1u4p0o,0,2013-12-31,This year I kept a list of the new (at least to me) movies I watched. I'd love to see your list if you did this as well. Here's mine!,blameitonthewookie,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1u4p0o/this_year_i_kept_a_list_of_the_new_at_least_to_me/,"Not sure why I did it, but I've had fun looking at the list.  I'll add IMDb links to the ones I don't think are recognizable/are hard to find but don't hesitate to ask if you don't know what one is. I only listed movies that I watched for the first time ever.  Re-watches weren't counted.  I'll bold my favorites but that by no means indicates it was great cinema. Just entertaining!

I counted a couple documentaries and you'll see where I go on some series binges.

1u4t0b,6,2013-12-31,Would you consider John F. Kennedy a misogynist?,[deleted],AskFeminists,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/1u4t0b/would_you_consider_john_f_kennedy_a_misogynist/,"First, I can understand your suspicion.  It's very common for a right-winger to try and bait feminists into condemning liberal ideas by superficially and inconsistently injecting gender into it.  For example, asking why feminists don't oppose misogyny in the middle east as a way to promote islamophobia.  This is not what I'm here to do.  I'm not here to bring politics into this, even though I do admire Kennedy from a political standpoint.

There's a lot of good to say about him, but Kennedy did have some serious issues with women.  There was almost no place for women in his life or in his administration outside of the ones he had sexual relationships with.  And he had many sexual affairs.

I'm usually skeptical about making charges like this, but it's beyond conspiracy as even mainstream news stations and many historians at some point embraced it.  I usually take claims with a grain of salt, but there's just an air of consistency amongst all the people who claimed him to be a womanizer.  Mimi Alford (an intern during his administration) wrote at length on how he pressured her to do sexually degrading things to not only him but the men in his cabinet.

It was also characteristic of a wealthy powerful family of men to be able to cheat while their wives were to not object to it, which I do think is a sexist double standard: one he did nothing to abolish and all to keep pursuing.

From all I've understood of this, it's seems way more than just your garden-variety womanizer, but a sleazy lifestyle of a person who viewed women as disposable and not of any value outside what they had to exclusively offer as women.  

I'm not here to mount a political agenda against him or snub him.  In the end, I think the good does outweigh the bad, but I just feel it's important to look at things objectively.  And criticize misogyny everywhere it exists.  Even if it exists within admirable people, especially ones who champion views we agree with.

So what are your thoughts on Kennedy's attitude toward women?  Do you think he was innocent of these charges historians had recently placed against him?  Was he just a typical womanizer or was he much more harmful than that?  Did you find him to be positive or empowering for women at all?  Was he mildly sexist or deeply misogynistic?

1u4wap,14,2013-12-31,"I (m:24) am love with my former fuck buddy (f:23), but there's some issues that makes me worried...",long_advice,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1u4wap/i_m24_am_love_with_my_former_fuck_buddy_f23_but/,"Almost exactly one year ago I met a girl at a club while I was a exchange student in Tokyo, we spent about 3 hours at that club just talking and we got some breakfast after the club closed. We exchange contact info during the breakfast.

I was really curious about her so I looked her up on facebook and saw that she was engaged to a guy that guy that lived in my home country (in Europe). I didn't want to say anything to her about what I had seen (thought it would sound a bit creepy).

The next weekend after we met we decided to go out to a club together, I didn't really know what her intentions where (I thought she might just want to be friends). But things got heated and we ended up making out and left the club to go to a ""love hotel"", however while we  where walking there I realized that what I was doing... So I said that I wasn't feeling that well (I said that I had a few to many drinks to be able to perform or something). After promising that I would make it up to her, she was ok with just making out and then going home...

The day after I texted her that I had seen that she was engaged and that it was the reason that I wasn't that eager to sleep with her (I tried to do the right thing)... She told me that her and her guy hadn't talked for a few weeks and that things wasn't really working out. She didn't mean to kiss me or do anything, but that she really liked me. I said that I liked being with her too and that maybe we could have dinner or something and talk about the situation (I thought I could give her a chance to explain the situation).

She had been together with her guy for 15 months, but he had some really big trust issues. He thought she would sleep with every guy she talked to, she had never kissed another guy during their relationship until she did it with me. But the last few weeks he had apparently hacked her facebook and twitter accounts, which made her really angry and questioned what he thought about her and if she really wanted to be with a guy like that... I sort of understood what she meant, he sounded really controlling (she showed me some facebook messages he had sent).

She said that we didn't need to do anything serious, but she really liked talking with me and found me attractive. I thought the same thing and I thought that would maybe be the safest way for me to go about it (I didn't want to get to emotionally attached to her).

But started to go out to clubs together and having sex, but soon we also started to go to dinner and things like that... And a couple of weeks after we had first met she told me she had broken things off with her guy, and that she was single now... This made me think that there might be a chance for me, and we started to see each other a few times every week. But after a couple of months she got a internship in another country and she would need to leave for 6 months, and I would need to move back to my home country during that time. I was really sad about this, and I didn't think a long distance thing would work (we weren't even bf and gf at that time).
We texted a bit during the first few weeks, but soon lost contact...

But about two weeks ago I drunk texted her, and asked how she was doing... This lead to that we have started to talk again, we text even more than we did while we was seeing each other. And it just got more intense when I told her that I was planing on moving back to Japan again this summer...

I asked her if she was seeing anyone, but she said no and that she wasn't really looking for a relationship right now. This however make me confuse, because the things she texts suggests otherwise... I haven't had a serious relationship for a while and I haven't really ever been in ""love"" before, but I'm pretty sure that the feelings I have for her is that (she's prefect in every way to imo).
I don't think I want to pursuit a real relationship with her while I live in my home country, just hint that that's my intentions when I move back there...

But the only problem is the cheating she did when I met her, is this something I should be worried about if I want to try and develop a serious relationship with her? I heard people say ""once a cheater, always a cheater"", but I have no idea if there's any truth to that...
Is there any good way to find out what a girl thinks of about a guy without just asking her straight up?"

1u59lp,4,2014-01-01,Just sharing some personal reflections on the year behind us,abrb_water,LGBTeens,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTeens/comments/1u59lp/just_sharing_some_personal_reflections_on_the/,"Welcome to 2014 y’all! We made it. Been spending these past couple of hours reflecting on the past year, and I guess the best word to describe my 2013 would be “Closer”.

Since the end of 2012, I’ve become closer to a lot of things, closer towards becoming who I want myself to be. I went from being fully closeted in Jan, to coming out to friends in April, and finally coming out to family in September. It’s been a rough journey in accepting myself as gay and getting my family to accept it; they still don’t, and some days I think there is progress, other days I don’t. I’m thankful that I’ve been able to keep strong, and have found allies to fall back on.

I’m now closer than ever to being a grown adult. Last summer was the first time I had to live alone, which I did for a month. The experience taught me a lot about caring for myself (in terms of cooking, cleaning, shopping, planning, transportation, etc. ), and made me more mature and self sufficient. I am more confident in my abilities, and am a stronger individual. I can only expect to grow more and more as I graduate and head to college.

In my search for and application to colleges, I’ve gone through career path changes within the past year. I started January wanting to be a programmer, engineer, physicist. Anything with computers and science. As the year went on, I went through experiences and internships and I slowly began to realize that I wanted to be something else, because I didn’t want to be a cog in the machine, and I wanted to leave a significantly positive impact on this world. As a result, “want I want to be when I grow up” is still in development.

Overall, I’m coming at 2014 with a positive, take-life-by-the-horns attitude. This year will be a year of a lot of firsts, and hopefully even more development.

What do you think? Do you have any reflections on the past year?"

I went to a college full of people who were bright on paper. I was friends with people who were at the top of their classes, in classes chock full of smart people. Yet if you talked to these people about anything beyond their narrow field of expertise, they knew nothing. And not only did they know nothing, they had no desire to know more than nothing; even a subject of wide appeal like human nature wouldn’t get their interest. They were philistines in every area of human thought, except their own – and that too bored them. Political science majors would squint in confusion when you asked them about political philosophy, as if you had asked them how to refine uranium into fissile plutonium.

I came to college hoping to be engaged intellectually, among fellow students. I didn’t find that. People who did fancy themselves as intellectuals were awkward, weird, boring – and their conversations were about the nerdy trivia of Star Wars and video games. Screwing around with girls was far more mentally engaging – at least that drew laughs and satisfied my penis. Being curious didn’t get you any closer to an internship with Goldman Sachs or a spot at Johns Hopkins’ medical school, so it went ignored among the students.

In an intellectual sense, they were effeminate – they would only want to know something when society would reward them for it – which is the same reason why so few women opt for the thankless job of editing Wikipedia. There was no intellectual interest independent of professional gain. There was none of that masculine desire to know for knowing’s sake, like a medieval monk might have. At most, people would spout their personal feelings about something, ignore what everyone else said, and pat themselves on the back for ‘being so expressive.’

Among the intelligent in America, the chief object of study is learning to conform

You would try to figure out what other people were thinking, and parrot it accordingly. Thankfully, Orwellian campus newspapers made it easy to conform. It was hard to even find the words to dissent. When someone did dissent, you were sure to hear about it, in harsh scolding tones, with shock and anger. Personally, I had a teacher ‘correct’ me when I failed to include an ‘or she’ when I correctly used ‘he’ to refer to both sexes.

When you’d say something controversial, and it was logically convincing, they would fall silent. They knew what you were saying was taboo – but they couldn’t prove you wrong. Or they may have even sensed that you were right – but your position was so taboo they had to stay silent. They wouldn’t give your argument an honest look, lest they become convinced and believe something different from everyone else. Controversial beliefs were just a liability to a bright ambitious future as an up-and-coming mandarin. So it was imperative to walk around with a protective cage around the mind – thinking impure thoughts would only keep them from fitting in and having a successful career.

Maybe they were so unused to a clear framing of debate that everything you said confused them. And there were the philistines – principally girls – who’d say “how do you even know this?!” – to shame you for knowing something that they didn’t.

At best, people would come and tell you they agree with you in private – and then go right back to parroting the herd’s message. They could not even manage to stay silent, lest they raise doubt by withholding their agreement. It was like a communist party meeting where every vote ran 100% in favor of the party position, yet there was no Stalin or Mao there to send them off to a death camp if they abstained.

A few men retain their curiousity, but they go to comical lengths to cloak their dissent behind a studied pose of ignorance. Paul Graham, a celebrated Silicon Valley capitalist, wrote an essay about the taboos of our time, and how they make certain truths unutterable. Yet he could not bring himself to mention any of those very taboos. That which goes unsaid goes unquestioned. Men of power have refused their duty to live not by lies, as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote:

And the simplest and most accessible key to our self-neglected liberation lies right here: Personal non-participation in lies. Though lies conceal everything, though lies embrace everything, but not with any help from me.

This opens a breach in the imaginary encirclement caused by our inaction. It is the easiest thing to do for us, but the most devastating for the lies. Because when people renounce lies it simply cuts short their existence. Like an infection, they can exist only in a living organism…

So in our timidity, let each of us make a choice: Whether consciously, to remain a servant of falsehood-of course, it is not out of inclination, but to feed one’s family, that one raises his children in the spirit of lies-or to shrug off the lies and become an honest man worthy of respect both by one’s children and contemporaries.

Occasionally I go to political events and see a similar pattern. On the right, among Republicans and conservatives, the only people making bold claims are crackpot audience members. The crackpots may have poor powers of reasoning – but at least they’re using them. Then there are the rich backers who bring in the speaker – they are too polite by half to discuss his ideas in earnest. They are all desperately waiting for a man to step up, and say what they are too cowardly to say themselves. Deep down, they know what must be said, but to a man, no one has the balls to say it.

You can see this dynamic on display in this clip, in which Allen West discusses the nature of Islam. Regardless of your position on Islam or Allen West, what’s happening is obvious – the crowd is waiting for a man to say what everyone in the room believes about Islam. The greying panelists hem and haw empty platitudes until Allen West takes the microphone, and speaks forcefully (skip to ~0:48):

[(This is the video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkGQmCZjJ0k#t=0)

The West is stuck in that very moment, in wait, for a man possessed of conviction to stride to the podium and defiantly state the unutterable truths of our day."
1u7304,0,2014-01-01,I [21/m] broke up with my girlfriend [20/f] because I can't live with myself or hurt her,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1u7304/i_21m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_20f_because_i/,"Okay, I never thought I would post, but I just keep reading and reading in hopes of stumbling upon a similar situation for guidance and I can't find any so here I am. Where do I start?

So I will take you back to how it started: before the end of last semester my group of friends and mutual friends all went to the beach for the weekend. During this trip there was this absolutely cute girl that caught my eye and I just needed to have her. I finally get my chance when we are all drinking in one of the rooms and I get the girls number. Nothing else happens that weekend, but all is well because I want to take this one slow and actually maybe take this things a little further. We get back to school for the week of classes before exams and I text her to get dinner and so the date is set. She is so cute and funny and I am just a nervous wreck when it comes to making a move for a kiss. We go on one more date before the semester end, but I am doing an internship 10 hours away and our relationship is reduced to nothing more than texting and phone calls. I am super nervous, I really like the girl and I want nothing more than to have her, but we didn't even kiss and she is going into the summer where anything can happen. Sometime over the summer I find out she is interested and it's the best news in the world. In the week between when my internship ends and school begins we go to a baseball game together where afterwards we have our first kiss and it's the best thing to happen to either one of us in a long time. I have always been in really screwed up relationships and never had any one serious in my life ever (dating always lasts less than a month or two). She hasn't liked anyone in a long time and we just are really getting along well going into the school year. We are both really busy people so we spend a couple days a week together and it seems to be the right balance. We become exclusive. Eventually we start to have conversations about how we want to eventually date, but we just don't see each other very much and we are worried with how it will work out. I am also very scared to let people in and I struggle with relationships just do to the terrible experiences I have had in the past. I have always just moved past things by internalizing them and struggle with periods of time where I need separation which can only be labeled as unmedicated depression (depression runs in the family and is a big issue). I eventually decide to date her and I couldn't be happier. She is a super outgoing and amazing girl.

Fast forward until around Thanksgiving time and I start to feel my emotions traveling towards a period of some kind of depression (probably seasonal) and I am getting a little detached. She just wants me to let her in and develop trusting each other. We work on our issues and move forward. Less than two weeks later we get in a fight because I find out she lied to me about smoking pot with friends over break and it's a big issue with me. The catch is she doesn't realize how big or the legal and personal trouble my family has had with drugs and why it truly bothers me. A week later we talk again that she isn't as happy as she was in the beginning of the relationship and isn't sure about things. Keeps insisting she isn't breaking up, but the word break is thrown around and it really bothers me. It is so early, and there's absolutely wrong, I just don't know why it isn't working. We work past it, but things feel like they are declining and my mood is dreary and only exacerbated by this lull from depression. I am not happy and feel like now I have something to prove and our first few interactions are kind of forced and awkward. There were things in the relationship I guess she felt I wasn't addressing, likely due to my inexperience or inward thought and emotion. I drag my feet through exams feeling weird and unsure. I finally finish exams and want to go to the bars with friends, she still has two exams left and is underage. My group of friends all go out to celebrate and get absolutely destroyed. I apparently break down and tell them how things aren't working and I am not happy and I don't know why (likely my mood and internalizing everything, not the relationship). I see a girl downtown I used to have a fling with, but we have remained friendly and she is very cerebral and usually can give some good advice. I tell her, says we should talk about it later. Interaction over. 

Side story about this girl. This girl has been around since my sophomore year and we have always had a really weird relationship, once again going with the theme of terrible relationships I have had. We make out a few times, but never more. Then one time she goes to a weekend trip and gets way too drunk and sleeps with a friend of mine. She is torn when she gets back to school, but then goes on and hooks up with tons of people. I get really drunk junior year and we have sex, then a couple more times. One day I find out from my friend she is also sleeping with him and was untruthful to both of us and I get extremely mad at her and don't talk to her for a while. I get too drunk and hook up with her one last time before the year ends and end all communication before senior year. We only have a few friendly texts here and there. She tries to hook up with me when I have already met my future GF and I turn her down and realize what I truly want is a relationship with future GF, not this weird and untrusting hookup.

Back to the night celebrating the end of exams. All of my friends continue to drink and have a good time. I blackout. Wake up the next morning trying to piece together the night. Something feels off. I remember going to a late night breakfast restaurant with friends then flashes of hooking up with someone. I have texts from said old hookup that it was good to see me at the bar, then she was going to come over to talk. I call her to figure out what happened. Her account: she drove to my apartment (which she had never been to before, so she must be sober and know where I live) said she planned on talking outside, but we walked up to my apartment (it was cold). Same story as before, I was upset and talking about how I wasn't happy. Says she doesn't like to see any friends upset and somehow start kissing. We have sex. I remember flashes of it (but I didn't really know what was going on and nobody was in my bed the next morning so it was fishy). The last flash I have is she asks me if I have ever cheated before and then walks out and drives home. 

I was absolutely mortified. I have never done anything like this before. I am DISGUSTED at myself. I always had disdain for cheaters and I couldn't believe people did it. I had no idea what had happened either. I wouldn't even dance with other girls at parties when my girlfriend wasn't there because I thought it was weird and looked unfaithful. I liked her and would never even imagine doing something like that. I can't even look at myself in the mirror. I cry to myself for hours, but I have to get on the road to be home for something. My girlfriend wants to get lunch before I leave (she has to stay for more exams). I tell her I can't, but that we should talk after her evening exam. I didn't want to distract her from her exams or tell her over the phone, but I know I need to do something. On the car ride home I just cry and curse at myself. We talk that evening and I break up with her bringing up the problems we had before. I just want put her through anything else with exams coming up. I tell the hookup that I don't think we should communicate. I feel terribly for days. I text my ex a few days later that I really want to talk to clear things up about the break (this is the chance I see to come clean). She texts me and says we can talk when we get back to school, but she doesn't know she feels about trying to work things out and date again if that's what I wanted. I see this as it being done for good so I make a decision: I just will bury this inside and not tell her. Only me and the hookup know, and I don't even really know. I don't want to put her through pain just to make myself feel better about coming clean because it is my selfishness that got me into this situation so I need to think of somebody else and let her go. I have the worst feeling in my stomach and it won't go away. I have two nights of heavy drinking separated by a few days and I contact my ex both times about how sorry I am things ended that way and I really want to figure things out. I am an absolute emotional wreck as a blackout drunk and just cry and mourn. I just know that I really liked this girl and wished everything could have worked out, but somehow I just managed to make the worst mistake of my life. 

Now she says that she still wants to be friends at the very least and knows I am holding a lot inside. There might be the possibility of getting back in to the relationship, but she says right now she doesn't think that is an option and wants to know what's going on. I have no idea what to do and I feel like the scum of the Earth. What do I do? Do I tell her and forever live knowing I am a terrible person and have everyone know too? Bury it? I just really wish I could have her back because all I can think about it is how things were actually really good. I know the deficiencies of the relationship were not letting her in and I would be ready to do that now that I have had time to reflect. I know that as soon as I tell her all trust is gone and there's no hope. I can't help but feel like the situation, even though I have responsibility, feels almost like I was in a vulnerable state and got take advantage of by a sober old hookup. I know it was a mutual act, but it is nothing that I felt like I would ever be capable of.

TL;DR: Hooked up with a sober old flame during my blackout state despite not showing signs of being flirty throughout the night or making moves (everything took place completely blackout). Couldn't live with myself and broke up with my girlfriend. Can't live my myself in regret and disgust and really want her back."
1u7dqz,1,2014-01-01,[28/m] having trouble getting over ex [26/f]. We broke up under duress / for pragmatic reasons,Test_Tossed_Eronious,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1u7dqz/28m_having_trouble_getting_over_ex_26f_we_broke/,"My apologies if this is the wrong place to post this.  I read the sidebar and I still think I'm ok, so here goes.

Here's the story:  We had been together for about 1.5 years before we broke up and it was great the whole time.  We were long distance for a portion of that time, but we made it work very well, taking full advantage of our time together.  When she finished grad school, she got a job in another state.  By this time, I was sold on the relationship and I began looking for a job in the city she was moving to.  Before I was able to land a job, she came to the realization that she hated her job and that she was going to leave after staying for a few months more in an attempt to be professional about it.  This is why we broke up:  it would be pointless for me to follow her if I was going to have to quit whatever job I landed shortly after moving, then having to start all over again.  We had a last hurrah in Colorado, and it was the best vacation I have ever been on.  We had to split up in the airport, and we were both inconsolable and sleep-deprived by the time we said our goodbyes.

We have kept in touch since then and she regularly tells me that she misses me and that she's happy/thankful for the time we shared.  She has since landed a temporary gig, after which she got her dream internship at a certain animal hospital (she's a vet).

So I hate my job and generally dislike the city I live in, which is also where I grew up.  So I put 2 and 2 together and came up with the naive notion to start looking for job leads in the city where the animal hospital is.  Today being new year's, I got right on it and started revamping some of my web presence.  One of the sites that I use needed a much more current picture of me than what I had, some pictures of me are untagged on FB, and I stumble into seeing some romantic pictures of her and a new boyfriend.  I don't think it's unfair and I totally get it, but I still want to throw up.  I texted her about it and she still wants to keep in touch, still tells me that she misses me.

So my thoughts now are that maybe I go through with the plan to move to this city where she'll be.  I have less to lose since I don't enjoy my life where I am.  I understand that it isn't necessarily wise to move to a new city on the off chance that I'll get back with my ex, but as far as I'm concerned, she's worth that risk.  I also know it's a long shot and I can't really get my hopes up, but god, I want to at least try.  I'm already looking at my calendar to plan a potential recon / vacation there to see if I like it...

**TL;DR: My ex and I broke up because she was in an unstable job situation that had her jumping from state to state.  Her situation has stabilized somewhat, she has a boyfriend, and she regularly tells me that she misses me.  I am contemplating moving to the city where she will be anyway since I hate my current job/life situation.**

NINJA EDIT:  New boyfriend lives in the city that she just moved away from.  I have no idea how permanent/impermanent their relationship is.

NINJA EDIT #2:  **My actual question is whether or not my plan is total lunacy.  I justify it by wanting to move anyway, due to reasons unrelated to our relationship.**

I used to mainly to do game development and graphics programming two years ago.  In the past two and a half, I've had to focus on my university studies.  Anyways, I've finally have been able to have some windows of free time open and I'm looking to get back into game development.


I mainly tend to focus on graphics, engine development, mechanics, but would like to extend out more into design.  Quite proficient in C++, Python, and Java.  Knowledge of SDL, OpenGL, and other various libraries; willing to learn others.  Work primary on UNIX based systems (i.e. Linux).  Experience also with lower level systems.


I've also been on an internship before, so I am able to work in a group.  I am looking for another one in the near future, preferably a game development related one.  Though for now would like to work on small hobbyist projects.


Please PM me if interested,


thanks."
1u7vwl,1,2014-01-02,Is a full year of bio needed or just 12 units + GPA question + SMP,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1u7vwl/is_a_full_year_of_bio_needed_or_just_12_units_gpa/,"So I posted this on SDN but I got discouraged from the response and I was wondering if the people of reddit can give me better advice. 

Before anyone states the obvious, I do plan on going to an out of state medical school. I've done my research and I realize that I can't get into a California medical school.

First of all, I am on the quarter system and as a Human Biology major I am only required to take 2 quarters of Intro Biology (5 units each=10 units total) and 1 quarter of lab (2 units) for a total of 12 units. For many, many medical schools (Both MD+DO) and many SMP's the language regarding prereq classes is either 12 units of General Biology or 1 year of General Biology and a lot show both. So should I take the 3rd quarter of Biology (Ecology and Evolution) or not? I do not want to be rejected by SMP or medical school or be told to take the 3rd quarter after graduating. I'm specifically worried about RFU since they require to fill out a form for your science coursework.

Second of all, I failed 3 science my sophomore year due to a lot of immaturity. No excuse at all, I socialized way too much and in my first 2 years of college I got by with a 3.1 GPA studying maybe 3-5 hours a week. Obviously now I've realize that is practically nothing. I know MD schools do not have grade forgiveness and DO schools do but what about SMP programs? How do they look at 3 failed class 1 year ago if they are followed by 3 quarters of great performance? I have had a good upward trend the past 2 quarters and I have 1-2 more quarters of hopefully upward trend so my GPA could be around 3.3 by next Fall when I apply for SMP (G-town, Tufts, RFU, Toledo, Cincinnati, Tufts, USF, BU, EVMS, Tulane) My goal is to get into Cincinnati, Toledo, or RFU since they have high linkages (Did not include EVMS because of their recent increased enrollment which could lower their linkage) but realistically RFU is my best bet since Toledo and Cincinnati are much harder to get into. Due to my subpar undergrad GPA and 3 failed classes RFU's ""all in"" method of deciding primarily based on performance in the SMP seems like my best chance for a MD. (Am I wrong?)

My backup is DO schools since I want to go into a surgical specialty, then St. George in the Caribbean. While it would be great to have MD after my name I realize that DO schools offer me a much better chance at surgery then St. Georges will should I not get into US MD.

In summary by next Fall:
Without grade forgiveness: 3.0-3.1 overall, 2.7-2.8 science
With grade forgiveness: 3.2-3.3 overall, 3.0-3.1 science
I will also have completed 5 quarters of Spanish including one quarter of Medical Spanish. Does this help me stand out for SMP or Medical School?

Personal Statement + LOR are obviously subjective so I'm not gonna say they are great but hopefully they are good enough.

EC's (Duration at the time of SMP Application/at the time of Medical School Application)
- 3 years/4 years in a Greek Organization (VP + Secretary)
- 1/2 years in Inter Fraternity Council (Representative + VP)
- 100 hours/150 hours hours shadowing an Orthopedic Surgeon, Neurologist, and Pediatrician
- 100 hours/200 hours volunteering in PACU
***10 week health science internship that will not be started or completed until after I submit my SMP applications next Fall. I am placed into this internship because it is required by my major.

As for the MCAT, I am taking a summer course with Berkeley Review from Mid June-Mid August and taking the MCAT on September 18th, 2014. I know I need at least a 32 (or do I need higher?) to get into a SMP and to offset my GPA .

Lastly, I have done 5 mock interviews (Both Traditional and MMI) through my school's career center and have been told that I am a great interviewer so hopefully that will help me as well. I am most afraid being screened out due to my GPA and not even given a chance at an interview.

Any help or advise to strengthen my application is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."
1u86rh,6,2014-01-02,Me [22F] with my boyfriend [24F] were dating for 8 months and ended up with broken heart.,HonnyBunny,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1u86rh/me_22f_with_my_boyfriend_24f_were_dating_for_8/,"I had a long distance relationship with my boyfriend. He lives in America and I live in Thailand (Originally Korea). I met him when I had an internship in America and we knew we were going to have LDR until I go back to America for rest of my life. 

We had arguments and too much of jealousy that made us break up. well, actually it was because of me, my jealousy made him walked away from me. It happened before he came to see me in Thailand but then we worked out and it was perfect when he was with me together but then after he left, everything changed. 

I like to talk with my boyfriend but then he likes to hang out with his friends and sleepover. I understood what he likes to do and what he wants to do but then it became too much for me. I know I was being selfish to keep him near me. This morning he called me to talk with me and he told me that he doesn't want to be in this relationship anymore, he doesn't want me to text him or call him for awhile and wants to stay away from me. Few hours later, he posted on facebook that he still loves me and he will miss me but I'm not ready for him and a relationship. 

I'm planning to go to America to see him 5-6 months later and he knows 7 months ago. I asked him to wait for me, even we're broke up for now, I will grow up and be a woman who he wants to be with. 
He hates LDR and he thinks it will be much better when I go to America and be with him. but it ended up with broken heart for both of us. 
  

**TL;DR;**  Is he going to feel better and be with me when I go see him in America? Is he going to wait for me? I can't handle the sadness, it hurts so much.. and when I'm there, there will be no LDR at all. "
1u8k1q,2,2014-01-02,"My [20/F] relationship with my SO [21/M] and two roommates [21/M], [20/M] is on the line.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1u8k1q/my_20f_relationship_with_my_so_21m_and_two/,"Hey reddit,


I just want to preface this post with saying that I love my boyfriend. He's provided me wih love, happiness, and a roof over my head for the next year. Despite his obliviousness when it comes to my being upset at him during fights, he's a great partner. 

Backstory: My boyfriend, roommate #1, roommate #2, and myself all were pretty good friends that lived in Florida before moving in together in NYC. My boyfriend and both roommates have been friends for years, and I've just developed friendships with them over the past year (which is how long my bf and I have been dating). We decided to move over the summer after a long period of debating whether or not we should. We decided since we're young and ill-experienced college kids with no credit, my SO paid for the apartment for a year in FULL, with the expectation that both roommates would pay their share of the rent each month to my SO. 

That isn't happening.

My SO is an aspiring audio engineer, so he took the opportunity to move here so he can seek out internships. I moved for the experience. Roommate #1 was in school up here, but dropped out. Roommate #2 came along for the ride. Since we moved in the beginning of September, I got a job right off the bat. I hated it, quit, and then immediately got a new job that I'm in love with, and I'm putting myself through school. Roommate #1 had a job for 2 days,quit, and hasn't looked since. I tried to help him by giving him an application to my work (there was a spot available in the cafe). He filled it out and left it somewhere. I texted him AGAIN and asked where he put it so that I could turn it in with no response. I've been paying the electricity bill, which was mysteriously put under my name. He hasn't paid me a dime and ignores my requests for his payment. Roommate #2 has a job, is somewhat responsive to my payment notifications, and I'm less worried about him. 

Roommate #1 also has not paid my SO rent since we've been here. It's a complicated situation because my SO is a very friendly, big-hearted, push over son of a bitch. EVERY time I tell him he needs to get his goddamn friend to pay, he replies, ""I know he will pay me. He's going through rough times."" Bullshit. He's spending money on weed and shows and is too lazy to find a job.

I continue to show how distraught I am about this situation, and my SO choses to ignore it. He gets anxiety about confronting his friends for the fear of losing them. He doesn't listen to me when I try and give him advice about the situation, and the anxiety is rubbing off on me ten fold. My credit and well being is on the line, and I'm starting to get fairly annoyed with both roommates. ALSO, to add to the madness, both boys clean the apartment/after themselves VERY seldom.

I'm afraid if I give the roommates an ultimatum the friendship between us will end, and so will my relationship with my boyfriend. I consider myself to be a rational person, and I don't think that if roommate #1 hasn't paid rent for the first 5 months, he won't pay the accumulated amount.

Reddit, please help me. Do I put my foot down with my roommates who are lazy and stingy and threaten to kick them out/turn off the power at the cost of my relationship with my SO? Or wait until it blows over?"
1u8srm,3,2014-01-02,Hey /r/lol! I recently created a site to help improve knowledge of champions and matchups and would love feedback!,eganwall,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1u8srm/hey_rlol_i_recently_created_a_site_to_help/,"http://champ-match.com

A couple months ago I found that using sites like LoLCounter and ChampionSelect weren't actually helping me improve my knowledge of matchups as much as I would like to, and as a computer science major I am always looking for side projects to help expand my horizons. This started mainly as an exercise to learn a bit of web development, but my League friends all told me that it sounded like a useful idea so I wanted to share with Reddit!

Basically the idea is this: after selecting your own champion and your opponent's champion, a page is displayed with two tables. The first table shows a comparison of base champion stats (base health, mana, hp5, armor, mr, AA range, move speed, etc) with their scaling counterparts. This table also highlights differences between the stats so you can clearly see where your champion has advantages over the other champion. The second table shows information on your opponent's abilities (description, range, resource cost, and cooldown), which will allow you to more effectively time important cooldowns (i.e. Corki's rank 1 Valkyrie has a 26 second cooldown so gank the shit out of him while it's down) and gauge your champion's spacing to stay out of range of dangerous abilities. 

The end result is that rather than showing whether or not a champion is a ""counter-pick,"" the information provided will allow an intermediate player to see where their champion has clear advantages and figure out a way to press those advantages, while assisting players in learning about champions that they have never played as/against.

The site is somewhat bare-bones right now mainly because I am not a very skilled web dev, and I also just wanted to get base functionality released in time to add it to my Riot internship application due in a couple weeks. PLEASE let me know what you think of the site, good or bad, and I am ALWAYS open to any kind of suggestions that would make it more useful to fellow League players!

Sorry for wall of text, thank you so much for reading!

TL;DR: I made a site that shows comparative information on two champions in a lane matchup to help players improve champion knowledge. Feedback much appreciated!"

______
Last years: 

• Expand my client base (Done! I got a lot more clients and even more returning ones) 

• Start an internship (Done! I'm currently interning under celebrity and fashion photographer Kristopher Armstead: www.kristopherarmstead.com)

• Fix my website and start a blog (Done! www.danielabphotography.com is looking better than ever!) 

• Photograph out of the country (Only one I didn't do :( I'll be traveling a lot this year for college and I'm so excited for all of the opportunities!) 

____

This years:


• Finish a 100 days project (I could never finish 365, so I gave myself something smaller)

• Photograph out of the country (Keeping this one, I'll be in a lot of different places this year!)

• Get a shoot published in a magazine (I've had single photos featured, but I'd really just love an editiorial) 

• Shoot more of what I love. (I love shooting for clients, but I haven't shot anything conceptual in ages.)

1u96ed,2,2014-01-02,I've had enough! DAY 1,FilmsByDan,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1u96ed/ive_had_enough_day_1/,"Hello Fapstronauts,
This is my first post on my new journey as a fellow Fapstronaut.  Pornography has been a major problem in my life for several years.  I live at home with my parents so I've had to wait to masturbate when no one else is around or late at night when everyone else is sleeping.  Often I'm up until 2 or 3 in the morning.  I'm usually tired at 11pm but I force myself to stay awake.  I do this to  myself even when I don't have the urge or need to masturbate.  It's become such a routine that whether or not I feel like masturbating, I masturbate.  This is how I know I'm addicted.  
Masturbating everyday and staying up so late has had a major negative impact on my life.  I'm a very cranky person with a very short temper.  Often I feel depressed, sad and hopeless.  Staying up late results in me waking up later the next day, and this upsets me because I feel some of my most productive hours are in the morning.  Now that I'm on break from school, I usually get up around 9 or 10 and then spend half the day feeling sad and watching TV shows or wasting time on the internet.  Prior to Winter break, I set goals for myself, like creating more animations for my YouTube channel, preparing a resume and securing an internship for next summer, but so far I haven't accomplished much and I blame this primarily on my addiction.  I've tried several times to abstain from masturbating, one time restraining myself for an entire week, but then I relapse.  When I relapse I become disappointed with myself and basically give up, going back to my daily routine.  I'm sick of failing, and in spite of the fact that I did the unspeakable last night, I've decided to start 2014 right by abstaining from porn and masturbation.  My addiction has hurt me physically and emotionally, and I believe has hindered me from seeking and building real world friendships.  I'm ready to quit and I'm glad I'm not alone.  I will admit, I am nervous because I know this won't be easy, but at the same time I can't wait to get my life back on track and become a more happy, caring, and productive person."
1u9a77,5,2014-01-02,"Inspired by a comment, I send an email to the HumbleBundle team, pleading for adoption of the Doge. Let's find these kind of companies and write them!",wouldacouldashoulda,dogecoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1u9a77/inspired_by_a_comment_i_send_an_email_to_the/,"I wrote the following, probably not perfect (and kind of too long) but it's not about writing the perfect letter, it's about writing! If you have any more suggestions for some good candidates, I would be more than happy to write them as well! Think consumer-friendly, cool companies that deal with relatively small payments.

---

Dear people of the awesome Humble Bundle,

Let me start of with saying how much I appreciate your bundles! The games in there are often more fun than most AAA titles, and the value for money is simply amazing. So, kudo's!

Anyway, that's not why I'm writing today. Today, I'm writing about Dogecoin. You might already have heard about Dogecoin, but in case you haven't: Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) that's kind of hot recently, and has been the most traded cryptocurrency (after Bitcoin) for nearly a month. It is a bit different than Bitcoins, most notably in that there are much more of them, which in my opinion is also one of its strengths; it's not a lot of fun (and not so easy) to pay with 0.00573 Bitcoin for something like the humble bundle (which is the equivalent to the $4.45 average for the current bundle). That makes it much more suited for smaller payments. In that sense, Bitcoin can be compared more to a valuable material such as gold, with Dogecoin being more like a regular coin.

The strongest point of the currency however is its community. If you search for the Dogecoin, you will find it was based upon a meme. This might make you disqualify it, but honestly, the community behind it is the best behind any other cryptocoin, with people really believing in it instead of just being in it for a quick buck. Because it is such a familiar concept for something unfamiliar (a trick earlier performed by Apple, by putting a piece of fruit as logo for a hi-tech company) it attracts way more kinds of people to it than your regular, techie cryptocoin. This has caused the getting started guides to be the best of all coins, is evolving the tooling better than for any other coin (for example an Android app was released yesterday, unique for most cryptocoins but the very big ones), and has made marketing efforts sprout up here and there (such as Starcraft gamers playing against each other for Dogecoins). There's a momentum going on, and I think it's time for Dogecoin to take the next step.

So, to get to my point. It would be awesome if you guys could add Dogecoin as valid payment method to your website. There's a big userbase behind it so there would be no worries about not getting anyone to use it; I can guarantee you'll even see a large influx of new customers paying with the coin.

It does require some kind of faith however from your side, as the value of any cryptocoin isn't fully stable right now. However, a move like this would be unprecedented, and as such will for sure make the value of the Dogecoin rise quite a bit, at the very least for the short term. This should make it quite a safe investment for you as well. Obviously the value could still plummet, but with more support will come more trust, and with more trust comes more support. We just need someone to take a leap of faith. I am asking you to take that leap of faith.

About the implementation, I'm afraid there isn't yet a convenient PSP solution available, so some custom work would have to be done. The coin is based on the Bitcoin principle, so the howto's from there should be applicable to Dogecoin as well. Please have a look here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merchant_Howto, and here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_accept_Bitcoin,_for_small_businesses. Transferring coins is very convenient and easy for consumers, so I would imagine it is not too difficult to receive them for a business either.

Furthermore, for any questions or requests to the community, we are available here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogecoin. We are very happy to answer any questions, or to help you during implementation. I'm sure it could even be an option to recruit one of us as intern to build the implementation completely, if that would be an option for you.

This has been quite a long mail already. I hope you will consider taking up Dogecoin as real payment method on your website. It would give a great boost to the coin and to cryptocoins in general, and will help provide a real alternative for Bitcoins, which is currently really more for investors than for consumers.

Thank you so much for your time.

Best regards,"

Or is it considered a separate, required course in itself? I know it's better to ask my adviser about something like this but I figured maybe I could get an answer from here first and have an idea about things before I talk to my adviser."
1u9afc,2,2014-01-02,"Me [24F] with my boyfriend [25M] together for 2 years, I think he has poor priority setting skills and it makes me question our future",wrong_priorities,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1u9afc/me_24f_with_my_boyfriend_25m_together_for_2_years/,"Let's refer to my boyfriend as A. A had his first job since graduating trade school for a little over a year and a half. Before that, he had a job for only 6 months back in high school and one internship. He is very new to his field.

He and his ex-boss were the only people in his department and I admit, his ex-boss is a complete jackass. He's not that professional and took his anger out on A every once in a while. Still, I think many people can agree that it's hard to find the perfect job your first few years in the real world where you don't deal with anyone you bump heads with. When his boss started getting on his last nerve, he was convinced he needed to quit...which I agreed with.

I, his friends, and family all tried to give him advice in the right direction and told him to find a job before quitting and being as polite as possible so he could still get a reference. He did try looking for a job while still working there, but his emotions got the best of him. A tends to act pretty irrationally at times when he lets his emotions take control over common sense. He started answering back to his boss more often, raising his voice more to him, and was ready to send a nasty page long email to his boss and carbon copied to the rest of the company. Luckily, he was talked out of sending it, but clearly he was starting to become more emotionally heated. Even though he didn't send that particular email, he did send a couple response emails other employees were carbon copied to that were essentially talking back to his boss.

The last straw for him came a couple months ago where he had a petty argument with his boss, went to HR and put in his 2 weeks notice on the spot. No jobs lined up. No money saved up. And made it pretty obvious his boss was the reason for quitting.

He did get maybe 3 job interviews, but he couldn't use his boss as a reference for fear of it being negative. Needless to say, he didn't get those jobs. I don't expect him to have job interviews coming through consistently, but I can't help but feel that this wouldn't even be an issue if he just composed himself better at his old job and made sure he had a job lined up before quitting, it wouldn't be as much of an issue.

The thing that makes me worried is that not only does he not have a job now for a reason I don't agree with, but he only has 500 dollars to his name saved and he has bills to pay. I've always felt uneasy about the way he spends his money. He bought an expensive laptop knowing he was ready to quit his job, has a new car, and other expenses. He lives with a relative rent free but eats out often and goes to the bar with friends a lot. You would think he'd have more saved up in the bank if he doesn't pay rent.

Before this job, he lived off a check he'd get every once in a while for going to school. Every time he'd get this check, he'd blow it all on one big thing or on going out. One time, he bought an expensive computer [again], saw a pixel stuck, sent it back, got another, realized he wasn't an apple person, sent it back again, and rebuilt a computer he already had before. When he runs low on money, he acts like it's no big deal and sells something and thinks that'll hold him over. This is all before he had his job and he's getting back into this habit.

He has that new laptop now and thinks it's no big deal, he'll just sell it. If he can't pay car bills, no big deal, he'll just sell it. Meanwhile, he's trying to make money on websites to hold him over which is okay I guess, but he takes days off because it's the holidays and I'm not hearing much about the job hunts. He says he's doing them, but I haven't heard of any company names. I just hear about the quick money schemes he's doing.

He just bought me what he considers his most expensive gift yet. He got me a bracelet for my birthday two years ago which was over a hundred dollars, so what is he doing spending that kind of money when he only has 500 dollars left? It's sweet but it makes me so nervous!

He's also set on losing a few pounds, which is a nice goal, but says it's more important than the job search. He's been saying he'll lose weight for a long time and flakes out very fast...yet it's a higher priority than his job. I never thought I'd be more worried about his future than he is.

I don't want money to be the reason to end our relationship, but this has all been a huge turn off to me because of the way he's handling all of this. It could have all been prevented if he prioritized right and acted more professionally. We don't live together and his money right now isn't really my business, but he keeps talking about how he wants to marry me. I don't know how I'd deal with with him as my husband if he is this shitty with his money and acts out of emotion in a professional setting. God forbid something like this happened if we were married with kids and had bills to pay together. He wants to move in with me, but even when he had his job, he was unable to because he had barely anything saved. I'm afraid of making a bigger commitment with him now because of how I see he handles his own life. He's kind to me and cares about me a lot but I want to be realistic here. What is the next step??

TL;DR: Boyfriend quit his job emotionally with no job lined up, has no money saved despite living rent free, has shitty spending habits, and isn't as concerned as I thought he would be after quitting his job. It's a huge turn off for me and I think the way he's running his life shows some character flaws that I don't think I want in a possible husband. What do I do?

1u9fci,3,2014-01-02,Hey SummonerSchool! I recently made a website to help improve knowledge of champions and 1v1 matchups. Please let me know what you think!,eganwall,summonerschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1u9fci/hey_summonerschool_i_recently_made_a_website_to/,"http://champ-match.com

A couple months ago I found that using sites like LoLCounter and ChampionSelect weren't actually helping me improve my knowledge of matchups as much as I would like to, and as a computer science major I am always looking for side projects to help expand my horizons. This started mainly as an exercise to learn a bit of web development, but my League friends all told me that it sounded like a useful idea so I wanted to share with Reddit!

Basically the idea is this: after selecting your own champion and your opponent's champion, a page is displayed with two tables. The first table shows a comparison of base champion stats (base health, mana, hp5, armor, mr, AA range, move speed, etc) with their scaling counterparts. This table also highlights differences between the stats so you can clearly see where your champion has advantages over the other champion. The second table shows information on your opponent's abilities (description, range, resource cost, and cooldown), which will allow you to more effectively time important cooldowns (i.e. Corki's rank 1 Valkyrie has a 26 second cooldown so gank the shit out of him while it's down) and gauge your champion's spacing to stay out of range of dangerous abilities.

The end result is that rather than showing whether or not a champion is a ""counter-pick,"" the information provided will allow an intermediate player to see where their champion has clear advantages and figure out a way to press those advantages, while assisting players in learning about champions that they have never played as/against.

The site is somewhat bare-bones right now mainly because I am not a very skilled web dev, and I also just wanted to get base functionality released in time to add it to my Riot internship application due in a couple weeks.

1u9ng7,6,2014-01-02,"I have a BEng and want to work in the software field, is BCIT's CST program for me?",92817349,BCIT,https://www.reddit.com/r/BCIT/comments/1u9ng7/i_have_a_beng_and_want_to_work_in_the_software/,"I graduated a little while ago with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at McGill University. I made the mistake of assuming that my degree alone would be enough to land me a job in the software development field upon graduation. My resume is pretty much empty (no internships/co-ops, no personal projects), and so I haven't had much luck in searching for a job. Most positions I can't even apply for because I fall well under their requirements (they usually want multiple years of experience using certain languages/tools/platforms), and the ones I do apply for I don't hear back from.

Since my program was in the Engineering faculty and not the CS faculty, it feels like a lot of what I learned was too theoretical or just irrelevant to what I want to be doing. I know many people in my program that didn't have any trouble getting positions in the software development field after graduating, but they all have had prior experience through internships. I know a lot of what I should know can be self-learned, but I was wondering if maybe BCIT's CST program would be better for me since it would be organized and structured and I could just focus on learning what's presented to me. All I want is to be able to learn as much as I can to put me in the best position to be able to confidently apply for jobs in the field.

Is the CST program my best option? Or is there something else I should be considering?"
1ua3i8,0,2014-01-02,I'm going to ramble. A lot. And I've been drinking. Don't read this. I'll be talking to myself in the corner.,MotivationDeceased,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ua3i8/im_going_to_ramble_a_lot_and_ive_been_drinking/,"Well, me, got some shit to say to ya. May as well post it in a public forum so it can be mocked and/or praised.
So, fuck. I passed all my classes this semester, that should make me happy. It doesn't though. Probably because of the D's I received as final grades. Fuck do I dislike school, mechanical engineering should not have been my choice. I should have done something with drawing and no math. I am so bad at math, yet I keep taking harder, and harder math classes? Have you ever heard of Root Locus or Nyquist plots? I hope to God or spaghetti monster or whatever does or does not exist that you don't. Or you do, it really depends on your profession. It's pretty interesting shit if you can find a credible source.
Anyway, I don't flourish in school. Despite how easy high school was, college is a bitch. I feel like something has bothered me with every class I've taken. It could be the professor, the grading structure or guidelines, the subject matter itself or just the time class took place. I'm pretty great at manifesting excuses. I always regret how I handled it after, I could've done this or that.
Is could've a word?
I mean I'm still waiting on one grade, idk if I even made it through this semester. I have failed out once already, it was wayyyyy too stressful. I mean, I got back in, but i still didn't do well this semester so hopefully I don't get any emails saying I'm kicked out of school. A kick in the dick is something I need but, fuck. I don't wanna fail out. I'm a semester away from getting to stupid piece of paper that says I can engineer anything mechanical.
First mechanical engineering idea: bed that syncs with your phone's alarm via Bluetooth to initiates a pneumatic device that sways your bed around as if you were floating on a raft in a body of water. Genius, don't tell me otherwise, I can't be convinced.
Alright, school! Did anyone else essentially become crippled for the stress of being at a university? Don't answer that, this is a selfish post. I have never done well in a class unless it was a bullshit course. I define a bullshit course as the following: get stoned, skip class, never hand in assignments, B in the class. 
I got a B+ in my only writing class all of college. That is also the highest grade I've ever received. It's also one of the most failed classes at my school, I never understood that. I've gotten A's in lab before, but we all know labs are lobs for the most part. People bitch about bio lab so I assume that sucks several wangs.
I get stoned far too often. On New Year's Eve, I smoked an eight to myself while a house full of people partied on with me. That isn't okay, it's not cool. What the fuck am I doing where I need to smoke that much?
Smoking started out as the most amazing stress reliever in college and now it's some habitual release from the day. I love the weeds though. To not give a fuck within an instant of hitting a j-bird or whatever, it's just magical to me. Engineering does not tolerate this behavior. I was fired from my internship due to a random drug test. I spent like 20 days clearing out my system to pass the drug test just to get in, then a month later I'm pissing in the cup again. I know better. I should've spent the summer clean. Being able to not give a fuck on command is too powerful an idea for me. Especially since I usually handle liquor so poorly.
I'd say 50% of the time I drink, I get violent. Punching inanimate objects and threatening friends seems to be what I do. That's fucking miserable, my friends don't deserved that. They don't wanna see some depressed, self-loathing, drunk mother fucker. If I'm stoned, I'm controlled. I guess I need to give up both in the near future. Alcohol is super easy to give up. Weedz on the other hand...I don't wanna part with it! I'll learn though, I have to in order to function in this world. This fucked up ass backwards world.
I miss my ex too much. We dated for a few years through high school into my freshman year of college. When I went away, rumors started circulating that I cheated on her. Very possible. I have no memory of doing such a thing but being blackout drunk at a large school leads me to believe its possible. I'm not about that though, I enjoy monogamy. Fucking square, right?
Her reaction was to do the same to me because after we broke up, which at the time was amicable, I heard all these shitty rumors about her blowing a horse or something. Of course this is a lie, but I like getting the beastiality lovers rocks off. Cheater cheater pumpkin eater, sophomore year of college rolls around, I'm pretending I'm not a mess by lifting every day. 
Fuck. I forget where this was going. Well, I never smoked until my freshman year of college and I never drank til my senior year of high school. So freshman and sophomore year I was cockslapped with about a million sensations as I started dealing with a breakup while experimenting with life. This is when grades started dipping and I became a regular stoner. Fuck that phrase, stoners can be great, I obviously didn't know how, and still don't know how, to handle The Sword of Dank. So fast forward though about 3 years of getting stoned and not doing my work, here I am!
Fifth year engineering student who should be graduating in the spring but may not due to grades. A lot of my friendships have died off because real people jobs and the love life is dead because I'm an ass and don't want to talk to the women at my school. My family knows everything I do because I was desperate for an emotional outlet. They've been amazing about me being an overall scumbag but there are some things I need to address before I continue on in life. All the ""big questions"".
Fuck, do I love to ramble? This is all nonsensical.  

I just want my parents to not worry about me. I want to find a job that I don't see as an end justifying the means or whatever the fuck that absolute piece of bullshit means. I want to find a woman who understands I am a crazy person.
Fuck there is so much more to write, I didn't explain anything. Reading through this again is painful because it's awful and terribly written. I could never be a writer. Fucking grammar and formatting everywhere.

1uaicu,1,2014-01-03,"I have porn induced ED. I understand the ""science"", but emotionally I am scared and still have trouble accepting it (24yo)",in4thelonghaul,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1uaicu/i_have_porn_induced_ed_i_understand_the_science/,"Hey everyone,

I am a 24 yo straight male. I stumbled upon yourbrainonporn.com about 19 months ago and realized that my inability to sustain an erection for oral or vaginal sex with a partner was due to porn induced ed. Despite having a working penis in my late teens, by the age of 22 I could not keep it up for real life women. I was scared, but emotionally in denial. I tended to blame other women, alcohol and my self-confidence (whiskey-dick). I have been watching porn heavily since 9th grade, and took it to new heights early in college. After discovering the website, everything clicked. My ED became real after I became addicted to porn. 

I managed to reboot for about a month and a half during first summer after discovering the website. I immediately deleted a hard drive's worth of pornography. I tried to reboot without doing the proper research, and lasted only a few days without masturbating. Then one night, I could not control myself. I needed to release and worse, I could not fall asleep. I needed to see porn, but I refused to let it happen so I wound up on craigslist at 4 in the morning to get the stimulation I needed. 

I did a bit more research before trying again. The first 48 hours were not bad, but then soon the experience became miserable. Despite managing to distract myself with an internship, working out, running and socializing, the hour or so I had to myself before bed each night was filled with the most intense urges and fantasies that I have ever experienced. I did not have a good strategy to cool off, I would sometimes go sit in the dining room and read. Other times, I was lucky enough to chat with a roommate. But, mostly I could not fall asleep and it affected my job performance negatively. Worst after 45 days I ultimately I relapsed hard. I had a porn binge. I masturbated probably 2 dozen times over the course of 60 hours. I was a mess. 

As the wake of relapse weakened, I changed my strategy from NoFap to LessFap. Over the course of 14 months, I went from daily porn viewing to watching porn about 3 times a week. Binging went from once every 3 days to about once every 3 weeks. Nonetheless, I have not reaped many benefits of nofap. While my life is back under control, I still have porn induced ED. 

Two nights ago, my erection went flaccid during my first sexual encounter in a year and a half. I was embarrassed and the girl took it personally. The last 14 months were a waste in terms of improving my ED. I am now ready to try to reboot again, this time I want to be prepared to handle the inevitable urges, pain, anxiety. 

I have a few questions for you:

* My biggest question is this: Despite spending all but one or two hours outside my home and despite being quite occupied with work, hobbies and excercise, I still face intense cravings while laying in bed at night. Based on past experience, I know those urges will only worsen. 
What are some strategies you have used to quell extreme urges to masturbate to porn at 11, 12, 1, 2 at night? 

* Should I continue to pursue sexual relations with young women my age? 

* How do I build a support network with real world friends without labeling myself as a porn fiend? 

* I am interested in pursuing drawing, is my fear that drawing female anatomy could trigger porn urges justified? 

* I am very interested in pursuing a serious relationship, should I avoid trying online dating websites like OkCupid? 

*Emotionally, I am bit of mess right now. I have not had many sexual partners and I am afraid that if my penis does not start to work again, then I'll never be able to have passionate sex with a women. Any thoughts on the emotional side of dealing with ED?

Thanks so much for you help, I look forward to learning about your experiences with NoFap as well as the opportunity to join the community. 

Cheers to a better 2014!"
1uav06,0,2014-01-03,[25/m] It's Finally over between me and my first Gf (23/f)?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1uav06/25m_its_finally_over_between_me_and_my_first_gf/,"I'm looking advice for my first break up. Sorry in advance, the back story is kinda long.

So I am 24 years old, and have been dating this girl (23) for about 8 months now. Before that, we were friends for 8 months. We had gotten really close to each other before we started dating, and has gotten comfortable with each other so much that we tell each other everything. Initially, it started great, This was our first relationship. She was my first kiss, as I was hers. 

In my point of view, problems slowly came up. Neither of us really knew how to be really bf and gf. Both of us want certain things and we both get a bit upset when we don't. A few times she bought that we should break up cause maybe we weren't right for each other.

But I was stubborn, and I want to keep trying to make it work. I convince her each time that I would try harder and learn from my mistakes. I really didn't know how to be a bf, and slowly I got better. Like how to treat a gf and show that she was special and all. 

But then things gotten bad. Around the end of October, she started losing hair. Crazy fast. We went to doctors and they don't know. Currently, waiting for a specialist to look. There seem to be no bacterial infection, and she thinks its stress. 

She had also start taking birth controls, and she seem to be quite moody. Even she realize it herself. It had reach to a level of moodiness where we will be happy together for a few weeks, then she gets upset and I'll try to fix it and apologizing to her. Usually I did something bad. 

Eventually, she came up with some sort of agreement, since in January, she'll be doing her internship locally, and I will be very busy with school, we wouldn't have much time to see each other anyway. She purpose that she would give December our last try and she want to be the one deciding if she wanted to be in the relationship or not any longer. Whenever she previously wanted to end it, I would convince her to continue and she felt trap.

I kinda half hearty agree, and was pre-occupied with other stuff. Eventually, once we were done exams, we had a few weeks of romance. I had written her a poem, song. We took a small little vacation (3 days) for Christmas vacation (her suggestion, cause we found a very cheap deal). Really enjoy our time together, and didn't fight at all. 

Till today. She came over to my place to spend some time. We were both tired from the previous night, so we just cuddle and slept. We had previously agree that we might go out to eat together. Well, once evening came about, I suggest we go somewhere. It has been a while where we eat just the two of us and talk. She didn't want to and didn't feel hungry and ask me to take her home. I did so, but was visibly upset.

Hours late, we start talking on skype and she mentions that arrangement we had. She decides to end it right there. We talked a bit and she just doesn't want to be in a relationship right now. She wants to recover (hair loss) and rest.

It sucks even more, cause the next day is my bday. She and her parents have to leave town tmr, but she was planning to come back early. Perhaps to come back and celebrate my bday with me. I usually don't do anything, nor do I celebrate it so I was really looking forward to it.

Now I'm at a loss, cause I really didn't see it coming. I thought things were going good, and we were recovering in our relationship...

She could be gone the whole weekend, and she would start work on Monday. I really want to see and talk to her. I don't know what, can I even win her back right now? 

She live with her parents (Chinese), and I have met them before. I was only slowly getting to them. So I feel kinda awkward going there unannounced looking for her..."

Moved to Toronto a few months ago for an internship and getting bored because I don't know many people in the area. I've been having trouble sleeping recently, (3-4 hrs a night tops), and spend a lot of time doing nothing during the day. I thought I'd make some friends to get myself to do things. 

About me: I'm a programmer by trade, and always have an idea or problem I'm mulling over in my head. I love reading, video games, anime/manga, tennis, football, and work out regularly. Lately, I haven't been spending time on the aforementioned hobbies, so looking to shake things up a bit by doing them with people or finding new ones that other people enjoy.

Send me a message if any of the following apply:
1) You'd like to talk, in general or about something specific.
2) You're in the area and would like to hangout, I can commute anywhere in the GTA
3) You're thinking of doing something cool or fun and need a +1 (I can wingman or provide great stories) 

Basically, I have a lot of free time and want to spend it meeting new people. See you around! "
1ubqtu,12,2014-01-03,"Me [21F] with my boyfriend [21 M] of 3 years, might have a friend that is not ""just a friend""",justfriends2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ubqtu/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_21_m_of_3_years_might/,"Did my boyfriend emotionally cheat on me?

This past summer I lived in another city away from where my boyfriend currently resides to follow a dream internship. The internship lasted barely 3 months. My boyfriend was more worried about our temporary distance, but I reassured him that we would pull through. I couldn't pass up this once in a lifetime opportunity and was hoping that he would understand that this would advance my career significantly. I left for my internship with him a little disgruntled and him having feelings of being left out. 

Before leaving I explicitly told him that I felt uncomfortable with his relationship with a friend of his and that I didn't want them to hang out together over the summer. Back story: This friend is a girl our age whom I've briefly seen in person. My boyfriend and this friend work together and I have hints that they have a flirtatious relationship. They are always next to each other/sitting by each other in pictures of public work outings (which I'm not present). He never mentions his friendship with her. I've seen her text him late at night. I cannot see the texts. It might be important to note that my boyfriend takes is phone EVERYWHERE! Bathroom, shower, running down the street to repay the car meter, his side of the bed, ect. When my boyfriend and I run into the girl on occasion my boyfriend seems uncomfortable and dismisses her quickly, meekly saying ""Hi, how are you..."" before he abruptly ends the conversation. However when I'm not present they talk copious amounts.

Fast forward towards the end of summer. Our communication has been great. Towards the end of summer I become suspicious of his texts. On one occasion he says he is ""too tired"" to send me a picture that he promised to send of a new beer he is trying. This is odd as he always has his phone with him and he is supposedly home at the apartment we share. I press him and the situation becomes tense. He eventually sends me a picture where the background is suspiciously nondescript. I will come to learn later that he was indeed at the girl's apartment.

One day I outright say to him on the phone ""Have you been hanging out with this girl?"". He says ""Yes."" I press further and ask ""Have you been hanging out with this girl, one-on-one?"" He says ""Yes."" My heart sinks.

He has been conveniently not telling me about his relationship with this girl all summer long until I outright ask. I understand he would expect me to be jealous, but now he has made the situation worse by lieing to me for MONTHS about his whereabouts/interactions and has specifically invited this girl over to the apartment we share, which clearly crosses the one boundary I set for the summer. He later confesses that the girl has come over to the apartment we share to watch a movie, one on one! Drinking was also involved. Red flag. He ""can't remember"" how many times she may have been over at our apartment. He also confessed that he did it to ""prove that he could be faithful."" He said he did this for himself, not me. I forgot to mention that he has cheated on both of his past girlfriends, which have been the demise of both of his past relationships. His disloyalty has been a talking point before in our relationship, but this is the first time it has come to the forefront.

I'm just grasping at details because he won't tell me anything unless I explicitly ask. It's like a game. I also find out that on multiple occasions he has walked this girl home, hugging her goodbye. I'm livid and absolutely hurt. How could someone I trust explicitly do something that he knew would hurt me? How unreasonable was I to ask him to restrict his behavior? Am I going crazy?? I feel he essentially dated this girl and emotionally cheated on me in the least. I feel our relationship is crumbling and I'm contemplating the end of it.

---   
**tl;dr**: Had an internship for the summer in a different city away from my boyfriend. Boyfriend hangs out with a friend who is a girl, and who I have felt uncomfortable with in the past due to flirtatious behavior. I explicitly told him not to hang out with her one-on-one. Turns out boyfriend lied the entire summer and had one on one drunken movie night(s) with this girl in the apartment that we share, walked her home, went out for drinks, lunch, ect."

1ucvnd,3,2014-01-03,I feel like I'm living a lie / a living lie.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ucvnd/i_feel_like_im_living_a_lie_a_living_lie/,"Sometimes I just don't want to live anymore. I don't even know how to articulate my thoughts enough to write it in a comprehensive way. I have so many issues that nobody really knows about. To my friends, my family, and people who know me, I appear to be a person who's got their shit together and doing fine (as I have been told by them). I'm in good shape physically, I dress and present myself well to others, and just generally trying to be as good as I can (appear to) be to others. But deep inside me behind that wall I'm so weak and filled with issues and shame. Lots of it.

I have no self-confidence and it's hard to believe in myself. I don't ever praise myself or give myself credit for achieving anything. The older I get the more I see myself as an absolute failure. I'm 22, just finishing up my last year of college. I live at home with my parents who are still supporting me financially. The last time I had a real part-time job was when I was 16. I saved a couple grand from that job but by the time I was a college sophomore all that savings was gone. I got out of touch with my employer after leaving that job so I couldn't get a reference from him when I applied for jobs after. I've volunteered at various one-time events on campus so none of the organizers knew me enough to be a reference. Luckily my friend hooked me up with an (unpaid) internship last summer so I know I have one reference now but still, I feel like nobody would want to hire someone who's only got one reference ever in their life at the age of 22. The thing is, I know I have potential to do so much better but I feel so incompetent all the time and I'm ashamed of myself for not having a job for so long (ie living with my parents' money).

I have gone through periods where I completely broke down in despair. The first time I felt that was so scary. I had never felt so lost and empty; I didn't know wtf was going on with my brain (had no knowledge of depression). It was the first time where I thought of offing myself. I didn't go through with it because the rational side of me kicked telling myself that it would hurt my friends and family to do something like that. I don't know if I'm still depressed.. I feel like I'm back to 'normal' now as I can get on with my daily activities just fine; I enjoy doing things; I mean it when I smile and laugh. But when I'm without distractions just thinking to myself I often want to *disappear* from this world. Not necessarily ""kill"" myself because I'd be too afraid to go through with it, but just disappear.. poof.. gone.. no existence and everything of me wiped from this universe. Obviously that's not possible but it crosses my mind almost every day.

I'm scared of the future. I'm scared of I'm scared of what I'll become, better or worse. I'm scared of being a loser bum leeching off my parents forever. The worse of all is that I'm aware of my problems but I'm at loss as to what to do.

I probably sound so pathetic and I wouldn't argue with that. I don't know what writing it all out would do in the long run but it feels better to let it out because this is something that's been bugging me for a long time and something that I haven't told anyone due to shame.

1ud1bn,3,2014-01-03,I feel miserable (long rant),usa-e-getta-legal,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ud1bn/i_feel_miserable_long_rant/,"I have nobody to tell this to, so here you go, Reddit.  I just need to tell SOMEONE.

I'm 26, I'm married, I'm in college, and I'm pursuing a career in a field I love.  And I feel miserable.

I have nobody to support me other than my husband, whether financially or emotionally.  My parents are not in the picture, and I'm thankful for that.  They poisoned my life since my teens, and it was my happiest day when I moved from Hungary, and came to the US.  My parents refused to let me become who I want to be.  Since I was little, I was interested in fields that are not hard science: law, international relations, political science, and so on.  Yet, they wanted me to follow in the family footsteps, and either become a chemist, a doctor, or at most, an accountant.  They disapproved of me going to college for Hospitality Management - where I solely went because it's my mother's alma mater, and because the prestigious schools they wanted me to go to (for accounting or international finances) didn't accept me.  My mother wanted me to not move out - she never moved out from her parents' house, and she often mentioned she ""expected me to do the same to her.""

My in-laws are poor, even poorer than we (my husband and I) are.  My mother-in-law is disabled and on welfare; my father-in-law is also disabled, and a mostly recovered heroin addict, who can't receive benefits due to said addiction history, and because ""he didn't apply immediately after his injury"" (that's when the pain caused him to turn to drugs); my brother-in-law is 21, never held a job, and hasn't gone to physical school since 2nd grade (they went to private school while they could afford it, then homeschooled) until now, when he enrolled in community college with us.  They live on nothing but one person's disability checks, the occasional, low grants from school, and food stamps.  At the end of the month, they often borrow from us or from my husband's grandmother to make ends meet.  Mortgage, bills, food, you name it.  Something will not last.

My husband is the most supportive man on earth, but I can't vent to him on this - why would I?  He lives in the same misery as me, hearing again it won't help, and it will just frustrate him more.  We live in a wonderful apartment in a nice area of town.  This is the smallest and cheapest thing we could find, and it's still nice.  We couldn't move in with anyone if we wanted to: all of his family lives in houses too tight for their own use.

We don't own a car, never have in the five years we've been married.  I drive my mother-in-law's car every day to work.  I work for the District Attorney as a paralegal intern while I finish up my degree.  I work 40 hours a week, and I work my butt off.  I don't get paid for it.  I work on the other side of town, and I have to drive some 15 miles each way, chewing up a lot of gas.  The car I drive is about 13 years old, and it hadn't been well maintained.  It slowly leaks oil, but we can't figure out where.  It leaks coolant.  I replaced the radiator myself last summer.  The driver's seat is broken, and I don't have the money to replace it.  The transmission is giving out.  I'm afraid one day, it will just break while I'm driving on the freeway.  I don't even have a cell phone - we can only afford the $2-a-month lifeline land line.  I can't just go out and buy a car - even if I did, I can't afford to pay the insurance and the registration fees.  In fact, the car I drive now has not been insured for months, and the registration got suspended because of it.  This month, my tags will expire, and it will be obvious for cops.  We got the car impounded last spring because of this.  I can't afford to do that again - if it gets impounded, we will likely have to leave it at the impound lot for good.

Besides work, I take 15-ish units every semester in school, usually working 8-5, then in school 6-9pm.  I leave the house at 7am, and I rarely get home before 9.30.  I'm a 4.0 student.  My husband takes a similar courseload, and works 11pm-7am Friday through Sunday.  He simply does not have a day off.  Our emotional life suffers.  Our sex life suffers.  During the semester, getting it on once a week was a miracle, but to be honest, we're usually both too tired to be in the mood anyway.

Before I went back to school to become a paralegal, I worked at shitty jobs where I didn't fit in.  I worked at Target, where I was neither the snooty college kid who only worked for gas money, I wasn't the guy who never wanted to achieve further, and I wasn't the baby boomer looking to supplement a pension.  I had a hard time getting along, and I was fired after a year.  Then I worked as a dishwasher, and I tried to keep in cheer.  When my boss quit, I got a new supervisor, who sold drugs out of the kitchen (mostly weed and shrooms - I have no problem with the usage of them, but I don't like the idea of selling them out of a commercial kitchen; and occasionally acid, molly, or meth, which raise more red flags for me), and who hated me for being the only female in the sausage-fest of a banquets department.  I left when I started school, because he refused to adjust my schedule around my classes.  I later found out he hired his cousin to replace me.

I have no friends.  I have lots of casual acquaintances - classmates, people I bump into every now and then, co-workers, and the like.  I left my friends in Hungary, and the distance made us slowly drift away.  Since I've been on such a crazy schedule, I didn't really have the time to form a meaningful friendship, and I suffer for the lack of them.  I also don't feel comfortable becoming close friends with guys, although I generally had an easier time connecting with males.  I just feel it's inappropriate for a married woman to be hanging out with another guy, even if there's absolutely nothing sexual between us (at least not on my end).

We barely make ends meet.  I want to contribute more, but I need to complete this internship to get my degree.  I can't work any more.  I already do 40 hours a week, plus some 15 units in college, and I'm also the president of our student paralegal association at school.  I know I made some mistakes.  I'm trying to atone for them.  Yet, at the same time, I feel like I will just break.  I have no health coverage, even with the so-called affordable care.  There's no such a low payment I can afford, but apparently I'm too rich for the 100% subsidized care.

So, here I am today.  I'm down with some sort of a cold, I'm really sick, I have no money, my husband is asleep, sleeping up for the night's shift.  I also just found out that my credit card info was stolen in the Target data breach, and although I won't be liable for the over $4,000 used fraudulently against my credit, I still won't have access to my account for another two weeks or so.

Please - do not offer any physical help (money, donations, etc.).  I would never take advantage of any of you like this.  But if you feel like it...  please stop by and say hello.  Share a story, commiserate, or just say a kind word or two.  All I really need is companionship.

I'm sorry this turned out to be such a huge rant.  I just really, really needed this off my chest.  Thank you for reading me through."
1udnrp,47,2014-01-04,I don't know how much longer I can deal with being so alone.,spengineer,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1udnrp/i_dont_know_how_much_longer_i_can_deal_with_being/,"Three months ago I moved to a small, rural town to do a six month internship.

I was in no way ready to do that. A month before, my first girlfriend, who I had been dating for almost two years, and who was one of the very few friends I had, dumped me. I still haven't gotten over that, even though she's moved on. Not that I don't want to move on too, it s just that I can't. I can't meet anybody new out here. both because I just can't meet people, and because I have some pretty bad issues with depression and social anxiety. Not to mention that her dumping me kinda destroyed whatever confidence I had. 

I feel like I don't have anyone who cares about me. I'm just alone, trying to deal with shit that I really don't think I can get through by myself, but I'm too scared to try and find someone who's willing to help me through it. I always worried that I was an asshole, and those worried just got worse after my ex left. Now all I can do is sit in my apartment, try unsuccessfully to get my mind off of how pathetic I am, and get reminded again and again that my ex has moved on, while I'm stuck out in this town in the middle of nowhere, unable to meet anyone that could possibly help me out of this endless whirlpool of depression. I'm just stuck here, all alone, for three months, before I head back to school, confidence shattered, depression worsened, and social skills worse than the nonexistent skills I had before.

I can't handle this shit on my own, and no one wants to help me. All I want is for someone to care again, to at least pretend that I matter in any way. for a friend to actually start a conversation for once, rather than have me text them only for the conversation to die off quickly, because they obviously don't want to talk. I used to try so hard to socialize, but everything I did always just became awkward, and made me feel like I wasn't wanted. I guess I just stopped trying. But I don't want to be like this anymore. I want to have someone care, I want to be wanted. I just don't think I can get there on my own."
1ue7da,0,2014-01-04,"Discussion/Editorial: ""What Should an Indie Dev Make?""",Bcadren,IndieGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1ue7da/discussioneditorial_what_should_an_indie_dev_make/,"So a friend told me that I was too much of an engineer and too little of a game designer; that I made things that I found fun to make and/or that I would enjoy rather than what was marketable or common people would find fun. After much thought about this, I feel like; focusing only on what is currently in ‘vogue’ or appears marketable is a bit of a common flaw. As an Indie, I can see that say, Pokemon is popular and make something similar, but I can’t expect that to make it; I just don’t have the budget to do it, well enough to compete with the big guys. The two principles of making a game that I’d actually like to market that I’ve used before and still wish to use are the following:

Something that has never been done before. Trying to come up with a completely new genre would be (a) hard and (b) probably too confusing to the player. What I mean by this is finding an established genre and cranking out a new specific mechanic that hasn’t been seen before at all; or hasn’t been managed well before. Or taking an established genre and simply spinning it in a radically different artstyle/story or towards a different group than before. See ‘Portal’, ‘Fez’, ‘Braid’, ‘Shift’ etc.
Something that hasn’t been done well in a long enough time that the big companies don’t do it anymore; but there’s still a nostalgia crowd for. Especially if you also apply (1) or use features that wouldn’t have been possible at the time of the original. ‘Super Meat Boy’ is a great example of this.
I think within the Ludum Dare; I started on this (2) and was also going to apply (1), though I never got the chance to, due to time-limits. Just getting the basic mechanics of a Lemmings-Like was a bit of a stretch for 48-hours so the more unique ideas I had never got applied. On top of this, I didn’t properly add an in-game tutorial which gives the feeling that only people that have played a game in the Lemmings series can manage to play this at all. Because, within the 48-hours, I didn’t really have  time to ask anyone else to playtest it; I didn’t really realize how foreign a concept it was to people, because of that. I never really had had a full working prototype before playtesters before, because of this hard focus on getting everything ironed out before showing people. I think in the future I need to show people earlier; and/or focus on one mechanic and shoot off a playable alpha before doing anything else at all. I need a website and/or followers to manage to do that kind of thing though. In general though, I need to find a balance between assuming  the player knows nothing about the mechanics at all and providing sufficient in-game tutorials and not having someone who knows the game and/or has played games of similar genre before feel like they are being patronized. Also, on the other end, after the player is aware of all the mechanics, there has to be enough sufficiently difficult levels to keep the game interesting. Though I know how to make hard puzzles; this steady difficulty ramping and introduction of elements is something that I agree I don’t have practice with.

Thinking about the other some of model he implied with the statement; I end up seeing both the lucky successes of games like Angry Birds, which copied the semi-popular Crush the Castle with surprisingly good results; and the hundreds of cookie-cutter copies of things that don’t do so well. I feel like this path; puts more of a paramount on quality than the other; unless there is something truly unique about a game, be it a simple as its theme (Psychedelic/Drug influenced Pot Farm got some press against more mainstream Farmville) or as complex as a new mechanic; just something that sets your game apart. That said; this advice does tell me that choosing a popular genre or something that once was popular (again nostalgia points) is a more solid model to mutate from than something that saw very limited popularity.

All of that said; for myself, I hope that everything that I design that’s major to sell either has ‘new mechanic’ or ‘new artstyle’ going for it and either is a currently popular or formerly popular genre AND something that I personally enjoy as unless I am part of a much larger team; I feel like my own perspective on a game is very important and I don’t have the insight on games that I don’t enjoy from the player’s perspective that I do on ones that I know from both sides and cold analysis of ‘player should like this’ so we will do this is why traditional communications corporations that buy game companies don’t tend to do very well with them.

'Bcadren' is actively seeking internship or employ in the game design field and has completed a 4-year degree in 3D art and game design, save the internship requirement. At this time, he spends most his time developing a personal webpage, creating Indie games, and developing new skills. Contact me for more specific information or questions."
1ue9a8,2,2014-01-04,Where is the systematic discrimination against women in CS happening?,[deleted],socialjustice101,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialjustice101/comments/1ue9a8/where_is_the_systematic_discrimination_against/,"I don't know about X Engineering or other STEM majors, but the CS program at my Uni feels pretty welcoming to women. Though only about 20% of the students are girls, I fail to see where they're discriminated against. Hell, there are even less black (or partially black) guys in this program than girls, and I don't feel very discriminated against. The professors seem more than willing to help them, and the guys definitely aren't cold towards them. Hell, every time a girl has a problem during our lab every guy around her jumps to her rescue.


I even live in Louisiana, which is obviously not the most progressive place to be.


So what options does that leave? The workplace? Well, most internship opportunities I looked at apparently encourage women and underrepresented minorities (blacks, latinos) to apply to their programs. So, what's left? Where are women feeling this supposed discrimination in CS programs? I'm not seeing any systematic discrimination against women, all I've been hearing are anecdotal arguments. (e.g. ""this happened to me, so it must be the case everywhere"" or ""check out this blog from such and such littered with cherry-picked cases of misogyny in the tech industry"")


""Well then why is there a shortage of women in CS and the CS job market?""


It's probably just a cultural thing. Women aren't inherently less capable of being developers, they just generally aren't interested in such programs. I can see how maybe they'd be turned off by the lack of *other* women in those programs (not saying that's a valid excuse; the lack of black people in the tech industry doesn't turn me off from it) but that ideology just creates a cycle which results in a gap that'll never be filled."
1uegmy,6,2014-01-04,Really need advice and/or similar experiences to what I'm going through,taway654,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1uegmy/really_need_advice_andor_similar_experiences_to/,"So a bit of background, my gf and I dated had since first year in college, all that way until we graduated. So we were together for almost 5 years. During this time we had many internships, and were only able to see each other 4 consecutive months at any one time. We made it work, lived together for 4/5 years, and I was ready to marry the girl. After we graduated, she went off to graduate school, and I went to start work full time. We are only a 2.5 hours flight away from each other, so I thought we'd be able to visit each other quite often, like every two weeks even (finances would not be an issue).

Two months into graduate school, she breaks up with me because she says being away from her like this is too hard on her and she feels extremely lonely. I guess it's different because now she has to wait a year and a half before we can be back together consistently. I feel she finds it too daunting (not that I don't). But I also just don't understand how she could do what we did before, where we didn't even visit each other during those four month stins, and now I'm offering to do it every two weeks and it's not good enough! This is issue number one.

However, we are still talking because we think there may be a future. Issue number two is that even after she is done, she doesn't know that our career ambitions will line up to end up being in the same place. She's worried that we won't make it in the real world. So this contributed to why she broke it off in the first place because she was scared that we might not even want to live in the same place, and that it might be too different from when we were in school. I tried telling her that couples go through this (w.r.t  the location issue) and they make compromises because they love each other. Jobs will come and go, but a life partner is there to stay (in theory). However, there really are some places where she could end up that wouldn't work for me. I just don't know how to tell her to take it one step at a time, and I can't think of how to calm her down about the future. I think she's really just trying to protect herself and is afraid of things not working out, and that she needs to be sure that things will work if we're to get back together.

I'm also worried that maybe she thinks I'm not committed to her. The reason I didn't propose is because I didn't think it would be the right time with her going off to grad school for awhile, but now I'm worried not doing it might make me end up losing her for good. I'm not sure if that was the right choice.

I'm just looking for advice regarding my situation or just similar experiences to see how other people handled things like this."

1ufi4k,34,2014-01-04,Tips for busy season,UKaccountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ufi4k/tips_for_busy_season/,"I'm into my 4th busy season within a Big4 firm and thought it would be useful to share some tips for the new graduates and interns on this subreddit. For the new grads, I know how daunting it can seem but every situation can be managed! 

Please feel free to share your own experiences.

- Make sure you get some sleep. I can't stress how important it is to sleep at least 6 hours a night over a long period of time.

- Make use of your peer network. Everyone above you in your firm has been in the same situation so ask them about it - you'll find more often than not that managers/seniors Will like passing on advice! 

- If you are struggling, put your hand up! Drowning in work is awful and feels awful, so don't feel isolated. It'll seem like the hardest thing in the world but just pluck up the courage and tell someone because that's the only way it will get resolved.

- Try and laugh. I've always worked in/managed teams and I know first hand how important it is to crack a joke and have a bit of a laugh throughout the day, especially in an audit room. It does the world of good for everyone's mood :)

- Blow off some steam once a month. This is a personal thing but I found it always realigned my focus the day after and helped break up periods of constant work and took my mind off things.

I'd like to hear other accountants advice on getting through the next 3 months because it is a test of character at times! 

All the best!"
1ufpep,39,2014-01-04,The Sig Sauer 1911 Nitron Rail or: Why Virginia is a Pain in the Ass for College Students,isprant,guns,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1ufpep/the_sig_sauer_1911_nitron_rail_or_why_virginia_is/,"Hello /r/Guns, boy do I have a story for you today. This story starts in late August of 2013. I was driving from home (TX) back up to school at Virginia Tech after a nice summer of working an internship. I decided to treat myself after the long summer with a new purchase. I spent a while choosing what I'd want, going from an AK to a 9mm AR to a Remmy 700, but ultimately decided on a nice Sig 1911. So who do I contact? None other than our local angry man, /u/FirearmConcierge. Exchanged quite a few private messages with him and found myself a nice Sig 1911 Nitron Rail at his establishment with a good price tag and a quick ship date. So I spoke to my FFL, got it all figured out, sent a transfer of some money online, then had a 1911 headed to my LGS. Once it arrives at my FFL, the clusterfuck begins.

As many of you know, federal law states that you cannot do a transfer for a handgun in a state in which you do not reside. One exemption, however, is [ATF Ruling 80-21](https://www.atf.gov/files/regulations-rulings/rulings/atf-rulings/atf-ruling-80-21.pdf). Essentially, this states that while I am in VA for school, I am a resident in the eyes of the ATF of VA. Same goes for TX, while I'm there, I'm a resident of TX to the ATF. So I speak to my FFL about this and he reminds me that there's Virginia state law on top of that, which includes their own background check and form (the SP-65 form).

So I go and call the ATF local branch, and they tell me ""Yep, you're good to go on the federal level. All you have to do is use the additional information part of the 4473 to prove your VA residency."" Then I call a few troopers with the Virginia State Police. Essentially, they say ""Yep, we know you're good on the federal level. We just don't have a stipulation for you to get possession of your handgun. You have to provide a VA Drivers License or VA Identification card to get the handgun. To get either of those, you have to surrender your Texas one."" Well, shit. Now my new 1911 is stuck at my LGS and I'm not going back to Texas until late December. Luckily, I know the guys at my LGS and are good enough friends that they agreed to hang on to it for as long as it takes. I went to the store every once in a while just to play with it, but had to give it back to them before I left each time. Then, finally, I got to transfer it to another LGS here in TX. Two days before Christmas, I finally got to do my 4473 and pick up my Sig 1911 after way too many months of limbo.

So here it is, in all its' beauty.

It's a fantastic feeling firearm, and my first 1911. I love Sigs, and I know I won't be disappointed with this. I know I don't really have a range report, but I figured I'd share the clusterfuck of a story to take possession of this gun. 

tl;dr - bought handgun from Mr. Angry Man, ran into annoying fucking laws, took possession of it 4 months after purchasing.

1ufwxq,7,2014-01-05,I'm a fucking mess. Please help...(tl;dr I got cheated on and now I've reverted back to feeling worthless),[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1ufwxq/im_a_fucking_mess_please_helptldr_i_got_cheated/,":( 

I don't know if this is going to be a wall of text because I'm just typing shit down and I'm sooooo sorry if this seems over dramatic. This is a long wall of text because I'm honestly just writing this for mostly cathartic purposes 

I'm an underclassman college student at a competitive, elite university. I am just such a fucking mess that I don't know what to do with myself. To be honest, I don't even know where to fucking post this. 

I found out that my ""girlfriend"" had been cheating on me about 2 months ago. My ""girlfriend"" and I were in a long distance relationship, where she attended a school of similar caliber in a neighboring state that was only like a 5 hour drive away. I know this is pathetic, but this girl was basically my first ""relationship"". We basically met over summer and had a very intense fling, but mutually decided against being serious because we'd both be going to different colleges and only knew each-other for like a month and a half. We also decided to kind of end the relationship. I honestly thought that we'd never speak to each other again once college started, but we ended up Skyping and chatting again after the second week. Strangely enough, the distance actually made our relationship stronger! 

I'd like to add that I thought (and still think) that this girl is wayyyy out of my league so I was pretty stoked to have ""won"" her attention. She's a lot smarter than I am and extremely beautiful. She's also very quirky, loving, etc. However, she also has horrible self-esteem due to being abused by her biological parents.

We ended up making plans to see each other three weeks after school started. She came over to ""my"" city to visit and stayed at the house of her roommate. We met up that weekend and had a fucking blast. However, on her last night there (she actually extended her ""visit"" by like two days) she ended up breaking down and admitting to me that she wanted to be in a fully fledged and ""exclusive"" relationship with me. She also told me that she hated her school and wanted to transfer to mine (you have no idea how happy this made me). I should have known something was up when her roommate was shooting us both weird glances when she heard our conversation about ""exclusivity""... 

Anyways, I ended up visiting her city a couple of weeks later where I met a guy who I was initially very suspicious of because he was basically orbiting her. I voiced concerns over their relationship, but she just assured me that it was all ""platonic"". I just thought that the guy was a harmless loser, so I buried my doubts and we ended up hanging out together one night together without my girl as he showed me the frat scene. I honestly had a great time with him, and we even exchanged Steam users and subsequently played with each other about 2-3x a week. I'd honestly say that I thought that this guy was my ""friend"". One of my better ""friends"", I'd even say considering the circumstances of our ""friendship"". 

Well, well. Turns out the fucker was hooking up with her behind my back. How did I find out? Her roommate sent me a text message saying that my ex was cheating on me with that fucking spineless bastard. She also managed to sneakily break into my ex's phone when she was passed out to forward me screenshots of conversations they had and a pic of her basically playing with the guy's dick as proof of physical infidelity. 

I also found my ex's secret Instagram account and found out that the bitch had been flirting with that backstabbing cunt for MONTHS! In some of their more recent pictures, I also noticed that the fucker completely stole my sense of style and was even wearing some of the exact same shit that I wore. WHAT THE FUCK!? HE EVEN GOT HIS EARS PIERCED LIKE ME! 

That just killed me inside. I called her the next day and broke off the relationship, but not before calling her every insult that has graced the English lexicon. Over the course of about 48 hours, she sent me over 100 text messages and tried to call me at least two dozen times. A week later, her room mate called me and told me that my ex had tried to kill herself. Twice. I got an update from her a couple of weeks ago and apparently my ex tried to kill herself again and had fucked up some of her classes due to falling into a serious depression. Her merit aid may have apparently been jeopardized due to the decline in her academic performance and her parents might even force her to take a gap year. 

I'm just so fucking confused. I honestly thought that this girl loved me. She encouraged me to be who I am, i.e. a weird motherfucker, and would buy me gifts almost every week (two hours ago I was actually playing a videogame that she bought me).  She would bombard me with lovey dovey and supportive messages almost everyday and almost acted like my little personal therapist. I'd also like to add that she even once visited me on short notice when I was having issues with my parents.

Basically, what I am trying to say is that I genuinely believe that this girl somehow loved me despite doing something very fucked up. It's just an absolute mindfuck as to how she can beg me to enter an exclusive relationship only to fuck me over like that. Am I crazy if I said that I'd want to re-visit the relationship maybe ~3 years from now? Or maybe I just have a low sense of worth because quite honestly most girls have treated me like complete subhuman shit. 

I was never the most popular guy. I'm also objectively not attractive, although that is changing. I was actually a gigantic fucking loser in high school. I don't want to be too specific, but I transferred to an extremely wealthy and homogenous high school where I felt like a complete pariah due to not being a WASPy motherfucker and being a very middle-class kid. I was also extremely depressed due to my home situation, which only made things worse. I only started making ""real"" friends in my final year of high school, forming a tight group with some other kids who didn't exactly fit in. However, towards the end of the year I felt like they kind of abandoned me as they became more ""popular"". Thankfully, I ended up reconnecting with some buddies from my old school during my final semester and made them my primary social circle. 

I decided to completely reform myself and catch up on all the lost years of socialization with my new friends over summer, and it kind of worked. I made a ton of friends during my first month of college and it honestly felt awesome to be invited by so many people to different things all the time. For the first time in a looooooooong time I actually had a proper social life. I became one of those people that would somehow end up in every photo album after a night of partying. 

But anyways, that brings me to my next point. The cheating absolutely shattered my sense of self and how I perceived my relationships with my college friends. Honestly, none of my ""friends"" seemed to give a shit about me despite the fact that I was clearly *very* troubled at times except for these two very awesome guys (although to be fair, I kept my issues on the DL and 98% of peeps didn't even know that I was in a sham of a relationship). Turns out that most of my ""friends"" were just drinking buddies. This one girl who I thought was one my ""best friends"" basically started to ignore me when she caught me teary eyed in a park. Ouch. What's funny is that I consoled her when she cried her eyes out when her boyfriend was forced to go back to his home country due to some issues with financial aid/scholarships. I thought that I had a ton of friends. Turns out I only had like two or three REAL friends. This realization made me very depressed and during the last two months, I basically cut myself off from everyone else. 

I finished the semester with an okay GPA of 3.1. The problem is that I'm trying to get into a program with a GPA cutoff of around 3.5. To make things worse, when I apply to this program, they will recalculate my GPA which may end up being ~2.7 for this semester once they remove all the ""fluff"" courses/credits. This program is very well respected and is my best bet at starting a good career once I graduate because I'm honestly too stupid to pursue the other majors that can land me with a solid career. 

I am now worried that I will never find a girlfriend in college. I had a drunken ONS during my second week of college and it honestly made me feel like shit. That scene is just not for me. Some of my friends have called me a ""pussy"" for this and have egged me on to be more sexually active. Getting laid is easy. I want a relationship. The competitive nature of my college means that most of the women are very career driven and are not looking for any serious relationships. 

Depression has honestly made me a complete idiot. I honestly feel like the biggest idiot on Earth re-reading this post. My brain feels foggy/slow and I can't tell if that's the substance abuse or the depression. I was also recently diagnosed with a learning disorder. Maybe I'm just naturally slow. My memory is comically bad and I'm now worried that I may develop Alzheimers or Dementia prematurely. I know for a fact that my parents sometimes ask themselves where they went wrong with me. It hurts. I've never had a good relationship with them. 

I know this all sounds like stupid melodramatic shit (because it is), but quite honestly I just feel awful. I've experienced some awful things in my life that I just don't what to get into now. The problem is that I thought that somehow college was a place to reinvent myself and to iron out many of the problems that have been holding me down. I've somehow reverted back into my old self (maybe worse) and now I feel like complete shit. Things are actually a lot worse than what I've written here, but I'm too embarrassed to write about some of the other issues because I just want to focus on my college life. 

I just don't feel like a real man. I just feel like such a weak and worthless fuck. Everywhere around me on campus are people who are landing internships, jobs, awards, etc. People with friends. People getting laid. Basically, people who seem to have their own identities. People who are confident in themselves. People who are real...""people"" if that makes any sense? I understand that everyone has their own insecurities, but I honestly just feel like a hollow husk of bullshit or something. 

wat do?

**TL;DR**: I was a depressed loner in highschool. My LDR girlfriend cheated on me, triggering some deep-seated recurring emotional/psychological issues. Realize that my ""friends"" were just drinking buddies. Kind of messed up my grades. How do I turn things around? "
1ug8at,1,2014-01-05,Planning,xanderthemighty,justintymeco,https://www.reddit.com/r/justintymeco/comments/1ug8at/planning/,"I am planning my outing for this week. I don't want to put it off because I fear that if I do, I might just put it off too long.

**I may not be being too clear on what I mean, I am planning to go to LA to see a show! I also plan to stop by the BuzzFeed offices and try to apply in person but that is a secondary goal... although important in it's own right!

**I've only applied for an internship recently, but I'm hoping that if I get it, it would eventually lead to more work. It's a long shot... but it would go a long way to getting me where I want to be in life!!

**The other part... the more important part is the show. I hope I can find the strength to talk to Trisha after the show on Friday. I don't plan for anything big but I hope I can be at least a little suave and not feel like I'll be tossed out immediately...

**That is if she is even there... I think her role is vital to the show and I don't see why she wouldn't be... yet I am afraid. I actually have several fears... she's going to CES next week which I believe is all week and while she could feasibly make it back in time, she might have an understudy or maybe there's no performance at all! I guess I could try calling the theater... probably a good idea but now I don't want to put off the BuzzFeed thing...

**And then, if she were there... why would it matter if I were there? It's really, really meaningful for me... to support Trisha as a friend and someone who cares for her... but it may mean nothing to her. I don't think she would want me not to go but I'm not sure my absence would be that significant... 

**I suppose that's not really what my going would be about though. Regardless of how she feels, I do care for her and want to offer my support and encouragement. 

*However, I don't want to scare her... I'm afraid of how one might approach her afterward. I mean, do the actors just come into the lobby afterward or do I just wait in a dimly lit alley with a buncha other people who want to congratulate her? I honestly don't think I could wait in an alley or anything like that... it'd just be creepy...

*So, I'm still working out the details... maybe none of this even matters... At least I've left it open so I can catch her run the last weekend just in case. I'm excited... nervous but excited... looking forward to a good show with someone I admire and just maybe I'll have the courage to say something to brighten her day. She may not be aware but she always brightens mine!

****Also, I know it may come off as weird and creepy but I do think the world of her and find her whole being very comforting... I will not cause her any harm whate'er the future may hold!"

So here it is- My first semester in college: a look back. Feel free to ask questions!",sceptox,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1ugo75/now_that_a_lot_of_you_seniors_are_figuring_out/,"I'm going to spare you most personal details, but you should know the following: male, white, 18 years old, parents divorced, dad lives on the other side of the planet, from a private high school in Georgia, attending Georgia Tech, majoring in Environmental Engineering. I know I sound pretty boring based on all that, but I promise, I'm kinda cool. There's so much I want to talk about, but I also don't want to make this too long, so I'll get straight to my experience. Fair warning: I'm going to be blunt.


You might notice that in the following paragraphs, I will hardly ever mention classes or anything related to academics. That's for one reason: *Classes* are easy. *College* is hard. If you want to be successful, you can be successful. It's extremely simple. Go to class. Read ahead in the textbook. Ask questions. Find help outside of class if you need it. Read your notes again. Study a few days in advance. If you do these things, your academic career **will** be immaculate. This is what I did for the first three-to-four weeks and I was churning out As at a hard university and I was proud of myself.

But college is about far, **far** more than your GPA. I might have been kicking ass in class, and might have been working out once or twice every single day, and might have been in the best mental and physical health I have ever been in, but it didn't matter how sharp I was, because I was lonely. In college, when you feel like you're alone, you're **done**.

That's a bit of a cliffhanger, but let's get back to the first week of college. I'm 18; I'm male; and I've got a pretty good idea of what I want to do with girls in college. I've heard stories, I've asked around, and it turns out that the best way to go about enhancing my odds with the ladies is by being in a fraternity, which was a problem, because I didn't want to be associated with alcoholism, drugs, rape, rowdiness, poor academics, and hazing, all of which are the stereotypes and stigmas that surround fraternity men. But after much deliberation, I rushed at a fraternity, they gave me a bid, I accepted it, and I became a pledge.

Like all the other pledges, I did the work they told me to do, with the hope that one day I would be a 'frat bro' and I would be cool. And I thought that despite all the stuff I would have to put up with, I could continue to make amazing grades. **I was right.** While all the other pledges were getting to know everyone in the fraternity and bonding and having fun as a group, I was studying and working out on my own. I kept this up for over a month, and it was exhausting, mentally and physically. And then something happened.

I was called to the fraternity house and was faced with three members of the executive committee (the guys who decide which pledges they keep, and which pledges they drop). I figured I was in trouble, but it had to be a mistake because I was doing all the necessary work to the best of my ability. Not only that, but I was kicking ass in school, which helps the image of the fraternity. Turns out that the problem they had with me was simple: *they weren't getting to know me*. It wasn't important to them what my GPA was, or what extracurricular stuff I might be good at, or how many young ladies I would be able to attract to the house. They wanted to one day be able to call me their brother, and I would have to spend time with them in order to make that happen. They decided to give me one week to change my behavior or else they would have to drop me.

I immediately started hanging out with all the other pledges and some of the brothers I really liked, which cut into my study time and my working out, but when I saw these other guys and saw how happy they were to be together, *to have someone*, it didn't matter that their grades were mediocre, or that they were kinda out of shape. They were happy, and they were learning more from each other than they were from their textbooks. My reasons for being a part of a fraternity changed entirely. Originally, I thought there was no way I was going to meet and be respected by girls unless I was in a fraternity, but now it was about the guys around me. We had to put up with a lot during pledgeship. None of us would have been able to make it- and not just through pledgeship, but through the process of going to a new and daunting place with new people and new challenges- without being able to lean on the shoulder of the guy next to you.

By the end of the semester, my grades grades had taken a huge hit. I barely managed to keep all of my scholarships. If the same guy that came to Georgia Tech at the start of the Fall semester had seen my GPA at the end, he would have left the fraternity immediately. But I'm not the same guy. Sure I gained back couple pounds after I had lost a ton of weight, and I might have been a part of more than a few stories I might one day regret. But this is what college is for: mistakes. Make them. I did, and I feel fantastic.

However, I am going to make some serious suggestions for making those mistakes safely:

* Don't ever get black out drunk. It's not fucking funny. There is nothing sadder that seeing a girl at a party and knowing that there is nothing you can do to avoid her being taken advantage of. That sounds awful and really short-sighted on my part. It is. Welcome to college. I don't drink, and I actually act as a sober monitor for our parties, but there is nothing I can do for someone who is already too far gone. They will find a way to get into serious trouble or really get hurt. They always too. Do not get to that point. Ever.
* Don't do drugs. I can't believe I have to say that. If you really like drugs and that's what makes you happy, good luck affording them. Everyone in college is pretty much broke. You will be too.
* Don't skip class. I skipped one class, and it sucked. One. You can be five minutes late to every single fucking class you take, but never, ever miss one entirely. You're welcome.
* Unless you absolutely hate, with a burning passion, the major you chose going into college, don't switch majors immediately. Stick it out for at least a semester, then make the change. You may think that your major will give you certain job opportunities, but what you end up doing at internships or with jobs might be totally different. By changing your major you are costing your family time and money.
* Be very careful with your money. If you can save even a little bit every month, you will help yourself and your family a lot in the long run. Something big is going to come up and you are going to have to pay for it yourself. Be prepared.
* **THE BIGGEST FUCKING TIP I CAN FUCKING GIVE YOU**: Let go of high school. Who you were in high school means nothing anymore. No one cares about what was on your college application once you are accepted. If you are in a relationship going into college, where he/she is still in highschool or he/she is going to a different college, call it off. Be friends. You are going to change very quickly in this new environment and so are your priorities and how you think. Being friends is the best way to go about this. Stay in touch, but be prepared for both of you to see other people. **I FUCKED UP. I COULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS WITH MY EX, BUT I WAS LIKE NO. NOW ONE OF THE COOLEST PEOPLE I HAVE EVER MET WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.** There's obviously a much longer story behind that, but I just want you to know that as much as it sucks, *just be friends*. You will not regret it, because if y'all were really meant to be together, it will happen. Trust me. I beg you.

Sorry for getting a little wild near the end with the f bombs and caps lock, but I wanted to get the important stuff across. Now, if you have any questions about fraternities, sororities, majors, professors, classes, Georgia Tech, or surviving your first semester, I'm here for you."
1uhi6z,6,2014-01-05,Interest in non-profit,Zcandy,nonprofit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/1uhi6z/interest_in_nonprofit/,"I'm currently a sophomore in college majoring in art history. This year I've gained some experience working in an art museum in a part time ticketing position and I will soon be starting an internship at a non-profit contemporary art gallery. 
I love my major and enjoy it greatly, but I do not have much interest in pursuing an academic or curatorial position in the future. Which I know leaves me with an even smaller option career wise. Originally, I was interested in possibly working with art investments and working to obtain a certificate in arts management.  The thought of working for an art related non-profit or starting my own is much more appealing to me. Because of this, I am wondering if it would be better if I changed my major to non-profit administration, and finished out my art history with just a minor, and then consider receiving a masters in art administration. 
I know that anything I decide won't really point me in the direction of easily attainable jobs, but I would like to make myself as marketable as I can. 
I'm just hoping for some advice from people already within the field, because I'm feeling very lost at this point. 

Edit: one more thing, could I possibly PM someone and explain to them an idea I have for an art related non-profit? It's something that would happen years from now obviously, but I'd really like some feedback on a basic idea I have. "

$22,000 in debt for student loans. 3 different rates, all pretty low. I think the highest (and smallest loan) is 6.2%.

$2,000 in personal debt to a friend. I took this out because of some cash flow issues I had when a paid internship ended unexpectedly and I made some mistakes with my financial aid. I've agreed to pay them back in 2 years, my friend now says I don't need to because of a very large new line of income she's acquired, but I still want to pay her back.

I own a '00 American made Sedan with 95,000+ miles on it. Bought it for $4,000 when it was at 69,000, its been great but I'm starting to worry about it. It gets about 22 MPG.

I'll soon receive a $5,000 sign on bonus.

I need to buy suits, I'll need to wear one everyday for my job and I currently own one.

After getting my bonus, a few scholarships, and buying some suits I expect to move down there with roughly $4k in my checking account, no emergency savings, and no credit card debt.

So I think I've got an nmom. I don't know whether all the time at the babysitters when I was a child really was because my mom was going to school or not. She doesn't have anything to show for it, but in adolescence I quickly picked up on her shtick. She likes doing the minimum amount of effort in everything she **has** to do (ie raising kids). She liked testing the waters, so it was a gradual decline in standard of living. It started with inviting freeloaders into our home. At first these were family members who had nothing going for them. They were let in under the guise they would help with rent, chores, and most importantly... babysitting.

 You see, all of my moms friends and boyfriends could be found at the local bar. And if some awful thing were to happen to her kids while she was at a bar, that would look bad on her. So the freeloaders were her way of having a ""responsible adult"" in the house at all times. The first one was an aunt, she beat us with shoe-heels if we didn't do the dishes. The second was Paul, an old babysitter's boytoy (he was in his 20's, she was in her 60's). We saw him at Subway one day panhandling and my mom decided to take in this ugly duckling as well. He was on constant meds for some godawful reason, and had a really fucked up thing for my mom. Whenever we'd do something we weren't supposed to he'd say we controlled him, and one night my mom came home to him standing behind her bedroom door with a knife ""as a joke"". He was gone soon after when my mom invited my uncle to live with us again. Third was Don, my in/out of jail uncle. He was around the longest (a few years before Paul, and again much after). At first he was okay. But eventually it was a downward spiral of binge drinking, hotboxing our garage, and occasional overdoses. He was around for maybe 9 years. I think from when I was 8-16. But eventually while my mom was at the bar, he was walking around incoherent with nothing on, vomiting and leaking diarrhea everywhere (he had Hepatitis....yay) and banging on the walls so I called 911. Red flashing lights were enough for my mom to kick him out. He died in a nursing home in his 50's a few years after, alcohol related issues. The last was Bruce, an in/out of prison type of guy. Nice enough dude, it's just that his moving in really marked the accelerating decline in my and my siblings' standard of living.

 For my whole life my mom had been working at the same place for the same guy, but around the time Don died she'd been having her hours cut. So she quit after finding a new job. Her hours were crazy and didn't allow her to go the bar as often, but it paid the bills. This was maybe Freshmen year for me. After a while, she found a new boyfriend (despite my brother's father being a major supporter of our family) and things took a turn for the worse. She made up some bs story of a spider in one of the security cameras where she works (entomophobia is her go-to for avoiding manual labor) and just had to quit her job. Just so happens her new boyfriend was an in/out of jail type of guy, she worked at a juvi. The two wouldn't mix well. So now we had another freeloader to feed and only welfare and ebt paying for us (4 kids, 3 adults including Bruce). Things went to hell those few months, namely because my kind-of step-dad was still supporting her and he wrongly assumed they were in a relationship, seeing how he was around almost 24/7. So he stopped helping those few months. After the boyfriend was put in jail she ran back to my step-dad. ***Then*** left him for the boyfriend when he was released. She would take lots of 2am walks and give/imply threats of suicide to us, her children included. We had to hug her and apologize for not being there for her on Thanksgiving, we went to our Grandparent's instead. It took every fiber of my being not to cry for fear of it being mistook as sincerity. It was soul crushing. Mother's Day rolled around after not seeing the boyfriend for months after Thanksgiving, and she used that, saying we were going to breakfast, to drag us to a halfway-house type of church where lo-and-behold the boyfriend was at. When I tried to walk home she used everything in her power to stop me, and I did. Sitting in church having people say they were glad to see this family together... again, I pained to not cry for fear of looking sincere rather than depressed. Fuck giving them the satisfaction.

Months went by and eventually the boyfriend stopped popping up in conversation. But my mom was still jobless. By late Sophomore year I was accustomed to having only power or only water working at any given time. We couldn't afford trash pick-up service, so we threw bags in our backyard and used a trailer to dump them every month. We'd fill giant water gallons to shower and cook on a barbecue in the back, and the whole time my mom spent more and more of her free time at the bar. This was the effects of her testing-the-water method of being a shit parent. I guess she figured no-one died yet or called the cops, so she was fine. The occasions I did have blow-ups or cry for hours on end she'd be indifferent and tell me to quit with the self-pity.

 It kept on like this until Junior year when our landlord died. His wife decided to renovate/sell all the houses he owned, except our house had been falling apart for years and my mom hadn't properly documented it. We lost our deposit and the civil suit to get it back. This was all during the first half of 2012. One week before finals week my Junior year, we were evicted and living in a motel. I remember stuffing everything into a truck on the last morning we were allowed in the house, did I mention she was a hoarder? It felt like the *Grapes of Wrath* with a trucked filled maybe 14' high with her belongings even after a week of packing. That morning was when I had one of my two serious personal epiphanies. I realized we weren't getting another house no matter how much ""it's just for a week or two"" phrases she'd spout. Her old boss was nice enough to put us up in a hotel while we finished school and for about a week over summer... super generous, but the money only lasted so long. ***Sidenote, for months prior my mom's passion-project was to start up her own business in the field she'd worked in my whole childhood, it worked out just as we lost our house. Guess those bills were more important...*** Anyways, once the money ran out we stayed in her shop (paid for by step-dad) in this little trailer meant for weekend long excursions w/ two people. There was 6 people inside there for about a month until the owners of the building asked if we'd been living there. We packed up the trailer and moved it to, you guessed it, the bar. I spent my Senior year living in a cramped trailer in a bar's dirt lot with no electricity or water.

 The day we moved the trailer was when I had my other epiphany-thing. I sat and made a conscious point to work my ass out of that situation, and avoid the trailer all costs while I needed it. Luckily the day after the 4th of July I was accepted into this after school non-profit art studio, that acceptance is wholly responsible for where I am now and where I'm going. Once I got in, I spent every day from 3-7 there working on art, something that was already a big hobby of mine from the days without electricity. But going there cost a $40/month membership fee. The directors of the studio were this really understanding hippie couple, so they had me on a pay what you can, when you can, basis. I still felt guilty not being able to pay, so I stayed late doing chores, helped studiomates when I could, and was practically the studios stock-keeper. I became one of the few go-to people after all that, so they offered me an internship a month or two after joining. That internship meant I could stay after hours and get a key when I turned 18. I stayed there every night until the last bus came. The trailer? I was only ever there to sleep. I got up around six, went to school early to clean myself in the bathrooms, went to the studio right after, and worked there until about midnight. This was my entire Senior year. The way I put it was that I made productivity my form of escapism, it did the job. Plus, it got me better grades with all that homework time and a few art related scholarships. Only one friend vaguely knew my family's situation, but I mentioned it in past tense with a few understanding teachers. I think not telling anyone during then did it's number on me however. Whenever I was in the trailer trying to sleep I'd have what I believe were panic attacks. I'd violently (but silently) cry with my chest in that perpetual 'oh shit' feeling like when you're terrified/jump-scared by something. Those nights, mixed with all the work I was doing, made me an exhausted mess. But I fell asleep quicker from it, so that was a silver-lining.

Graduation rolls around and I manage to have better grades than ever, I've learned I work best under stress. Rather than go to community college I go to the local 4-year, I'm lucky it was so close. My family's income made it so everything, including housing, was paid for by federal aid and a few merit based/art scholarships I'd gotten. That's where I am now. I see me mom maybe once every 2 weeks unless she/I need something, and I now have a key to the studio + a good amount of mural painting jobs. Also, the directors went and did a few workshops at a private art school in Sante Fe, Landed me and two studiomates 50% tuition cuts. We're taking a one-way road trip next fall. :]


**TL;DR: My mom drove us to homelessness and it all centers around a bar. I'm doing a little better now, yay art.**

(M24, F21)",Spoonie_McLuv,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1uj740/almost_three_years_and_unsure_if_we_can_make_it/,"Hello everyone, forgive me as it is early in the morning and I hope this does not turn into a rant.

My girlfriend and I have hit a rather rough spot in our relationship as of late with arguments, trust issues, a halt in our sex life, and me receiving some minor but still present physical abuse.

First some back story, my girlfriend and I started dating during a pretty rough period in my life, parents divorce, rough break up, etc. When we met everything felt right and I was happier than I ever had been with anyone that I dated, we got along really well, we had a very active sex life and I felt safe which was something I hadn't felt for a long time with my ex. After our ""honeymoon"" phase things kind of got ugly quickly. I started to suffer from serious depression, had trouble controlling my drinking, and watched as all the ""friends"" I have made just abandoned me. Looking back I know that those were all interconnected but that isn't why I am here. When we first started dating my gf was working regularly as a stripper and that is actually part of what made me like her, in my innocence in naivety I let her have a sugar daddy as she had told me stories of her friends who had them with no sex involved so I thought nothing of it. A few weeks after she started seeing him they, predictably, had sex and for me that crossed the line. After a few days of hollowness I decided it wasn't healthy to be with her and decided that the best thing to do was breakup with her. This is when I really saw who she was, the day I attempted to break up with her I learned of all her mental issues, including ""dissociative seizures"" where she just passes out due to mental stress, and at the time without my knowledge, physical stress from abusing adderall. Well after dealing with her seizure you can safely assume that I felt an obligation to make sure she was safe and I decided to try and work things out, she stopped seeing her sugar daddy and we spent more time together. During this time I was not the best boyfriend I should have been, but I never cheated, I never physically abused her, and I tried to avoid doing anything that would cause mental trauma.

Well for a while I was content with her but I felt like she wouldn't be there when I needed and always considered breaking up with her. Then came the night I got arrested for D.U.I. that was my rock bottom point. I know I am going to be criticized for it and that is fine but I ask you to look at in the context of I couldn't deal with my issues, couldn't control my drinking, and wanted to kill myself. As I was pulled over for speeding then arrested it is safe to say I could have done much worse, but that night caused me to try to put my life in order. I confronted my parents about all the issues they help cause in my life (more than there divorce but a pretty messed up childhood), got my drinking under control (two-beer queer anymore), and start exercising, and try to bring myself up from where I was.

After this series of events, my gf really came through she was supportive the entire time and helped me get back on track. For about the past year things have been great, we moved in together, and for a while I was truly happy. 

But around June things went pretty sour, pretty fast. I started working at a company that treats me like shit, underpays me even though I work more than most of my colleagues, with a few notable exceptions. Expects me to work from home, bring in my own supplies without getting reimbursed, and will not supply things to get my job done while lecturing me about how important everything is and that it needs done right then and there. Because of this, I unfortunately carried the stress of my work home with me, add that on top of not being able to afford my bills and shit always needing replaced. Well, my gf was tolerant, but I clearly needed to get better at handling stress. A few months went by and we worked through everything, when one day we were having a conversation about ""open-relationships"" and thought it would be fun to experiment so we both agreed to it, and I had the stipulation that I was ok with it as long as we were open and honest about it, i.e. I wanted to know when she did something. Well from that point on, things got kind of weird, she started an internship and we would go out drinking and dancing every Friday, but then she would start to bail on me while we were out to dance with other people, and nobody would dance with me. This became a regular occurrence and it really hurt. So I told her how I felt and she said ""she just wanted space to dance by herself"" but she never danced ""by herself."" It got to a point where we would go out with couple friends and she would act like I was not even there and I would get fed up and just leave. Then our ""Friday nights"" turned into her staying late at work with a guy that she became interested (~30, married, kids, etc.) and this went on, for months. Stopped talking to me, never wanted to do anything with me, lack of sex. Then one day she came home with a hickey and seeing as we agreed to tell eachother everything I was pissed, because she lied and said she hit her chin. It took me getting her drunk to find out where it  was from, she told me the story and honestly, I was fine with it from then on. I eventually met the guy and I actually like him. But still she continued to ditch me, then one night when I had to work the next morning her and a friend went out and she met her next FWB. This is where most of our issues stem from. She never told me anything, not even if she would be home. I had to find out she was home by looking in the bathroom for her retainer. When I would try to cuddle with her she would push me away, she never put down her phone to talk to me. It felt like I was not even there. This triggered my depression to the point that had I was seriously considering killing myself. There is actually a whole week+ that I did not see or hear from her. I should also mention that I have no reliable friends to see or anyone that acts like they care about me. So during this time I felt completely alone, isolated, and trapped. I kept telling her how I felt and she kept saying it wasn't that bad. Eventually her FWB and her called it off because he was against anything sexual. But not until I made the awful idea of going through her facebook messages and finding the extent of it. They spent weeks talking about how I was in there way and so on before they decided to just be friends. However, even though they called it off I still never saw her, she befriended his group of friends and ditched me, and him for them. She continued not talking to me or spending time with me for weeks. I lost control and went through her messages again, and found something that tore my heart out. As she talked to her female friend, I read ""I wish Spoonie would just stop trying to spend with our group."" They invited me out, once, and the entire time they acted like I didn't belong. I will admit I can be shy/awkward at times, but I am not an unfriendly or unenjoyable person if I am actually welcomed into conversation as my few close friends can attest to. Well I said something and she just shrugged it off. Well about a month ago I met a nice girl who wanted to be friends, didn't mind FWB and knew full well that I have a gf. After talking to this girl, primarily about my gf, my gf flipped shit and said I can't talk to her anymore. I told her I would, but it was a lie, in my mind I have too hard a time keeping friends and I met someone who likes talking to me, who I can vent to about my problems, so I haven't stopped talking. But talking to my friend, made me open up to myself about a lot of my problems, and one night I actually confronted my gf about them all. Told her flat I wasn't happy with her, our sex life, or my life, but before we could continue, she had a seizure. And that ended that. Since then I haven't really had anything to say to her, she acts like nothing is wrong but does not get off her phone, or have a meaningful conversation with me. 

So yesterday, I made the mistake of going through her messages again, and I know it is a violation of trust. But I found a trail of messages weeks old with another guy about how they want each other, heart, body, and soul. I was livid, I confronted her, and apparently it was a running joke between her, her female friend, and that entire group of friends. She has been talking to the guy for weeks non stop and it was all to play a mind game or a ""test"". I know I violated her trust, and I knew full well that it was when I did it, I feel no remorse. But I feel disgusted that she spent weeks creating this rather than just talking to me. 

As I just learned of the game last night while she is in NYC with her friends I am having a hard time reconciling my emotions. I realize I should not have gone through her messages, but I felt like I had no choice as she wouldn't talk to me. I am disgusted because I am a laughing stock with all of her friends, and I am disgusted with her. right now I feel like this is the last straw, but I have nowhere to go. Being ditched, abandoned, lied to, manipulated etc... I have not been this upset by anything ever before. I don't think I can love the girl anymore but I am unsure as to what to do, that's why I came here.

Any advice, comments, criticism are welcomed, I know where my short comings are and I do try to work around them but sometimes it is unavoidable. I am just tired of being a recurring joke with people and I just go out of my way to be a nice guy. I am starting to think that is what lets people think they can walk all over me.

Thanks in advance.

tl.dr.:Dating a stripper, who hits, lies, manipulates and humiliates me in front of her friends. Looking for advice."

1ujita,2,2014-01-06,[27/M] Need help making sense of my feelings over my ex [26/F] that I broke up with,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ujita/27m_need_help_making_sense_of_my_feelings_over_my/,"So I dated this girl for about 2.5 years and we had a pretty good time. Most of the relationship was semi long distance as I was in school and we met through work over the summer. We would spend most the weekends together and during the summer more time. We eventually broke up because I had an internship in the Virgin Island and chose that over trying to find an internship in NYC for the summer. She was my first girlfriend and I think I was just nervous about it getting really serious because I haven’t had any other experience. While she was very pretty her body wasn’t really my type but we still had a decent sex life but I was never head over heels it felt like for her. 

   We continued to talk basically for 4-6 months after we broke up, throughout the summer, and I didn’t see anyone and I’m pretty sure she didn’t. Finally after getting back to school I made the decision to say we have to stop talking because the whole reason we broke up was because of the distance and how I felt I needed more experience before settling. I never told her but I thought of marriage and children with her many times. She told me during the break up that she thought I was the one and how she imagined having kids and stuff with me. So we stopped talking it was hard but I felt free which at the time felt good. But about 2 months ago I saw looked at her facebook, I had blocked stories as not to remind me feeling that would make it harder, and saw that she had a BF maybe of couple months. I am mad at myself for being upset because I was the one that force her to move on and now I’m all bent out of shape over it. She wasn’t posting anything to crazy on FB but when I looked at her Instagram there was several pictures of her and him in her apt together. The one thing that really got me was looking at her twitter (which she knows I don’t use) was wishing a happy birthday to “the sweetest guy I know.” 

Since then I have been super depressed. She sent me a few random fb messages about random happenings with old coworkers and stuff nothing big. I broke down and gchatted her because I was super depressed one day and shot the shit for about an hour which was nice but untimely made me feel worse. I just got a job in NYC and she gchatted me about it asking about it and stuff which was nice. I also texted her on Christmas which led to us chatting for about 3 hours via text. So we’ve talked but always makes me feel worse after and she has always said how she tries to stay friends with her exs after they breakup. She also told me during the break up once she’s over someone she’s over it and has never gone back to an ex. 

I hung out with another girl for a little bit who was pretty attractive but I kept comparing her to my ex and even though I was way more attracted sexually to the new girl there was many times I just wished I was in bed with my ex. 

 I have been feeling super stressed out and depressed about the whole situation and can’t figure out if these feelings really just about how much i truly love her or if it’s about wanting something familiar and comforting in a huge transition moving to a new place, finding an apartment and starting a career .
I want to ask her to get to coffee when I get into the city but not sure if that’s a good idea. I have a huge fear that she will either be completely moved on and not love me anymore or hasn’t moved on and somehow some way we get back together and I remember why I broke up in the first place and then ruin her life because she came back to me only to be heartbroken again. 
Please help me make sense of these feelings I haven’t been able to sleep for the past 2 months and wake up every morning with the thought of her in my head and it just kills me. Sorry for the huge post but thought there was a lot of relevant details.


EDIT: The past view nights I've been having really horrific dreams about everything and haven't been able to sleep more than a couple hours a night. It's gotten to the point where the moment I wake I feel sick to my stomach and mind just begins to race with no happy thoughts. What can I do to cope with all of this?"

I started work here in Dallas while she was finishing up an internship. We are both Chinese, but I am Chinese-American and have my citizenship here in the USA. She, on the other hand, doesn't. We are both college graduates with undergraduate degrees.

In the middle of this month, she is leaving for China because she needs to get into graduate school in order to stay in the US and she has not gotten into any schools yet. She is looking to apply so she can attend middle of 2015. This means we will have around 7000 miles between us for a year and a half.

We both met in Chicago and we've been dating for two years. Once we graduated, I moved down south because I got a job. So I will probably be here for awhile. The 3 months we've been apart in separate states have not been any problem whatsoever.

She came to visit for a week, and she is going back tomorrow morning. She gets to Chicago, stays for a week, and then it's off to China.

It sucks, thinking that tomorrow morning will be the last time I see her in...however long it is about to be. I think the most helpless thing about this situation is that we don't even know if she will be able to get back into the country (if grad schools don't work out). And if she gets back into the states through a school, most likely, it will not be in Dallas.

Any advice? What kind of mindset should I work to have? Thank you so much."

I'm not looking for a workout routine, but rather I want to start the new year off with a new athletic goal, and I kind of want to go big. However, I'm not sure what kind of competition, or event I am looking for.

A little background about me:

- I was a varsity athlete in HS in football (WR, DB), track &amp; field (sprints), swimming (sprints), lacrosse (defense), and basketball (PG).

- I walked on to my university's track &amp; field team last year and competed for one year, only to have the program cancelled by the school at the end of spring semester.

- I've never formally trained for any long-distance running, but once as a sophomore in HS I ran a 10:10 2-mile and that same season I ran a 2:00 800m, so I think I have the ability to run long-distance.

- I squated 405lbs once. Idk if that is helpful, but it was during the end of my offseason for my one season of collegiate running.

Ask me any questions you have, and I would love some suggestions from fittit about what kind of competition, or athletic event I should make the goal for my training this year. Thanks!"
1ukvp5,1,2014-01-06,10-year-old dog has lost most of his teeth while I was away at college. My mom gets defensive whenever I bring it up to her. Help. What do I do?,[deleted],dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ukvp5/10yearold_dog_has_lost_most_of_his_teeth_while_i/,"Some background: 

Before my younger sister and I went off to college (I'm a sophomore, she's a freshman), we took care of our dog. Our mom helped out whenever my younger sister didn't. My youngest sister, who's still in high school, didn't help out too often.

Anyways, that responsibility shifted to my mother and my youngest sister when we left. I'm almost never home because of internships. 

When we came home for Thanksgiving break, we noticed that our 10-year-old dog had lost a lot of his teeth. We expressed immediate concern to our mother, who was immediately defensive. She said he would be fine. My sister and I still pushed her to take the dog to the vet, to which to she responded that she couldn't afford it. When I brought up further concerns she shut down and told me to pay for it. I told her that I would, but that I was using my internship money for food, room and board, etc. After a while, she said she would borrow money from some family members. I told her I would chip in.

Come Christmas time, and she had done none of that, despite telling me she would take care of it. When I asked her why she hadn't, she told me that work took up too much time, as did dealing with the house going under water, trying to break back into the industry she worked in before she had us, and her debt. Again, I offered to pay for a checkup, gave her the money in cash, but she gave it back to me and told me not to worry about it.

Well, I'm fucking worrying about it and I have been since I first saw what happened. Maybe I'm being harsh on my mother; I understand the immense amount stress that she's under; it really fucking saddens me. But I'm also seriously concerned about the health of my dog. I'm pretty sure he has periodontal disease. Because I'm not home often, I just don't have control over the situation; but I will be home again this Thursday. What do I do?    "

1ukz9h,5,2014-01-06,Why college athletes aren't or shouldn't be paid.,[deleted],Destiny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1ukz9h/why_college_athletes_arent_or_shouldnt_be_paid/,"To be honest, I don't agree with this. I'm playing Devil's Advocate here, that said Destiny is ignoring tonnes of issues and other relevant information (mostly because no one is presenting it to him).

So here.

Keep in mind these aren't the reasons that they *aren't actually* paid. Those would be things like, they have no choice, and as you said if they tried to form a union or something they *would* get fucked. 

1. Don't rage. Promise not to rage and not to just close this post. They do get free tuition. These are kids with a skill that would be worth absolutely nothing in any situation other than the very specific situation they are in. And college tuition is fucking expensive. Come on like 40 grand a year is not bad for a semi-pro or amateur student athlete.

2. They do get paid. Sometimes. http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/college-football/news/20130920/arian-foster-documentary-comments-about-being-paid-at-tennessee/ 
Read the big ass quite in gray, you'll thank me because its on your side. I'm not saying he shouldn't have been paid, I am saying that the paying of players does happen under the table sometimes. Also I understand those are tacos. But let's not be so naive as to think absolutely no one in this situation is capable of negotiating (or has someone to negotiate for them).

3. What exactly would you pay them? (this part is long as fuck, its everything up until ""Last Note"") I have no fucking clue how many people are on a football team so I'll google it. Its like 90-120! Apparently the most allowed to practice before classes (so allowed to be on campus for college pre season practices I guess) is 90. 

Some reverse engineering thinking. You mentioned how few college players actually become millionaire pro players, very correctly calling this 4 year time and physical body investment not at all guaranteed. So turn it backwards, of the millionaire pro players and star quarter backs, how many more are there that didn't make it all the way to the top. Cause that number is how many you have to pay. I know college football is fairly popular, but its not pro football popular is it? Anytime you find yourself saying that most of the people that did this for free didn't make it to the land of the salaried, remember that ratio is also the backwards ratio of how many more people you're saying should get paid.

Here's an article on this subject, http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1684452-if-college-football-were-paying-players-how-many-programs-could-afford-it, basically discussing how much players could get paid (if everyone on the roster were paid evenly) based on that school's athletic income. It contains some good notes about both sides of the argument. Its worth noting that I'm not sure what this athletic division of the school income number means, does the coach's income come after or before this? Bonuses? Incentives?  all this information is based off of limited financials, not everything is disclosed to the public). anyways, 
""First, the entire power structure in college football would be turned on its head if say Kansas State could sign players with fat $200,000 contracts, while in-state rival Kansas offered potential recruits a mere $25,000 per year."" This is undoubtedly true to some extent no?

(It has been a while so I'll remind you this is me putting forth small examples of devil's advocate arguments, these aren't fully researched and I personally side roughly where you stand on this).

Last Note: Its so much more complicated than you make it out to be on stream. Its not as simple as just pay everyone. From the same article, ""At the end of the day it’s clear that even if we could agree on the concept of financially compensating players, the effect of actually paying them would go way beyond cancelling out amateurism and negating the ideal of the student-athlete.""
Now you're wondering why I quoted that even though its what I just wrote repeated. Because I'm not a real source on any of this, I don't play pro ball or college ball. And neither do you. And neither does 90% of the population that talks about this issue. What we do know for sure is that the people who are capable of playing college ball, play college ball.

Thats all I got. Remember I don't find these arguments wholly convincing, I'm just saying you're the only one with the soapbox on destiny.gg and that has the effect of bolstering your arguments, so I figured someone should summarize a few of these real quick.

Also If you think unpaid internships are ok, thats a whole nother thing. That one is actual bullshit too, I think athletes should get paid in college with some stipulations, but I actually disagree with the notion that unpaid internships are ok."

I have a history of depression and anxiety. I have a few friends, but my low grade depression makes me feel distanced from them, even when they try to reach out to me. 

Right now, I am pretty much unemployed, broke, and have nothing. I have trouble making friends and meeting new people, even when they try to talk to me first. My antidepressants and many therapy sessions have very limited success for me. My broken family is full of undersuccessful people who aren't going to help me find a job at all, when 80% of the people I know have either family connections or close friend connections get them into a job. My family is actually so ignorant and negative to me, they held me back from being successful by talking shit to me since I was a kid and not helping me out, and they don't even need to go out of their way. Like really, for example, they are going to work and I need a ride to a place that is literally on the way to their work place, and they need to make a 30 second stop, but I don't even get help.

 I try to put on a smile and be as positive as I can when I go about my day and job hunt, but I don't think I can do this any longer.

1uljhu,80,2014-01-06,I bought a pair of CAT Abes in college. That was two years ago.

A truly great-quality boot for not a lot of money.

I bought a pair of [Caterpillar Abes](http://www.amazon.com/Caterpillar-Abe-Mens-Boot/dp/B003EYVVOI) when I was in college. They were on sale for around $100 and I thought they looked like some decent boots for my intern's budget. You can still get them on Amazon in certain sizes for around $120.

Anyway, that was two years ago now including a year of almost daily wear. While I have since bought 1k's, a couple Chippewa's, and some AE Daltons to alternate, they still remain in my wardrobe today.

These boots take a lot of guff around /r/frugalmalefashion and especially /r/malefashionadvice. I've personally grown to love these boots and they've aged / held-up pretty well.

If you're on a budget, give these a chance. I get compliments almost every time I wear them.

As a disclaimer, I just put these laces on the boots recently. I plan on staining them to be darker and match the tones of the boots. I noted this in the album. Of course I am open to constructive criticism!!"

1ulo5d,31,2014-01-07,This is my story of how I learned the harsh truth about the mental health system,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ulo5d/this_is_my_story_of_how_i_learned_the_harsh_truth/,"In case anyone goes to read the only other post I've made with this account, here is a brief summary so we can get to the point of this post: Things in life are still tough for me, but they are slowly getting better, also my boyfriend and I broke up early last year, but we still see each-other from time to time.

The story starts with the past few nights, in which I had been having another depressive spree, where I was feeling extremely depressed, and suicidal thoughts began running through my mind. My ex had been spending some time over, but he was way too involved with video games to notice I was feeling depressed, so I told him out right, since we agreed to be each other’s support for our problems. 
That night though he was completely disinterested, and sat by me for about 4 minutes saying they usual ""oh its ok, you're a good person things will be fine"", and then went back to playing video games. I laid there for a few minutes continuing to feel completely unloved and unwanted, until I got up and walked off to the bathroom. Please note that the computer he was playing games on was in the same room as the bed, so he was fully well aware I had gotten up and left the room.
Once I was in the bathroom I was completely over taken by grief, and having finally broken the skin while trying to cut myself the night before, I grabbed my scissors sitting in front of the mirror and hopped for the luck of slicing a vein as I ran them back and forth across my wrist. As trickles of blood began to run from my wrist I remembered that I wanted to say my good byes to my loved ones before I died, and seeing as I might actually succeed in a few moments I might as well do that now. I whipped out my phone and wrote up a few texts to my closet friends, and saved a draft on my phone for my ex in the other room, knowing that if I actually sent it to him he might come intervene.

My phone began to ring with friend A and C trying to call me, but I was too far mentally gone to do anything other than silence their calls with voice mail. Then just as I had finished running the scissors across the full length of my wrist I heard my Ex’s phone ring. It was friend A (who it is important to note despises my Ex), and she was calling to see if my Ex could go home if he wasn’t and to check on me. My Ex then came to the bathroom, and I was sitting on the bathroom chair trying to finish my draft to him, completely unable to look him in the eye. He said to me “A just called and said you sent her a text, what did it say”? I held my phone out to him and showed him the text I sent her. After talking to me for a minute and checking my cuts to make sure they weren’t too sever he helped me back to bed and went online to find a suicide hotline.

I remember speaking to this person who truly knew nothing about me, but instead merely tried to latch onto the first semi positive thing I said to her (which was about my having recently graduate). She continued fixating on it while going along with the most rehearsed script I had ever heard “I want to hear you say you won’t try cutting yourself again tonight” she said as I was getting ready to end the call that was only frustrating me further. I didn’t want someone who knew nothing about my struggle telling me things would be fine after a minute of talking “I won’t try to cut myself TONIGHT” I responded, knowing that cutting myself wasn't going to work in the long run anyway.

After the call I really didn’t feel any better, so my Ex convinced me to go out with him for a bit to McDonalds, thinking the fresh air might do me some good. I drove us there and we ordered some food, but while waiting in line my Ex got another call from friend B, who was completely panicked, as she had received my text and then a call from A letting her know what had happened at that point. I wanted to focus on my sandwich at that point so I told my Ex to let B know I would call her when I got home in 10ish minutes.

When we got home my Ex told me to call her right away, and when I did she still seemed a little upset. I told her I didn’t mean to upset her, and never would of bothered texting her if I didn’t honestly think I was going to go through with it. She talked with me for a little while I drew a bath, hoping something could pull me out of this. Once the bath was ready I told her I wanted to soak for a bit and I might call her again later. At that point she asked for me to give my phone back to my ex who was in the next room skyping with a few people, and I went to soak in the tub.

I had been laying in the water for a few minutes when my Ex walked in and told me B said if I went to the hospital, it wouldn’t cost me anything and they could help me tonight. Seeing as I wanted my friends to be at peace, and hoping I could speak with an actual therapist and get a prescription that might pull me out of this and then go home the same night I agreed, but asked him to come with me there. He agreed, but wanted to know how he could get back to the apartment if I was going to end up being there over night, at which point I told him I could give him some cash for a cab.

I drove to the hospital a few blocks away and we entered the ER (as it was the only thing open at 9pm). At this point I was too upset to think clearly, so I asked my Ex to explain why I was coming in that night. It was at this point my fate was sealed by the poor choice of words, as never before that did I realized “he’s feeling suicidaly depressed” were the secret words that would imprison me to suffering more than ever before.

As we sat in the waiting room my Ex texted a few people while holding my hand, and a few minutes later they called me to the screening room. As I walked in the door and was about to sit down my Ex asked me for cab fare so he could get home. I remember feeling my heart sink into my stomach, as I was feeling like I didn’t matter to anyone in the world, and my Ex, the one person I thought who genuinely cared, couldn’t wait even 5 seconds to be the hell away from me. So I gave him the money and he called a cab to get back to the apartment.
At this point I was finally destroyed, I didn’t care. Completely empty I followed the nurses orders as they sat me in a bed in the hallway. I sat there for almost an hour just staring at the floor while doctors and nurses walked past me, then I saw a familiar and panicked face. It was friend C (who is friend A’s boyfriend) and he had managed to get past security because he was an EMT. He told me friend A said where I would likely be, and that my grandmother and younger brother were in the waiting room. He stayed for a few minutes, but I knew he had been working all day so I told him he didn’t have to stay and that I would be fine.

My grandmother and brother came back to check on me, and stayed talking with me for a bit which was actually making me feel slightly better. Somehow hours had passed and it had gone from 9pm check in to 1:30 am the next day with no doctor giving me any help or information about what was going on. Finally my grandmother was able to get an answer from someone who told her that didn’t have any psych wards at that hospital and were waiting to have me accepted at another hospital. It was at that point that they enlightened me to information that would have been helpful before that point, the fact that I was not allowed to leave by law until I had seen a doctor and been evaluated. We tried arguing the point, but I had to accept that they had all my belonging locked away because they had me change into a gown, and they were completely in charge of how this would play out. Finally at 2:30am EMTs arrived to take me to the new hospital, where I was told I would get to see my doctor in the morning and then they would do the evaluation.

When I arrived at the psych ward at the new hospital I explained my situation, and mentioned that I had an internship position that I was supposed to be starting Monday morning so I would need to be out well before that so I could make sure I’d have everything in order in time. The intake nurse told me I would need to speak to the doctor in the morning, all while another nurse went through my belongings that had been brought along, writing each and every item on a sheet of paper. I was told I would be able to hold onto my t-shirt and pants, but nothing else, not even my shoes, then I was forced to strip in front of a security guard so they could check me for contraband.
It was at this point that I began to feel as though something was amiss. I had come to one hospital just so I could talk to someone, and now I’m being held against my will and treated like a mixture of a prisoner and a complete mental case. Was this really the case? Was I going to be held here because I wanted someone to talk to for help…was I being punished for asking for help?

I was led to a room with nothing in it aside from a night stand with the drawers removed and picture or mirror frames with nothing in them. I was told the Tv room would open at 6, and breakfast was at 8. So I lay in bed, alone, afraid, still upset and now feeling completely trapped in a strange environment.

After an hour or so of sleep I was woken up for a blood draw and breakfast, which I nibbled on slightly as I was never much of a breakfast kind of guy anyway. After breakfast I wanted to know what things were looking like for my discharge, so I asked one of the nurses when I would be seeing my doctor, at which point I was told they we’re unsure, since the doctors have to see a lot of patients, and I might not get to see him today.  This was rather upsetting, as they had made it clear the only way I could leave was if I had seen my doctor, and with my internship starting in less that 48hours I needed to be out. I told them I had just come to the hospital so I could have someone to talk to for a bit, and they let me speak with a  social worker. I talked with her for about 15 minutes and she took notes, and she said she understood my situation, that she knew what it felt like to be ignored by someone you love, but it sounds like I was a lot more coherent than most of the people who came there, and that I was moving in a good direction with my life.

She then let me go back to the tv room where I sat with a Sudoku book and a 300 piece puzzle. At first I had hop “I’ll see the doctor, explain everything and get home in time”, I thought to myself as I worked on my puzzle. As I completed 4 sudoku puzzles and laid down nearly 100 pieces of the jigsaw puzzle I began to worry more about when I would see the doctor, lunch was coming and I had yet to see him. It was at lunch that one of the other patients told me some very unsettling news, the fact that this hospital have a five day evaluation period after seeing your doctor. I felt something inside me snap. Why had no one told me I would be here that long, and if I had come here voluntarily why couldn’t I leave just the same. I was distraught, and barely able to keep myself together.

After lunch I sat and halfheartedly tried to work on my puzzle when I heard the social worker call me aside. I assumed she was going to do some sort of test or make me aware of some rule I hadn’t known of but instead she lead me to my room in a hushed manner and closed the door and whispered to me that she knew it was unlikely that I would be let out in time normally, but that she understood what had really happened to me, and knew I needed to be out of this place. I knew what she was doing was a personal act of kindness and compassion that I will never forget, as she coached me on exactly what to say and do until after I had seen the doctor, just so I could stand a chance of getting out of there. I knew that if anyone else found out her job would have been at risk, so while it killed me I knew I could never truly thank her for her kindness.

So I returned to my puzzle and smiled and joked around with the other patients, as luckily my years of theater had trained me how to act away from my feelings, and the only way I was getting freedom was if I could convince everyone I was no longer depressed at all. This façade worked just fine through dinner and the movie that followed (I had never seen all of super bad before that, and sadly dinner and tv time cut off the first and last portion of the movie). I calmly went to bed certain that I would see my doctor in the morning and could get everything sorted…at least that was the plan.

As I lay in my room with nothing beside a half completed Sudoku book I couldn’t help but return to my tormenting thoughts, which had all been converted to my hatred of this place. What if I didn’t see the doctor tomorrow? What if I did but couldn’t convince him I was fine. If either of those occurred I would lose the internship I had spent so long searching for, my one chance in god knows how long to turn my life around. Here I was filled with anxiety, and I could do nothing about it, I tried talking to one of the nurses who just told me there was a chance that I might not be able to see my doctor the next day, and that the normal minimum stay was 5 days, so it was almost certain that I would be missing my internship.
It was all I could do to hold back tears or expressions of my grief at this point. This place was hell enough, but it was a hell I was completely alone in, as the most outside contact I had gotten was a call from my grandmother. Not a single one of my friends called or visited, I was alone. Feeling grief stricken I asked a nurse when the doctor would be in tomorrow, but the nurse standing before me wasn’t an messenger of goodwill, but rather a sentry that upon detecting my anxiety would report it to the doctor sealing my fate. How could it be that I wanted help, and instead was in a situation that was only creating new problems. Knowing I had no other way of avoiding a major breakdown I asked the nurse if I could have a sleeping pill, which she got me and I took. Having taken pills at home I knew it would be a while before it kicked in, so I went to the bathroom and silently as I could let out a good sob over the situation, knowing that my hope that I had been holding on to was being taken away from me. Finally, filled with anxiety I fell asleep.

The next day I told them I was still full from the snack last night when they came around to wake us for breakfast. I used this time to get more sleep, as the later I woke up the less time I would have to act before the doctor saw me, meaning I could keep things together better. It was an hour or so later that I was woken and told I was being transferred to another wing in the psych ward. Knowing I had no say in the matter I complied completely and was brought to my new room, which by the greatest of luck had its own bathroom with a shower that I could hide in to vent about things.

I knew hiding in my room wouldn’t get me out though, so I went to the tv room to act like this was no big deal what so ever. I sat and watched some law and order for a bit when an activity director came by to ask me if I wanted to join the art group. Having worked in a retirement home in the past I knew this game far too well, and saw it as a chance to score some extra points toward getting out. The director sat us down and told us what we would all be doing “just express things we can control and things we can’t”. I thought to myself “you’ve already lost this round bitch” and I reached for the most brightly colored pencils, quickly drawing two sketches of my hand with the words “my emotions, my actions toward others, my feelings and my education” on each of the fingers. On the other hand I wrote about outside forces.

But that wasn’t the game winning move for me, that picture had only taken 5 minutes, and we had a full 20. Quickly I flipped over the paper and began to sketch a scene I had drawn many times before so I knew it would be easy to pull off without too much effort. It was a simple drawing of a table with a tea cup resting in front of a lake with a brightly colored sailboat in it. Not a single dark color filled my page as I colored everything with bright blues, yellows and greens. At the end we all presented our drawings, and I coyly played off the master piece I had drawn by instead showing the first thing I had drawn. I knew if I showed her the picture right away it wouldn’t feel genuine, so I waited for those words “I saw you drawing something on the other side, can you show us that”? I flipped the paper around and explained the scene, fully well aware she would report my current state to the doctor I would be seeing, and this was a huge push for my freedom.
After art I went to my room and took a shower. I had always loved the feeling of warm running water at home, but here it was the only escape I could truly feel from this nightmare. I returned to the T.V. Room and at about 2pm the moment of fate took place; the nurse came to tell me the doctor wanted to see me now. When I would go on stage and felt nervous I usually had a few minutes to shake loose or talk to myself to distress before the performance, but not this time, this time I needed to come in hiding my worry that I might be trapped, my resentment for being held against my will, my outrage at being treated like a lunatic, and my disgust at the fact that when I came asking for help, they made me wait nearly 2 days just to talk to someone.

I sat in front of the doctor and remembered what I had been told by the social and began my final performance. I calmly explained to him that I hadn’t really tried to kill myself, but was just upset and that my Ex had just told the check-in nurse that I was suicidal. I continued by telling him I wasn’t feeling depressed at all anymore, and that I was hoping to be out in time for my internship that started the next day, as it was a paid internship, and missing it would mean missing my only source of income. 

It might have been no longer than 2 seconds before the doctor stated his rebuttal, but that time felt like an eternity. If I had said too much I would seem eager to leave and I would be treated like a high elopement risk for the next few days which might mean I would be literally locked in a room. If I said too little my case would seem weak. Finally he spoke, and said he could discharge me that day with a prescription and the number to follow up with for therapy. I thanked him and said I would get a ride to get home.

A short while later I returned home and was able to prepare for my internship the next day, but discovered something about having been in that place…I now felt trapped anytime I was anywhere enclosed. My Ex came to spend the night with me because of the fact I was still upset, but as we cuddled that night I had a sudden panic attack. As his arms were wrapped around me I became more and more anxiety laden, constantly feeling as those his arm were trapping me and keeping me prisoner. I had to push him away eventually and get up for some fresh air, before finally being able to fall asleep.

What had all of this gotten me? Did it get me help? Most certainly not. Certainly I was given prescriptions and someone I could talk to in the future, but my already lacking trust in doctors was even more shattered now, and what’s worse I had now developed new phobias. How is it that one goes for help, but instead come back with more issues than they left with, and are forced to lie their way to freedom? How is it that a man of health can care so little about his fellow man that he cares more about what procedures say that whether or not the man is actually better.

 I plan to take the medicine for now and see the doctor if I can manage the strength to go back to that hell hole for even a few minutes, but until now I had never realized how bad our mental health system truly was. How its blanket procedures were extremely ineffective in many cases, either being too strict or lenient at varying times.

I just wanted to feel better, but now I worry about others knowing I’m not.

I need help, every day is getting longer and longer and i still have so long to go

Although I have made strides over the past few years, it is soo frustrating. When Im feeling my best, I am just dealing with some generalized anxiety, when I am feeling bad I am having panic attacks and feeling like I am going crazy. It is just a never ending roller coaster, a fine line of not having panic attacks, and living life normally.

I've picked through some local classifieds and found a few that match my needs/budget. I haven't had the chance to go out and actually look them over yet, I fully intend to but until I do I wanted to ask for some opinions on the three that I am most interested in:

1. 2003 VW Passat 1.8L Turbo (I believe it's the GL model), manual, 137k miles for $2900 ([Edmunds page](http://www.edmunds.com/volkswagen/passat/2003/?style=100161574))
2. 2001 Mazda Protege LX (No idea if it's 1.6L or 2.0L), automatic, 128k miles for $2900 ([Edmunds page](http://www.edmunds.com/mazda/protege/2001/?style=100001455#specs-diff))
3. 2003 Ford Taurus SES 3.0L V6, automatic, 169k miles for $2100 ([Edmunds page](http://www.edmunds.com/ford/taurus/2003/?style=100080651))

I'm heavily leaning towards the Passat (I have a bad habit of picking favorites pretty quickly and having a hard time changing my mind) but looking around on the web they all seem to have their own pros and cons and there's no clear stand out. Can I get some advice on which to pick (assuming they all run fine, I know that's not likely the case but until I go check them out that's the assumption I'm working off of)? Any previous owners that would like to share their experiences or mechanically-inclined Redditors that would lean one way or another? Please help! And thanks!

Some other info that might help:

* 20yo bachelor university student, don't need a huge amount of space or anything.
* Haven't had a chance to learn to drive a manual, but I've got a few good buddies who all drive manuals and are willing to teach me.
* Like I said, the car is for commuting to an internship (13 miles one way). Additionally, it'll be used for some around-town driving to friends' places or stores.

That's pretty much it, don't need anything too special but I also don't want to buy a lemon that'll die on me soon after purchasing.

Thanks again!"

1umtb7,9,2014-01-07,Is he (26/m) in it for himself or is he in it for me (24/f)?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1umtb7/is_he_26m_in_it_for_himself_or_is_he_in_it_for_me/,"I'm going to try to make this as short and sweet as I possibly can.

In 2007, I met a guy at school who shook me up. I had just got out of a long, serious relationship nearly a year prior and this was refreshing. We connected instantly and became very, very close friends. It was a flirtatious friendship but we were never physical with each other. We enjoyed each others company. Very platonic and very sweet. He was working as an intern in a 6 month program and left at the end of it. We exchanged numbers and kept in touch periodically.

In 2011, he added me on Facebook (damn, Facebook) and started liking/commenting on all of my pictures/statuses. Social media flirting, IMO. He called me cute and asked if we could Skype. It built up from there. He was in the area, we hang out. Again, not physical. But during this time, we opened up with each other. I started talking to him about my religion and he was in shock. Turns out we're of the same religion (we didn't discuss faith prior). That's a big deal to him. He's not a religious person himself. He's young and still wants to experience life outside of his beliefs. It's a strict lifestyle. That I can understand. However, his family is very, very strict religiously and would literally disown him if he doesn't marry within his faith. My family is not my faith but I would prefer marrying within. Anyway, I think marrying within is more serious to him as it is to me, even though I'm more devout right now.

During our friendship, it became obvious to me that he was really into me. He talked to me regularly and was very caring. He gave me a lot of attention and we talked for a very long time. Every day. Most of the day. I did notice this connection before my beliefs were broadcasted to him, but it definitely intensified. I didn't find that to be too odd. We have a strong aspect of our lives in common. It kinda makes sense. 

I asked him why we can't get into a LDR if we click so well. He agreed that he would really love to be with me, but he emotionally cannot handle LDR. The only way he would want this is if there is an end date in mind. On my part. If I would consider moving there. I said I would, if we were in a committed relationship. He seems to want to do things the other way around. We stopped talking in a romantic sense and moved to staying friends because of our differences in what a relationship should consist of. He was doing things I really didn't approve of in a partner. Drinking, LSD, Pot. I get that it's something people do, but for a relationship, I want none of it. We discussed this thoroughly and he made it clear to me that if we were to get serious he would drop these things in a heartbeat. That his feelings for me outweighed any of that. Even when we weren't talking romantically, just as friends, he was still there for me in every way anyone ever could be.

But now he's back at it again. He has dropped all of those habits and he wants a relationship with me. When? I don't know. How? I don't know. He's coming to see me in a few weeks to discuss but it's really getting in my head. That's not how a relationship works, IMO. For me, you're supposed to have an established relationship where you're dying to be together and then you close the gap. Not move there to start a relationship, which is what he's clearly thinking. Why he would ever consider this is beyond me. He has some narcissistic tendencies. He can be selfish at times. I feel like he's in it for himself. But at the same time, I truly believe he does care about me. In a way other men haven't. 

I told him I wouldn't want to move there and just start a relationship. That makes zero sense. Especially because I can't really afford rent right now. Not in his area. I really don't want to lose him, though. When we're together and talking without all of the drama, it's amazing. I could take the risk, but how do I know if he's in it for himself or if he's in it for me?

**TL;DR** The guy I'm pretty much in love with has the wrong idea of what a LDR is and should consist of when closing the gap. "
1undq3,1,2014-01-07,"I feel like there's a conspiracy among my friends to shut me out, and I don't know how to deal with it anymore",[deleted],Needafriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1undq3/i_feel_like_theres_a_conspiracy_among_my_friends/,"I've talked to my boyfriend about this, and he's supportive, but I hate to keep bothering him with my friend problems. I feel so lonely and shut out. I'm a senior in college, and I had a friend group going back to freshman year. At first it was big, then last year there was drama, some people split from the group, and the remaining group became closer as a result. Then about half of us graduated, so now there's a a group of 6 of us. 

This is gonna get complicated but I'll try to keep it straightforward. One important detail is that I dated a guy in the group. We shared the same friends, he was a year above me, we were both friends with everyone BEFORE we started dating. I broke up with him last summer, after he had graduated, so there was no drama during the school year. My closest friend in the group at the time (I'll call her E), who also assumed the role of group leader/most important fucking person in the universe, assured me that no one would be mad at me or stop talking to me, and everyone acted normal to me when the school year started last fall. 

Another thing that happened is that I was pretty close with another girl, L. Then for reasons she never told me, she stopped wanting to be my friend. I didn't do anything wrong, I guess she just got sick of my personality. Of course, this didn't stop anyone else in the group from loving her and having her around all the time, which sucks for me cuz I hate being around her now, it just makes me mad, but the other option is to be isolated and not hang out with my friends.

Over the semester, my friends were normal and nice to me when i was around, but they would always make plans when I wasn't around and seem to forget to invite me, even though they thought to invite their other friends who had already graduated. I was away most weekends because my boyfriend lives in a different state, and the weekends were my only chance to see him. I tried really hard to spend time with my friends during the week, and sometimes they'd hang out at my invitation, but no one ever initiated. It drove me crazy, because they all knew I wanted to hang out and was free like all the time, but no one would ever think to text me and ask if I wanted to do something, yet they would make plans with each other. Looking back, it seems really obvious to me that they didn't want me around, but at the time E always reassured me that everything was fine, and they'd apologize when I confronted them about forgetting me, and they DID invite me to their weekend parties (though I wasn't usually able to go, cuz I had often already made plans by the time the parties were arranged). Also, I considered E to be pretty close, as I would talk to her when I was feeling insecure, and we got breakfast together twice a week the whole semester. The thing that started to bug me was how she was super bossy, and everyone else in the group just let her control everything and make all the decisions and played right into her being the all-powerful leader. But as much as that got on my nerves, she was still the closest friend I had.

Now winter break started, and what's really been driving me insane is that just about every day, one of them will post something funny on Facebook, and will tag everyone in the group *except me*. L does it, which pisses me off because it reminds me that she still likes everyone except me. But E also posts things and tags everyone but me, S does too, and none of them will respond to me. I asked E if she wanted to hang out over break, but she told me she was too busy working, *even on the weekends* (I'm pretty sure her government internship doesn't occur on weekends). I texted, Facebook messaged, and called S, and she's just completely ignored me. S and I used to be pretty close, and she was always super nice to me in person last semester, but now she's completely ignoring me, and she did the tagging-everyone-but-me bullshit too. What really set me over the edge today was that I called her to ask if she wanted to get coffee, and after ringing 3 times, the call ended... no voicemail, it just ended, so I know she ignored my call. 

I feel like there's this big conspiracy where all of my friends decided they don't want me to be their friend anymore, and other than breaking up with a friend of their's 7 months ago, I have no idea what I did wrong. I tried so fucking hard to spend time with them last semester, and they routinely blew me off, were too busy for me, and then went and made plans with each other that didn't include me. We've been friends for 4 years, I don't understand why they would suddenly stop liking me, unless it purely is a childish matter of ""you broke up with my friend"" (which is bullshit since, as I said, I was friends with all of them before the relationship started). And if they really don't like me anymore, I wish they would just be fucking honest with me, instead of being nice to me when I'm around and then making me think I'm going crazy. If they told me to fuck off, at least I could stop trying so damn hard to be their friend. I'm dreading going back to school, it's my last semester ever but I'm so unhappy and I just want it to be over. 

If you read this all, thanks for listening. I don't really need any advise, just a friendly word would be nice. And ""get new friends"" isn't much of an option at this point, I'm a second semester senior, but I do plan to focus my attention elsewhere and spend more time with the few friends I have outside the group, who don't constantly make me feel like shit."

Warning: This is long, and it's mostly just a rant. I don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for, I just really need to get this off my chest and to hear some kind words.


 I've talked to my boyfriend about this, and he's supportive, but I hate to keep bothering him with my friend problems. I feel so lonely and shut out. I'm a senior in college, and I had a friend group going back to freshman year. At first it was big, then last year there was drama, some people split from the group, and the remaining group became closer as a result. Then about half of us graduated, so now there's a a group of 6 of us. 


This is gonna get complicated but I'll try to keep it straightforward. One important detail is that I dated a guy in the group. We shared the same friends, he was a year above me, we were both friends with everyone BEFORE we started dating. I broke up with him last summer, after he had graduated, so there was no drama during the school year. My closest friend in the group at the time (I'll call her E), who also assumed the role of group leader/most important fucking person in the universe, assured me that no one would be mad at me or stop talking to me, and everyone acted normal to me when the school year started last fall. 


Another thing that happened is that I was pretty close with another girl, L. Then for reasons she never told me, she stopped wanting to be my friend. I didn't do anything wrong, I guess she just got sick of my personality. Of course, this didn't stop anyone else in the group from loving her and having her around all the time, which sucks for me cuz I hate being around her now, it just makes me mad, but the other option is to be isolated and not hang out with my friends.

Over the semester, my friends were normal and nice to me when i was around, but they would always make plans when I wasn't around and seem to forget to invite me, even though they thought to invite their other friends who had already graduated. I was away most weekends because my boyfriend lives in a different state, and the weekends were my only chance to see him. I tried really hard to spend time with my friends during the week, and sometimes they'd hang out at my invitation, but no one ever initiated. It drove me crazy, because they all knew I wanted to hang out and was free like all the time, but no one would ever think to text me and ask if I wanted to do something, yet they would make plans with each other. Looking back, it seems really obvious to me that they didn't want me around, but at the time E always reassured me that everything was fine, and they'd apologize when I confronted them about forgetting me, and they DID invite me to their weekend parties (though I wasn't usually able to go, cuz I had often already made plans by the time the parties were arranged).

1unot8,6,2014-01-07,I do not know what to do with my math degree.,legitphilip,whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1unot8/i_do_not_know_what_to_do_with_my_math_degree/,"Hi Reddit, this needs to find a way out.

I am currently a 4th year math student at the rather prestigious Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, looking to finish my studies in summer.

My interest in mathematics went from theoretical and mathematical physics to theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics and very recently formal languages (which could be considered theoretical linguistics). My grades weren't exactly stellar, but until summer I at least managed to pass all exams first try. I also work as a Teaching Assistant.

Now, thinking about next year, I get nervous. I genuinely don't know what I want to do then.
One thing I am rather sure about is, that I want to do a masters. 

And now the most important point is that, as you can see, my interests are broad, and although I still love mathematics, I don't want to go deeper into it. I also love physics, computer science, philosophy, history, politics, film,... I could go on and on... I have just had enough of mathematics for a while, and I want to learn other stuff now.

What can I do? I feel like I should have chosen to study Liberal Arts 4 years ago, when I had to decide what I want to do.

I will probably try to find me an internship and earn some money first. But I am afraid that I will just keep working then since it would probably be the easy choice, and I have a tendency to go for the easy choice...

It used to be my wish to stay in Zurich, but to be honest this has completely turned around. There are several options in my head. I'd love to go to the US or UK, but I don't think I'd get into the top universities, so it'd probably be a step down, plus I'd pay a lot more. But I could maybe find a program that I like better than here in Switzerland. I could also go back to Germany, where I am from, but I feel like this wouldn't really be a new experience. So... Somewhere else completely?

Yeah, that's basically what bothers me... Thanks for listening (reading)."
1unsf7,6,2014-01-07,"I need to find an auto loan to purchase a car to be able to commute to my internship, but I don't believe I have enough income to be accepted for one. Please help!",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1unsf7/i_need_to_find_an_auto_loan_to_purchase_a_car_to/,"So here's my situation: I'm a university student and recently got accepted for an internship position. The position pays $12/hr and offers 16 hours a week so it provides approximately $832/month before taxes (assuming 4 1/3 weeks per month average). My combined rent and utilities for my studio apartment is $740 due on the first of every month (January is paid off). I have $2,750 in subsidized student loans that will be disbursed sometime before the 21st which I plan to put towards all living expenses (rent, utilities, and groceries) which gives me a few months to live off of. Additionally I have just under $175 in the bank and $200 balance to pay off on my credit card which I plan to pay off using some of the student loan money. My plan was to purchase a car and live solely off of the student loans for a few months while searching for a second job, because my monthly expenses would be greater than my take-home each month with only the internship.

Here's where my problem lies: to commute to my internship and earn an income, I will need to purchase a car. There is no getting around this fact. I would bike but I can't because it's about an hour and a half away by bike, I'm pretty out of shape, and I would be unable to go when the weather gets bad (which is pretty often around these parts). There is also no viable public transportation that I could use to get there.

I've been looking at cars with an upper price limit of $3,000. I've found a few that would work great for me and even looked up insurance quotes. The total amount I would need to purchase the car and pay for 6 months worth of insurance in a lump sum is at max $3,400. I've calculated that the registration/fees/taxes on the cars I'm looking at will be about $200-$250. I plan to pay this using the remainder of the auto loan as well as with a small chunk of my student loans.

Now so far I've applied for a $3,400 auto loan at two credit unions and one has already rejected me stating that my monthly income was insufficient to accept me. They stated that they would not be able to include my student loans as income, which I can understand but I can't help but feel that it's BS. I know that considering all monthly expenses and all taxes on income, my current situation means that I'm in the red every month and so I know that as a credit union, they can't offer a loan to me and realistically expect me to be able to keep up payments. However, in order to be able to make an income, get a second job, and earn enough to be able to afford an auto loan and come out with a net profit each month, I would need a car, which would then require an auto loan! It's a Catch-22 and I don't know what to do. I was thinking that if need be, I could maybe take out some unsubsidized (I've already accepted the maximum subsidized amount) student loans to use in place of an auto loan, but I'm really not eager to get involved with unsubsidized loans. Can I get some advice?

If anything is unclear or confusing, let me know and I'll clear things up. I'm running on only a couple of hours of sleep so I may not be entirely coherent.

**TL;DR:** I need a car in order to be able to work but to purchase a car requires an auto loan which I won't be accepted for unless I'm able to work (and find a second job)."

I'm a junior in college. I go to school far away from home, at least 8+ hours by plane. Normally I hate being home (which is why I chose a school so far away in the first place) but, this year has been different. I had a horrible, drama-filled semester which included the end of my first real relationship, having my ex's ex publicly call me out and scream at me at a party, a depressive episode that lasted almost two weeks, regrettable drunken hook-ups in an attempt to get over that guy and cutting some toxic people out of my life who are now ""out to get me"" spreading gossip since I stopped talking to them. I've never been happier to be home, I've opened up to my parents about my mental health, have really bonded with my sister who has gotten older and have reconnected with high school friends who I've missed dearly. I'm happy for the first time in 6-ish months and I'm scared going back to school will screw it up. I've tried suggesting taking a semester off from school to my parents but they're not having it plus I accepted a research fellowship which is an opportunity I don't want to blow. I'm scared going back to school will make me anxious/depressed again, I'm scared of seeing my ex again (he was doing an internship off-campus last semester) and most of all I'm scared of having to deal with the people that used to be my friends. My mom just tells me to ""keep my head up and walk on by,"" but I feel like I'm not strong enough. So sorry for the wall of text/rant, I know I have to go back to school as much as I don't want to, I just kind of need advice of how to deal with everything. I'm trying to enjoy my last week here at home but thinking about going back is making me anxious and distant towards everyone. "
1unvgj,5,2014-01-07,Big personal announcement,Driesb,RedditorsRS,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditorsRS/comments/1unvgj/big_personal_announcement/,"Hi guys

My name is Heatzone and I've been in this clan for almost a year now.
I've enjoyed being in this clan. You are all lovely people. I would even grab a drink with the lot of you!

Unfortunately this post will consist of sad news.
In light of recent events I have decided to quit Runescape. This is a very hard decision for me because I have been playing this game for many years now. It had become a part of my daily routine.

For those who want to know the reason for my leaving, I will tell you. 

It was once my dream to have everything 99. I achieved this half a year ago. It was wonderful, but along the way I also noticed that getting a 99 wasn't how it used to be. I remember being very happy for achieving my first 99. At my last 99 the only thing I could think was: what now? Achievements were not what they used to be anymore. Not even comping could bring a big smile on my face. I mean i was happy, but it was just not what i expected it to be.

The second reason for my leaving is that, whenever I achieve something big, something comes along to make me feel shit. And I decided I don't want to feel like that anymore.

I will not be in the clanchat anymore, and I will unsubscribe from from r/runescape and r/redditorsrs because I don't want to be tempted to start over. 

From now on I will be focussing on some irl goals. I'm in my last year of collego so I'm going to focus on my finals and internship and hopefully graduate at the end of the year! 

I wish you all the best of luck.

http://i.imgur.com/YTgy2f8.jpg 
Here’s my life change. The left was when I started at my university. I woke up one day and decided I didn’t like what I was. 4 years later, I can finally say I am happy with myself and proud of what I’ve made.  

Started at 18 years old, 135 lbs (not sure on bf%), now at 170 @ 6% at 22 years old. 

In this picture I was 16, my body didn’t change till I started lifting http://i.imgur.com/xqoZiMJ.jpg 
When I started I couldn’t bench 90 lbs.. I’ve now been able to do 225x4 during my bulk + creatine.

I'm struggling on hitting 100's for shoulder press. It's my favorite exercise and can only do 90's comfortably (4 reps) with a spotter getting the up. (I think I have tendinitis or something, my wrists hurts from being an idiot when I started)

Deadlift: 405x4

My most proud exercise is that I've hit 39 chin ups no weight (very pissed off that day) and 19 with 70 lbs strapped on. Granted my form is not perfect at the end, but I'm pretty proud of it. 

Always knew and loved Arnold, but never thought that was possible until I saw a picture of the Son of Zeus http://i.imgur.com/iZudFsk.jpg and fell in love. The next day I picked up my first dumbbell. 
I also follow Broseph Rakich http://i.imgur.com/5TBtBcv.jpg religiously. I’ve learned a lot about how to control body fat and have implemented IIFYM (if it fits your macros) into my meal plan. 
I started my lifting following Body for Life, following the 5 set pyramid with the a 6th set being a super set at maximum intensity. I didn’t take nutrition serious enough then.

My serious changes started when I went abroad to Budapest my junior year, so I’ve been serious lifting for two years. 

At that point I was starting to learn about nutrition. 

I believe that your body is 80% made in the kitchen. Lifting is the easy part.. 
This picture represents my everyday with food http://i.imgur.com/v0jV2zA.png
My bulking meal plan is this: http://i.imgur.com/yikwFDF.png (I’ve changed the whole eggs to egg whites. Gotta watch dat der cholesterol)
Just remember to eat your veggies kids http://i.imgur.com/ju1hxGh.png (broccoli is my favorite  )

I learned about how to calculate calories through this website here http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/ which gives your BMR. From there its just hit your protein (easiest to do the 1g/lb) and then multiply your lean muscle by .4 to know how much fat you should intake and then fill the rest with carbs to hit your calories. I personally really enjoy eating chicken and meats, I know I take an excess of protein, but it’s the foods I enjoy most. God, I love meat.. 

My lifts have changed from following 5x5s, to copying Zyzz’s workout plan http://www.simplyshredded.com/exclusive-zyzz-interview.html to pulling a lot of exercises from Arny’s body building bible.  
I reached a massive plateau for 5 months because I became comfortable with my lifts.. I was an idiot, my body didn’t change and nor did my weights. Completely my fault. The only way to change your body is to change yourself. I ate more, and every day in the gym was a different rep range and different weights than the week before (Mondays international chest day, then other parts for other days. I keep legs on Sundays to be able to properly walk into the bar and dance on Fridays and Saturdays).
Going with that for a few months, Bodin blessed me with many gains.  I worked an internship where I sat at a desk all day, so I was able to eat whenever so I never missed a meal. Changed my lifting sessions to hitting my weakpoints twice a week. Mine being chest and legs. 
I try to do calves and abs two to three times a week. More than that I believe is unnecessary. 

Other than that, not sure what to say other than tren hard and eat clen. Do your deadlifts, kids. 

Also, only Trance music while at the gym. I have a passion for Armin Van Buurens, A State of Trance podcasts. Also love Group Therapy podcasts by Above &amp; Beyond. Holy Brodin, mates, that stuff makes you peak.
What grinds my gears the most is when someone stands in front me when Im working out and blocks the mirror.

It's a weird situation I don't know how to get out of.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1unyad/im_30m_essentially_broken_up_with_my_gf_26f_but/,"I've been with this woman for about 2 years. We dated for a year and a half seeing each other on the weekends. We decided to move in with one another during the last year of her Psy.D. Next year she is will be going off for post doctoral training. She does not want to live where we are now. Originally I had planned to go with her, pending the success of the moving in with one another.


Since then things have changed for me. My career has taken off locally and I won't have the same opportunities if I move. Additionally, I've decided I don't want children, a deal breaker for her.


Also, since we moved in we just haven't clicked. She needs me for everything. I've been in codependent relationships before and I do not want that again. I run and bike, but she views these as competition for my attention. She doesn't seem to be able to do anything alone.


So, to make it complicated, we've essentially broken up. We're both on the lease. It was my condo before she moved in. She will not move out until her internship is over (9 months). She doesn't see why she should have to change her entire living situation because of all this. She doesn't have anyone she can move in with and she doesn't want to live alone. I feel like I'm faced with three options. 


1) Move out, stop paying my share, lose my deposit and a great condo in a great location. She can't afford the place on her own. Losing the security deposit won't affect me at all financially, but I love where I live.


2) Be such an asshole that she has to move. This isn't me. I don't hate her. We just have very different goals and ideas of what a relationship could be that can't be reconciled. I don't think I could sustain this.


3) Live with her for 9 months as roommates. This sucks. I can't move on. She's always there moping around. She starts asking me the same relationship questions we've discussed over and over.


I don't know what to do. I have no legal recourse to get her out as she's on the lease and paying the agreed upon rent split. I feel like a prisoner in my own home and I'm over the relationship. I don't want to hurt her more than I already have, but she doesn't seem to be capable of going it alone, so she won't.


TL;DR: Broke up with girlfriend, she won't move out. I'm miserable.


Advice would be great!

Edit: Yes the relationship is over and I've told her I think it would be best for both of us if she moved out. By ""essentially"" I merely meant we lived in the same residence. Luckily it's 2000 sq feet so it's not too cramped. I really don't think I could have been more bluntly honest with her which is what makes it so frustrating. If I were her, I would've moved out after leaving an upper decker in every bathroom. She can't muster up the independence to do that.

I race bikes and do tris so I've been riding my bike a TON, running a lot, and got a gym membership. Starting in two weeks, most of my weekends will be out of town bike trips so I'm trying to make the best of a tough situation.

Thanks for the input.

Edit 2: Small victory I guess. She finally told me she recognizes it's not good for her to be there and will move out after her post doc interviews next month. I can hang in there for that long. I'm going strong with option 4: I don't have to be mean, but I don't have to be nice. Seems to be working.

Edit 3: She's moving Sunday. Done."

I'm a 24 yo male from Brazil. Just discovered that I was cheated and I promptly ended a 3 year relationship since I can't cope with this kinda of attitude.

But it hit me much harder than I thought.

I was in the same relationship for a long time, so for the past few years I stopped noticing if women did look at me. I would like to know what women think about me, body, style, face (with or without beard?) because I really have no idea of what's my best feature.

I just came back to Brazil from a internship in NY and I'm moving to a new job too, so after some years in the same relationship it's a good time to take care of myself. Be kind or cruel, but be honest :)

I keep thinking that I will never find a job because of the fucking stupid bullshit of having 3 to 5 year experience to get into an entry level job in the museum field. If I went back to grad school I would still get fucked in the ass afterwards because if the low amount of work experience I have. My parents say I just need to keep looking and try harder, but I fucking can't because this is not FUCKING 1968 WHERE ANY ASSHOLE WITH A FUCKING COLLEGE DEGREE CAN GET THE DREAM JOB THEY WANT AND HAVE IT FOR THEIR ENTIRE CAREER!!!!. I want to scream at the top of my lungs everyday and I hate when my mom asks me why I'm not seeing someone right now. HOW THE FUCK CAN I DATE ANYONE WHEN I'M BACK LIVING AT HOME WITH MY PARENTS AND HAVE NO HOPE FOR A JOB GOD DAMMIT!!!!!!

I keep thinking over and over again if I picked the right career, but I'm not good at anything else other than history and museum related work. I keep thinking I need to fight in a war to prove myself, but I have no clue what I would prove at all if I went and fought in a war. If I joined the military my parents would fucking flip because they don't want me to get killed in some shithole place. I just can't keep going from one internship to the next with no promise of a job. The job I want is filled with lifer old guys that need to DIE so I can apply for the job. I just feel like I'm slowly going crazy and I just want to drop off the earth and go somewhere to escape everything.

1up4xx,3,2014-01-08,"Destiny, I think you're viewing this argument from the wrong perspective.",LukaBoySwag12,Destiny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1up4xx/destiny_i_think_youre_viewing_this_argument_from/,"Why does a football player go to college in the first place?  It's for the same reason any other student there does: to receive the qualifications they need to pursue the career they want.  You and Kyle mentioned how athletes are basically ""forced"" into playing NCAA football if they wish to play for the NFL.  This is exactly the same for any other person that wants to have a job with more qualifications than a high school degree.  If I want to work at Microsoft writing the next generation operating system, I am ""forced"" to go to university and get a degree in software engineering / computer science.

The reason college athletes aren't paid is the exact same other college students aren't paid: they are there for the sole purpose of building their resume to apply for the jobs they want to have in the future.  For an engineering student, this might include a high GPA, solid internships, and research experience.  For an athlete, it would include their performance in the NCAA program &amp; games, their inherent athletic talent/skill, and the things they learn from the coaching staff at their university.

When you view this issue from the perspective of ""these students are bringing such huge value to their school for nothing"" instead of ""these are college students who are there to build their resume/CV/experience /qualifications for the career they want to have"", it may seem unfair to the players.  Virtually every university gives scholastic scholarships to students with the merit for them, and they give many more to athletes for the sole reason that they DO get more financial value from a successful athletic program than, say, a really smart undergraduate student doing research."
1upmkr,44,2014-01-08,"It's really hard to see my little sister destroying herself to be in an unhealthy, crappy relationship",throwawayoldersis,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1upmkr/its_really_hard_to_see_my_little_sister/,"Throwaway and slight details changed because my little sister uses reddit. This is a long rant, but man... I could definitely use some input on this craptastic situation, too.

My little sister is 20 and has, for the past few years, steadily been on a downward spiral. She met her ""boyfriend"" about 2 years ago when she first entered college, as they were in the same [edit] Associate of Arts college program. The first time she ever told me about him was in the past tense as this ""creepy jerk"" that she hooked up with, but who lied to her, treated her like crap, and used her for sex, and so she was avoiding him when she was forced to take the same classes. But next thing you know (as in literally a few days after she called me to complain about how she had been avoiding the guy for months and how he was a jerk to her in their classes, saying that she couldn't make it in their chosen career path and talking trash about her), she and ""creepy jerk"" were dating.  And so it began.

The guy is 9 years older than her and has never held down a steady full-time job. There are some silly things about him, such as that he would insist on people calling him Lucifer instead of his real name (I can't even make this up. He is apparently completely serious about it and it's hilarious).  He has a son and wife in a different state, who he has stayed married to in order to avoid paying child support. He has sometimes worked part-time bartending and apparently hooks up regularly with women through that. Not once has he acknowledged my sister as his girlfriend. Not once has he reached out to meet her family. They have fought constantly and broken up several times when she has found out about other women (and about him still being married). They fought about her relationship status on Facebook. Every couple of months she cuts him off, makes statements about never wanting anything to do with him ever again, and then goes back to him weeks (or days) later. Despite his lack of commitment, every time she leaves him he chases after her and hounds her until she comes back (of course).

And it's getting worse. This guy introduced her to drinking and drugs. Granted, with her entering college I figured she'd be experimenting anyway, but it became really clear that she started drinking in order to impress him. In high school she was extremely against drinking and even chided us (very legally aged older siblings and parents) for drinking at home, so it was a dramatic switch that came after she started saying that ""Satan"" was teasing her for being younger, inexperienced, and a teetotaller. I was a bit surprised when last spring I saw her drinking wine coolers at home (but hey it was at home). Now the other day she posted on *Facebook* that she had been *chugging vodka at work* with her older coworkers. And she *drove home afterwards.*

Speaking of work...

After she graduated with her degree last summer, I had hoped that she would take advantage of some internships her college had connections with to get into her field. She also has programming skills, so I figured she would be able to fall back on that. Some of the internships were out of state with companies where I knew a few people that worked for them. I offered to help connect her with people, but never heard from her. Instead she took a waitressing job near this guy and pressured my parents to help her find an apartment close to his. She refused to live anywhere else, despite the fact that it's an expensive area of the city (don't ask me how he affords it, I have no idea). As far as I know, she dropped any ideas of out-of-state internships and hasn't been working towards getting a job in her field. All to stay near him.

On top of this, she's being reckless and endangering herself. When she first started dating this guy she bragged about not using condoms with him. You bet your ass there was a shitstorm and her older sisters chewed her out. She cried to our mom who told us to leave her alone. Argh.

So they don't use condoms. We at least got her on birth control. But now she says they're in an open relationship. And tonight I learned that the last time this guy went out of town to visit his wife, she went downtown alone to get wasted with strangers (think literally drinking in alleyways because she's underage) and hooked up with several people. Apparently this is also what she does when she gets into clubs illegally.

How do we know this? She brags about it. On Facebook. Along with a stream of selfies. That everyone in the family including our fracking grandmother can see. A couple of weeks ago she participated in an amateur strip show at a gay bar and not only did she feel the need to post about it twice on Facebook, but also to message me specifically about it and then say she planned to do it again.

Now, don't get me wrong. I don't care if my little sister is exploring her sexuality or has a polyamorous relationship (I'm pansexual myself and have dated polyamorously before - and our family is very progressive and nonreligious, so multiple/gay partners and what not are not shocking to us), but what freaks me, and the whole family, out is that

A) I do not trust that she is doing any of this safely, and believe she is in fact doing it extremely unsafely

B) All of it feels like a cry for attention and intended to shock people - probably to impress/shock her boyfriend because he's her Facebook friend.

In fact, something that concerns and saddens me a bit is that my little sister was actually transitioning into being my little brother during high school. My family was being supportive and she was dressing as a man and going by a male name. As soon as she met this boyfriend, all of that disappeared. We don't know if she legitimately feels that she's female now, if she was just playing with gender, or she's denying her male self to keep this straight guy. We just kinda went with the flow.

And when she was in high school, I even bragged to friends that I wasn't worried about her when it came to relationships because she had her head on straight. She (he then) dated both girls and guys and seemed to have a surprisingly mature sense of what was healthy versus unhealthy when dating. She focused on graduating and her career prospects and talked constantly about how she wanted to move to a different city.

On top of this disturbing change and trend, is the fact that she's completely distanced herself from our family and has become, frankly, an awful, spoiled person. She doesn't have any friends of her own anymore, just through this guy. My older sister hasn't had so much as a text from her in 6 months. She ignores all of our texts and calls, and when she does occasionally go over to my parents' house for things or to do laundry and she's confronted about this, she brushes it off as annoying. She's really unhappy. My parents are constantly worried and stressed out by her behavior. She only sees them when they pay for her gas money (so she can do laundry at their place) and then only with the motivation that they give her more money, too.

The most recent example of how she acts now: Over Christmas my parents were under the impression that my little sister had to work over the holiday. No problem, as they are encouraging her to support herself. So she doesn't show up for Christmas (didn't even call to confirm she had to miss it). Also note that she had only come over to their house previously to pick up presents and never said thank you to anyone in the family for the gifts and spent not a minute of family time with anyone.

Then at 2am they get a phone call from her where she is distressed and frantically crying. My mum asks what's wrong, and she says that her boyfriend is in the other state visiting his wife and son again. Turns out she *didn't* have to work. She took the days off to spend with him and spent the day moping alone over his absence. She told mum that she had spent *$150* on her boyfriend's Christmas present and he didn't stick around to accept it. Then she has the gall to ask my parents to pay her rent *again,* because she was broke. She complained that no one was helping her. My parents, oy, said that if things really were that bad where she couldn't pay rent that she could always move back in with them. Her response? That she would only move back in if they got rid of their pets because she didn't like them.

Then, the next day she came over to their house. Not to apologize or throw herself down at their mercy, but to *use their supplies and kitchen to bake a ""welcome home"" cake for the boyfriend.*

It makes me want to tear my hair out! For so many reasons. The fact that she could do so much better than this guy (with who she used to be). The fact that he's manipulative and mean and a deadbeat. The fact that she's letting this dead end, nonexistent relationship consume her very soul and possibly future. 

My parents are obviously enabling some of this behavior, though they're apparently snapping out of it with this last incident. My mom laid it out for her that if she wants her life to change for the better that she needed to break up with this guy and take control of it. We sisters have also been vocal (e.g. freaking the fuck out when she was having unprotected sex).

My parents have been afraid that by showing outright disapproval that my sister would become even more distant and absorbed into this emotionally abusive and rotten relationship. Which, I hate to say, is probably justified because that is how she tends to react to confrontation and how the mind works when you're in ""crazy"" love. Her other sister and I have had our own toxic relationships that we threw ourselves into in the past, and are cringing at seeing her go through it, too. Her other sister is convinced that she'll learn from this and survive, since we did and became much happier people (other sister is in a 12+ year marriage, and I've traveled and accomplished career goals).

I'm not so sure. Part of me really wants to smack the living daylights out of her. Part of me wants to fix things. And all of me just hopes she pulls herself together, leaves him, and re-prioritizes her life before she ends up STI ridden, in jail, pregnant, or dead.

**Tl;Dr My little sister is fucking her life up to be in a relationship with a guy that treats her horribly and has in turn treated her support system horribly.**"

It's a rather small shop but it does work with some great clients. It's all very exciting for me. 

Initially, I assumed I would have the rather classic intern experience, getting coffee, etc. However, I was elated to find out that they actually had a pro bono account that they wanted me to work on in order to gain some experience. 

I am assisting the Director of Brand Strategy with writing the public relations strategy and execution material for the client. This includes testimonials and a little bit of social media strategy for the client. I realize that this is not the big leagues and possibly not what paid copywriters are doing on a daily basis, but I was under the assumption that I would be writing copy for ads, brochures or some sort of social media.

I am not complaining by any means. I am quite happy to have this opportunity and to be gaining job experience, but I am just a little unfamiliar with this aspect of the job. I'm still learning  about this industry and am eager to absorb any and all information that this experience is providing me with.  

So, copywriters of Reddit, what are your main tasks? Is this a standard assignment for the most part? How is your workload divvied up? Is this something employers would like to see in a portfolio?

Any other information you can give me regarding my questions would be more than fantastic. "

---

Boyfriend and I met just before I was going to head out on the adventure of a lifetime:  I was going to travel around the world alone for 3-5 years.  I was 24, and had been working towards this goal for years.  I wanted freedom, to be untethered, and to be able to ""ride the wave.""  He knew all this when we met, but we were both astounded by our incredible connection.  He is a truly unique and wonderful person, so full of love and just a kid at heart.  But quickly, we became unable to communicate; he said things like ""go travel, I wouldn't want you to resent me for 'keeping you' in the end"" and both of us being smart people we realized we couldn't compromise each others' lives at this point.  It would have been too much, too fast.  I guess we were making assumptions about each others' feelings and not saying what we *really* wanted, though, for fear of keeping the other from doing what they want.  He is very passionate about his job and life here, and in no way would I want that to change.  


So after 5 months of dating, I left and started my travels as planned.


We stayed together.  But he visited me during those first 3 months of separation, and we broke up.  It was my choice.  I realized I loved him so much, but all the bullshit and confusion of trying to start and build a relationship amidst these circumstances was not working: we could try again in a couple years knowing that we loved each other.  He didn't take it well.  He was a mess, in fact.  I stayed strong and did about 2 months of no contact, but he wanted to talk about it and see where we were.  He said he needed some sort of thread to hang on to to make sure we weren't losing each other for good.  I was afraid to promise anything at that point, because it would inherently mess up our detaching.  


We were where we always had been.  So deeply in love and fearful of losing each other, but unable to see how we could possibly go anywhere together as we were.  I felt tethered, which was so fundamentally what I was running from, and meanwhile he felt abandoned.  So I said, ""give me some more time, and I will give you a decision.""


I landed in SE Asia November 1 last year.  I traveled alone, and we didn't talk during this time period.  But I knew immediately, that no matter what I had to be with him--he was always part of my life and he had my heart.  No one I met interested me in the slightest ""in that way"" and I was *with* him whether I liked it or not.  So I called him around Christmas and told him I would do whatever it takes not to lose him.  I booked a flight for March to come home, as there were things I had to do before coming home (namely, a 2 month internship for diving to advance in my career).  He said fine, and we talked again regularly. 


We were both happy that I was coming home, although on some level I knew I was making a huge sacrifice.  But it was worth it, right?  I couldn't let this guy go, and I felt like the only way to stop that was by going ""home"" to him.  


We both approached it terribly.  We were committed, yes, but saw it as a ""trial"" period, which put immense amounts of pressure on us both.  I was scrutinizing his every last behavior and he was doing the same to me.  We had terrible communication, and literally couldn't access the love we had for each other.  We stopped having sex, stopped having fun, and started fighting terribly.  I fell into depression, because any time I expressed my feelings to him I was either yelled at, or shut out.  It might be important to mention here that he is not in any way a mean person, but he is very closed off emotionally...he had a tough upbringing that taught him to deal with emotions very much on your own.  So I think me trying to work through emotions with him was a bad idea, one that I didn't realize at the time.  It's just not how he operates.  He is also extremely logical, and when emotions don't make sense (raw, unedited emotions), he shuts down.


So I left again in September, again to advance in diving career.  We didn't talk about when I'd come back, but it was clear that it was home now.  We had a house together, bank accounts, I had bought a sailboat, etc.  


I came back in November to visit him.  I missed him.  I felt alone.  There was a huge barrier between us emotionally and it was killing me.  I have known since last year that this is the person I want to spend my life with and I know he will be a difficult person to have a relationship with because he does have some emotion issues.  


He broke up with me.  I guess at that point it was mutual.  I knew it was inevitable, because he was a stranger to me, and couldn't express any kind of affection or love for me the way I knew he was capable.  So although I knew it would be hard, I agreed that this was the only way.  I needed someone who would at least make me feel good about the person I am instead of how he had been making me feel.  I knew this at the core.


But after we broke up, it was like the first time we met.  We shared our intimate, unfiltered feelings and fears, and we spent every day more in love than the last.  This went on for 2 weeks.  I then flew to another country for 2 weeks for a job interview.  While I was away I felt terrible about our decision.  He says he needs time apart and space for a ""reset"" to occur within him.  Where he can truly feel alone again and work out what it is within him that pushes me away when I am most vulnerable.  He said he loves me so deeply and doesn't want to lose me, so he sees this as *the thing* that needs to happen if anything is to work in the future.  


But Reddit, how am I supposed to cope with this.  Do I ""move on"" and forget him, knowing one day he might come around and ""be ready"" for me?  I'm scared the timing could be off if that time ever comes.  But I don't want to ""move on"" if there's a possibility for our future.  If there's one thing I've learned from this relationship is that I need to spend the time to get to know and understand this man more than anything.  I fear that this space will let me forget (and in fact, time has shown before that we both have ""forgotten"" very essential truths about each other with time and space) the things I've learned about him, and vice versa.  I have come so far in my own growth in this relationship, and I know how to avoid his buttons and pick my battles *with him* and I want to continue on with the momentum knowing that we still love each other.  I don't want to move on, but I feel I might have to because how else can I go through this uprooting?  I no longer have a home in this world, or anything secure to hold on to.  People need those things, and I need to find them somewhere.  What do I do?  Do I wait and trust in his ""process"" or do I tell him I don't want to break this off and do whatever he needs to salvage this?  My biggest fear is resenting him for this if we ever did get back together...how can I trust that he will be there for me through thick and thin if he's jumping ship at this moment when we both know we don't want this to end?


---   
**tl;dr**: I don't know if I should ""let go"" and move on from a very complicated relationship, but my ex wants time and space.  Do I let it go and give the time and space or do I tell him I think we're making a bad decision if our future is still in the picture (which we both want it to be)."

________________________________________________________________________

May 26th: ...Freddie Maxwell worked the night shift at the Hess Gas Station on Ketcham Road in Altamont. He’d had other jobs and other schedules over the years but this one seemed to suit his temperament and sleep schedule best.  His family worried about him working alone from eleven in the evening until seven a.m. but he assured them he was perfectly safe. After midnight he was for all intents and purposes locked into the building; he could only communicate with customers via a speaker set into bulletproof glass and anyone wanting to exchange cash for goods would have to perform the transaction by way of a metal drawer.

That wasn’t to say he didn’t see more than his fair share of cranks and weirdos while he waited for sunrise. From his secure little box Freddie had seen all manner of hook-ups, break-ups and freak-outs. That was one of the things his friends always said about him, “Freddie always has the craziest stories.”

Security footage recovered from the scene shows a figure walking into the gas station parking lot at 12:40 a.m.. The shape approaching the secured building was slumped and seemed to carry its own shadows with it. It held a thin length of metal in its right hand and dragged it along the asphalt as it walked. Freddie was too busy sleeping and didn’t notice the stranger until a filthy, lichen coated hand rapped against the bulletproof glass. Freddie started but then, ever the professional, shifted into customer service mode. He asked the bearded, grimy figure, “Can I help you sir?”

When the stranger spoke the audio on the security tape went wild with static, obscuring the voice. Whatever he said sent the suddenly terrified young cashier scrambling away. 

All Hess late shift workers are required to wear what is called a ‘Panic Button’, pressing that button sends the local police speeding to the rescue. The security video clearly shows Freddie pressing the ‘Panic Button’ but no alert ever reached the local authorities.

At 12:44 a.m. the Hess Station trembled, the shelves toppled and the thick, security glass of the building’s walls and windows shattered as though they had been struck by a thousand invisible fists. The stranger must have spoken again because the security camera’s audio erupted into fresh wave of static that faded away just in time for the viewer to hear Freddie’s final plea for mercy.

So, in the end Freddie Maxwell’s craziest night shift story of all was the one he never lived to tell...

by
Al Bruno III


*...where was I when Freddie Maxwell met his demise? Where was I when I learned about the Black Door? Where was I when my research buddy almost got killed? I was at my favorite bar of course. Jasper Moradi and I were both in that wonderful place that exists between Not Sober and Not Sloppy Drunk. We had run into another dead end in our hunt for the vorvolaka but thanks to him I had just learned a stunning new fact.*

*“This...” I looked around the Blue Valentine in confusion, “...is a gay bar?”*

*Jasper snickered while ordering another round, “You didn’t know?”*

*“It... It doesn’t look like a gay bar...”*

*“You were expecting it to look like Elton John’s basement?”*

*“But there are women here...” I’d like to be able to tell you readers that it was the seven white Russians that were making me this clueless but we all know the truth.*

*“Yes, there are,” Jasper said. “and there are gay men in straight bars. Truly we live in an age of wonders.”*

*I have to admit that my impressions of what the inside of a gay bar looked like were primarily influenced by the Blue Oyster from the Police Academy movies. A nightmarish vision of a dimly lit dive full of leather clad men forcing unsuspecting straights to dance with them to jaunty salsa tunes.* 

*Blue Oyster? Blue Valentine? Was it a color scheme thing?*

*“Maybe we should go somewhere else?” I suggested.*

*“Oh don’t worry about it,” Jasper said. “Lets talk about something interesting. I think I’ve found a copy of the Liber Cicatrices in readable condition. I’ll just need to go to- To go to- What is that smell?”*

*The man approaching our table smelled and looked like he had come from a swamp. The first thing I noticed was that he was carrying a serrated length of metal that only bore a passing resemblance to a sword. My eyes traced a straight line from the stranger’s weapon arm to his face. It was a face made cadaverous by necrosis and eyes made insane by abandonment. Strings of lichen hung from his clothes and was tangled in his long hair. “Didn’t you hear...” he spoke revealing teeth that were as discolored and bent as his weapon, “...the clawing at the Black Door?”*

*All around us people were making for the exits. Jasper had his hand and mouth over his nose. I was pretty sure the question was directed at me so I said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t even know who you are.”*

*The stranger started to cry, his tears cut veins through the filth that coated his face, “You made a sacrifice of me.”*

*“Now just a minute here-”*

*He raised the blade over his head, I hit the floor with practiced ease. But he didn’t go after me, he went after Jasper. The weapon missed my friend’s head by inches. Swamp Man was screaming now, he sounded like an animal left to die in a trap. He took another swing at Jasper but before that blow had a chance to connect I kicked my friend’s seat over.*

*“Who the Hell is this guy?” Jasper asked.*

*“I don’t know!” And I really didn’t.*

*“Whoever he is I think he watched too much Highlander II.”*

*“Highlander II?” I almost turned away from our assailant so I could give Jasper a dirty look, “You’re thinking about Highlander II now?”*

*Swamp Man attacked again swinging the weapon like a demented samurai warrior. I grabbed a chair and deflected the blow. I positioned myself between Swamp Man and Jasper looking like some kind of a third rate lion tamer. “Listen,” I said, “we can talk about this.”*

*“Too late now,” he sobbed, “too late now. I’ve seen the secret at the heart of the Never that beats behind the Black Door.”*

*“Wait. Just wait and tell me what’s going on.”*

*“Why?” Swamp Man brought the length of metal down with enough force to smash the chair to pieces, “So you can put it on your fucking blog?”*

*The next words out of his mouth weren’t really words at all, they were collections of ugly syllables that shattered all the glasses and windows of the Blue Valentine and made me feel like I was drowning. Swamp Man raised the weapon high over his head. I raised my arm in a feeble attempt to protect Jasper and myself.*

*And that was when one of the bar patrons shot Swamp Man dead...*

+

...The bullet punched a hole through the back of Swamp Man’s skull and when that bullet came out the other side it made an even bigger hole. Swamp Man dropped dead at my feet. Maybe it was a trick of the light or the ungodly number of drinks I’d downed but the stuff leaking from his skull didn’t look like any kind of blood I’d ever seen.

Fact: The events of that night have forced me to reevaluate my opposition to concealed carry laws.

The first thing the police did after they arrived was give me the standard ‘Not this guy again look.’ Then they ushered everyone out of the building and sealed the area. Not sealed the area in the crime scene sense but sealed the area in the hazmat sense. Since I had a bit of Swamp Man’s brains on my favorite t-shirt they took it into evidence.

Fact: I don’t think I’m ever going to get my White Brains On Toast 2003 world tour shirt back.

Once the police had finished with us Jasper and I headed back to his place for a little research. We had some wine and while he went through his volumes of questionable lore on modern day supernatural legends I logged into the FEAROFTRUTH message board and started asking questions.

Fact: The legend of the Black Door is your standard Book of Revelation/ “The stars are right” kind of stuff. It says that there is another world near ours; a world that the Creator turned his back on because the creatures that lived there were worse than any devil or angel you might imagine. This world is called ‘Nix’ or ‘Never’ and there is a heart at its center. That heart beats slowly and irregularly but when it does the Black Door opens.

Where does the truth begin and the half-assed metaphors end? I can’t tell you yet. What I can tell you is that Jasper has no idea why Highlander II popped into his head in that moment of crisis.

Fact: Highlander II sucks ass.

I can tell you is that I stole a bit of evidence before the police ushered us out of the Blue Valentine, a clump of the slimy plants that covered our attacker.

I’m no horticulturist but ‘ShortRound92‘ from the forums is and was able to tell me that the vegetable matter in question was tillandsia usneoides or, in layman’s terms Spanish Moss.

Fact: Spanish Moss is not even remotely native to New York.

When you get right down to it Jasper and the regulars from FEAROFTRUTH did all the work; ‘50Fingers’ got me the surveillance footage from the Hess Station, ‘ObamaWanKenobi’ worked as an intern at the Altamont county morgue and found out that Freddie Maxwell’s heart had collapsed and ‘ScaredGhost’ was the one that found the eventual, unexpected destination of the hazmat truck.

Fact: The hazmat truck was found in a ditch along the Northway, the crew dead, the body of Swamp Man missing.

May 26th: ...Freddie Maxwell worked the night shift at the Hess Gas Station on Ketcham Road in Altamont. He’d had other jobs and other schedules over the years but this one seemed to suit his temperament and sleep schedule best.  His family worried about him working alone from eleven in the evening until seven a.m. but he assured them he was perfectly safe. After midnight he was for all intents and purposes locked into the building; he could only communicate with customers via a speaker set into bulletproof glass and anyone wanting to exchange cash for goods would have to perform the transaction by way of a metal drawer.

That wasn’t to say he didn’t see more than his fair share of cranks and weirdos while he waited for sunrise. From his secure little box Freddie had seen all manner of hook-ups, break-ups and freak-outs. That was one of the things his friends always said about him, “Freddie always has the craziest stories.”

Security footage recovered from the scene shows a figure walking into the gas station parking lot at 12:40 a.m.. The shape approaching the secured building was slumped and seemed to carry its own shadows with it. It held a thin length of metal in its right hand and dragged it along the asphalt as it walked. Freddie was too busy sleeping and didn’t notice the stranger until a filthy, lichen coated hand rapped against the bulletproof glass. Freddie started but then, ever the professional, shifted into customer service mode. He asked the bearded, grimy figure, “Can I help you sir?”

When the stranger spoke the audio on the security tape went wild with static, obscuring the voice. Whatever he said sent the suddenly terrified young cashier scrambling away. 

All Hess late shift workers are required to wear what is called a ‘Panic Button’, pressing that button sends the local police speeding to the rescue. The security video clearly shows Freddie pressing the ‘Panic Button’ but no alert ever reached the local authorities.

At 12:44 a.m. the Hess Station trembled, the shelves toppled and the thick, security glass of the building’s walls and windows shattered as though they had been struck by a thousand invisible fists. The stranger must have spoken again because the security camera’s audio erupted into fresh wave of static that faded away just in time for the viewer to hear Freddie’s final plea for mercy.

So, in the end Freddie Maxwell’s craziest night shift story of all was the one he never lived to tell...

*...where was I when Freddie Maxwell met his demise? Where was I when I learned about the Black Door? Where was I when my research buddy almost got killed? I was at my favorite bar of course. Jasper Moradi and I were both in that wonderful place that exists between Not Sober and Not Sloppy Drunk. We had run into another dead end in our hunt for the vorvolaka but thanks to him I had just learned a stunning new fact.*

*“This...” I looked around the Blue Valentine in confusion, “...is a gay bar?”*

*Jasper snickered while ordering another round, “You didn’t know?”*

*“It... It doesn’t look like a gay bar...”*

*“You were expecting it to look like Elton John’s basement?”*

*“But there are women here...” I’d like to be able to tell you readers that it was the seven white Russians that were making me this clueless but we all know the truth.*

*“Yes, there are,” Jasper said. “and there are gay men in straight bars. Truly we live in an age of wonders.”*

*I have to admit that my impressions of what the inside of a gay bar looked like were primarily influenced by the Blue Oyster from the Police Academy movies. A nightmarish vision of a dimly lit dive full of leather clad men forcing unsuspecting straights to dance with them to jaunty salsa tunes.* 

*Blue Oyster? Blue Valentine? Was it a color scheme thing?*

*“Maybe we should go somewhere else?” I suggested.*

*“Oh don’t worry about it,” Jasper said. “Lets talk about something interesting. I think I’ve found a copy of the Liber Cicatrices in readable condition. I’ll just need to go to- To go to- What is that smell?”*

*The man approaching our table smelled and looked like he had come from a swamp. The first thing I noticed was that he was carrying a serrated length of metal that only bore a passing resemblance to a sword. My eyes traced a straight line from the stranger’s weapon arm to his face. It was a face made cadaverous by necrosis and eyes made insane by abandonment. Strings of lichen hung from his clothes and was tangled in his long hair. “Didn’t you hear...” he spoke revealing teeth that were as discolored and bent as his weapon, “...the clawing at the Black Door?”*

*All around us people were making for the exits. Jasper had his hand and mouth over his nose. I was pretty sure the question was directed at me so I said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t even know who you are.”*

*The stranger started to cry, his tears cut veins through the filth that coated his face, “You made a sacrifice of me.”*

*“Now just a minute here-”*

*He raised the blade over his head, I hit the floor with practiced ease. But he didn’t go after me, he went after Jasper. The weapon missed my friend’s head by inches. Swamp Man was screaming now, he sounded like an animal left to die in a trap. He took another swing at Jasper but before that blow had a chance to connect I kicked my friend’s seat over.*

*“Who the Hell is this guy?” Jasper asked.*

*“I don’t know!” And I really didn’t.*

*“Whoever he is I think he watched too much Highlander II.”*

*“Highlander II?” I almost turned away from our assailant so I could give Jasper a dirty look, “You’re thinking about Highlander II now?”*

*Swamp Man attacked again swinging the weapon like a demented samurai warrior. I grabbed a chair and deflected the blow. I positioned myself between Swamp Man and Jasper looking like some kind of a third rate lion tamer. “Listen,” I said, “we can talk about this.”*

*“Too late now,” he sobbed, “too late now. I’ve seen the secret at the heart of the Never that beats behind the Black Door.”*

*“Wait. Just wait and tell me what’s going on.”*

*“Why?” Swamp Man brought the length of metal down with enough force to smash the chair to pieces, “So you can put it on your fucking blog?”*

Firstly I want to say how much I love this community.  You all are fabulous wonderful people and I have enjoyed this growing community immensely.

Now as to my request.  I am a college CS student at Chico graduating next year.  I was wondering if any of you lovely tech people would be interested in letting me colab on a project with you.  I don't need payment, I don't need anything really except experience.  My main language is Java.  I think I'm a decent programmer (see some my work at SethVg.com)  But with internships coming up this summer I am trying to get some more projects for my portfolio.  If any of you have any need for me I would love to help out through Github.  If you like my services I would always accept Dogecoins as small payment (though completely unnecessary). All I mainly ask is if I help that you let me talk about my contributions to your projects in interveiws.  Like I said I am an Okay programmer (I know im not great, yet!).  I Just need real world experience!

Please let me know if you have any projects for me to help on (pref Java related)  Much appreciated!

1uqsg8,10,2014-01-08,Switching careers?,Nurfed,physicaltherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/1uqsg8/switching_careers/,"Hey, 

I've been thinking about something for the past 4-5 months and would like to receive some outside feedback. I'm currently working in IT for a small insurance company. The company itself is great however I feel I majored in a career way to introverted. I really dislike sitting at a desk all day, I don't like the lack of social interaction and the constant need to be on top of all new technologies. I feel as if I picked my major prematurely and because of the promise of a 'big salary'. When in school, I loved my major. I even graduated with #1 with a 4.0 in my major. However I've hated all 3 of my internships and I just feel 'there' at my job. No love or hate, I just keep watching for it to be 4pm. I make $43k atm.  

Currently I work part time at a Mixed Martial Arts gym. I love lifting weights and MMA; two things I've been doing for several years. Even though I barley make any money working there part time I love it and the time goes by so fast because of all the interaction I have with other people. Additionally, my SO becomes a RN in less than a year, and the way she talks about her clinicians make envious. I have no certifications in personal training or anything like that but I know if I went after one it would be easy for me to obtain because of how obsessed I am with learning about the body &amp; muscles. These things make me wonder if I be a good physical therapist... 

If money &amp; time wasn't an issue I'd be back in school in a heartbeat; but I'm currently sitting on 20k in student loans and pay $400 in car payments + insurance a month.  My degree is in Management Information Systems so I'd have to take about 28 hours of prereqs before starting DPT. Little bit more background: I'm a 23 year old from Long Island, NY. Few questions:


* Do you think in my circumstances switching careers would be a wise choice?

* Would DPT schools frown on my bachelors because it's not a science degree? 

* How expensive are the average DPT schools? I'd be paying this all on my own. On average I found about 15k-20k a year (may have been semester...) but I think I also found a state school that was about 6k a semester. 

* How difficult is it to get into a DPT school after achieving all the prereqs?

* If I acted on this now I won't likely graduate until I'm 28. Is that to old for a entry level PT?

* How difficult is it to get a job after graduating from a DPT program?

* How true at the salary stats online? I now know the ones in IT are crazy inflated. According to what I see the average PT in new york makes about 70k starting and tops out at about 85k... Is that accurate? After actually working I'm not as nearly green-eyed as I was in college... I just want enough money to have a decent house+family without worrying about bills. No fancy cars or anything.

 * Related: Why does the salary top out at about 85k? Also: if a PT starts his own practice do they earn more money? What's some other differences between owning your own practice vs working at a hospital?

* Lastly: How does the recent healthcare act impact PT? 


Thanks. I've done a lot of research on my own but I constantly find mixed results. I appreciate any input I can get; it means a lot to me!"

1ur4c3,5,2014-01-08,"back in my N-home, really struggling, all alone :(",[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ur4c3/back_in_my_nhome_really_struggling_all_alone/,"I will try to be as brief as possible. I am very alone right now and would   so appreciate anyones' advice or sympathy.

I grew up with extremely narcissistic parents. They were controlling,            manipulative, emotional bullies, and my father, when angry, became        pretty abusive. I don't want to go into detail, they pretty much                              possessed the textbook traits. I didn't understand anything was wrong,      just that I wanted to get away from them my whole life. I never rebelled       like my brothers did, I was too afraid of my parents. I had the chance to     get away when I went to college far away. Unfortunately, the emotional     issues caused by growing up in such a home and my own naiveté             stemming from having been an extremely quiet homeschooler caused   me to not do well. I made mistakes that caused me a lot of grief.           I struggled, alone, because to share with my parents would have caused   instant judgement and punishment, and my grades suffered immensely.    I have been working hard to learn from those mistakes and to move on    and have improved in college immensely. Unfortunately, it was not        enough for my parents. I always feared they might withdraw their           funding of my education and bring me home when my grades slipped       so before I left this holiday I called and made it very clear I would be       returning back to my college town home regardless of their wishes. I        told them that while my grades had suffered, I still had my scholarship       and had a great opportunity this semester to really put my mistakes        completely behind me and excel once again. Plus, I made a home and        life there and had a great ""family"" of friends. They said they understood.   

Well, it turned out they were lying. I got home fully expecting to return     to college with their support to be told no. They had no intention of          letting me return and I was also in no position to dictate to them what     was going to happen now. They led me to believe that I could stay with     them, take a year off school, sort my life out, make money, learn to       to drive, and take community classes and then make a triumphant           return to college, be it where I had originally attended or somewhere      else of my choosing. I accepted the wisdom of this as I've been pretty       beat up from the last year of stress and drama and, while I didn't like       it, could see that taking a ""break"" would not be a bad thing. I told them     this but said it was very important I be allowed to return to my home      to bid goodbye to that family I referenced and my longtime boyfriend.      After all, I left and had no idea that could be the last time I ever saw       them all. They said they understood and would make it happen.              

Well, in the next few days, come to find out they were lying. I asked         them for an update on when I might be able to return to bid goodbye       and they told me they never promised they'd let me do that and it          couldn't happen because I needed a chaperone and no one had the time     to go with me. I told them that I would work and buy a ticket for myself     to do so at which point the enormity of their lies came out. They told me   I'd never be able to afford to do that because my work checks would       go to paying them rent, buying all my things (including food), and any       leftover money had to go to saving for a car because using my mom's       would disrupt her schedule (she's retired and likes to go to swim and        volunteer). I understand it could be disruptive but when I said that           I'd rather save my money to move out and instead use public transit        and bike I was told first: you're in no position to move out anytime           soon, you have to learn to be independent first and second: you can't        bike or use public transit because you might get hurt and you'll be            smelly. I'm also expected to break up with my longtime boyfriend and       must introduce any future friends or potential boyfriends to them first.      

When it came out that I wouldn't be allowed to return to college and how    controlling they were going to be of me I decided I was going to get out.    I'm going to stay this semester and take the offered free community        classes and save my money. In summer, I hope to get a room+board       internship job and then head back to my college town and my FOC. It's much cheaper to live there than where I am currently and I hope to       pursue work with some of the outdoor education networks they have      up there. Its a passion of mine. I'm just afraid that I'm going to lose my       nerve and fall into the brainwashed passive state I was in highschool         and never leave like they want. I'm already really struggling because   I'm extremely isolated here and have only my Nparents for comfort   IThis is all really scary!

1ur8t5,35,2014-01-08,"Brother at UGA accused of cheating, need some info on how to handle it",swander42,UGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/1ur8t5/brother_at_uga_accused_of_cheating_need_some_info/,"So over the Christmas break my brother received an email accusing him and another kid of cheating off each other during one of their exams. Apparently he was reported by another student. The accusation was totally bizarre because they weren't even sitting next to each other. He was really upset at first because he studied really hard and he thought it was going to be for nothing. But once we calmed him down and made him realize the complaint made no sense he felt better. So he set up the required meeting with the teacher and facilitator and told them he didn't cheat and that he wasn't even sitting next to the other person. Obviously we thought that would be the end of it.

Well once he told them this, they let the other kid off(apparently only my brothers test number was in the complaint) and demanded to know who he was sitting next to. This happened to be one of his best friends from high school, which opened up a whole new can of worms. They study together for this class all the time...So once the teacher had this other kids name, the teacher decided to repeat the entire process and compare their tests. Once she reviewed them, she said they were close enough that she still believes they cheated and so now they have to set up another meeting...

The statement said that my brother and this other kids paper were close together and that they were whispering during the test. My brother fully admits that he was whispering to himself, which he does during tests and when he is doing assignments. I have witnessed this myself. The other kid is an A student and would have no reason to cheat. But now that he has been brought into this by proxy, he is livid with my brother and is demanding that he just tell them he cheated without his knowledge so he doesn't suffer any consequences.

My brothers and I are 10 years apart (23 and 33) and my dad has been out of the picture for a long time. I have been taking care of my brothers for most of my life and I know when they are lying. He is not lying. After talking to some other people on campus he is convinced that he is going to be punished regardless because of the evidence against him. So he now feels that he can a) go through the process maintaining his innocence and likely be punished regardless and take his friend down with him (which would likely mean he would lose most of his other friends as well) or b) admit to something he didn't do, hopefully save his friend from any punishment and deal with the consequences.  

Now the big issue with this is my brother is going into accounting and already has an internship set up. Failing this class and being accused of cheating could do long term, irreparable damage to his career.  At the very least it will set back his graduation and would likely mean he wouldn't get an offer once his internship was completed. 

I just need some advice on what to tell him. I have zero insight into this process and how to deal with it if you actually didn't do it. The evidence seems like circumstantial crap to me. 

* There is the statement from another student that only lists my brothers test number in the complaint 
* They were within 5 points of eachother and some(no actual number was given) of the questions they got incorrect, they answered with the same incorrect answer

So several things about this don't make a lot of sense. The test was 15 pages with 25 multiple choice questions and 5 short answer, but the tests they both had were different versions. So the order of the questions was totally different. In order to actually cheat they would have had to do a lot of collaborating and page turning and I can't see how only one person would have noticed that. There was a TA walking around the whole time. 

As for their scores being similar, they study together, so it makes sense their grasp of the concepts would be similar. But seeing as my brother got a b-, that means that at best they both missed maybe 5-6 questions. Assuming these are the multiple choice questions, because it would be super obvious in the short answer portion, it seems pretty probable that of those wrong answers, some would be the same... I'd honestly like to see how many other people in the class got similar scores and had similar answers. But they apparently do not have to actually provide my brother with anything other than the content of the statement against him.

Sorry for the long post..I just have no idea how to deal with this. My first instinct is to talk to a lawyer, but other posts in this sub about the process made it sound like people get really pissed if you do that. I can't tell my brother to admit to something he didn't do and I genuinely believe him. His friend is going completely mental and my brother is close to losing it. Cheating doesn't go over well in the accounting community and he pretty much believes that he is now going to have to change majors.

I just need some help understanding the process and figuring out if there is anything I can do for him, anything he can do for himself, anyone he should talk to, anything he shouldn't do, etc..

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance."
1uri8b,13,2014-01-08,12 hours until my first appointment...,pinkprinny,MtF,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1uri8b/12_hours_until_my_first_appointment/,"Hello everyone,

Starting off, I'm trans. It's been a hell of a ride trying to be a man, but I just can't keep hiding it anymore. I've done so many stupid things to try to ignore this aspect of my life, just to try to be ""normal"". I'd lie to myself. I'd say ""If you get another A, you can talk to someone."" or, ""If you lose another 10lbs, you can ask that coworker where she got her sweater."" or my favourite, ""Clean up the house and no one will be able to see where you can hide your collection of imagined skirts."" I never kept my word, I never talked with anyone, I never asked where people shopped nearby, and I never dared to dream that I'd wear something as girly as a skirt.

Well dammit, enough was enough. December was the end of the bargaining. It started off rocky with family health concerns, pushed into finals for classes that had no grades, and the glass shattering moment, the one thing to destroy my perfectly imagined male world.. Everything turned out fine. Everything. Family health concerns were major, but handled. I rocked a 3.925 GPA, acing the second washout class of the major. I'm literally on the top of my world, sitting at my desk at my internship with a local software company, but this nagging started again.. ""Hey, remember me? You told me we'd do things, and you never followed through."" Everything else was golden, I didn't have to worry anymore about anything, right? I should maybe try to figure out what this feeling is, since I couldn't remember when it started, what it wanted, where it was coming from, or how I was going to get rid of it. 

Introspection. That was a mistake. I should have talked to someone immediately rather than turning and facing this head-on, alone. If only I had a time machine I could turn the clock back another wind, stop myself from experiencing that pain. Memories that I'd blocked from years ago came flooding in as if to say ""This is who you are. This is who you can be. You're living a lie."" But that wasn't how I felt, it seemed insurmountable. I was alone, and it was a very dark place. It was the 23rd, and the family event lead us to Target. Holy crap, why do I care about these clothes? What is going on with me? Where is this panic attack coming from and how can I possibly get my feelings back together so I can pretend it didn't happen? I managed that day, sobbed through the night, but the next was Christmas eve...

It wasn't bad, my mother and I had my brother and his wife over for dinner and cards against humanity, but I noticed something strange. I was having a hard time consuming food. I'd just lost my appetite. This was my first gigantic red flag of ""GET HELP NOW"", but it was Christmas Eve, and I didn't think anyone was available. It was the first time in 7 years that I'd had suicidal thoughts. (I don't, anymore.) Christmas was an entire day of sleeping. I didn't want anything to do with anyone, and I just wanted to be left alone. I did nothing but cry and lay in bed as if to say to the rest of the world: ""I'm not worthy of this day, maybe tomorrow."" The thoughts intensified. 

The day after Christmas, the only thought I had was ""LIVE."" I called my doctor's office about the loss of appetite and was scheduled for an appointment one hour later... Only there was a snowstorm, it was 2.5 miles away, and I don't have a car. I made it there with 20 minutes to spare, but the office was so empty I was seen immediately. Then, for the first time ever, I said it. ""For as long as I can remember.. I've never felt comfortable.. I'm sorry, it's taken me twenty four years to have the gumption to say it, and I'd hoped it'd be from bravery instead of fear, as it is today.. I'm not male."" The doctor took my hands in hers and tried to make eye contact, but I'd shut my eyes in fear. She then said ""Congratulations"", ordered blood work and sent me on my way with the appointment two weeks later.

What a fun two weeks. Tears have been a minimal occurance. Once I'd told one person the floodgates opened. The next night I told my mother, who is supportive. Thinking that something crazy was bound to happen I tried to keep it in, until I told my sister-in-law. Supportive. Co-worker #1. Supportive. Coworker #2, supportive. Co-worker #3, supportive. Boss/instructor/friend, #1 and #2, supportive. Fox news grandmother and brother, supportive. Everyone I've reached out to has either been supportive or indifferent, and I'm okay with indifferent because I prepared myself for much worse. There are family members and friends that are probably not going to be supportive. I know it, but that's okay.

 Tomorrow was a day that I'd been afraid of when it was scheduled two weeks ago, but as the time went on I'm more excited than anything. It's just a step, but holy hell if it isn't another step in the right direction. "
1urkv9,8,2014-01-08,FSU or UCF for Computer Science?,Drathgore,fsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/fsu/comments/1urkv9/fsu_or_ucf_for_computer_science/,"I'm having trouble deciding where I want to go, I've heard that UCF has a really good CS program but I've also heard similar things about FSU so I would like to try and get some more information from anybody in said programs.

I've heard that FSU shares its engineering school with Florida A&amp;M, is this true? If it is, does it effect CS majors or do they use a different building?

I've also heard that FSU has a more C++ based program where as UCF uses a lot of Java, just wondering is this is true or if it's balanced for both.

I would also like to know what kind of companies recruit from each school, internship opportunities, and just general quality of each program and maybe which one you think is better.

Any information that you guys could give me would really, help! I'm just very curious and I find this to be a really hard decision for me because I'm completely torn between the two schools."
1urrvq,40,2014-01-08,"Need help, 18 year old daughter doesn't want to grow up",[deleted],Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1urrvq/need_help_18_year_old_daughter_doesnt_want_to/,"My daughter is 18 years old, and is a freshman in her second semester in college. The problem is, she doesn't do anything but spend time on the internet, playing video games, watching cartoons, or reading children novels. She commutes so she goes to college for a class, comes back home and immediately goes on the internet.  I urged her to get a job, join a club, go to the gym, make new friends, whatever to get her out of the house but nothing worked. She says she will do something whether it may be find an internship or get a job but she doesn't put the effort in doing so. Even when I offered her a job I found from the newspaper she does not take them.  I don't want to force her to do things as she is an adult but now I am starting to feel that I'm going to need to in order to get her life in order. She doesn't know what she wants to do with her life and she doesn't attempt to try. All she does is surf the internet, pass her classes without putting much effort, and she is majoring in evolution ecology yadayadayada. She's only majoring in it because it's the only major that interests her,although there aren't any careers she wants in the field of her major. Oh and not to mention she is very pessimistic, cynical, and has socially anxiety problems. She is afraid of driving, she is afraid of asking an employee a question, she doesn't want to try anything new in fear of failure. 
She spends most of her time in the house, she hasn't made any new friends in college, and now I don't think she's attempting to anymore! College is the time to grow up, to learn things, to become independent, but she doesn't want to do any of these things
I always get in fights with her. I always tell her to change because if she is the way she is for the rest of her life, she will live miserably. My wife says that time will change her. I don't believe that at all and it's because of the lack of effort my daughter makes to change. She doesn't think there's anything wrong with her. We get into arguments, and she always reverts back to ""what if i don't want to grow up? What if I don't want to be independent?"" This is stressing me out day and night, why won't my daughter grow up? She doesn't have any goals, dreams; all she does is live in the present and do whatever makes her happy. That might mean spending the whole day doing useless activities like playing video games. She says she cares about her future but she doesn't do anything to show that. 

Before enrolling in college, she wanted to go to art school. At first I denied her as it is very expensive and  I don't believe a degree in art could lead to a good future, but after seeing her behavior for the past few months in a regular college, now I WANT to send her to an out of state art school just so she could learn to grow up. I tell her she could transfer there now, she can go, and she says she wants to because she is interested in cartooning. But she doesn't apply. She doesn't want to spend hours making a portfolio (a requirement for art school). She would rather spend time surfing the internet, taking classes in a major she is uninterested in getting a job in. I pushed her, I reminded her, but all I get are ""kays"" that mean nothing. 

She is the complete opposite of my other children! My 17 year old son volunteers for the rescue squad, actively participates in his school and community, he is starting to work, he gets excellent grades, and he has big plans for the future. My 14 year old daughter is similar except she is bigger in pursuing her interest in fashion.

What can I do? What can I do to make my daughter realize that I won't be here forever and that someday she will need to get a job, to learn to talk to strangers, to do things she is uncomfortable with? I am considering therapy but I know she won't go as she doesn't think she has a problem. Should I force her? Please anything would help"
1urv5f,1,2014-01-08,"Lonely, frustrated and feeling my dreams slip away",sadphysicist,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1urv5f/lonely_frustrated_and_feeling_my_dreams_slip_away/,"In case my username doesn't give it away, my dream is to become a physicist.

When I was in first grade, I liked math. I was good at it. I liked patterns. I liked seeing how things fit together. Only I was slow at it. All of the math work we did was timed. I got everything right but could never finish in time. One of the room mothers tried to console me when I was sad and embarrassed by telling me not to worry, and that girls don't need math and science. 

I took that to heart. I let myself believe I didn't deserve to go to science fairs, to join chess clubs, to compete at the math olympics. My parents are actors, they didn't encourage me to do any of the above, so I just assumed the joy of science was for other people. 

Then in high school I decided it wasn't. My school had no AP's and didn't even offer precalculus. I fought and fought and fought the administration and the teachers on the subject, put myself through a college physics class, worked at Caltech, and took the SAT three times and six subject tests. Finally, just when I graduated, my school decided to offer precalculus and calculus classes. Too damn late for me. I was left to teach myself how to differentiate and integrate, so I could have a shot at my dream. 

My first semester of college (I'm on winter break from it now) was pretty awful. The physics department is tiny, and for some reason the girls in the department have decided they don't like me and trashed me pretty relentlessly behind my back. I feel totally ostracized at a goddamn women's college. I took two 200-level physics classes and after busting my ass for both of them I ended up with an A in one and a C in the other. My roommate didn't even take her finals and got all this accommodation while I struggled and struggled and just got looked down on. 

I know I did the right thing fighting so hard to get decent math classes for the kids at my high school. But the thing is doing the right thing doesn't make you any friends and it doesn't make you happy. I'm frustrated by the lack of support for the sciences there is at my college, and after battling my way up to talk to the president of the school about how to improve it for everyone, I get rewarded by finding out that a few of the other physics majors were laughing at me with a PROFESSOR. (By the way, this professor's class is the one I got a C in.) My physics teacher in high school also screwed me over when I dared try to improve the system. I spent the whole year working on my senior project, doing my Caltech internship, even helping to write a research paper. She still gave me a C on the project and never responded to my repeated attempts to understand why I got that grade. After all the work I put in, even after I was the top student in her class the entire year. 

I'm so exhausted from fighting for everything. I didn't get into the college I worked so hard for, and now I'm fighting to transfer. I don't believe I deserve this C, and now I'm fighting for a B-. In the meantime I made one friend who isn't even in my grade this semester. I can't face four more years in an environment where girls are going to bully me to PROFESSORS. I have never met physics majors who didn't want to talk about physics, who have so little passion. When I brought up Peter Higgs winning the Nobel Prize, they laughed at me and said, ""Who cares?"" What does a goddamn senior have to gain from bullying a freshman? 

I didn't get into my dream school. I've never won any science fairs. I've never had anyone say, ""Hey, good job,"" or ""You've made a difference."" I love physics-I want so badly to work with people on unlocking the secrets of the universe, and I want so badly to enjoy the beauty of G-d's creation with someone who isn't a bearded rabbi (I spent a lot of time with rabbis this semester.) I'm so afraid that dream is slipping away too. I'm jealous of everyone I know and how damn happy and carefree they seem. I know so many people who just skated by in high school, got everything handed to them, got into the schools they really wanted and just bombed out and didn't do anything, while I'm at a school I hate working all the time and ending up with a C. 

Physics means so much to me and I don't see that passion in any of the other people around me, and yet they get all the attention from the professors, and my dream might just disappear. Just like that. "
1us0qc,12,2014-01-09,How can I shake off work stress?,[deleted],TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1us0qc/how_can_i_shake_off_work_stress/,"I've always had the mindset that my career is one of the most important things in my life. Boyfriend dumps you? Concentrate more on that project you've been working on. Family is irritating you? Hey, you can always stay later/go earlier to avoid their drama! Nothing to do at home? Prep for tomorrow's workload and you'll have nothing to worry about!

The only problem is is that now i'm letting work get to me *too* much. I've been working my ass off to get a promotion coming up in the next few months (I have several opportunities), but other parts of my life are getting the brunt of the stress i've been experiencing at work. The silly conversations I had with my boyfriend in the past are now making me question his maturity level, i've been sleeping a lot more because i'm coming home from work exhausted (I catch myself nodding off at stop lights sometimes, i'm so tired), i've been a lot more *""this is my way, do it or don't do it at all""* at my team members (i'm in management) so I can show upper management how well I perform, and i've been relying on coffee a hell of a lot more than I should to function. 

What made me realize all of this is when I snapped at my boyfriend last Monday. Where I live, we experienced wind chills of -40, the high has been well below zero for the past few days, and I live about 45 minutes away from work. My boyfriend insisted that I just call off to stay safe, but instead of reasoning with him as to why I can't do that, I (and this is word for word and I feel **terrible** for saying it) told him *""you're just an unpaid graduate intern, I'm sure you not going to work today isn't going to make a difference in what they get accomplished for the next few days.""*. 

I know this is long, and half of you probably think i'm a b*tch, but I really can't figure out a way to de-stress. I want this promotion so bad, but I'm not willing to let it ruin other parts of my life. Any advice you guys are willing to throw at me, i'll definitely appreciate it. Thanks :("

Dan Snyder is relaxing in his Potomac, MD mansion in his silk robe and gold fleece slippers. He grabs a glass of Pappy van Winkle 20-year that he sent his intern to purchase on the black market. He relishes in the thought that some peon went through all the trouble to buy the bottle at cost, when he just threw them some pennies from his change purse.

He flips on the television to enjoy the first week of Monday night football. After barely getting by the Jacksonville Jaguars, in a 9-8 nailbiter, he knows the season is off to the right start. The kicker they chose with the 3rd overall pick is truly proving to be a steal, going 3-4 from inside the 20 in his NFL debut. He was definitely worth trading away the rest of the draft and the next five years of 1st round picks.

Plus, he knows that the 8th time was a charm and he finally found the coach he always wanted. At that moment, he hears a familiar voice.

""Well, Mike, I like to call Andrew Luck the Teabagger, cause he loves forcing the ball down the defense's throat.""

That can't be right...how is his coach of the future finding the time to commentate in the booth as well? Isn't he scheduled to massage RG3's knee in 30 minutes? What is J. Gruden thinking? He quickly turns to his Lazy Susan full of iPads, and grabs the mini. He had just moisturized and did not want to hurt his delicate fingers. He pulls up the contract to see if his team of lawyers missed a loophole. That's when he notices...""Jay Gruden"".

Dan had been swindled yet again. He wonders if maybe he can shame this coach into giving up his 10 year contract, since the last thing he wants to do is pay him the guaranteed $10 million/year for the next decade. Knowing there is no way out, he settles for another 9 years of mediocrity. ""Oh well"", he thinks, swirling his glass, ""there's always 2024""."

1utm1n,4,2014-01-09,Once you're a monopoly you no longer need to provide Customer Service,sentury111,CustomerService,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/1utm1n/once_youre_a_monopoly_you_no_longer_need_to/,"This is a repost from my post in r/google where it got roundly rejected and I was blamed for the problems. Hoping here it gets a better reception. If not then I'm probably completely off base and need to stop worrying about it...maybe worried isn't the correct word, but more involved? Ok, moving on. 

It's absurd that no one talks about this, but it must not be needed and all their services are working properly.

If that really is the case I figure 1% have issues and call in once a year the volume could be handled by about a thousand representatives. 

My solution is to have interns they are screening do it as a sort of test. The hiring managers could filter particular problems towards applicants they question skills of in various departments. This way all parties benefit. Intern works harder, making customer happy. Pleasing managers and making executives more money. 

Other companies should apply that same strategy. It helps everyone. Customers being priority number one.

Google has a line to call for people listing their ads and such, Called and waited on hold for 5 hours till battery died. After 10 minutes I just set it to low speaker and did other things. They are a failure in this department.

EDIT: What if your account was compromised and your contact information was changed. Is it your fault? Maybe. Though you now have no access to your account. You can't reset the password because telephone line and security questions have been removed or altered. Should you just give up? 

Example of free services: OTA radio and TV. You can contact various people to fix issues or complain. Point is that someone is there to respond regardless of the level of stupidity of the question or fault of the user. Police, fire, medical and 911 are all examples of free but paid for indirectly. Not everyone pays either. They still call in for various reasons. 

I find it funny that people find this acceptable. Eventually there may become a time when you need to contact them. Or another company. These practices should be unacceptable. 

tl;dr google customer service is non existent. Or like the NSA, try contacting them.

These are the other posts I made

My appologize for if this isn't the right subreddit but I need a little help.  I'm interning at a company and we're experimenting with EXSi 5.1.  However we're trying to keep the hardware costs low (roughly $240).  I was using an AMD Athlon x2 processor before and it worked perfectly... but those processors have been discontinued since.  Currently I'm looking at an AMD A4 processor.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819106013 

What I would liek to know if anyone has any experience using this ESXI on this processor.  And if now, can someone recommend a low cost processor for me to look into for this project.

edit: I want to clarify that the system we're using will have about 4gb of ram, an 80gb hard drive, and some other low cost parts in it.  Like I mentioned earlier I owned a system similar to this with an AMD Athlon x2 and it worked phenomenally.  However I do not know if this processor will work as well.  That is why I'm coming to reddit for help.

Hi guys, I am a college student studying Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science and I made this app in my free time to both learn about programming and provide an easy way for android users to watch tournament VODs in a spoiler free setting.

This is the first app I’ve ever made so it might be a bit rough around the edges but I’ve worked on it for over 6 months in any free time I got so hopefully you guys like it.

My motivation for creating this app stemmed from the summer LCS tournaments. I absolutely loved watching the NA and EU splits on my phone before I went to sleep or during lunch break at my internship. I wanted something slick and easy to navigate without having to dig through a lot of unnecessary information or try to click on small links in a cramped table. With this goal in mind, I worked with the moderators of /r/LoLEventVods to create zzReal .

Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy this app, (sorry iOS users) and I would love any feedback, criticism, bugs or help you may have (zzreal.dev@gmail.com). 

*This app is part of the LoLeventVoDs 2.0 project that will be launched later this month.*

-I have worked with her while in college (we actually go to same uni) for 2 years but over the last 6 months we talk more at work and hangout in groups with other coworkers outside of work.


-She always asks me personal questions like ""Do you date a lot of people that you work with?"" (I did date 2 other people from work but that was years ago) or if I say I'm going to the mall or something or movies she will go ""With a girl?!"" or ""Who did you go to the mall with? a girl?!"" Lots of things like that or if a girl walks by at work (we work in retail) that I know she will go ""Go ask her for her number/ask her out!""


-She doesn't really touch me though or anything, she will compliments my clothes and such (as do I to her) or hold up clothes to me that she thinks I should buy. Or for example on Christmas wanted to wear matching sweaters to work. She will throw things at me though or poke me with things jokingly. 


-She doesn't really text me or if I text her, she doesn't really text me back much, convo will just end randomly. Honestly though I have maybe texted her 10 times though in the past year.


-She brought up to me about 2 months ago about a guy she liked that denied her at school.


-I also can't tell if she is joking or not sometimes. Few days ago I was leaving and told another girl I work with I was going to the movies, girl I like over hears this and says ""You going on a date?"" I said ""ya with you"" she goes ""I work till 10 though"" I said ""well thats gonna be awkward for me since the movie is at 9:30"" She goes ""no date with me is awkward unless you make it awkward"". I didn't know what to say cause I didn't know if she was serious or not so I chickened out.


-Also I'm quitting this job for an internship next week and when I told her she was sad that she wouldn't see me and whose gonna compliment her (Like I said we point out when eachother looks good) and that I'll find a new girl at my new job and date her blah blah.


-Saw her two days ago when I went to work and she goes ""Aw you came to see me?! (super happy). So I figured good time to ask her out. She says something like she some super old guy asked her out. I made a joke and said so if I asked you out, would you say no to me? She said probably....



Do I give up? She flirts with me a lot, but that ""probably"" seems to me like she doesn't like me..






---

**tl;dr**
-Known a girl coworker for 2 years (I'm quitting next week)
-She asks personal questions about other girls (if I'm hanging with them, what do I do for fun with them, I should ask that girl out, do I date alot, etc...)
-Started talking to her more in the last 6 months.
-Dont really text her much (she isnt like normal girls attached to their phone either though) and she did bring up to me getting rejected by a guy 2 months ago
-Always happy to see me and really only guy she talks to at work.
-Joked and said so if I asked you out you would say no? She said probably"

(CA),curtainlikeobstacles,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1uumxc/girlfriend_is_having_a_great_deal_of_trouble_with/,"My girlfriend has had a steady job her whole life and throughout her school internships (we're still in university for another year) has made good money from great companies. She's very responsible.

However, she's having a massive amount of trouble getting a credit card. 

I know this must be partly in fact that her parents (who are not very good with money and have a very low credit score) asked for her SIN one day to help them out with a cell phone bill, and they ended up not paying it until the collections agency came to her demanding the money. She realizes she shouldn't have given her the SIN, but it was truly just trying to help her parents out, and the implications of that scenario seem to reflect on her, when in reality she's not fully to blame.

Long story short, she's a very responsible girl and quite frankly I'd trust her with a credit card more than I would myself (and I have one). What are her options for getting one in Canada/or just general credit tips? She applied to the Bank of Montreal as well as a few others, the Bank of Montreal one being a student card and they denied her based on the report from equifax.

We're at the point in our lives where we'd like to build credit, and a credit card is a very inconvenient thing *not* to have. She just feels really defeated and I want to help.

He is done now, she leaves sobbing and cursing, but he is satisfied, barely feeling the cut. The street was empty, with only the sound of distant traffic, and so he begins his long, planned out walk back to the apartment, and after a few blocks he starts humming, the weather tonight is lovely. The door to apartment 815 locks and he undresses, the soiled clothes fall to the floor and he falls into bed. He thought tonight had been great, but as he tosses in his bed he feels a twinge of pain in his hand. 

He remembers now, the scissors. She was more resourceful then he expected, her small, frantic hands pulling them out from her bag, had she had a second more, he could be missing an eye, but he reacted fast, receiving only a small cut on his hand before he threw them across the alley. His hand swung back and landed on her face with a strong and sudden force before returning to her thighs. He slept peacefully, as he had time and time before.  

Red, red in the morning. He rises from bed after a dreamless sleep, but as he looks back to the bed he finds red on his white pillow, and red on his hand, and struggles to remember where he kept the bandages. He puts away the clothes from last night, and makes a mental note not to wear those same clothes again for a few weeks. Before he leaves, he looks on his laptop to check if his payment for his mother’s medical bills went through.

Black, black coat, black suit, and black shoes, he blends in with the crowds, hundreds of tiny clouds from hundreds of people, appearing and disappearing as the cold air meets their breathes, the walk to the firm always seems much longer in the cold. As he walks something shines in his eyes, and sees someone in the alleyway

Tall and dark, black pants with a black hoodie draped over his head, and he was holding something shiny and metallic in his hands. Their eyes met, but before he can clearly register him, the crowd pushes and shoves him forward. The man is now gone, lost in the crowds. He thought he looked familiar.

Blue, blue walls, blue screens, blue eyes, the man works in his cubicle, filling numbers into the blank spaces, black ink, some red ink, coffee, and calculators, this is his little world, in his little cubicle. A young blonde intern drinking coffee passes his cubicle, and he can smell her when she’s near. She doesn’t notice him, few at the firm did. A few cubicles down he sees a large women with a black wart on her is cheek slicing paper into small slips with her scissors, slice slice. Though he had worked there for three years, he still couldn’t remember most of his co-workers by name, with the exception of the Intern Colleen of course, and often he wondered how long he go without knowing. He guessed he could go on indefinitely, he cared little for them, and he believed the feelings were mutual. Slice slice, the sound made his cut hurt.

He was three steps out of the building when he was hit by the cold. It cut through instantly, taking all the heat with it, he left is coat at his desk. The lights were turning off in the building, and almost everyone had left. Shivering, he heads back into the building.

 The elevator takes him straight to his office floor, but it was different. The floor during the day was bright and busy, people crammed into their tiny cubicles, the constant chatter of phones, printers, and air conditioners, and the bright white of Florissant lights, but now it was dark, still, and quiet.
He looks around the fields of empty cubicles, only few dim florescent lights are on now, and no one else was there. He walks between the rows of cubicles, inside them photos of children, overflowing waste bins, and empty chairs. He hums to himself, and the nameless tune echoes in the stale office air. He reaches his desk, the coat hung around his chair, but there was something on his desk, and he starts to sweat.

 Neatly placed between his aging Dell computer and desk chair is a pair of scissors, sharp and shining. He looks up from his cubicle but again, he is alone. He thinks of the woman with the wart and her endless slicing, but she left hours ago, and remembered no one else using scissors that day. The lights were going dim, and now only the light above the elevator remained bright. He walks back to the elevator, the floor seems twice as large, cubicles being where he never saw them before, and familiar landmarks like the ancient copy printer where nowhere to be seen. The air smells of burnt coffee and body odor. He is nearly at the elevator when a desk chair moves behind him. 

“Hello?” he whispers. Silence, only silence. The lights at the end of the office fade, and now he can no longer see to his desk. In the corners of his eyes, desk lamps, filing cabinets, and water coolers become figures in the dark, silent as cobwebs grow around them. He hears only the sound of his heavy breathing and the carpet squishing under his feet. Finally at the elevator, he presses the down arrow button. A familiar, metallic sound echoes in the office.

Slice slice

He is not alone. Over and over he taps the button, down down down! In the dark a sound is growing, the squishing of carpet, and the light above him starts to flicker. Tap tap tap, the elevator does nothing. “Whose there?” he asks, but no response from the dark. The squishing of carpet had become footsteps.

Ring. He jumps as the elevator opens and runs inside. The last light goes out as the doors to the office close. Alone in the elevator, he looks down at his hand, he sees red."

I'm a student in my second year studying computer engineering at KU. I live in the Kansas City area, and I'm looking for an internship for this summer.

I went to the career fair hosted by my university and sent out applications to a few companies. However, I'm not really interested in any of the companies I applied to. While the pay would be good, I don't believe I want a internship at a company with an HR department. I've been told time and again by people more experience than I that there's a strong correlation between the type of company you intern for and the type of company for which you work.

That being said, I'm looking for an internship with a small startup in the area. I want to be in an environment with creative, driven people with their own unique ideas. At this stage of the game, money is less of a factor than hands on experience doing what I want to do in the setting in which I want to do it.

Do you folks have any tips on getting my resume into the right hands? Any suggestions on how to make myself more involved with the KC startup scene? Thanks guys."

1uvjlk,1,2014-01-10,My [23f] boyfriend [21m] is getting taken advantage of by a mutual friend [20f] and I'm so turned off by it,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1uvjlk/my_23f_boyfriend_21m_is_getting_taken_advantage/,"June 2013 my boyfriends male roommate rented out his room to a female mutual friend of their's (and now mine) who's live in boyfriend had just broken up with her. It was supposed to just be for a month, as she had a summer job in the area and the original roommate was going away for an internship. I was also away for 6 weeks on vacation. Due to a bunch of coincidences, the original roommate ended up deciding he was going to just move out, her job contract got extended, and she's now been there ever since. 
I have several problems with her being there.

 A) She's my boyfriend's ex's older sister. He dated the ex in high school so it's not really a big deal but she was his first and I hate hearing about her all the time. I don't care that they're friends, but being roommates is just a little too close for comfort. 

B) She has never paid the original roommate back the full deposit, so my boyfriend is getting shit from the original roommate and has all this stress on his shoulders to pay the deposit back when it should be her who's replacing it. He asks about it, but not nearly often or seriously enough. It's been over half a year now, and they still don't have it. 

C) She doesn't ever pay rent on time, and sometimes not in full either. She transfers money from another bank account in another currency and the conversion means that often she is substantially short. Since she gives her rent to him and he pays the landlord, he is often a full month late from waiting on her, because he can't cover her difference and still eat for the month. They have gotten numerous letters from the administration and yet my boyfriend still hasn't had a serious talk with her. 

I'm disgusted with my boyfriend. We have had so many fights about it, because I just feel like he's being a complete and total pussy. Why is he practically paying this girl's rent, and putting his security of a home on the line for her? I know it's not really my place to butt in, because we don't have any shared finances, but I'm getting increasingly fed up with the situation. On top of it, this girl is a friend of mine too, should I just straight up tell her to pay up or GTFO? 

---   
**tl;dr**: boyfriend is living with a mutual friend who doesn't pay rent on time or in full, hasn't paid the deposit, and I'm sick of him not doing anything about it. "
1uvjxs,11,2014-01-10,I [F/22] realized I've just been fooling myself into thinking my SO [M/24] of two years is emotionally available,psychonaut_blues,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1uvjxs/i_f22_realized_ive_just_been_fooling_myself_into/,"I missed all the red flags at first. I eventually realized he was bad for me, but he changed for the better before I had made up my mind to leave him. With all his positive changes, I thought that our relationship was evolving into something of actual substance and intimacy. I realize now that I was wrong, and his unavailability just manifests itself in less overt ways than before.

I have no doubt that part of him loves me, or at least is very attached to me. But he's incapable of being emotionally available. He says he tries to share his feelings with me, but I see very little effort on his part. I realize I know very little of his inner world. Half the time when I'm talking with him, I feel as if the wall would listen better and give more of a response. Most attempts at dealing with problems or conflict end in frustration because he usually shuts down.

He doesn't commit to plans for the future. When I ask him where he wants to go or what he wants to do after he finishes his local internship, he won't give an answer or says he hasn't thought about it. He insists that I'm always part of the picture, yet when he talks to people about our situation or our plans or whatever, he never refers to ""us"" or ""we."" It's always ""I,"" even if I'm present and it's something we're doing or decided together. Fuck that. Once a relationship supposedly becomes serious enough that you share a living space and finances, some things cease to be ""I"" and become ""we."" It just shows how little he even thinks about our life as a couple. It's all about him.

I have had pretty much zero romance from him since we became exclusive, despite my attempts to tell him I'd like some occasionally. Even birthdays and anniversaries go by with little effort put forth in his part. I try to do romantic things for him fairly frequently, and it sucks feeling like I'm the only one trying.

He resists change, even for the sake of his health, and gets terribly defensive during any discussions or conflicts in which a flaw of his comes up, no matter how sensitively or nicely it's approached. If a flaw if mine is pointed out, I apologize for how it may have hurt or upset him and try to work on it. He would rather pretend his/our problems don't exist than deal with them. But it's a totally different story if he has a problem with me. And god forbid anyone even mention trying counseling.

Why did I stay with him this long if he's this way? I love him deeply. He's not all bad. We share a child-like sense of fun and imagination. Our goals in life are very similar. We have a ton in common. He's very physically affectionate and loves to cuddle. He has always called and texted when he said he would. He's pretty wonderful in a lot of ways. Just as much as he's not wonderful in a lot of ways. I know he loves me too, as hard as it may be for you to believe from the glimpse you get of him in this post, but now i can be realistic about how things really are. Beyond love, it was mostly delusion that kept me with him. The delusion that his good things could make up for his bad things, that his changes meant we could truly be close now. He was and continues to be emotionally unavailable. 

He's in denial about a lot of things about himself, and I bet if he just cut the shit and saw how it really is, he'd actually try to change. He turned his life around and finished school, he says because of my love and support. He's just not willing to see his deeper issues yet. He says I'm the best thing that has ever happened to him, and I believe it. I'm the first girlfriend he's had who hasn't cheated on him and treated him like crap. I've tried in every way I know could to be the best girlfriend I can. But I've changed, and I see now that, no matter how much he may love me, he will never be able to have a truly intimate relationship with anyone until he takes a good, honest look at himself.

I have grown a lot in the past 6-8 months or so. I've learned a lot about myself and come to love myself in a way I never have before. I like working on myself and trying to become a better person. Reading over my journal entries from our relationship made me so sad. I've been settling for someone who doesn't want to or can't truly commit to me and be intimate with me, and it's taken a huge toll on me mentally and physically. I'm exhausted and stressed out. I love him and want his happiness, but I can't sacrifice myself for him.  I don't know if this is the end. I know it will hurt him deeply if or when I end things, and it kills me. But I have to do what I have to do.

I'm so tired that I can't think straight anymore, and I've made myself sick from the stress. It's time to try to sleep.

I'm going to bet there's still some delusion on my part about his supposed good qualities.

TL;DR I've grown as a person, while he stagnates, and realized that he's emotionally unavailable. I'm assuming I should get out, but part of me hopes that he loves me enough to try to change if he sees how dire an issue it is. I know it's probably silly to hope. Fuck, this hurts."

My girlfriend started exercising and carefully planning her food back in October. We've been together for over a year and I was in another city from September to Christmas for an internship. I love her very very much. 4 days ago, we moved in together and we're having a lot of issues adapting to it. One of the biggest issues is her food. She carefully plans and counts every calorie (awesome!) and has asked me not to bring any junk food into the house, which is perfectly reasonable. I messed that up last night, NEVER AGAIN.

Anyway, since I moved in I've been very busy assembling furniture, reorganizing the place, optimizing space, cleaning, etc, putting between 4-10 hours of that sort of work per day on top of going to school full time. Obviously I haven't had time to cook and I've been living off microwaveable meals. Yesterday, I bought a meat pie and she didn't like that. I'm trying to be respectful of the massive amount of work she put into losing weight in the last few months. Personally, I need a LOT of calories every day. I'm a 22 y.o skinny (150 lbs) 6'1 guy, I normally drink ~500ml of milk and about the same amount of juice per day, tons of pasta, etc. I feel weak, tired and confused when I don't eat enough.

How can we reconciliate our different eating styles? I know that if I put apple juice for myself in the fridge, it'll disappear almost instantly. She told me that I can't leave my (cooked, not only those shitty ones from the store) meal leftovers in the fridge because she'd eat them. She has no problem cooking say 4 portions of food for herself and eating only 1 at a time, though, which is great. She can avoid unhealthy food at the store and during the day, but it's a problem when it's in the house. We don't have the space nor the money for a second fridge and I need to eat, too. I've been trying to eat more while I'm at school and less at home, but it's not enough, we need a better solution. I don't want to destroy her progress.

Also, she stopped exercising during the holidays and she's having a hard time picking it up again. She HATES being nagged/reminded to work out. How can I encourage her to get back into it? I already try to be as accomodating as possible when she wants to work out and try to congratulate and make her feel good about herself after workouts. Her exercise is bodyweight workouts at home because she doesn't have time for the gym. She used to have a dedicated space for that, but now with my stuff in the house that space is gone. There's now more space in the living room, but locking up the cat in the bathroom is something she hates having to do. We're both stressed like never before, so that probably doesn't help either. Any tips and suggestions?

She's a regular in this sub and I'm sending her the link to this post so we can discuss it.

Please tell us all your ideas!

Thanks!

TL;DR How can we peacefully share the fridge (please read, the details matter) and how can I be more supportive?"

1uvtax,22,2014-01-10,Tomorrow I am going to let down my boss. I just can't deal with self guilt right now. Not sure how I am going to sleep or even talk to him tomorrow.,egzaaa,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1uvtax/tomorrow_i_am_going_to_let_down_my_boss_i_just/,"Alright, so I need to take this off my chest. I just need to write this somewhere, might as well be here. If you have any insights to share with me, feel free to do it.

My ""boss"" (not really a boss, just a guy who gives me work from time to time), asked me to do something back in November. I misjudged the amount of time I needed to put into it, I procrastinated, I eased off, and I am supposed to hand the work back to him tomorrow. I have about half of it done.

The thing is, this guy was always good to me. I am 21 yo, and before I even graduated from university I was already working with him, I never let him down. I started to do ""entry-level"" jobs, filling in spreadsheets, sending emails, that type of stuff that he couldnt do due to the amount of work he had on his hands.

Early this week he asked me how was the work that he asked me to do, and I lied. I said ""oh its pretty much done, lets schedule a meeting for next weekend"". I thought I could do it during this week. Well, I couldn't.

To make things worse, during the week he talked to me about the next things we wanted me to do. Serious things now, not ""entry-level"" intern bullshit. Things that I would really enjoy doing.

Now, I just don't know how am I going to tell Im that I didn't do what he asked me to do. I am going to let him down, and this is the worse time to do it. Now that he asked me to do some serious stuff... 

I really feel like shit. Hopefully he won't freak out. But I am sure he will. I can't blame him.

To make things worse, he only speaks english. And as you might tell from this post, english is not my main language. So I am going to let down someone that trusted me, and try to justify my fuck up in a language thats not even my main language. This is just great.


EDIT: **UPDATE:** So I didn't wait until tomorrow and I went to talk to him right away. It was ridiculously easy, I told him ""Hi, I need to talk to you... I can't have that thing you asked done by tomorrow as I said"". He didn't even asked why, just asked how much time I needed, I told him and he said that was fine, to not worry about it. And then proceeded to talk about coming up things. 

I felt like this was not as a big of a deal for him as it was for me. I feel like I am 1 Ton. lighter.

This does not make my lack of discipline and professionalism acceptable, put at least I know that I didn't made him upset. And that was what I was afraid of.

phew...

So now I will finish this. Thanks for everything guys, you're truly awesome! And learn from my mistakes as I did!"

1uvu1j,5,2014-01-10,[27M] feeling tempted to contact my estranged ex [26F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1uvu1j/27m_feeling_tempted_to_contact_my_estranged_ex_26f/,"Right when I got out of high school, I dated a girl for about four years.  We hit it off incredibly well, went to music festivals together, learned a lot about life together, and generally had a good time.  Our lives were very intertwined after a few years, we had all the same friends, etc.  However, looking back, I displayed a lot of signs of co-dependency with this relationship.  I said ""I love you,"" within the first couple of weeks, and in general I think I was borderline obsessed with this girl.  I chalk most of that up to her being my ""first love,"" and what have you, but it's important to keep in mind.
 
After a few years of this, things started going south.  At this time I was primarily focused on smoking pot and playing Super Mario Galaxy on her Wii than anything else.  I had taken a semester off from school, and when I was in school I wasn't really serious about it.  She was more focused on going to class and trying to graduate, and otherwise making more adult decisions.  It was just a matter of time before we broke up, and ultimately that time came sometime in the summer of 2009.

After the break-up we tried to do the whole 'staying friends' thing, as most of our friends were mutual, but it really didn't work out.  I got heavy into drinking and pills, and in a desperate attempt to escape my turmoil, packed up and moved several states away.  Eventually I ran out of money and had to come back to my hometown (where she lives), and we hooked up a couple of times, but never really established a relationship.  I started getting more serious with school and had made plans to move about three hours away in Fall of 2010, and at this point she had started a relationship with another guy.  In a bout of drunken frustration I said some things that I didn't really mean, I just wanted to try to hurt her feelings.  Something along the lines of ""I hope someone causes as much heartbreak to you as you've caused me,"" to which she replied something along the lines of ""That's not a nice thing to say, good luck in school,"" and we parted ways and haven't really talked since then.  I opted to delete her number from my phone, remove her and most of our mutual friends from facebook, and just cut ties with her in general in order to try to repair myself emotionally.

Now I am going to say some cliché things like, I really never had a sense of closure with this relationship.  I feel like during our last encounter I very poorly expressed my feelings.  She shows up in my dreams with some regularity still to this day.  Sometimes every night for a week, sometimes only once or twice in a few months.  I got sober in the summer of 2011, and with that I feel that I have gotten more honest and in touch with my feelings.  Recently, I have started a full time internship, and she has started showing up in my dreams again.  

In short, I am tempted to try to contact her again.  There are a couple more facts worth mentioning:  As far as I know, she is still with the guy she started dating after we broke up.  I have been involved in about a dozen short term relationships since we broke up, most of those were during the first year after our break-up when I was still using.  

Am I being too obsessive?  Should I learn to accept the fact that things were good, then they got fucked up and I need to try my best to forget about it?  I'm not really sure what I need to do.  Thanks for any replies, and sorry for the lengthy post.

**TL;DR: Was in a four year relationship with a girl that was peaches and cream until it wasn't.  I haven't talked with her in several years, she still shows up in my dreams often, and sometimes I catch myself thinking about her.  Should I try to contact her again?**"

2nd year EE student in Texas looking for a summer internship or undergraduate study opportunity.

Professionally, I've spent time in the IT world doing network and server development, specifically for small to medium businesses, often involving some open-source spin. So my inclination is toward residential and micro-grid solar design/deployment. I'd also consider general small- and medium-scale construction work revolving around the planning and wiring.

Geographically, I'm willing to go pretty much anywhere for the right opportunity. Planning on leaving Texas when I'm done (projected Sum/Fall 2015), thinking of head for a handful of possible places including Washington, Oregon, California, NY or South Carolina.

Been scouring Indeed.com by state for relevant internships and thought I'd throw up a flare on here as well!

Thanks in advance!"

I am a professional Hollywood script reader.  I am considered part of the coveted Hollywood inner circle known as ""development.""  I've read for a-list directors/producers, studio writers, managers, agencies, and a few professional coverage services.  I will not name places, as I wish to remain anonymous.  

I verified all the above with one of the moderators here.  My job has some pretty strict NDAs attached.

Feel free to ask me any questions you think might help you make it past us gatekeepers.  I will respond throughout the day.  

For those of you wanting to know how I got into the profession, it was really a wonderful bit of luck.  I am a former working model who came to L.A. to pursue law school.  After graduating, I found I hated the practice, so I went into something more creative.  This meant I had to start back at ""square one"" and work as a development intern for a startup script reading company that is now well-known.  From there, well, I just kept doing my job and doing it well.  Eventually, people started paying me to do it.  I hear it is a job that not everybody does well, but it comes to me naturally.  It is my niche.  

Alright, ask me some questions!  I spend most of my days passing on writers, so it'd be nice to stop and take some time to really help you guys out as best I can!

EDIT:  Your questions were all so amazing.  I'm gonna go start my weekend with a bottle of wine!  I hope I was able to shed some light on some issues for you guys.  I'll try to respond to any unanswered questions some other time over the weekend.  I hope you all keep writing in this new year, because you certainly won't know if you have what it takes if you don't try!  

EDIT 2- 01/11/2014 830 AM PST:  I am answering the last remaining questions.  Honestly, this was such an enlightening experience for me.  I hope you all managed to get something out of it, too!  Thank you, mods, for letting me do this AMAA!  "

1uxko9,4,2014-01-10,"I'm thankful this subreddit exists [Trigger Warnings] (Sorry, this is a long post.)",[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1uxko9/im_thankful_this_subreddit_exists_trigger/,"I recently stumbled across this subreddit and at first I didn't think much of it. But it quickly hit closer to home than I wanted to admit.

On an almost daily basis I have mental arguments with my own NMom. I'm constantly running through arguments we've had in the past where I wanted to stand up and say something or express my feelings, but in the moments they happened I was more than subordinate and wanted to take care of her when she was hurt by ""emotional meltdowns.""

Some of the biggest events I can recall include when I was a teenager and trying to deal with my father's death, she would tell me stories of how horrible he was then recant it with, ""Now please do not think I'm speaking badly of your father. He was a good man who gave me two wonderful children, but...""

I went to a racist and extremely christian high school. I'm gay. She always told me I should trust her with anything and she'd be there for me. My family is also very religious. I decided one morning to tell her I was gay after listening to her bash on my other friends who had recently come out to hopefully put it in perspective for her. I was emotionally exhausted from telling her and then her telling everyone in the family and checking in with my school.  The teachers who reacted quickly to let me know I was not allowed to talk to other students and I was to sit by myself in every class and every social activity was enough to drive my depression.

Dealing with coming out, no interaction allowed at school, and a dead father by the age of 15...I was depressed.  I started cutting. I needed to punish myself because I was never good enough. I remember the day after school when my mother was upset I was doing poorly in my school work and not being active enough around the house. She yelled at me to come upstairs. I had just punished myself in the bathroom and threw on a long shirt.  As I stood there while she screamed at me, she looked down and saw blood dripping onto the floor. She grabbed my arm, shoved my sleeve up and her response was, ""Why did you do this to me?""

She had me discuss my emotional problems and fantasies of being gay with her family practitioner who suggested I pray and accept the Lord into my life as well as my savior. I started lying to him about the boys I had crushes on the next session we had and told him I knew it was a phase, too. It was the exact same thing I now heard from the teachers at my school. (I graduated high school in 2002, so this isn't something that was 'unheard of back in the 1950's era of intolerance.) 

After high school, I went to junior college. I became an RA. I was involved in school activities. I did theatre! I was doing well. I ended up doing a local internship with a film company who, luck would have it, I was able to work with some incredible celebrities. NMom wanted to make sure she was able to participate and bring food on set. It was mostly small and local, but I didn't see much harm in it.  She took it over. Food and baked goods every day. Any celebrity she liked before, if they didn't appreciate their pie, they were now one of those ""divas"" you hear about on the the news.

I ended up personally befriending another smaller known celebrity. She escapes to my area of the world so we can exist together and be normal just as I escape to her area of the world to be normal.  NMom has to be a part of this. Home cooked meals, grandma's recipes, and promises of babysitting for my friend. When I visit my friend, nmom has to make her presence known and has actually interrupted the shows my friend makes to the point her coworkers cannot stand to have my mother call or have me around on their set anymore in case she calls.  (Yes, nmom does have tracking on my phone so she can know where I am but will call, and call, and call until I answer to make sure I'm okay and demands to talk to those around me to confirm this. Then brag on Facebook about who she was just on the phone with.)

I was accepted into a film program at collegiate level and wanted to get away from home. Unfortunately, I dealt with a stalker from my program and ended up in a highly abusive relationship with a local drug dealer. Police were involved, nmom pulled me from the program and due to her connections, 2 days later after my ex was arrested for B&amp;E and arrested for hitting me, I was accepted into the theatre program of a big ten school without applying. 

Surprise, after 160+ credits under my name, an order of protection against my ex, dealing with a stalker, moving back in with her, and entering a program I had no interest in at 18 credit hours a semester, I failed. She made sure I knew the strings she pulled to get me into the program and how it was her personal image on the line because I quickly dropped out close to the end of the semester.

I broke down. Depression came over me. I wasn't able to handle anything. I was crying constantly. I wanted a new start. I hated how I looked. I shaved my head. But I wanted to pick myself up and have a talk with her, my supposed best friend I could talk to about anything. I put on a winter hat, laid out how I would ask for help, ran through my lines, I did everything I could. She came home. Her first response was to tell me to take off my cap. I did so, in tears while telling her I needed to talk to her, and she lunged at me when she saw my head. How dare I ruin everything she's ever done for me and why did I always feel like giving up was the answer to anything?! I should know better! She raised me better than to be a quitter! Two colleges in less than a year I've dropped out of. I ran out of her door as she grabbed my coat I was wearing, screaming at me. I was homeless. I couch surfed. I felt weak. I couldn't get anywhere. I eventually came back to her home because it was all I felt like I could return to (though I know better now.)

I had to apologize for being as disrespectful as I was to her and apologize for her hurting her knees as she fell when she grabbed my coat and I ran out of her home months before. 

Depression quickly sank in and I tried to kill myself. I waited until she fell asleep, I wrote my apology note to her on my body, cried, and swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills. I don't know how I survived or why, but I woke up to her checking my pulse hours later. I felt like shit. She placed the blame on sleeping pills making people do weird things in their sleep and now she only brings it up as a warning to others if they take that medication, they may way up with writing on their arms and legs.

Unfortunately my grandmother died who left me some money. With that money, I made a down payment on my own home. I needed to get out. I got a job that paid for me to finish school on my own terms. I was able to get on the Dean's list and get a degree. Things were going well. I had my own space. But nmom still needed to see me each week. I felt like I was finally in a place where I might be able to handle that. My older brother was doing it and she was always making him exquisite dinners and doing his laundry. How bad could it be?

It's bad. Now we're current. It's been a few years since I've been in my own place. Every weekend I help her with her errands and her interests. I've tried sharing things I would like to do, but they're shut down. So we do the things she needs help doing with either her church work, community involvement, her help with hospice, help around the house, or listening to her complain about how cousins, aunts or uncles are all horrible people. I asked her to help my boss with a community involvement project seeing as that might interest her, but it turned into nmom telling my boss how I never let her over to my house because I'm such a slob. To prove a point, I let my nmom come over after I had, or thought I had, cleaned everything I could. The moment she stepped inside she let me know it made her uncomfortable to be in my filth, I didn't clean enough, and she saw dust on a shelf. (Mind you, this woman could have a home literally feature on hoarders. She even jokes about it when people come over. People have injured themselves trying to walk around her house.) I finally got in her face and told her the reason I don't let her come over is because her reaction is to disrespect her host and how I have never mentioned the condition of her own home when I enter. Her response was literally, ""Now you know how I feel when you refuse to eat my food.""

What the FUCK does that even mean?

Whenever we are in groups of people, she loves to share the moments when I had troubles coping with life, but she was there to save me and if only more parents were like her to their children.

We recently had a family dinner during the holidays where she made, ""My favorite dinner!"" and it's been a family recipe for generations. She was gloating on and on about it before I let her know it was never my favorite meal, but it's a good comfort food for most people. For the first time in almost 30 years, she sat down to ask me what snacks and food I actually enjoy so she could make sure it was available to me when I came to visit. I saw a spark of hope with it and appreciated the gesture of her finally fucking asking me a question about what I personally enjoy, only to be shot down tonight because I wasn't responding to her texts quickly enough and she couldn't read my attitude. (My phone was charging in another room and I was making dinner for myself.)

I can't even have a relationship with anyone without her literally checking their criminal and driving record, showing up on dates or the day after a first date, and fucking Facebook. She adds all of them.

I know this is a huge wall of text and I am so sorry. I don't expect anyone to read this, but I needed it to get out. I can't handle this back and forth and I'm not even sure where I can go from here. I think I'm too damaged. I do my best to stay quiet, I don't want to kick up a fuss, I don't want to make waves, and I want to stay hidden."
1uxpil,1,2014-01-10,"Great Salary, great benefits: And I want out of this new job",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1uxpil/great_salary_great_benefits_and_i_want_out_of/,"I better start from the beginning. I got an internship right out of college, and got hired on full time within a month. I did well and eventually got a promotion within a few months, and things were going well. It wasn't a glamorous job; but I dealt with interesting challenges and I was able to gain some great experience.

I guess I was doing well enough that management thought I could take on the task of supporting one of the company's more problematic business units. This unit was so bad, that a lot predecessors had left the company after supporting them.

To summarize my experiences with this business unit, it was HORRIBLE: poor leadership, no communication, and a lot of bad situations. I tried my best to improve the group, but it never lead to any sort of progress with them. I reached a burnout eventually. It was so bad, I was even experiencing some medical problems. I communicated my problems and frustrations with my manager, but nothing was being done. 

Eventually, I saw job posting from a good company with what looked like a good job. I did my research, applied, nailed the interviews, and got a job offer an hour after my second-round interview. I eventually accepted, and turned in two-week notice. A lot of my colleagues were upset, but thought it was good career move for me.

This new job gave me great salary, good benefits, and an easy commute. Sounds perfect right? After working the new job for two months, however, I want out. They don't assign me anything to do, and the work they do assign me is ridiculously easy. I have made multiple requests for additional work or even some sort of special project to keep me busy for a full day. My requests have been a complete failure, and I'm really questioning why they even needed an additional person on their team. 

Since I had a lot of down-time at this new job, I had a lot time to think about my situation and how unfulfilling this new career was. I eventually thought about going back to my old job. Minus the horrible business unit, I absolutely missed the old company I worked for. 

I got the courage to send my old boss an email describing my situation, and asked if I could come back. I got a response within a week, and asked that I meet her for coffee. Our meeting lasted a while, and I pretty much laid everything out there as to why I left in the first place and what I needed to do better ensure we were both on the same page going forward. She laid out her frustrations with me leaving and discussed what would be done differently if they did accept my proposal. Overall, it was a productive conversation, and I’m confident they’ll bring me back.

Now, I’m at this point where I need to burn a bridge if I go back to my old company. Regardless of how I turn in my resignation at this newer job, they’re not going be happy with me. The company and I have wasted each other’s time. Frankly, though, I couldn't care less what they think of me."
1uyhev,0,2014-01-11,"Very early draft of my major work, any comments are welcome :)",unluckyguy13,DestructiveReaders,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1uyhev/very_early_draft_of_my_major_work_any_comments/,"“Please note the rules are on the walls Merissa. If you ever get confused you can just look around.”
The walls were plastered with them. Everywhere there was an exhaustive list of rules and regulations that determined what everyone should do in every situation imaginable, as well as the consequences should you not comply. To Dr Abel the hospital had always run like a rusty, old clock. Designed for perfect synchrony while the parts refused to budge. It was annoying really. An annoyance in an otherwise efficient process. A reason why Dr Abel tried to keep everything in his little section of the hospital running smoothly, including the training of his new intern.

“And most importantly you have to remember that the psychiatric patients must never leave their holding cells unless it is in their schedule and they’re escorted by a guard. Otherwise it can be both damaging for their behaviourist therapy and dangerous should the patient be unstable.”
Each time he spoke she would write down a few key notes before holding the book close to her chest. Reservedly, she followed the doctor as he gave her a tour of the hospital. She felt sorry for the patients. Each one isolated in their own cell only to be released for their sessions and showers. It must have shown on her face because Mr Abel commented immediately.

“What’s wrong Merissa? I know this can be a little overwhelming for an intern but...”

“Oh no, it’s not that. I don’t know, I feel a little bad for the patients I guess.”

Dr Abel remembered when he first came to the hospital and how he had felt largely the same.

“Indifference is a necessary evil, Merissa. Empathy is a positive experience, a reward. Something that cannot be handed to negative behaviour or it becomes acceptable. You have to learn to hide your emotions if you want to work here, otherwise you’re just making it harder for the patients to reform. It’s difficult, but necessary.”
Merissa carefully jotted down what he had said, and then they continued.

“Why are the showers in separate rooms? Doesn’t that make it harder to avoid any problems?”

“Ahh, good question. It’s easier to explain if you can see.”

Dr Abel pushed open the door and gestured inside. Merissa followed the direction awkwardly as she avoided bumping into him. She was surprised to find a modern bathroom in a strange state of disrepair.

“The shower head is inside the roof for good reason. You’d be surprised how many patients tried to hang themselves from it. Best just to remove the temptation. The sink is a flat basin, so most of the water flows onto the floor. This just stops them from drowning or anything…”

To be honest she was disgusted by the state of the bathroom. There were weeds growing from nearly all the drains and a dark, blackish-brown substance was dripping from the shower nozzle in the roof. There was even a raised tile corner that had been filed down, but not before some blood had stained the surface. 

“I know what you’re thinking Merissa, but it’s for a reason. Everything is for a reason. The patients should never want to stay in hospital, it’s counter intuitive. The pressure to change is imperative to their therapy.”

She understood the logic, but couldn’t help but look for an alternative. Nevertheless she took notes. 

“That’s enough of the hospital I think. Let me show you my office and where you’ll be working.”
This time Dr Abel didn’t bother to hold the door as he walked briskly past the holding cells. Merissa followed close behind as the pleading eyes of the patients followed her. Some were angry, while others were fearful and scared. Others begged for things like proper toiletries and beds.

“Please, anything to make the pain go away…” pleaded one of the patients, and Dr Abel stopped. He turned to the frail man who had spoke from behind rusted iron bars and looked at him.

“You want an escape? Some drugs maybe? A pill to fix everything?”

“Please sir anything…”

“DON’T. BE. WEAK.” Scoffed Dr Abel, before continuing towards his office.

I've scoured through some of the car subreddits and it always seems that this question is answered with ""never ever lease"" but I don't really believe in absolutes and think my situation is kind of unique. So I'd like to ask some pros.

Here's my situation:

I'm a recent grad, 22yrs old. I got an internship with a big tech company right after school and was hired full time a few weeks after my internship started, I'm originally from NY and this job is in Mass. More so, it was New York City ---&amp;gt; Central Mass. My needs for a car went from no need at all to being dependent on four wheels to do anything, I've spent a fortune on local cabs and have carpooled so many times its unbelievable, either way.. it's time to purchase a car.

Eventually I'd like to move back to NYC, but this job has been a great opportunity and I've been put in a position where I could move up quickly, so I might be here for longer than I had thought. This uncertainty leads me to believe that leasing might be a better option, I don't want to lease to get a new car every 2-3 years, I'd want to lease for the flexibility it provides.. if I move back to NYC I don't want to be bogged down by a car payment for a car I never use.

Ideally I'd like to ""lease to buy"" (is that a thing?) where after 2-3 years of leasing the car, my personal situation will be a little more concrete, and I can decide whether or not I want to stay in Mass. for the long term.

Right now I've been looking at the new 2014 Mazda3/6, sport trim. I've seen a few good lease deals from the local dealership and I'd like to check em' out, I spoke to my dad who knows a bit about cars and his inital reaction was ""never lease, because you don't own"" I explained that I don't want to be tied down by ownership because of the situation outlined above, and he seemed to agree and lean towards lease, I'd like to hear your opinions though.

1uz95b,3,2014-01-11,Red Pill College - What i learned in the first semesters - Practice Semester and Bachelor's Thesis upcoming,thoughty_police,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1uz95b/red_pill_college_what_i_learned_in_the_first/,"I Imagine my journey up to now as a Bachelor's program. Scroll down to **""Where to Go?""** if you just want to drop a hint.

First off, i was living in anxious isolation ever since i was denied my curiosity and enthusiasm(props to you, school bullies and dad) and eventually had the wake up call which started with just ""something has to be done"", continued with a crash, burn and explosion with a woman approaching her wall(complicated matters; i kissed her once, accepted friendzone, still threw affection towards her, missed her obvious and even verbal ""i am ready"" and went full retard | all while I rationalized red flags, including ""super party girl"" from the beginning).

**The Intern** - started to read and listen to some PU material, flirted with the girls in school and did a year of waiting at a cocktailbar.

* Heads on my Shoulder 2
* Dates 1 with 2 girls at once(one was totally into me, the other sabotaged)


+ a variety of girls at work taught me to deflect their bullshit about what has to be done and w/e continually. ""Would you help me with my tables?"" *pointing finger on my cheek* ""Haha, no you can do that anyways."" ""When my guests leave i am happy to assist you.""

* I am officially in control of my erection from female contact: The space available at the counter was so minimal that they would rub with their bodies all over me all day. It felt great and it taught me to be less invested

* Coworkers increasingly grew submissive to me. The ones running all over me at the beginning now did their shit alone and surprisingly that was no problem. More flirt less demands.


**The first semester** By past manipulation i studied to program on my own and i came into an internship right after shool in Computer Science. At the beginning i was totally into going there day after day and learning things here and there but my ""Mentor"" wouldn't care for me at all up to this day. I was still shy talking with people AT ALL. So i began reading, writing and listening on and about Manliness.

**The following Semester** I would read read, write, listen. Comprehend all that knowledge i acquired. I refound my interest in reading books and my passion for writing. Last month i stumbled upon Patrice O'Neal's The Black Phillip show. I am at The Beige Phillip Show's episode 65 now, and will relisten to it over the next year. Reading or listening in the subway; laughing out loud.

Now? I am enjoying reading again.

Gradually playing less video games and exchanging my big machine for a good enough laptop. I grew about 15 pounds last year. Mainly in muscle. 2 years ago I was underweight 130 pounds at ~181. I am at 149+ pounds now due to learning basic cooking and basic workout. I started with 2-5 push ups a day MAX and can now do multiple 15 rep sets a day. That's a big achievement for me. I have a natural T build but through training and my new, more fitting clothing it is more visible.

Over the past 2 years including my work as a waiter i have noticed and increase in daily eyeballing by women. DRASTICALLY increased attention and implied respect from people in general. Females hovering in my range, looking at me from their peripheral, direct EC, smiles etcetc.

My mind is still adjusting to all that.
 I was in search for condoms i could pull over my cock since most seem a little small. But the real problem occured after my long search when i tried different condoms on; it grew a few inches in widht and length(this was some polyutheran) and the other made me feel nauseous(some latex). I dunno but i better get that checked before i try more on my own.

**Where to go now?** Well, my practice has been lacking lately, so the first thing i have to do next week is to check the doctor.

The most important thing is about my carreer. Everyone advices to go the STEM route. However, it bores the shit out of me and it drains me to program and do math(i was an grade A student in math).

I will work in the gastronomy again, probably part time, but behind the counter and hope to grow some male bonds there.

I will start talking to girls i see and will ask those out that i find entertaining. The *thought* of the Uncertainty about the condom thing holds me back ATM.


I will improve my nutrition and start to look out for a gym for Starting Strength

""Just start out with the basics and it will fall into place on it's own."" Sure, and i still feel that social matrix popping up. What i found to be working sometimes was to question answers like ""yeah i feel good"" with things that it's boring and they should be elaborating etc... .

When the doctor check is through and i have fitting condoms there is nothing holding me back having sex other than my dickhead not having enough fun and caring too much."

First of all, [here's the original GW posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/1uyzec/first_time_meeting_with_another_redditor_last/) that got everyone interested.


Now some background.  I have a non-throwaway account that I use sparingly in /r/AskReddit and /r/trees, but I've never really been that active.  A couple weeks ago, I had posted a response to an AskReddit about something near my area (won't say what, it would give it away!), and this guy PM's me asking me questions about the area.  He had just moved into the area for an internship, and he was still trying to find his way around the city.  We went through some typical small chat and I recommended him a couple of really nice places to eat, as well as some local hidden gems.  He's originally from a pretty interesting place as well, so naturally my curiosity is piqued and we continue to exchange PM's.  Eventually we start texting, and one day we decide to meet up at one of the cafes that I had recommended.

I should let you know that I actually had no intention of sleeping with this guy when we were planning our meet up!  I'm fairly certain that he wasn't either, as he seemed extremely interested in discovering the city's culture.  Even though we werent' looking for it, the first time I saw him I immediately thought to myself, ""*This could definitely turn into a fun night...*"" I put that thought on the backburner though so we could enjoy each other's company.  Turns out that this guy was a total charmer!  He was so genuine and sweet, and he had countless hilarious stories about his hometown to share with me.  A couple stories in, we had finished our drinks, and he was thinking about getting some food.  I didn't quite feel like spending money on food, even though he offered to pay.  I think that idea that I put on the backburner started to sneak back up on me, because before I could stop myself, I heard myself suggesting that he come over to my apartment for some home-made dinner.  My mind immediately recognized that my body was speaking for itself... and I knew right then that I was definitely getting more than dinner tonight.

He agreed to dinner, and we took both our cars back to my apartment.  I whipped up some quick spaghetti carbonara, took out a bottle of wine that my cousin gave us, and we happy ate while discussing our favorite bands.  We both found out that we're going to Coachella this year and shared our crazy experiences.  The story drifted into a little substance talk, and we found out that we both smoked weed!  We were both stoked and agreed that smoking weed is one of the best ways to connect with anyone.  Funnily enough, my friend had left some of her weed at my apartment the week before, and I had also pack of rolling papers handy...  It's almost as if fate wanted us to have sex  :P

We create a playlist of our favorite bands and I start completely smoking him out.  The stuff that my friend left over was reallllly good stuff, and made every part of my body feel like it was wrapped in the most comfortable blanket in the world.  I look over and he's clearly enjoying himself too, with his head reclined on the back of the couch.  He glances over my way, we make eye contact, and he smiles one of the most genuinely happy smiles I've ever seen.

&gt; ""This shit is gooooood.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Right?  My body feels like it's wrapped in a huge blanket!""

I look at him, and we both laugh.  The weed is getting to us now, and I can definitely feel my body screaming at me to have sex with him.  We both finish off the joint together, and we finish while cuddling on the corner of the couch.  I lean back onto his stomach, and I feel his rock hard boner beneath his pants.  I glance up at him, and he glances down at me, giving me a sheepish smile.  He squeezes me a little harder, and says

&gt;"" I think we both know what we want here""

I smile back at him.  I know it's true, and that we might as well get it on.  I crawl up to his level and we start making out, like seriously one of the best make out sessions I've ever had.  It quickly gets hot, heavy, and musty from smoking out my entire room.  We frantically rip each other's clothes off and we continue to make out, hands alternating between groping and stripping.  Before I know it I'm down to my underwear and bra, and he's down to his boxers.  I sit on top of his lap, staring straight into his eyes as I unhook my bra with my left hand.  It's clear that he loves my tits, proceeds to prove it by grabbing my back with one hand, and my boobs with the other.

At this point I'm getting really really wet.  As I'm sitting on his lap, I can also feel his rock-hard dick wedged right between my pussy.  It feels incredible on my pussy, and I start slowly grinding it a little deeper.  I start squirming a little, and that must signal to him that I'm enjoying it because he smiles at me again, then starts grinding back against me.  I'm soaked all the way through my underwear at this point, and I can tell that he can even feel my wetness through his boxers.  He gets even HARDER, and I slowly slide my hands down to take off my panties.  He takes off his own boxers and I glide a condom over his dick.

I'm so wet at this point that lube is totally unnecessary, so he starts to push his cock in.  I throw back my head and gasped when he got past the tip, since I was kind of tight from not having sex in a while!  My back arched and I leaned against his body for support.  He was good about supporting me in a really solid position while I slowly slid his thick cock inside my pussy.  I finally got it all in, arched my back, and started to ride him.  I loved being on top and in control; it was an incredible experience that pushed my whole body onto his dick.  He loved it too, as he started grabbing my hips and controlling my body like it was his toy.  He was surprisingly strong, probably spurred on by the heat of sex.  Before long he was straight up fucking me hard, and I began to feel an orgasm coming along.  It crept up slow, but suddenly he pulled my body down and started sucking on my tit.  Oh. My. God.  Then I felt his fingers on my clit, and my mind went into complete sensual overload.  The orgasm suddenly exploded and I could feel my pussy go into overdrive as we both fucked each other with everything we had.  My actual orgasm seemed to last FOREVER, and I swear I blacked out for at least a couple seconds during the orgasm.

I tapered off slowly, opening my eyes to find him smiling at me again.  I must've put on a really good show for him.  We laugh a little, and I dismount his still rock-hard cock.  We both stand up and decide to go into my bedroom, where we could utilize a real bed for our fuck session.

After that, we proceeded to have sex for another 3 1/2 hours!  He left to go back home now, but man I hope we can meet up again soon!  :)"

A couple summers ago he was in the US for an internship at my university and we met a month before his return to France and completely fell in love. We decided we would try to stay in a relationship even though it meant only being able to see each other in the summers. The following summer I visited him in France for two months and then this past summer he came and stayed with me in the US for two months. The more time we spent together the harder it became to be apart so after lots of tears and discussions we decided to end things. A couple weeks  later we realized that the breakup was going to be more difficult than we imagined and we quickly fell back into old patterns, and since then we've been going back and forth from one extreme to another. Seeing other people, discussing marriage and moving from one location to another. In the end it boiled down to the fact that he got a wonderful job opportunity in France and would be insane to give it up and I'm just not emotionally ready to get married and become a citizen in another country. Today for my birthday he mailed me back the love lock we locked up on the seine as well as a very heartfelt letter and other memories of our time together, saying that we were finished and that he wanted to say goodbye.

1v08lt,5,2014-01-11,A bit short on funds for school next year - thoughts?,mirntx,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1v08lt/a_bit_short_on_funds_for_school_next_year_thoughts/,"Hey, personal financiers. I'm a nineteen-year-old freshman in college, majoring in computer science. My parents have recently announced that they're not willing to pay for any more of my education, since as a computer scientist, I'm _supposedly_ able to gainfully employ myself for the rest of my life without a degree. I can't get federal grants due to my parents' high income (they're spending a lot on repaying debts, and have a house that's way too expensive, but that's another story).

I have a student loan that will cover tuition and on-campus housing for the remainder of this school year. But, starting fall 2014, I'm on my own. I don't have to start paying off my portion of the loan ($5,500) until I graduate (2016 or 2017).

Thankfully, I've landed a Silicon Valley summer internship that'll pay around $19,000 before taxes, plus $1,200/month for living expenses. I crafted a spreadsheet that takes out the appropriate CA and US income tax, and combined with my $10/hr day job, I'm set to make $26,898 this year after taxes. This would be great, if I weren't in school. Taking into account rent ($11,520), tuition ($9,696), furniture, food, transportation, and repaying my student loan, I'm short about $4,000 for next school year.

I have about $1,200 in a Coverdell ESA that my parents set up for me ten years ago. From my research, there's no way I can contribute any more to the account now that I'm over age 18--is it safe to withdraw the funds and apply them toward my expenses?

Getting into more debt scares me, but assuming I can get a well-paying job after I graduate, it shouldn't be too hard to pay off. Of course, I'm going to apply to all the scholarships I possibly can before resorting to more loans. Is it wise to take out another student loan to cover the rest of my expenses? "

So I've come here for help.

A little background- I am a 22 year old male who goes to what many may consider a 'top-tier' (whatever the hell that means) engineering school in the United States. I would consider my self fairly good looking (again, whatever the hell that mean), and witty. I have a great GPA, and I've been successful in my major. I have a pretty prestigious (and again, whatever the hell that means) internship lined up for the summer.

And again and again I find my self asking the same question: ""Am I depressed?""  I have so much going for me- and at time I am even optimistic about my future. Despite all this, I feel like shit ever night.

I love my roommates to death. I live on campus with people I've known since high school and I love these guys to death. They are some of my best friends. But they stay in every night. They have all their shit together. Jobs lined up and everything. It seems like I am utterly unable to meet new people. I feel like relationships are the fabric that ties together the human experience. But I'm so afraid to be myself without my friends there with me. I'm so afraid of rejection and the fact that others will think that I'm ""weird"". But isn't everyone weird? Isn't everyone really a hipster in the most extreme sense. Isn't everyone really just unique? 

I've been struggling with this for so long. I've been rambling, but the bottom line is that I've been striving to meet other new people and I've been failing so miserably because I'm so afraid of what others may think. Is this what depression is, an inability to for meaningful relationships? I've had thoughts of suicide. But this is nothing that I would ever actually go through with. I couldn't imaging any of my loved ones pulling that on me, so in my mind there is no way that I can bring that upon my family or my friends. But what I'm afraid of is that these simple thoughts will someday spawn into something more deadly. I can't imagine that one day I will somehow rationalize killing myself, but it is possible. And that is what I'm so afraid of. I just want someone to talk to about these things. Should I seek help? Am I depressed, that is the question."
1v0rw9,57,2014-01-12,Two years sober today!,lillyheart,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1v0rw9/two_years_sober_today/,"It feels awkward to share so impromptu like, but y'all, today marks two years, in a row, with no days off, of me being sober.
So, here's my story, in long format. What it was like, what happened, how it is now.

It took me a while in the rooms- the first time I found myself in the back of a cop car was before high school- in '02. I spent 7.5 months in a really crappy/abusive juvenile ""behavior modification"" placement that has left some permanent scars, and definitely kept me from asking for help for a long time. 

But after doing what we do- missing 9th grade for juvie, then graduating high school in a year &amp; a half, I got folks off my back and kept using, getting a crappy sublet with a fake ID with a girl whose problem meant I'd come home to a living room with no furniture sometimes.

At 17, I detoxed off opiates, and decided I needed to run the fuck away. I moved from the US to Chile because that would keep me sober. My family had found a picture of me shooting up and I think they believed the geographical cure might work too. It didn't. One of the most terrifying nights of my life was at the Argentinian border being pulled off a bus by paramilitary police yelling at me where the drugs in my backpack were. I was lucky not to have anything on me that night, just residue from where the bag had been.  

At 18, I decided I was going to college. Barely on speaking terms with family, I went to a religious school because I knew I needed to be ""reigned in."" The first girl I fell in with was an addict that once overdosed at rehab. Y'all are my people, through and through. 

And college, as you can expect, was a mess. I tried to be sober for a bit. I went to therapy to work on other issues, and that was helpful. I joined a sorority. I couldn't get an A to save my life, and by three semesters in, I was failing at least a class a semester. I was miserable, but I was also the biggest party girl ever.

I dropped out and asked for help in 2008. Got a job at a church, went to outpatient 2x a week, had a treatment team I set up myself. After my experiences as a young teen, I couldn't visit hospitals or treatment centers for any reason sober. My blood pressure and heart rate were through the roof. Regular rehab was out of the question, I would have rather died than be locked up the way I had been.

I went back to school after 8 months, miserable, shaken, drinking &amp; finally about to turn 21. I worked at a bar and was a shit show. I felt like it too. I failed a class and a few weeks before graduation left again, this time to Asia, where I got robbed about once a week for months due to my inability to be sober enough to be aware of my surroundings. I didn't have money to stay anywhere by the end of my trip &amp; don't remember getting home. 

I lied, told my friends I graduated, and got a job in radio. Moved in with my boyfriend, a man 6 inches shorter than me who kept an adopted Irish accent after he studied abroad, and another friend, my favorite using buddy. Got engaged. Went back to therapy. Quit drugs but not drinking for the man. Was mean, quarrelsome, and refused to face reality about our future. I blamed my job, quit it, and got hired at another radio station.

I was poor, despite making decent money. We were poor. It was bad. He left me and moved to Ireland. I lost my job again. I couldn't show up sober. After the last ""pre-evection"" notice, I moved out of the apartment into my parents home. At 5'7, I was emaciated. I don't remember September-December of 2010, except to know I wasn't welcome home by Christmas and decided to move to finish my degree.

I had nothing except rising credit card debt and misery. And a couple of cute men that would try &amp; save me. Somehow I ended up in New York for a conference one week &amp; never made it to my hostel. I stayed on Marcy Homes &amp; near Fordham &amp; just a bunch of places I don't even know. But somehow I graduated that may, 2011. And decided to get happy. I called my doctor for antidepressants because I was so miserable, and filled them to find a warning I could only drink ""moderately"" on them. They sat on my dresser. I tried to get sober. I shook so bad, I hallucinated earthquakes in my best friend's living room. I didn't make it 10 days. I passed out in a pool alone. I woke up in a cemetery. I partied harder than everyone else and couldn't stop.

 And one day, of all things, I woke up out of a blackout at Starbucks and realized I couldn't do it. I'd been at work 5 hours blacked out, and I had came to washing dishes. And apparently, again, had passed out in the pool and had a few worried friends. I'd lost most though. I stayed in my apartment all weekend and shook. Day 3, I went to an AA meeting and cried in the corner. These ladies gave me their numbers and I called them. I tried to call my best friend &amp; tell her I was going to be sober and she didn't believe me. She didn't want to speak with me. I hadn't realized she'd walked away over a month earlier because I was so toxic. It was another wakeup call.

I called those women. They let me sit in their cars and do errands with them. I stayed with them whenever I wasn't at work or school, because I had decided to keep going for a grad degree. I got a sponsor. We started working the steps.

My boyfriend, who had been there for the end, resented me getting well. He kept promising to teach me how to drink. That he could control it for me. I began to realize exactly how fucked off our relationship was. At 3 months sober, he came to my apartment, screamed at me for an hour, and we broke up. I stayed sober. 

But shortly after, I slowed down. I stopped meeting with my sponsor, I went to less meetings. I went back to the bars to hang out with friends. I was stressed. After a terrible holiday, at 5 months sober, I put in notice to leave my job. And a few days later, a close friend &amp; coworker killed himself. I'd hugged him that night. We'd closed together. I relapsed after his funeral with my coworkers. I couldn't handle the feelings.

I woke up drunk three days later in the middle of the night, feeling just awful, to realize drinking really didn't make it better. Nothing was making it better. Drinking couldn't bring him back. I couldn't do this anymore.

So I went back to the rooms. I got a new sponsor. I worked the steps quickly and thoroughly. At 3 months sober, a girl asked me to sponsor her. I did. She is 3 months to the day behind me and an amazing young woman herself. I met with my sponsor every Wednesday at 630am for a year, outside mostly. She has been sober longer than I've been alive.  

Life got better, but it got hard too. My first semester sober, two weeks after my relapse, a member of my cohort in graduate school passed away unexpectedly. We had talked hours before his heart failed. Two weeks later, my stepmom was in the ICU in a diabetic coma. Two weeks after that, my father had emergency surgery I didn't know about until afterwards. I got sick for almost a month. I couldn't seem to get a job and I was really poor. I failed a class in graduate school. I got in &amp; out of a relationship that lasted 6 weeks. I found out my ex spread a bunch of sexually humiliating stories about me in our relationship that worst of all, weren't true, but I doubted anyone would believe me.

That's what the first six months looked like. 

I got involved in a home group I felt safe in, a YP group I helped in it's earliest stages. I became our Hospitals &amp; Institutions chair, and brought meetings into a rehab without panic attacks. I went to a Women's group. I sponsored women who were undergrad sorority girls and religious. I was getting paid occasionally at a church again to lead lectures &amp; bible studies, eventually to preach and lead worship at a variety of mainline to liberal institutions. My best friend let me make amends after 7 months &amp; we talk near daily again.

I kept close to my YP group and went camping with 10 of them. I started dating a guy 5 years sober when I had maybe 5 months. It was a rocky 9 month relationship. We took vacation together, which was something I had only done with my ex-fiancé and meant something to me. I went on a pilgrimage in Israel with a friend from the rooms. We walked from Nazareth to the Sea of Galilee. It was the first time I'd traveled sober, and while scarier, I loved it! We went to a meeting in a comedy club in Jerusalem. The top shelf of the bar had a big book on it.

I went home and faced a breakup that felt like I was being destroyed. I didn't get a job I was expecting too. A few weeks after my breakup, my roomate got engaged, and as truly happy as I was for her, it hurt like hell that I had just lost my own relationship at the same time. 

I was burning out on my grad school program and felt like everyone was ahead of me. The town felt too small with my ex there, and he wouldn't leave me alone. I took an internship as much for the experience as for the distance, and moved 800 miles to Kentucky last summer. And fell in love with it. I found a great group, some other folks my age, got a temporary sponsor &amp; worked the steps again with her. I discovered that I really did love the work of a pastor even if I didn't like school. I applied to transfer to a school there and to some small church jobs. I got interviews. Last minute it didn't pan out &amp; I went home. 

I saw my roomate get married. I moved into a house. I got a call the second day of class that a job was open in the student ministry department on campus. I've wanted to work there a long time. I'd interviewed there every chance I could. I took it.

A few weeks later, a church I'd supply preached at asked me to go through their calling process. In October, I officially became their pastor. Yes, that means I preach in 8 hours...

I started dating in November after taking a break since March with a new list of what I want that begins with ""a man who is kind to me."" It's a process, but I know I can be happy and sober no matter what the outcome there. 

Over New Years, two guys from my home group &amp; I went to my grandparents log cabin and snowboarded for a week. It was awesome. I was better than I had been in a decade. That was last week.

So. Here I am. 2 years sober. No longer emaciated and miserable. With a busy plate full of things that I can pour into and find life in. I have both my dream jobs, seriously! I still failed a class in graduate school, but I also got two A's. I'm still learning. And I am incredibly thankful for this life, and it's so worth enduring. If you just skip to the bottom that's all I have. This life is more than I dreamed possible, failures and heartbreak included, and I hope everyone gets to experience that stillness and serenity inside.

(AU)",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1v12jj/ive_been_lucky_enough_to_receive_a_scholarship_to/,"Okay, here's the story. My alum offered me a scholarship to go back and finish a GradDip in Education as an internship at a regional school. My state is in need of teachers, and regional towns are absolutely desperate for them. The offer ended up being to good to pass up.

Where I'll be headed is the Pilbara region in northern Western Australia - almost 2,000km from the capital of the state and my hometown. Because all of the towns up there are mining-based, everything is very expensive. This is the case for a couple of reasons - the town councils release land very slowly so demand is through the roof, ultra-rich mining companies pay for everything so no one really cares about what things cost them, and most people working on the mines are making great money.

The break-down of the scholarship is as such:

* $40,000 scholarship money. This is basically the incentive to do the thing.
* $27,000 living allowance. To help with rent costs. Rent will be $1,200 per week, with two of us, so $600 per week. For comparison, where I am now you can get a similar house for $400 p/w!
* $3,800 for flights.

Totaling $70,800. 

That's a lot of money in the context of my life and I want to make sure I don't get sucked into the careless culture while up there. I'll be in an unfamiliar environment and moving out of home for the first time. What suggestions do you guys have for how I can remain composed or grounded? I've started using Pocketbook, which is an Australian mint.com, and it's shown me that even now I'm not as financially aware as I thought."

I have my girlfriend and about 3 friends I talk to.

Part of me just feels like my social life is lacking, and I should be meeting and know more people to have fun with.

I feel like until I do this I don't deserve to wake up and be happy all day. Its a really strange feeling.

Part of me feels like I just need to wake up and go out there and try really hard to meet people. This is not really true to myself though.

I realized its best if I just do things I enjoy and put a little more effort when doing those things to meet other people that enjoy them too, instead of completely going out my way with a purpose to meet someone.

With this more subtle method it makes me feel bad because I am less likely to meet people right away and I'll probably only meet someone once in a while.

I am doing an internship right now, not really the job I would want, its made me motivated to study harder when its done, work harder on my own to improve myself to get a job a want, and I want to go to the gym and get in shape.

I just feel like I am not allowed to do these things and be happy doing them as my social life is lacking, and I need a great social life to be happy doing these other things, or everything else will slip into nothing too.

How do I get over this type of thinking?"

-I've suffered from severe, sometimes completely debilitating, depression since I was a kid

-I'm currently getting my masters

-I'm currently in a four year relationship 

-My mom died before christmas of cancer

-My grampa died after new years of cancer

I just feel so alone and helpless. When I started the school year I was so happy, I had gotten my depression under control, I was getting my last degree to start my career, my girlfriend and I were very happy and on very good terms, my relationship with my parents was improving...then in september my mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and was told she wouldn't live past christmas...which she didn't.

It was so hard for me to deal with, it's not something I had ever experienced or prepared for before and slowly over the next few months my depression got steadily worse and worse. It was harder every day for me just to get out of bed and go to school, let alone go above and beyond to make myself stand out. We had so many close calls at the hospital and I was just a ball of depressed anxiety...then she died. I was a wreck and ended up messing up my internship for my masters, which just made me feel worse. At least my SO was there for me and helped me through the worst of it in the moment.

Then christmas came, my first christmas without her and being at home was so hard and my depression just kept getting worse and worse. My SO was staying with me for christmas, but is very emotionally fragile during the holidays and spent most of it sleeping or crying, which was very hard for me to cope with and it ended up causing a lot of friction between us culminating with her not wanting to talk to me for 2+ weeks.

Then, to top off this wonderful 'holiday' my grampa, whom I've seen every week since I was a little kid and was very close with, passed away of cancer, just like my mom. I was there in the hospital with him, the same hospital as my mom, watching him slowly fade away just like my mom. It killed me. It took the little bit of progress I had made in putting myself back together emotionally in time for school and shattered it. So here I am now, depressed, scared, hopeless, feeling abandoned and unwanted by the few people I could actually talk to and I just don't know what to do...I don't know and I'm so scared of what's going to happen to me. I'm scared of failing school, I'm scared my dad will die next and my family will be gone, I'm scared my SO is going to leave me, I'm scared I'm not going to recover from this...I don't know what to do and I feel like a scared ten year old kid again...I just want someone to care, I want someone to help, someone to talk...I feel so alone "

I have my girlfriend and about 3 friends I talk to.

Part of me just feels like my social life is lacking, and I should be meeting and know more people to have fun with.

I feel like until I do this I don't deserve to wake up and be happy all day. Its a really strange feeling.

Part of me feels like I just need to wake up and go out there and try really hard to meet people. This is not really true to myself though.

I realized its best if I just do things I enjoy and put a little more effort when doing those things to meet other people that enjoy them too, instead of completely going out my way with a purpose to meet someone.

With this more subtle method it makes me feel bad because I am less likely to meet people right away and I'll probably only meet someone once in a while.

I am doing an internship right now, not really the job I would want, its made me motivated to study harder when its done, work harder on my own to improve myself to get a job a want, and I want to go to the gym and get in shape.

I just feel like I am not allowed to do these things and be happy doing them as my social life is lacking, and I need a great social life to be happy doing these other things, or everything else will slip into nothing too.

How do I get over this type of thinking?"
1v2na7,3,2014-01-12,"Me [20 M] with my recent ex [20 F] of over a year, been together since beginning of college, don't know what to do from here",Vaginal_Fart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1v2na7/me_20_m_with_my_recent_ex_20_f_of_over_a_year/,"I have recently been broken up with by my girlfriend of a little over a year, and I'm having a really hard time with it due to a few different reasons which I'll explain below.

I met my ex, Alice, very early on into our college careers (literally the first weekend before school even started.) and we instantly hit it off great. About a month in we had a rocky start, she broke up with me and started hanging out with this guy who pretended to be my friend to get close to her. That didn't last long until she came back to me and wanted to pick up where we left off. I quickly forgave her as my feelings were strong, and since we had just started to experience college life, I found it understandable for something like that to happen.

Fast forward through the rest of Freshman year and the summer, our relationship was flawless and awesome. She'd been an awesome girlfriend other than that one incident so it wasn't really a problem or worry to me anymore. 

At the beginning of this year, we moved back into our college town and had no signs of wanting to break up. It might be important to note that last year we lived in adjacent dorm buildings so getting to spend time with her was extremely convenient. We now live off campus this year, about 2 miles apart, which can put a strain on things as we don't have cars, the weather sucks, and we're busy. I feel this helped begin our problems.

Throughout the term, her sex-drive seemed to dissipate completely and this put a lot of stressed me out, as it had never been this way and something felt wrong. I believe this is where our problems began as I'd be annoyed/concerned that she doesn't want to have sex with me ever. This only caused problems, which made her want to have sex even less. We kept going in circles like this, fighting about it and (kind of) making up. She eventually decided to break it off in week 9 of 11 in the term. 

We remained on good terms and I had a late class with her the very next day. She was visibly upset throughout the whole class (I was upset but I remained calm on the surface) and I offered to walk her home afterward as it was past 10pm and she was upset. When we get back we get to talking and she regrets breaking up and said she was just scared that we were fighting and made an irrational decision. I forgive her, we make up. 

We still aren't having sex yet, because we agreed to ""take it slow and ease back into it"" I wanted to do this, but I was having an extremely hard time and could not hold back my discontent successfully. This eventually led to a fight and her breaking up with me in the middle of finals week. I'm extremely upset this time, but I refrain from contacting her.

She went home (about a 45 min drive from the college) for winter break and I stayed here an extra week for my internship before going home myself (about 3 hours from campus, in the same direction as her home town). A few days into break she begins talking to me, telling me she misses talking to me and what not. I say the same back as no-contact was killing me. We planned for me to stop by and have lunch in her hometown on my way home. 

It's important to note that her breaking up with me wasn't meant to be a harsh, cruel, or punishing act, and that I feel very much responsible for the reasons why we broke up. For this reason is why I was so accepting to try things again, I didn't blame her for wanting to break up at that period of time. 

We get to talking at lunch and we agree to stay on a break over christmas break, but we want to work on getting back together. I go home, and later go to a friends party that night. I ended up drunkenly having sex with one of my friends at the party. I felt bad about it, but hey, she broke up with me, we aren't back together yet, so no big deal. I didn't feel the need to tell her (Not sure if that was wrong or not). 

We texted/skyped throughout the rest of break, except she started being bipolar about the situation. She told me she's been depressed, confused, and doesn't know what to do about the situation. She actually had days telling me that she wants to get back together for sure and that she could picture herself marrying me one day. This got my hopes up so high that things were going to turn out great. 

This felt awesome, until one night, she texted me saying ""if we're going to get back together, I need to tell you something"". She slept with one of her ""friends"" she had had before us breaking up, literally the day after us breaking up. This is when I confessed to having sex with my friend as well. I felt a bit betrayed, as I know there was mutual attraction between them during the span of our relationship. My hookup wasn't like that at all, me and my friend are 100% platonic besides that drunken incident. This caused some pretty bad fighting for the night but we kind of got over it. One of the reasons I was able to get over it is the fact that I had slept with someone too. 

I drove back to the college town a few days early and stopped in her hometown to talk about things, and we ended up working everything out. We had really good talks about our recent hook ups, as well as the events resulting in the problems we had prior to breaking up. She told me she had been depressed and sad about things unrelated to me that caused her to have a decreased sex drive (I didn't know about this) and that's what led to us having more problems due to not having sex, etc. We felt everything was worked out, and in that moment she said she wanted to get back into the relationship but we need to wait a week to talk about it again because of how bipolar about the situation she was, but I had high hopes. 

Fast forward a week, the day before the start of the term, she tells me she doesn't know what she wants (she said this at least 100 times over the break) and decided we shouldn't get back together. The reasons she gave me was that she feels she needs to be single and work out her other problems and stuff before she can feel secure about being in a relationship again. This broke me inside. She said she still loves and cares about me but just can't do a relationship right now. I understand why, but it still hurts. I told her I would love to wait and let her sort out her issues, but I'm not going to and that I may not be there for her anymore when she's ready. 

Throughout the break she (unintentionally) put me through so many ups and downs, and kept me hoping we would get back together. This made the final ""breakup"" hurt so much worse. This accompanied with the fact that I have no idea what living in this town and going to college is like without her. It always felt so good having her by my side the whole time, and supporting me with my school work. We're on good terms, but haven't talked or hung out barely at all besides seeing her one day on campus. 

Now I just feel lonely, and lost. Everything in this town reminds me of her, as I first experience everything with her. And it doesn't help that I spend the majority of my time alone, doing homework in my room or something. I'm really trying to put myself out there and form new relationships with people. I go out to parties, have fun with friends and meet new people, but at the end of the day I just feel lonely. It's taking a lot of my attention away from what should be spent on studying as well. I still have hope that she will feel the same that I do so that we can get back on track, but I just have no idea what's going on through her head, and I'm not going to try and force us back together as it's clear she needs space to work out her issues. 

So how do I shake these feelings of sadness and loneliness when everything here reminds me of her? I know that it'd be a lot easier to get over if I met someone new, but 1. I don't want to use someone as a crutch, and 2. I have high standards which makes it difficult. I'm still hopeful that she will realize the same things I have been feeling, and decide she's ready to get back together.



---   
**tl;dr**: Broken up with by my gf of over a year, she has personal issues she needs to sort out before getting back into a relationship and I remain hopeful that she will decide she wants me back. I'm feeling lonely and don't know how to get her off my mind. "
1v331e,26,2014-01-12,My First Traitorous Victory,rex_wexler,SS13,https://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/1v331e/my_first_traitorous_victory/,"I shuffled through my papers as the shuttle announced final approach to Liberty Station.  I confess I was more than a little nervous about the mission.  The Syndicate had never sent me into a station that was already running full swing before.  My notes indicated that the station had been up and running for a full 45 minutes before my assignment began.

Speaking of my assignment, that was only cause to compound my worry.  Medical Doctor.  I hadn't even played a Doctor on TV, and Syndicate wanted me to play Doctor on Liberty Station.  This was sure to be interesting.

The papers safely stowed, I turned to the dull monochrome screen of my PDA.  Not much to look at on the outside, the boards within were custom modified by the Syndicate.  Mission objectives scrolled across the screen:

1. Assassinate Security Officer ZJ Orjabinov.
2. Escape safely on the shuttle.

As I tried to imagine Officer ZJ, the shuttle docking clamps locked home, and the autosteward chimed departure.  Locking up my PDA, I did my best to seem purposeful, as I strode from the shuttle.

The layout of the station was along the lines of most Nanotrasen Corporate stations.  Medical would be on the Starboard Side of the station, past command, personnel, and engineering.  

I wasted no time making my way across the station.  The cleanliness of the halls was remarkable.  After 45 minutes of runtime in open space, a station can become a bloody and disgusting place.  Not so Liberty Station.  The hallways gleamed as I hustled towards Medbay.

As I turned the corner at the bar, I came upon a commotion.  The chef, the bartender, the mime, the clown, a security officer, and an engineer all jostled for space in front of Medbay.

""Make way!  This man is injured!"" The engineer shouted.  I noticed that the Security Officer was gasping, and unable to move on his own.  The engineer towed him throw the crowd.  ""Medbay!  We have an emergency!""

The mime and the clown turned and looked at me expectantly.  ""I'm a Doctor!""  I shouted as I strode forward.  ""Lets get this man inside,"" I said, as I waved my badge at the Medbay doors.

""He's hurt pretty bad.  He needs Cryo, NOW.""  The engineer said.  He seemed to know more about how this place worked than I did.

""Cryo... right.""  I responded.  Looking more closely at the Security Officer, my heart leapt.  Could fortune be so bold?  The ID on his jumpsuit was unmistakeable *ZJ Orjabinov.*  ""Let me get a scan.""  I said, as I grabbed ZJ by the collar and dragged him to the nearest sleeper.

Vital Signs showed 80% health, with a skull fracture, but he had lost a lot of blood.  *Can I just let him die here?*  I wondered.  *This could be the easiest mission ever*  I thought.  I was exuberant.  

For a fleeting moment, it seemed that luck was with me.  Then Alex Crossman strode into the Trauma Room.  ""What's going on here?""  She said confidently.

The Engineer spoke up immediately.  ""That officers hurt bad.  He bled all over the place.  Doc here put him in the sleeper.""

Crossman read the lifesign monitors.  ""This man needs Cryo, and he's going to need surgery.  How long has he been in the sleeper?""  I looked at her with what must have seemed a look of pure ignorance, minus the bliss.  Crossman could see I had no clue what was going on.  ""This is your first time isn't it?""  She whispered.  Looking at the oblivious Engineer I replied in the affirmative.

""Yeah.  My first time....""  I didn't know what to say.  It had seemed so perfect but now this woman was here to ruin everything.

""Listen.  Stay with me.""  Alex said.  ""You'll learn.""  And with that, she was pulling ZJ from the sleeper, and dragging him to Cryo.  She was a small lady, but she was fast, and keeping up in the twisting halls of Liberty Medbay was a challenge I was barely up to.

From the Cryo tank, we were quickly onto to the surgical theater.  ZJ was awake again, but not for long, as anesthesia was being administered.

""Clear the room!""  The surgeon angrily shouted.  The engineer, and the Janitor exited the surgical theater.  ""OUT!  OUT! I said!""  He shouted.

""Rex and I are staying.""  Alex said.  ""You need my help for the surgery, and Rex is an intern.  Give us a few minutes to get ready.""  And with that, Alex grabbed my hand, and towed me to yet another section of the medbay.  Surgical masks, and hairnets, and gloves were quickly applied, and we raced back to the surgical theater.

""I've prepped the patient.""  The surgeon was saying.  He walked towards the corner, adjusting some instruments, and Alex followed.  The moment was ripe, and the room was filled with opportunities: a scalpel here, a circular saw there.  A CIRCULAR SAW.  I grabbed it quickly, while the two real doctors were focused on their preparations.

Soon enough, they were back and we stood arrayed around the patient's head.  Alex took the lead, and made an incision in his scalp.  At this moment, once again luck took a turn in my favor.  There was a knock upon the door.  The surgeon, huffing angrily, turned to answer the door and stepped outside to speak with an anxious janitor.

As the doors slipped shut behind the surgeon, I knew my chance was upon me.  Alex was absorbed in the surgery, fixing ZJ's damaged skull.  As if by divine intervention, she chose this moment to step back from ZJ's table.  ""There we go.""  She said.

Wasting no time, I pulled the pilfered circular saw from my satchel, and flicked the switch to power it up.  I had no time to see what Alex was doing, as I quickly turned the saw to the exposed bone of ZJ's skull.

The saw vibrated in my hand, and my stomach turned over, and the blade parted bone and began to chew up the soft pink flesh beneath.  Time slowed to agonizingly elongated moments as the blade cut further around the circumference of the Officer's skull, parting flesh and bone alike.  The blades noisy whine rising and falling in intensity as it traversed around his head.

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING!""  Alex shouted.  It seemed like hours had gone by.  ZJ's skull cap was gone, as was most of his brain.  Splattered across the surgical theater, Alex, and myself.

The blinding white brilliance of a Flash knocked me on my ass.  Disoriented, I could hear the declining sound of the circular saw winding down.  Shut off.  The EKG monitor emitted a solid and reassuring steady tone.  ZJ was dead.

As the whiteness faded from my eyes, I realized that the world was moving.  With the same bold strides I had witnessed earlier, Alex dragged me across Medbay.  With a deft and assured motion, she grabbed me and slammed me into a Cryo pod.

As my senses returned, I had time to despair.  How could she have had a Flash!?  What does a Doctor need a Flash for?  These thoughts and countless others, as my blood slowed like sap in a winter tree, and the temperature continued to drop.

Ultimately, it was Alex's confidence that would be her undoing.  For as the cold of cryosleep began to settle in, Alex returned with a straight jacket.  In a moment of brilliant warmth, I was ejected from the Cryo chamber, and stumbled shivering into Alex's welcoming arms.  The arms of a white straight jacket.

With a start, I jerked back, resisting with all my might.  A brief struggle ensued, before I could break away.  Naked legs dripping on the floor I dashed across Medbay and through the open exit doors.

Dashing nearly naked through the halls, it quickly occurred to me that I was without ID.  Trying to hide, I found that none of the doors would open for me.  My PDA and ID were back in Medbay!

No time to waste, I hurdled around the station looking for a quiet corner to warm up in and collect my thoughts.  As luck would have it, the Custodial Closet was just such a place.  Rounding the corner by Engineering, I saw a sleepwalker standing in peaceful repose in the Airlock by Janitorial.

His purple jumpsuit was as unmistakable as the long gleaming line of drool from his chin.  This janitor had Sudden Sleep Disorder.  Wasting no time, I grabbed his ID, and pulled him back into the Custodial Closet.

Issac Blake had to die, I'm sorry to say.  He had done an admirable job of cleaning the station, but I needed his identity, and there couldn't be two of us walking around.  Strangling a sleeping man isn't hard to do, nor is it very satisfying.

Here time passed more slowly.  My primary mission accomplished I passed the time in the role of a custodian.  For nearly 30 minutes I patrolled the halls of Liberty Station, continuing the exemplary tradition set by the first man to wear my name tag.

In time the shuttle was called.  I believe the Singularity got loose, and there may have been a minor outbreak of fatal diarrhea as well, but I can't swear to it.  I do remember seeing her on the shuttle though.

Alex couldn't recognize me ofcourse.  I was wearing Isaac's ID, and a Janitorial Biohood, but she still looked awful nice, striding confidently around the little medbay in the shuttle. "
1v3saq,1,2014-01-13,[24/m] my girlfriend (22/f) feels guilty about physical intimacy,guilttrip1,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1v3saq/24m_my_girlfriend_22f_feels_guilty_about_physical/,"I apologize as this will be long, I will try to give context in the most organized way I can:

**Me** - 24 year old male, raised christian but closer to agnostic these days. Conservative with money, liberal socially. First real relationship. Graduated from a good engineering school and am currently working for a software company. My parents got married late in life and so I can't make too many comparisons to how they handled things and my current relationship.

**Her** - 22 year old female, raised catholic but she's not sure if she really believes in a God, takes comfort from church sometimes and her extended family is very religious, her immediate family is in the middle. Conservative with money and liberal with most social topics except sex. First real relationship as well. Currently studying engineering at the university I just graduated from. Not planning to get her Masters, 2~ years left until graduation. 

She gets very stressed out about school and says she'll feel mentally ""foggy"" at times, exercise usually helps to alleviate this but it doesn't always work. Her parents married in early-mid 20s and she tends to compare our relationship to them. I'll discuss them both below.

Her **father** gets very stressed out a lot due to work and other factors, this sometimes leads to physical symptoms of back pain and other ailments and my girlfriend is starting to suffer similarly. She is starting to see a counselor about her stress, and I am being as supportive as I can be. 

Her **mother** is very conservative when it comes to sex, and raised my girlfriend to feel the same way. Whenever she feels stressed or guilty about something she will talk to her and I feel like it reinforces the guilty feelings. Her parents never lived together and didn't really stay overnight together much before they got married, but this isn't what I want for myself.

---

**Relationship** - We've been together almost two years, with periods of long distance for abroad internships on her part. I visited her both times. 

**Pros** - We are very much in sync on political views, religious views (since we're both fairly agnostic, logically she doesn't really believe too strongly, but emotionally she carries religious views of sex), children, hobbies, senses of humor, etc etc. We are each other's best friends, and get along great with each other's families and circles of friends. 

She is physically affectionate most of the time, but mostly non-sexually. She will kiss me, hold my hand, hug me, and cuddle with me while sleeping together. She tells me often and unprompted that she loves me. She is very honest (to a fault sometimes) and I trust her completely. I love her and I see myself marrying this girl someday.

**Cons** - She gets very stressed out about school and other various things. She is up and down a lot and sometimes enjoys fantasizing about being married and living a life together, and other times gets worked up and feeling 'locked in' when planning vacations 6+ months in advance. 

Early in the relationship as we began to get physical she always held back and kept it slow, I was fine with this. As we started to do more, she would get guilty about it days later, but pushed through it thinking it would get better without telling me she felt this way. As time went on there would be times where the stress of school got too much and physical intimacy suffered, and other times where she would be more willing to engage in intimate activities.

---

**Problem** - She feels guilty about being physically intimate and won't initiate. We have never had sex though we've done everything leading up to it and we've both gotten each other off many times. I am fine waiting for sex until marriage, it was never that huge a deal to me despite being a virgin myself. That's not to say I wouldn't if she became alright with it, but I realize it's not something I want to push her to do due to her immense fears of being pregnant before she's married and ready to have kids.

What can I do to help her stop being guilty about being intimate with me? I can't marry someone who will only kiss me, I need to know that the physical chemistry will be there. 

As I said earlier, she is starting to see a counselor provided by the campus health center, and I hope this can help alleviate the stress which can help alleviate the guilt, but I realize this is not entirely a stress related issue.

We have very good communication and are open to talk when things bother us. She has said she wants to be able to be intimate with me without feeling guilty, but so far efforts are unsuccessful. Her reasons for feeling guilty are mostly thinking about what her mom thinks about what she's doing, what her friends (who are mostly single and conservative girls) think, and how she was raised. She doesn't want to live together before marriage and she thinks the level of physical intimacy I want is something to wait until marriage to experience.

I know there are sometimes things you can't change, but I'm not prepared to give up on what is otherwise a fantastic multi-year relationship over compatibility in one area if there is hope for coming to a compromise. I'm fine from my side in waiting for sex until after marriage, I feel like that's a hefty compromise. I just can't marry someone to try and fix something, I feel that I should feel fulfilled in all areas before making a commitment to that degree. Is there any way to compromise? How can I help her feel less guilty? How can I change what I want?

1v4cey,1,2014-01-13,Non-accounting careers with accounting degree?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1v4cey/nonaccounting_careers_with_accounting_degree/,"As a junior pursuing a bachelor's degree in accounting, I have lately been feeling kind of wary about my choice to study accounting. I know it's a wise major in terms of career opportunities/pay and it also happens to be a subject I excel at, but I don't really see myself fitting into the type of Type-A, competitive, highly ambitious crowd that seems to pervade business school. For some reason I expect to be surrounded by these same types if I take the conventional post-college path to work in public accounting for a few years upon graduation, especially based on meeting with many different employees at public accounting firms and visiting offices. Additionally, what I've learned of the work itself doesn't appeal to me much. In addition, I am highly introverted and don't want to live a life where I have to force myself to socialize all the time on the job, so while I understand that I will have to be social at times in any career, I do not want a career that seems to revolve around being outgoing and sociable and what seems like having to suck up to people a whole lot. If I am being realistic, public accounting isn't right for me.

I don't regret that I'll actually be getting a degree in accounting because I want to have that as a safety net for finding a job, if possible. I am far more interested in the idea of going into a field such as geography, food science, environmental sciences, public health, or even nursing or social work. Something more research-y and science-y, and/or something that will allow me to actively help people and make a difference. Basically something that would let me focus on my actual work a lot more than I would have to focus on building relationships with clients or anything business-oriented, for example.

My problem is that I somehow ended up landing an internship at a top public accounting firm this upcoming summer, and I don't want to let go of that opportunity just because I worked so hard for it. However, I really can't say that I'd want to actually start a career at the firm if I were to land a full-time offer from that.

I'm kind of stuck now, just thinking about my future if I am to leave accounting. How exactly *do* I leave accounting after getting a degree specializing in it? Should I decide to go to grad school? Should I work full-time at the public accounting firm I'll be interning at and get my CPA, then leave accounting? "

Please help",heavythrowaway10,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1v4cy7/my_27_m_ex_23_f_we_were_together_for_nearly_two/,"As the title says, we were together for almost two years before we split in early August (she was taking an internship out of the country for a yet to be specified period of time, and we'd just finished dpi long distance for 8 months) . We'd agreed from long before that we wouldn't let the other keep us from capitalizing on any professional opportunities that presented themselves. She pulled the plug, and I didn't fight her about it. I imagined that we'd make the most of the time we had left (she'd leave in early September). However, she got really distant and weird. I talked her I to hanging out one time in between, and we had a great time. We agreed to get together again a week later, but she'd bail saying ""I know I said that we would hang and that I still want you in my life, but I just need my space"". For the rest of the month, I say and watched in anguish as all of our close friends and her family (which I'd become a welcome part of) got to spend time w/ her and wish her a fond farewell. I felt like Stephen Strausberg the season after he came back from tommy-johns surgery (The season's ending, and if I pitch, we might have a chance to close out the season on a high note. But because his manager wanted to save his recently operated upon shoulder, he sat him, effectively killing the playoff hopes for the nationals). 

She leaves w/o saying a word. We eventually chat in October and clear the air/hash out a bunch of things. It feels like closure at first. But after a week or so, it still feels as though there are more questions than answers. We text/phone chat 2-3 more times, then things peter off for a bit. We text a bit more in December. The screen shots linked are our last interaction are in my comment.

(I'm Blue/green)

She came back on the 15th. She's leaving Wednesday morning. This whole time, I've been expecting her to reach out to me since she claimed to have so much to get off of her chest. I wasn't too concerned at first because it was Christmas/new year, and I didn't want to cast a dark cloud over her return. But I started getting anxious after the first. Every day since then, I've become more and more so.  However; I'm thinking back to our earlier convo where we said that we'd like to see each other, and I'm now wondering if I'm as much to blame for us not seeing each other as she is. Most of my friends that I've run this by feel that she should have reached out to me by now, and that she effectively dangled a carrot in front of me that's just out of reach. They say that I'm pretty much right, and that she should be reaching out to me. My mom thinks that I'm punishing her. One friend thinks that we're punishing each other. 

Side note: I got her parents some Christmas gifts, just to show my appreciation for their being so good to me/us over the years. I didn't get to deliver them in time for Christmas because her dads order got screwed up (it just arrived over the weekend). 

I'm almost positive that what I'm looking for is closure (in the form of a face to face sitdown, followed by a proper farewell). I'm willing to admit that I might also be looking for more/wrong about what it is that I want from her). Should I make a move to see her before she leaves? Or do I just let her leave w/o saying anything (again)? Honestly, I'm feeling kind of fragile emotionally, and in really just afraid of shedding the (emotional) armor that I spent so long forging/wearing, only to be hurt again. 

TL;dr: 
Ex and I agreed to meet up over the holidays, neither one of us has made a move. Do I say what I'm feeling before she leaves?

EDIT: Didn't realize linking in the post/comments was a no-no. Conversation basically consisted of her asking me (on 12/10)if she was going to see me when she got back. She also asked if I wanted to see her. I reminded her that when we last spoke on the phone, that I was open to us meeting up, and that I indeed, would like to see her. She indicated that she was arriving on 12/20, and that she'd be leaving on either 1/15 or 1/22 (she hadn't determined when at the time). 
Later that day, she wrote the following:
""There are so many things I want to say to you and talk to you about; but for now, I just want you to know that you deserved much better than the way I treated you and I truly am sorry. Makes me realize how undeserving I was to be your girlfriend.""

I honestly didn't know how to reply to that. What, was I supposed to be like "" I agree"" or ""you're absolutely right""? I didn't reply.

I texted her saying that I was sure she'd been busy since getting back, and that I wanted to drop off the gifts that I got for her folks, but that I basically didn't want to ambush her. I told her that I was aiming to do so sometime btw this thursday and saturday. She said that she was leaving wednesday morning, and that that was fine. I said ok."

Re:  Wisconsin Assembly Bill 409

Dear Members of the Committee,

I am a retired City of Kenosha police detective with over 31 years of law enforcement experience.   During my career with the Kenosha Police Department, I earned 57 awards and letters of commendation and completed the Wisconsin Department of Justice Death Investigation School, along with numerous other police related training programs.  For nine years, I served on the Board of Directors of the Kenosha Professional Police Association, most of those years as the Association treasurer.  I was also an active member of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association for nearly three decades.  

I graduated from UW-Parkside with Summa Cum Laude honors and a triple major of sociology, history, and political science.  I hold five secondary teaching licenses with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.  I earned these licenses through the post-baccalaureate teacher certification program at UW-Milwaukee.  I currently work as a full time social studies teacher at an alternative high school in Milwaukee for at-risk youth.  In my spare time, I volunteer as an investigative consultant for the Chicago Innocence Project, where I work with college journalism students who intern with the project.

This letter, the attached affidavit with supporting documents, and my testimony will make many people uncomfortable. My testimony will address the elephant in this hearing room.  We all know it is here.  Most of us, including me, do not want to acknowledge it.  I will be testifying about a law enforcement culture in some police agencies that fosters an environment where the concealment of facts and evidence, untruthfulness, and other unethical and criminal behavior by police officers is both tolerated, and in many cases, expected.  

Only the most naïve among use will deny the evidence of the existence of police and prosecutor misconduct in their investigation duties. 
On May 20, 2012, the National Registry of Wrongful Convictions issued a report titled, Wrongful Convictions in the United States, 1989–2012.     This report, which received extensive media coverage upon its release, documented 873 individual exonerations  in the United States from January, 1989 through the end of February, 2012.  As of December 10, 2013, the number of individual exonerations is up to 1,255.   Of these 1,255 individual felony exonerations, thirty-one are Wisconsin cases.  Of these thirty-one Wisconsin exonerations, “official misconduct” is listed as a contributing factor in six of these cases.   To put this in perspective, since 1989, it is confirmed that six Wisconsin citizens were deprived of their fundamental constitutional right of liberty by the misconduct of Wisconsin government officials.  Taking a citizen’s liberty by official misconduct is just a notch below taking a citizen’s life.  
  
The 2012 report also documents 1107 additional exonerations that occurred in groups due to thirteen police scandals where it was determined that law enforcement officers engaged in patterns of misconduct that affected the integrity of sets of criminal convictions.  
Researchers concluded that the numbers of known individual and group exonerations is only a fraction of the total number of wrongful convictions that actually occur in the United States.

The report also lists the contributing causes for the wrongful convictions in the 873 cases of individual exonerations across categories of felonies.  This data is contained in the table that follows that has been copied and pasted from page #40 of the 103-page report.  The table shows that official misconduct, which includes perjury and failure to disclose exculpatory information or evidence by government agents, and perjury and false accusation, on the part of civilians, are the leading causes of the wrongful convictions in the set of 873 individual exonerations the report studies.  
 
The Innocence Project is a New York based national “umbrella” innocence project.  According to its web page, it is a “. . .national litigation and public policy organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals through DNA testing and reforming the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.”     
The Innocence Project defines and illustrates “government [official] misconduct” as follows:   

Common forms of misconduct by law enforcement officials include:
•    Employing suggestion when conducting identification procedures
•    Coercing false confessions
•    Lying or intentionally misleading jurors about their observations 
•    Failing to turn over exculpatory evidence to prosecutors
•    Providing incentives to secure unreliable evidence from informants 

Common forms of misconduct by prosecutors include: 
•    Withholding exculpatory evidence from defense
•    Deliberately mishandling, mistreating or destroying evidence
•    Allowing witnesses they know or should know are not truthful to testify
•    Pressuring defense witnesses not to testify
•    Relying on fraudulent forensic experts
•    Making misleading arguments that overstate the probative value of testimony 
One may ask, “What does data regarding official misconduct in wrongful conviction cases have to do with AB-409, which is the subject of this hearing?”  The link is clear.  Some police officers and prosecutors commit perjury, conceal evidence and other critical information, and disregard basic rules of conflict of interest to deprive innocent citizens of their liberty by incarcerating them by wrongful conviction. 

It is not a stretch to think they would engage in this type of misconduct to protect their co-workers from being held accountable for unlawful use of deadly force.  It is the mirror image of wrongful conviction.  This type of official misconduct is intended to shield a co-worker from being held accountable for unlawful use of deadly force, thus depriving a citizen of another fundamental constitutional right, the right to their life.  

In the fall of 2012, Investigative Consultant Ira Robins asked me to provide an affidavit related to evidence that I possessed related to criminal misconduct by many high ranking City of Kenosha Police officials, including the Chief of Police.  Mr. Robins submitted this affidavit, along with other information that he developed, to the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.  Mr. Robins asked for a federal investigation into a pattern and practice of criminal civil rights violations on the part of the Kenosha Police Department.  Arguably, the most egregious of these civil rights violations was the death of Michael Bell at the hands of the Kenosha Police in November of 2004.  Based on information that I have obtained, I believe the federal government is conducting this investigation.  We will, of course, have to wait and see if indictments are issued.

My affidavit documented and provided evidence of numerous cases of concealment of evidence, altering of evidence, perjury, and other criminal acts by high ranking Kenosha Police officials, in addition to the numerous illicit acts involving the Kenosha Police investigation into the death of Michael Bell.  Some, but not all, of this information is already available in documents that I filed with the City of Kenosha Police and Fire Commission, the Kenosha County District Attorney, and the Wisconsin Department of Justice.  None of these agencies acted on this information.  Their indolence ultimately forced the unresolved issues to be submitted to the federal government so they could step in and protect the interests and constitutional rights of Wisconsin citizens.   Currently, the affidavit that I provided to the United States Department of Justice is not a public record because, as far as I know, they are investigating these crimes.

  Investigative Consultant Ira Robins also asked me to review the thousands of pages of documents, still photos, and videos that the City of Kenosha turned over to Michael Bell’s attorneys in his federal civil suit over the death of his son.  After my review of these materials, I have concluded that the shooting of Michael Bell was an intentional act that resulted from an unfortunate, unavoidable, but entirely understandable circumstance.  I believe that one of the four officer’s holstered handgun got caught in the side mirror of a car during the struggle with Michael Bell.  This caused the officer who’s handgun was caught in the mirror to honestly believe that Michael was attempting to disarm him.  His hysterical cries to the other officers due to his mistaken belief that he was being disarmed resulted in Michael being shot in the head.  This officer compounded the tragedy when he committed suicide in October 2010.        

The affidavit related to my theory is included in the packet of material that I provided to all of you.  I respectfully request and strongly recommend that you take the time to read it.  

 However, based on the thousands of pages of discovery documents that the City of Kenosha provided Michael Bell’s attorneys, the likely scenario that the Officer’s holstered gun was caught in the car mirror during the struggle was never considered nor explored as a factor in the death investigation.  To this day, unless the Feds are conducting an inquiry, this likely “gun getting caught on the car mirror” theory, has yet to be officially investigated.  There are only two possible reasons why the Kenosha Police Department, who were investigating their own officers, failed to traverse this avenue of inquiry.  
1.	Utter and inexcusable incompetence.
2.	Intentional conspiracy to conceal and deceive.  
With either reason, AB-409, should it become law, would prevent future instances in which a police department pre-disposed to corruption or incompetence could attempt to investigate their own officers who are involved in the death of a citizen.  

My dear sister is a police officer in southeastern Wisconsin.  Several years ago she shot an armed attacker in the line of duty.  Recently, during one of our discussions about this bill, she told me that any police officer involved in a justifiable shoot would have no fear of and would welcome the review of their actions by the entity established when AB-409 becomes law.  If I was not retired from law enforcement and was still an active officer, I would also prefer having the protection of the law to prevent a life sentence in a virtual prison for submitting to the peer pressure and participating in the crime of covering up a questionable or unlawful use of deadly force. 

 Many critics of this bill claim it adds an unnecessary level of government bureaucracy.  I ask you and these critics these questions.  Is protecting the natural right of the individual to life and liberty unnecessary?  Is having a legal system where individual citizens are protected by due process unnecessary?  I proclaim that critics of this bill demonstrate either inexcusable ignorance or a prince-like disregard of our country's founding moment.

After a few months of waiting for the right time (I was abroad on an internship) I've baught a 100kg barbell a bench and a rack which are arriving tomorrow. I'd love it if you guys could double check Im on the right path before I jump in feet first tomorrow! Also, feel free to set me some targets ;)

I'm 5' 8"", 133lb. I'v actually put on weight while interning in Toronto- I didn't have the money on an interns salary for gym membership or equiptment but started counting calories.

I'll be necking a svunt shake each morning for breakfast and ensuring (while not being anal) that Im hitting my calories, I love food and consider my diet fairly healthy.

Program wise? I'm liking the look of IC 5x5 (bit.ly/19uRA9M) 
But I'd like your opinion on one aspect of it. My genetics have blessed me with the ability to be able to develop a pot belly that can quickly grow to resemble a pregnant stick insect. For this reason along with the fact that my priorities are equally a)look good b)get strong Im wondering if more reps on this program would be a useful adjustment. Thoughts? 


Either way Im looking forward to the challenge, Ive never committed to getting fit before and I have reddit to thnk for turning that around. (I only use subreddits with a self improvement functionality)"
1v4nvl,10,2014-01-13,Could you all check my budget and give any other starting advice?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1v4nvl/could_you_all_check_my_budget_and_give_any_other/,"First off, thanks for helping me out with this.  I've been reading r/PF quite a bit for the past six months and I've learned a lot.  I've always been a naturally frugal person (thanks to my Mom), but I've never really taken charge of my finances.  I've had a job of some sort since I was 14 or 15 and I've always had enough money for what I wanted to do, but I never thought ahead.  Last Christmas, someone got me ""I Will Teach You To Be Rich"" and it opened my eyes to the fact that I needed to take a more active role in my finances.  

I'm a 23 year old grad student graduating with a STEM Master's in May.  I'll be getting married and moving to the DC metro area.  I'll be starting a job making $70k a year with the potential for a yearly bonus of 10% of my salary.  From talking to the other people there (I worked there this past summer), almost everyone gets 90% or greater of that bonus.  However, I'm not factoring that into my budget since it's not guaranteed.  Also, since I'll only be working for half of the year my first year, I'll only be eligible for half of the bonus (it's 5% twice a year).  My fiance will be doing a required internship for her profession (kind of like clinicals for nurses), so she won't be making any money the first year.  However, once she does the internship and gets her certification, she will probably make anywhere from $45k to $70k, depending on what job she takes.  Neither of us have any undergraduate loans (thanks to scholarships and in state schools!), but i will have ~$60k in federal grad school loans at around 6.5% interest.  They will be in deferment until November, but we're going to start contributing right away.

I've come up with the proposed budget below, but I'm open to any suggestions!  I tried to overestimate a little.

    	                            Monthly   	Yearly
    Rent	                        $1,500.00	$18,000.00
    Electricity/Water	            $200.00	    $2,400.00
    Internet	                    $70.00	    $840.00
    Cell Phone	                    $80.00	    $960.00
    Renter's Insurance	            $15.00	    $400.00
    Car Insurance	                $75.00	    $900.00
    Health Insurance	            $0.00	    $0.00
    Food	                        $600.00	    $7,200.00
    Transportation	                $500.00	    $6,000.00
    Entertainment	                $150.00	    $1,800.00
    Student Loan Payments	        $800.00	    $9,600.00
    Safety Net	                    $250.00	    $3,000.00
    Before Tax Expenses	            $4,240.00	$50,880.00
    Taxes	                        $1,060.00	$12,720.00
    Traditional 401k Contributions	$350.00	    $4,200.00
    Total Expenses	                $5,650.00	$67,800.00

I'm figuring a tax rate of 25% (that includes Social Security, state witholdings, and all of that; I got it from the ADP Payroll Calculator).  We'll both be staying on our parents' health insurances for now.  Since we both have siblings and their bills won't go down if they drop us, they both agreed we don't have to pay them anything.  We'll also both be staying on our parents' cell phone plans and paying them a negotiated amount.  As far as the transportation expense goes, I'll be taking public transportation and will most likely get rid of my car.  She has a paid off, 27ish mpg small car.  It should last for at least 3 to 5 more years with minimal repairs.  However, as part of internship, she'll be traveling different places every few weeks, so it's hard to rely completely on public transportation and to determine how much our transportation expense will be.

My company matches 25% of the first 6% you contribute, so I plan to contribute the 6% until I get my student loans paid off.  Then I'll start increasing it.  I think Fidelity manages our 401k.  I know to pick a target retirement fund with the lowest expense ratio.  Does anyone have any particular suggestions?  I seem to remember reading some negative comments about Fidelity on here.  Also, I'll be taking public transportation to work (DC metro) and I know there is some sort of commuter benefit program for public transportation mentioned in the company literature.  I'm not sure on the details yet, but it basically seemed like they take the money out of your check pretax.  Does anyone have any experience with that?

I'll also be getting ~$2500 (post tax) as a relocation bonus, plus another ~$3500 my parents had planned to give us as a wedding/starting our life present.  Some of that will go to help with moving costs, but we're hoping a large portion of that will start as our emergency fund.  I've left some wiggle room in the budget ($2200) in case I didn't account for something correctly.  If we really end up with any amount left over and with whatever bonus I get, we plan to contribute to our emergency fund (depending on where we're at) or make extra payments towards the student loans.  

Once my wife (I haven't referred to her as this yet!) gets a full time position, we plan to minimize lifestyle inflation and live the same way for a year or two so that we can pay off our student loans. From there, we'll probably start saving for our other goals.  Those include saving more for retirement (6% of my income isn't even close to as much as I want to save), travel, and maybe some fun items (new bike for her, kayaks, more backpacking equipment), etc.  We're not really in any hurry to own a house, especially in the expensive housing market of DC.  We also don't know that we'll be staying there long term, so we don't have much incentive to buy any time soon, even if we are in a better financial position to do so.

I think I've covered everything, but please point out anything that you see missing.  Am I forgetting anything?  Do any estimates seem unrealistic?  Is there anything I could do better?  Should I put my extra money towards my student loans (6% interest) instead of retirement?  Psychologically, I like knowing that my debt is paid off, so I'll most likely focus on that for now, but is there any reason it might be better to contribute extra towards retirement instead?

Once again, thanks for reading all of this and for your help."
1v4qc4,1,2014-01-13,I think I've finally realized my depression does not have a natural root.,ChrisGoesPewPew,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1v4qc4/i_think_ive_finally_realized_my_depression_does/,"I have been depressed since 7th grade. I graduated high school in 2011 and I just turned 21 last month. My basis of depression started from the lack of trust and freedom I got from my parents for literally no reason. I was what most parents would call the perfect child. I did not fight with my siblings, I didn't cuss, I didn't drink, I didn't throw wild parties. My idea of a party was sitting in a room with 16 xboxes lanning Halo 2. I went to school, made straight As, had a few very nice and cute girlfriends, and kept out of trouble. I played multiple sports and was in the cool crowd yet I wasn't a douche to the other groups and I had friends in every crowd.

It started with my parents lack of trust/freedom. We lived 2 blocks from our park, you could see the basketball court from our living room picture window yet my mother would not even let me go play by myself clear up to the point I moved out at 18.

The other big thing that started my depression was my lack of motivation to do anything. When I was in 7th grade halfway through the semester my career teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I had an uncle who passed away a year prior to that who was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked for NASA and an outfit in China and at the time of his death was working more as like a contractor for the various company and made really, really good money. Despite the fact that I was very smart and made perfect grades without even trying and on our state tests I always had the highest markings my teacher told me that I needed to have a more realistic goal and that realistically I would never be able to achieve that.

Ever since that day my motivation dropped and I started spiraling downward. My grades started slipping to the point that I only graduated with a 2.98 because I simply couldn't care enough to do my homework. I still got As on all my tests and in class work because I picked it up very easily and had no problems learning but I lacked the motivation to do my work. I stopped playing most sports and dropped back to just bowling and video games because it didn't take a whole lot of dedication and time.

I tried a few times to turn my life around. I moved out at 18 and started attending studies at a university. I ended up failing out from two different Universities and I'm currently failing out of another simply because no matter how hard I try I cannot stay motivated for more than 3/4s of a semester. I am having a very hard time keeping a job as well due to the lack of jobs in the area. I've tried fast food, sales, and I worked for a year as an intern IT when I was at the first University.

I have been dating a beautiful girl for just shy of 3 years and recently got engaged with her. I've been living with her for about 3 months now as well and I'm very happy with her. As much as things are looking up I still am always looking down. Through all the things I've been through throughout the years I am starting to realize something. I've been very happy with myself with the things I've accomplished and I've enjoyed the time I've spent with my friends and playing video games and such and I honestly think I can accept it now. I think that I can accept the fact that I'm just a lazy bum. It's not that I don't want to do things, it's that I lack complete motivation to do it.

The reason I feel like it's not a chemical imbalance or that it's a mental problem is because I have been somewhat happy the whole time. Yes I'm deeply depressed and I feel bad about my situation but all in all I have managed to make life worth living. I don't feel sick or off balance. Despite that fact, I've also thought about suiced many times, not because I'm so upset that I don't want to live life, but because I feel that one day all of this debt I have built up from school bills and other things and my lack of the ability to hold a job and keep things running smoothly are going to hit me and there is not going to be any way for me to stay happy through that and it might just be the easiest way out.

This year on New Years Eve my uncle who had been going through a very rough divorce shot himself in the head. He had been very depressed for a good while and though I tried to talk to him and keep his spirits up I saw it coming. While all of my family was sad and upset about it, my only thought was that he finally one. He was so upset and he wasn't liking how his life was changing and he didn't want to live without her even though he had a great job and everything. He was in love with her and she wanted to take everything he had. She kept pushing him and pushing him and he just wanted a way out, so he found it. In my eyes, I almost feel like he won. That's kind of why I have been wondering if or when I may end up doing the same thing. It would just be an end to it. Not a solution, just an end. 

The biggest reason I have never self harmed at all or gone through with anything is because I'm reasonably happy with what I have and I know that these actions are extremely selfish and do nothing but hurt others around you. At the same time, it would make it so I wouldn't have to feel hurt anymore. I don't think I'm sick or chemically off balanced like people have tried to tell me in the past. I just feel like I have found a logical reason to feel like at some point in my life it may be the easier option for me. I'm not afraid to live and I'm not afraid to die. I don't want to die and I would never want to put my friends and family through anything like my uncle just did. 

I'm honestly not sure why I'm posting on here today. I did at one time in the past and I don't even think I got any responses. I was just home alone and I felt like typing to release some of my thoughts and get them down. And note, I'm not trying to put all the blame on my parents or my teacher for the problems that I have, I'm simply stating that they helped cause it. I know my parents just cared about me and wanted me to grow up properly but as for the teacher that's not something you tell your students, that was really fucked up.

Anyways, I hope you all have a wonderful day and year. Peace."

I can't say I'm excited at the moment, but it will be an interesting year.
Going into my last semester at my college, then last summer internship then hopefully a study abroad in Singapore then full time job starting a year from now.

Sounds like the most exciting year yet, but I feel so down and lonely at the moment. Broke up with my third girlfriend back in October, she was great, a catch for me, but it was long distance and even though I really wanted it to work we were very different, but I'm still not over her. Recently talked to her and found out she has likely moved on and although I know getting back into a relationship is not what I wanted, I couldn't just be a friend to her.

I've never enjoyed the college life. I go to an engineering school in upstate NY, which ends up being very boring. The ratio is way off at my school 3:1 guys to girl ratio. I want to enjoy my last semester there, but I don't know how to. I just have negative feelings for it and to be honest I've only been my happiest when I was in relationships, maybe because I feel lonely during school.

I'm worried for the rest of my life after college, worried I won't meet the right people or get into the right relationships. Sometimes I don't know whether I'm in it for being lonely, the lust or actually love. I get so caught up in thinking about how my exes are living their lives and how they are so much more outgoing than me and that I'll never enjoy the college life or friendships or even the hook-up scene that they have.

I'm scared i'm not living my life to the fullest right now. I'm happy with my academic work and my passions, and I believe I can have a successful career, but i'm worried it will lead my life and I won't find true friends and relationships. My career and passions are the only things that keep me motivated. I have great friends at home and school, but they never seem enough to satisfy. I never feel wanted or necessary to them or looked up to.

I'm excited and nervous for the next year of my life. Going to be going to a lot of different places, meet a lot of people and do a lot different things, but I'm worried that even with that I'll be holding myself back. I'm scared that I'm my happiest when I'm in a relationship even if I'm in it for the wrong reasons.

I can't tell if I'm truly depressed or just in a rut in my life. I've felt this way before and I know things DO get better, but I want to make sure they get better and I learn from my mistakes and I make the right choices.

I overthink a lot of things and thats why I don't

Any advice is helpful."

I've never enjoyed the college life. I go to an engineering school in upstate NY, which ends up being very boring. The ratio is way off at my school 3:1 guys to girl ratio. I want to enjoy my last semester there, but I don't know how to. I just have negative feelings for it and to be honest I've only been my happiest when I was in relationships, maybe because I feel lonely during school, but I also feel like its great motivation for me.

I'm worried for the rest of my life after college, worried I won't meet the right people or get into the right relationships. Sometimes I don't know whether I'm in it for being lonely, the lust or actually love. I get so caught up in thinking about how my exes are living their lives and how they are so much more outgoing than me and that I'll never enjoy the college life or friendships or even the hook-up scene that they have.

I'm scared i'm not living my life to the fullest right now. I'm happy with my academic work and my passions, and I believe I can have a successful career, but i'm worried it will lead my life and I won't find true friends and relationships. My career and passions are the only things that keep me motivated. I have great friends at home and school, but they never seem enough to satisfy. I never feel wanted or necessary to them or looked up to.

I'm excited and nervous for the next year of my life. Going to be going to a lot of different places, meet a lot of people and do a lot different things, but I'm worried that even with that I'll be holding myself back. I'm scared that I'm my happiest when I'm in a relationship even if I'm in it for the wrong reasons.

I can't tell if I'm truly depressed or just in a rut in my life. I've felt this way before and I know things DO get better, but I want to make sure they get better and I learn from my mistakes and I make the right choices.

I overthink a lot of things and maybe thats why I end up feeling depressed because I don't spend enough time getting on with my life that I get stuck thinking about decisions and actions I can't change or about how other people are living their lives.

Any advice is helpful."

I don't know what to do with my life.,netz725,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1v55w7/im_23_years_old_and_im_lost_i_dont_know_what_to/,"Hello guys and gals, I am just writing this post to get some things off my chest and hopefully receive some advice from r/decidingtobebetter. 

I'm a 23 year old male, who just graduated with a Bachelors in Journalism and Media Studies last summer. I did well in college, earning a 3.67 GPA, good enough for a Cum Laude. I've always been a kid who strove for good grades and I mostly did that for my educational career.  Everything is all good right? No. 

Since high school, I never knew what I truly wanted to do for a career. Sure, I had childhood dreams, but those were unrealistic like being a professional athlete or something like that. Throughout high school, I tried to figure it out, but I never did. I just settled on journalism because I always wanted to have a job in the sports industry and I thought it was the best way to get there. Plus, it would challenge me to stop being shy and grow some balls to talk to strangers. 

However, in college… while it did force me to gather the courage to talk random people, the shyness never went away. Every time there was a reporting assignment, I dreaded the thought of going up to people and interviewing them. I was scared to death. I used to procrastinate until the day before it was due to interview people and it’d take me 3-4 hours to prep myself to finally talk to people. 

While I did well grades-wise in college, the experience felt empty. I felt like I did not accomplish much. I did not make any new friends. I joined one club, which I eventually quit because the people were very cliquey. I did not have a part-time job during college because I thought I could not handle the workload of 15-18 credits every semester. (one of my big mistakes) 

I didn’t get an internship until my senior year and I did not learn much from it because the organization was poorly ran. A lot of it was my fault and I regret not getting the full college experience because I did not push myself.

I’ve only had 3 real jobs in my life and I never had to really interview for any of them. Two of them I got because I knew someone in the company and with my internship, it seemed they let anyone work for them. 

Now it’s been 1 ½ years since I held a job and I have no idea what to do next. Every time someone asks me “what have I been up to?” My default response is “still looking for a job.” However, I haven’t been really looking because I’m scared to death to apply.  I think I’ve only applied to four jobs since my graduation. Pretty sad. 
I make up every excuse not to apply when I read the job description, it’s really terrible. Also, I’m really scared of rejection and failure. I’ve only failed one class in my life and it was the worst feeling ever and I never wanted to feel it again. Also that is why I haven’t had a girlfriend since senior year of high school, which lasted just a month. 

In addition, I’m very thin skinned. I’ve never really admitted to anyone, but I’m so thin skinned that every time I got an article or paper back, I just read the grade and that’s it. I do not look at the mistakes or anything because it kills me inside when someone critiques me on something.  

 I just really don’t have any direction. I don’t know what kind of job I want. My true passion is sports, but I don’t know how to make that a job. All the jobs I’ve looked up in the sports industry are not careers I’m really interested in. (Sales, operations, etc.) While I have a journalism degree, it’s not something I really want to pursue. I like writing, but I hate the reporting part of it. It feels so cut throat and I’m so thin skinned and shy that I feel I do not fit in well with the industry. 

I know for sure once I find a job I love, I will do whatever it takes to be the best at it because I’ve done it all my life especially when it came to sports.  After one year of playing tennis, I made my high school varsity team. When I was in tennis and basketball camps, I won most improved player and most hard working player. When I find something I have a passion for, I do whatever it takes to be the best, but I can’t find a career I’m passionate for.

Thank you for reading this post, I just really needed to write my feelings down somewhere because it’s been weighing on me for the longest time. If you have any advice, it’d be much appreciated. If not, thanks for reading again.

I am 29 yrs old and am trying so hard to find ""the one"" ultimate career. I am so indecisive and deathly afraid that I will be old with no job. We all know that INTPs have a very difficult time looking for that perfect career.

What wise tips can you beget to us, older INTP's? What would you do if you could go back in time? What can you offer to us less wise INTPs on how to find a perfect career?

Some things I've tried in an effort to find the ultimate career for more than a decade..... I was: 
A fashion model (my aunt is a fashion designer so I modeled her clothing line), an actress (I live in Los Angeles), a traditional folk dancer, patient escort, EMT, customer service, food prep cook (sandwich store, smoothie store, mexican restaurant), cashier at candy store, paralegal/legal clerk, assistant researcher for medical doctor x2 (2 different research), published co-author in the Journal of Psychiatric medicine, JPL NASA internship, postal worker, property manager for homes (god I hated that job), English teacher for ESL students, a successful ebay seller for collectible items, and a housewife (INTPs are not meant to be housewives). I was also a computer tech (built computers and networked over 100+ computers for high schools around my region.) In addition, I was in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps for a year and learned about airplanes, leadership training, and the military.

In terms of education, I have a Bachelor of Arts from UCLA for East Asian Studies, and an associate's degree in Business Management (completely unrelated, I know). I've studied everything from pre-med (so chemistry, organic chemistry, calculus, physics, genetics) to 2 different languages (Japanese, Korean) to history (Russian history, vietnam, art history, India, China, Korea, Japan) to religious studies (Buddhism in particular, but I also studied Christianity). I've studied nutrition, taken culinary classes, accounting, finance, supply chain management, business law, marketing, to computer programming, C++, HTML, and machine language (01010101). I have a license in sanitation management for restaurants as well. I've taken both the LSAT &amp; the MCAT and scored at a good range.

I've lived in different states in America, and currently live in Tokyo, Japan for my 3rd year and moving to Seoul, Korea soon.

You can see that I am truly searching for that 1 career.

Update April 2014: 

Wow, I have read every one of your responses and contemplating on them, turning them over in my mind. Thank you so very much for imparting to us your wisdom, although some of you still seem lost like me,lol. 

I am very grateful that you are helping us less wise INTPs. Thank you so much.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update June 2014:

So after about 15 years for searching for the ""ultimate career"" and reading everyone's comments here and thinking about them for several months, I am getting nearer towards a certain conclusion. I think INTPs are meant to be in a job that has a designing aspect, where constant thinking is required. I don't think we're meant to be a master in any one category, because once we master something we tend to lose interest and find something else. Continuing in this non-challenging environment would be a mundane task. Our type of personality would do best in a constantly thinking field, like a design-related field, where we can use our creativity combined with logic. An engineer is a type of designer, so is a head chef (makes the menu), an entrepreneur, a movie director, a researcher, a systems engineer....all types of designers.  

Like many, I too have tried many different jobs in order to find my ultimate career. I volunteered at all types of jobs and studied many things.

Everyone is different, but here are some questions I asked myself that helped in introspection greatly...allowing me to find that ultimate career (which I think I have discovered quite recently):


A. List all the things you find yourself enjoying consistently (ie. shopping, listening to music, golfing, etc). The key word is consistent. Answer the question and be very specific. Now ask yourself why and delve deeply. 

For example, I enjoy cooking. Why? Because learning the methods of cooking allowed me to have the tools to create anything I wanted. In fact, it was a sort of exploration into the world of taste. If I knew how to cook well, I could create anything I wanted to eat, and then my tongue could experience flavors I could not get locally. It was as if my tongue was traveling the world. It would take me away from the mundane-ness of everyday normal food. The new flavors excited me.


B. Next, we will go even deeper. Pick one thing you enjoy consistently, and pretending you are observing yourself in 3rd person, write down what you tend to do often. Then ask yourself, why do you do that?
For example, gaming is something I do consistently (meaning I've been gaming for decades). I noticed that I tend to do certain things constantly in a game. For example, I am obsessed with the character creation screen. It doesn't matter what game it is, I spend hours and hours on the creation of my character, constantly tweaking it. Why do I do that? It occurred to me that, it was because I enjoyed designing. It was fun. I liked to create things. 


 C. What have you been doing your whole life since childhood? What was something you have been doing, and still am doing? Why and what about it made it fun for you?
I've always liked reading. As a child, I mostly read fiction but as an adult, I mostly read nonfiction (news articles, scholarly journals, and textbooks for fun). Why? It was fun because I was gathering information. Through books or articles online I was able to research and get information to make a decision. 



 D. What habit do you see yourself doing over and over? For example, do you procrastinate often? Ask yourself why. 

A habit I do often is creating things but never finishing them. I had tons and tons of crisp, clean journals with the first few pages of them all written in. A new journal for a new project I made...such as ""Cooking Journal"" ""Health Journal"" ""Dream Journal""...etc. but then they were pushed aside after I lost interest in continuing to write in those journals. Why? Because for me, it was fun to create things but not finish them. Clearly I am not an INTJ, where the J part is good at finishing off projects that are started.



E. Finally, look over at all the answers to the questions above and look for key words. For me, I noticed I liked to create things and I did not like being bored. I liked gathering information and research. So I concluded that the type of job I should go for was a design-related job or an entrepreneur. It required one to constantly gather information, be creative, and was good at starting projects.



As an INTP, try as you might you can't change your personality. I think it is much better to play with your strengths and against your weaknesses. We are only 2% of the population and may feel like we're left out from the rest of our friends, but if we play with our strengths, we can achieve! "

1v5noi,3,2014-01-13,"Given the current Academic and economical climate, is a stem PhD going to overqualify me?",Thefakebatman,phdstudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/phdstudents/comments/1v5noi/given_the_current_academic_and_economical_climate/,"I'm 1.5 years into a PhD in the UK and while its very difficult, I am making progress. Lately however have been looking at jobs and have an offer to go into actuary, with study supposrt etc. Does mean taking exams while working - but compared to grad school, it looks more manageable - however I may be wrong. Does anyone have any experience with this? Any former PhD's out there that have quit?

My main concern is that academic jobs are very scares and I don't want to waste time even trying to get one. I see the people in my department who have clawed their way up and who they have had to become/what the have sacrificed (family/kids/hobbies etc) to get there and maintain it. I am at a top school (UK) doing computational engineering, but still think my chances are slim enough not to warrant wasting the best years of my life. So that leaves industry and non-academic jobs. 

To my amazement, the PhD students who have finished in my department and went on to an industry job started out with a lower salary (by far) than most graduate schemes! And both future pay and promotions were very limited - even the top engineers are cap at what would be a lower-mid range actuary's pay. A lot of the R&amp;D jobs (specifically requiring PhDs) I've looked at are very poorly pay compared with, say, the same number of years having trained as an actuary or accountant instead of a PhD. Of course I didn't start a PhD for the money, but for the love of science - however after living on the poverty line as a student (6 years now with BS, masters and PhD) for so long that is love is wearing thin. And one can only go on so long sacrificing everything for little or no return. I only have another 2 years to go so could sit it out and go into finance (quant finance or risk consultant or something similar) - but after burning myself out with a PhD the last thing I want to do is spend 70+ hours a week burning myself out for a job. Does anyone know about any quant/risk jobs that don't require insane hours?

Having spoke to other employers (that wouldn't otherwise request a PhD) I get the feeling that it's of no particular advantage and in some cases looked upon as either over qualified or ""couldn't make it as an academic and therefore wont make it in the real world"" - as one person put it.

I can leave PhD with a masters in had and a publication (or two), so not a complete lost. But not sure if I'd end up regretting it a few years down the line? Any Current/former PhD's have any advice? I have consider just taking a break from the PhD and maybe taking the job for a year or so (or finding an internship?) - but not sure that would work out.

It sounds weird but I think I'm ""bored"" with thinking all day long - I do a lot of advanced math and programing and while I enjoy it, I wouldn't mind if I was rewarded with good pay/opportunities instead if just another near impossible problem I'd like a job where I could ""switch off"" when I went home.

Cheers Guys,

Signed, a fed up PhD student.

- I have three boys. They live in the two-tier critter nation. 

- Sandor and Tyrion were brothers, but when puberty hit Tyrion became very violent and began attacking my sweet Sandor, so I had to separate them.
- Both live in one tier of the critter nation.
- I adopted Alphonse, introduced him to Sandor, and now they are the best of friends and are inseparable. They are very affectionate rats and are so passive.
- I worry about Tyrion being alone. He gets plenty of people time outside the cage, and he is absolutely great with people, but he cannot play with his brothers in neutral space without relentlessly and aggressively attacking them both.


So onto my question:

- Keeping in mind Tyrion's past behavior, would he get along with a neutered female rat? A family friend works for an animal rescue program and is always in need of homes for the rescues. 
- I've considered getting Tyrion neutered, but I don't really have the money right this moment (currently in an intern like situation in my last semester of college). Plus, there are not a lot of vets in my area that deal with small pets (I've checked to price them out), and my friend took his rat to the only one near us for the operation and the poor thing never made it out of surgery...which makes me wary.

I currently live in Houston, however I'm open to long-distance if things get serious.

About me?

My name is [Bryan](http://imgur.com/a/27M6j#0) and I'm 24 years old. I recently graduated from a university with a BA in print journalism.

Right now I'm on the job search for any publication companies, newspapers or magazines. However, I'm also writing as an editor for a video game website. It's an unpaid position, but it's a great start for my writing career. I also work at a grocery store.

Before joining the game website, I've been an editor for campus newspaper and I've also interned at the city newspaper as well. I gained a lot of experience and made huge connections. Since I've graduated, I'm taking off a semester before going back to college for business grad school. During that time, I'll be gunning for the editor in chief position, but that's only if I don't land a great job elsewhere.

As far as the job search is going, I have a lead on an internship and there's a person that I know who's putting in a good word for me. If everything falls into place, I won't be bumming it out at home for too long.

What else, what else? My hobbies include writing poetry, playing video games, cleaning, cooking and recording music (when I have the time, which is close to never--I'll explain in detail if you ask).

Like a typical nerd, I do watch anime. However, not as much as I used to. 

I'm a big fan of classics like ""Sailor Moon"" and ""Ramna 1/2."" I also recently went back and watch ""Akira,"" which turned out to be pretty disappointing for me. All time favorite at the moment has to be ""Samurai Champloo,"" with ""Cromartie High School"" at a close second. Right now, I'm in the middle of getting back into ""Kuroko no Basuket.""

I also listen to Japanese and Korean music. However, I never stray too far from music here in the States. I'm a huge fan of hip-hop and R&amp;B, but I also love Japanese rock and Korean pop as well. If I had to give you a glimpse of my library, my all time favorites at the moment are Utada Hikaru, Kendrick Lamar, Big Bang, L'arc en Ciel, 2NE1, Mac Miller, Drake, Drunken Tiger and T-ARA.

Honorable mentions go to Tyler, the Creator and Girls Generation.

(If you don't know any of the stuff that I'm throwing out here, then just know that I'm pretty well cultured, or at least I try to be.)

As far as food is concerned, I eat anything. There's nothing that I won't put in my mouth, but I've recently learned that this could be dangerous so I'm trying to learn about the food first before devouring it.

I enjoy action and horror movies. I'm okay with romantic comedy, but it really depends on who is acting. Some of my favorite movies are typical considering my personality. ""Deep Blue Sea,"" ""The Grudge,"" ""Rush Hour"" series, ""Men in Black"" series. ""Bad Boys II,"" and the ""Anchorman"" series are pretty awesome.

I'm also a big fan of some classics. ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""The Joy Luck Club"" is pretty up there on my GOAT list.

Lastly, I guess it must be addressed that I do have some disabilities and while none of them are severe or serious, they're there.

I was born with something called cerebral palsy and because of this, I have a corneal transplant in my right eye that I can no longer see out of (my left eye is fine). I wear leg braces. I am deaf in my left ear and partially deaf in my right ear. I wear a hearing aid in my right ear. In the past 20 years or so, I've grown to embrace my faults rather than hide them. On most days, I barely acknowledge that I have them or forget that they're even there.

I wish that I could control it's visibility to others, but that's wishful thinking. They seem to turn a lot of women away, which is why I'm on here searching for someone who is more open minded. So, if you are looking for companionship then I hope you're one of the few who is okay with the package deal.

....and that's pretty much it. PM me if you like what you read."

By: Martha Lucia Marin

It’s Human Trafficking Awareness Month. People are making signs, marching in the streets and learning how to integrate trauma-informed care into their client services. We think of the children in other countries being exploited for labor and sexual misuse. More recently, we’ve done a good job recognizing domestic minor sex trafficking, the forced prostitution of minors in our very own communities. I’m proud to say that countless organizations and law enforcement agencies have addressed the practice of arresting minors for what we used to call underage prostitution. Law enforcement agencies are now identifying these minors as survivors of exploitation and not minors willfully engaging in criminal activity. 

I’ll give you a split second to pat yourselves on the back. Done? Good, because we have more work to do. It’s time to connect the dots between childhood sexual abuse and the commercial sexual exploitation of children. But wait, I’m not done, don’t forget the boys! I find myself constantly saying “boys and men too!” After teaching sexual violence prevention to incarcerated men, I learned quickly that we had forgotten the them. Men are also survivors of child sexual abuse and must also be included in this conversation. 

It is important to state that boys and subsequently men have also experienced this manipulation and as a result are also susceptible to being coerced into commercial sexual exploitation. Stereotypes of masculinity make it difficult for many people to imagine a boy or young man being exploited. We force men into this constant frame of provider, protector and emotionless stoicism. More importantly and unfortunately, we apply this mentality to boys. “Why didn’t he just leave?” “Why does he allow someone to film him?” “He must be gay if he is a prostitute.” We fail to take into account the variables of poverty, homophobia, abuse and how those variables correlate to present behaviors. No wonder men feel less inclined to disclose abuse or reach out for services. We can’t only mention girls and women in our policies, services, flyers, websites, rallies and marches. 

Connecting the dots can get complicated when there are so many, well, dots. What we do know is that at least 1 in 6 men have had an unwanted sexual experience before the age of 18. We do know that many of those men were emotionally or physically coerced by someone they trusted. So when you are advocating for children and girls, remember the boys. Remember that those boys grow up to be men and need our awareness, compassion and resources to heal. I urge you to remember the men. Read more on the Joyful Heart Foundation

1v6p2u,3,2014-01-14,What can I do to experience Japan?,[deleted],japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1v6p2u/what_can_i_do_to_experience_japan/,"This is gonna be a wall of text, I'm 18 years old studying programming in The Netherlands (MBO, if that makes any sense it's a tertiary education (yes, I know, Netherlands has a weird, a*s-long education system which nobody really understands unless you're living here) anyway, it's NOT university). For people not familiar with the Dutch education system, [here](http://puu.sh/6kA0t.png) Yep, I'm at the blue spot.

I'd love to experience Japan, like I saw many posts here on Reddit with people who did an exchange program and lived a year with a Japanese host family. I feel like I missed something very important when I was still 16 and 17, but then again, none of my schools offered an exchange program, nor does my current school do (except for an internship abroad, but of course, none are available in Japan).

And you know, that sucks, because I feel like exchange programs are so openly available for Americans only (excuse me for my ignorance, I might be seeing it completely wrong.. I'm just a bit frustrated).

I still have 2,5 years of my MBO programming school left, after that, I can enroll to HBO (4 years), and then master's (1-2 years), or directly to the job marker, but the chances are quite naught of finding a job in NL with only an MBO programming diploma.

/r/Japan, what are my chances of experiencing Japan? I'm intending to work there in the future, and hopefully settle down there for good (inb4 discouragement posts about how difficult it is and shouldn't do that, and that I'm probably over-fascinated..)

This post may seem a bit sarcastic, if not angry, but I just really wanted to vent out, nothing personal.

Thank you sincerely in advance.

Now at some point I come across a multiplication of matrices as seen in the image: http://imgur.com/Txyqe7q

Now I cant figure out why anyone would put a transposed 11 in there. The matrix dimensions wouldn't work without some term in between. 

Since the circle is an entry-wise division.
The only thing I can think of is that it could be an all one matrix with the correct dimensions. That would make this some kind of summation of the amount of items since U and V are both binary matrices which could make sense since the division should do some kind of averaging.

Still, I've never seen this notation so if you can help me, people of the internets, I would be most grateful.

1v7fls,632,2014-01-14,As of this Friday I hit 100k in savings. Some tips to other Savers.,PetiePal,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1v7fls/as_of_this_friday_i_hit_100k_in_savings_some_tips/,"I haven't been paying TOO much attention to the accrual recently, but with the new year starting, I like to realign my finances in January. Took a look and noticed as of Friday 1/17, I'll have saved over 100k! A few years back this seemed insurmountable. My story isn't as common as others, (no one really is they're all so unique!), but hopefully people can learn from my mistakes.

A little background on myself...I'm 31, (32 in April). I am currently a Director of Managed Infrastructure Services for a tech company. I'll be 10 years out of college this spring. I had a pretty rocky start to my investing and saving though. In college I worked a workstudy job my junior/senior year that I basically approached my favorite professor for. He was good friends with the IT manager for the college of Arts and Sciences, and got me in with them. Job was literally across the street from me and I could earn $3-400 every week just working there. When there was no work I was able to do school work and study etc, so it was a really great deal. Post Sophmore and Junior years I worked an internship with an insurance company my cousin worked at, and post-graduation I was taken on full time for several months until cutbacks forced my layoff. Found a new job by January, and was there for about a year. Then the bleakness started!

I was out of work for nearly a year. Yes...a year. It was pretty terrible I couldn't find anything and looking back I should have taken something shitty, anything to bring some money in. I was in a bit of credit card debt, and overdue on some payments. As well I had a hospital visit at some point that was supposed to be covered but I ended up getting screwed and had to basically beg for the loan to be lowered. I finally landed a few 8-9 month contracting gigs for Pharmaceuticals, and some other companies. Sucks because no health benefits but I got my debt back to zero. My only real bills during this point were gas, car insurance and monthly cell phone bill. When the last contract ended I'd had enough. It was time for a full-time position with benefits and some type of retirement plan. 

I did land a great position with a solar Solar company minutes from my house. I started as a Tier 2 Helpdesk Tech. After about a year my coworker got fired, which was a blessing because he was a nightmare. As soon as I was eligible at my company I started socking away money to my 401k. I believe I was doing about 18% out of every paycheck simply because I could. I had kind of freaked out that year since I realized that they auto-cashed out my 401k at the second job out of college, which amounted to like 2-3k. So I decided to start saving as much as possible. During this time I read [Ramit Sethi's I Will Teach You To Be Rich](http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich-ebook/dp/B004WL4BW6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389719815&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Ramit+Sethi+I+will+teach+you+to+be+rich) which really ended up being my best resource. I took his automatic savings, ""set it and forget it"" method to heart, and set up auto everything. 

* Every paycheck I was doling out 18% into my 401k
* I had stock options with the solar company that I bought some into, which actually sucked for awhile because the company majorly tanked prior to my layoff 4 years later, but it's recovered enough now I'm nearly ready to sell.
* I started a few (then) INGDirect accounts and starting saving slowly for Emergency funds, secondary checking, Christmas Gift Funds, ($75 a month till December and you're set!), House Down Payment, Engagement Ring Savings etc
*  I started increasing my monthly payments on my car from 300 to around 4-550. Snowballed it down fairly quickly and paid off in 2013.
* Next up will be the remaining 5k student loans I still have. I've heard arguments both sides for paying it off immediately if I can, and then putting anything I WAS paying off monthly to investments

After the solar job, I was laid off unexpectedly, and took the summer off since I had severance pay for 6 months plus unemployment. That job took a lot out of me so I needed a bit of a break. (No vacations and very little time off when I worked there for 4 years) I landed a new job, a big step up salary and career-wise in September 2012. Been there since, and have been investing more and more through 401k, and auto deductions. I call my credit card companies every 6 months and get limits raised. Credit score is nearly perfect. I never miss a payment, and have it down to a 5 day window when I receive bills and then auto pay them from an account. Only one snafu with this on car insurance where they decided to ludicrously raise my rate without notifying me and deducted a years worth of payment at once. Fixed this up and have alerts and protections in place now though so it will never happen again.

Best tips I can get:

* Invest early. Get used to not missing the money. Best thing you can do.
* One of my favorite quotes comes from the movie The Score starring Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton. ""Make a list of everything you want then plan on spending the next 20-30 years getting it, slowly."" Great advice. I want some pricey things...a nice tv, surround sound, [LoveSac](www.lovesac.com) furniture for the Mancave. I set a monthly or bi-weekly transfer to sub-accounts in CapitalOne, (formerly INGDirect), and I get what I want, but not at the expense of savings, emergency savings, investments, or bills/utilities.

1v7ubu,1,2014-01-14,"Alright dear architects of reddit, what better place to ask for help than this subbredit? This is a question about architectural programs, universities/colleges and degrees.",needtogetmyshittoget,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/1v7ubu/alright_dear_architects_of_reddit_what_better/,"Alright, so before reading along, I would like you to understand that you'll basically be helping a stranger, a dude who's confused and unaware of what's up in the academic-world, get his s#it together and study what he's passionate about, that is - creating great buildings that will be visually stunning, durable, and most efficient. I am here for advice because I believe in getting help from people who actually want to help is thousands time better than getting *help* from a crazy-bit#h who gets payed to send students out of the school into whatever universities just because it's her job. I do not wish to get into this conversation of why I think this is wrong on many levels. Basically, I wrote all this to thank you in advance, whoever is going and willing to help a stranger out, for taking your time to support me. Please, whoever is not interested in helping, thanks for reading this far, but after this its just me giving information to whoever want to help. (just to make sure, knowing reddit as I do, this is my *throwaway* account or whatever they are call it so it's not meant to get me imaginary karma, I just truly need help)



**BACKGROUND**

Currently I am a student on my first year doing architecture in a place that I do not really appreciate, how and why I got here is not important, neither is why I don't want to stay here. The important thing for whoever wants to help me out is to understand that there was very, *very* low chance of things working out for me the way it didn't and therefore I ended up where I currently am, doing my BA in Architecture. 

My school background: I finished an international school with an IB (International Baccalaureate) Diploma, with the world average 30 points out of 45. I'm not going in details with what the program is, ask me specific questions if that'll help you help me. The thing is, I had HL (Higher Level) Arts in which I got a decent 5/7 (some people think its a blow-off class, but that ain't true, especially in my school). I also wrote the Extended Essay (part of the IB diploma program) about architecture and scored the highest possible grade, A, highest in class, in it. Basically, now I have a portfolio with all the works I've done in school (not architecture related), my IB diploma with 30 points and some more of my works that I've created here in my first semester (architecture related) that I will add to my diploma. I also have 3 recommendations (from my HL maths teacher, my SL (Standard Level) physics teacher and my HL Visual Arts teacher). Now it is time to get my s*it together.

**END OF BACKGROUND**

What I want to know is information regarding types of architectural degrees, colleges/universities and intern-work experience as well as work after getting masters degree in Architecture. I'll break down my questions into smaller, more specific ones:

1.What are, the most notable and useful (in terms of getting a job afterwards) programs in architecture (and since architecture is *huge*, consider that I'm looking at the general, building-design type of studies) that I can study for the next several years? (Sandwich type of studies - where I'll be able to work intern in-between studies, was recommended to me, I'd like to know more about how that works as well, please.)

2.What are the best architectural colleges/universities around the world from your personal perspective? (still, ones that teach profoundly and are recognized in the architectural society)

3.What do I need to do to enter the great university/college, in terms of my grades and portfolio? (I know, this is as basic of a question as it gets, but I truly have no effin' clue)

4.Do I need to get in college/university at all? (this question goes to all the self-taught architects out there, if they even exist, I mean, I understand that everyone needs some sort of qualification, especially when job is as serious as architecture, but are there other ways of approving your knowledge?)

5.USA, Asia or Europe? could you basically give very simple pros and cons of choosing one out of these three? 

6.Knowing my grades, what are my chances of actually succeeding in architecture? (I know this is just an opinion based thing, but I'd simply like to know how much my high-school grade is depended on what I'll be able to achieve in life. Argh, stupid thing to say, I know success and grades are not entirely interdependent, I just want to know if I'll be able to get into good universities and plan out my near future.)

Thanks again for reading, if you have anything, any question at all that I can answer to help you help me, go ahead and ask me. I really appreciate your help, hell, who knows, if I ever become a great architect, it might be because of you people."
1v7wla,1,2014-01-14,Every move I make is sabotaged...,cursedasfuck,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1v7wla/every_move_i_make_is_sabotaged/,"I feel like I am cursed.

I graduated from college with a B.A. in Film Production. I work hard and am good at what I do.

In college, I earned enough money to purchase a DSLR. Over the next few years I built up some respectable gear. I rented gear I couldn't afford to buy. One day I was on my way to return some rented gear and had to run a quick errand before, so I parked in the busy lot and went inside. Ten minutes later I returned to my car to find the door handle and trunk busted. Someone had broken in and stolen all my gear, as well as the rented lens and shotgun mic.

That was terrible, but not as bad as two months later when my car was totaled. A teenager driving a stolen truck caused a head-on collision and nearly killed me. Of course he was uninsured. Even though I have uninsured motorist coverage up to $25,000, my insurance company is still twiddling their thumbs and hasn't paid my nearly $20,000 medical bills. It's been six months. Apparently this is legal and they are allowed to drag it out as long as they want in the hopes that I will give up. I have a lawyer, but that doesn't stop my credit from plummeting now that the hospital has sent my bills to collections. Collections calls me 3 times a day. I still have a lot of pain from my injuries in the crash, but I'm afraid to go to the doctor because my health insurance refuses to pay for anything related to the accident.

I was handling everything okay. A couple weeks ago I got a new job as a video editor. The first day I started work, my iMac crapped out on me and completely stopped turning on. Understandable. It was old and couldn't handle the software. I had a bit of money left from my old job, and I knew that a reliable computer would pay for itself in a month at my new job.

I wanted something powerful for the price tag, so I bought a $1,400 Lenovo. At first it was very stressful and frustrating learning how to transfer projects from my boss's mac work to my windows computer and back. I got through that and have so far earned back half of what I paid for it. I even started a film festival internship I'm really excited about, which will require me to use my laptop a lot.

Today was a good day. I was feeling brighter about the future than I have in a long time. Then I got home.

A pipe had burst upstairs, and there was a torrential downpour in the kitchen. The waterfall was only coming down in one spot, right onto the kitchen table.

Right on top of my new computer.

I had left it there in sleep mode this morning after using it to look up an address. It was totally waterlogged. I took it apart and put it in rice, but everything I'm reading says that if it was on, it's toast.

I almost feel like crying from frustration. I just paid my car insurance bill (which is so high it is LUDICROUS) last night, so my bank account's getting low. I need the computer to do my job. All this is just scratching the surface of the unlucky stuff that's been happening to me in the past few years. My friends have always joked that I'm ""cursed,"" but I'm really starting to believe it. It seems like every time I try to move forward, I get kicked back into my place. I don't know what to do...I could really use some reassurance and someone to just comfort me."

In the first half of 2013 I was a complete mess. No job, lazy, unmotivated, sad. It was a difficult time for myself and for my partner.

One day I applied for an internship at a company I liked. Two weeks later I got the position. I was relieved and happy.

I started working hard and not much later I got offered a small contract.

Things are not that bad. I enjoy the work I do and I feel like I have room to grow, add my 'personal touch' to the company and really make a difference. I just need to have patience and work hard.

Here's the thing though. I am 26 and I have the feeling I am too late, with everything. I want to go back to finish my degree, but I feel like I am too old. I see people my age who have accomplished much more than me, and instead of getting motivated by it, I get sad. I am 26 and I feel like it's too late to do new things and try new paths.

I KNOW this is stupid, but I can't seem to tell myself this.

Some of my friends are younger and have accomplished more. I keep comparing myself to others. I cannot be happy with just impressing myself, I feel the need to impress others and seek their validation. This all comes back to me thinking it is too late. How can I validate myself when other younger people have done more than me?

I am 26 and I feel like it's too late. It's not, and yet I can't seem to tell myself this.

Sorry, this is not really a question, I just needed to write this down. It's frustrating. I wish I could stop feeling sorry for myself."

(This is the part where I say a little bit about myself, so feel free to skip to the questions) From an early age I was exposed to film and special effects (thank you mum for letting me watch The Fellowship of the Ring behind dad's back) and I instantly fell in love with one huge part of it all in particular: the makeup. Every single film I have watched since then, and to this day, all I can do during the movie is stare at their makeup/prosthetics and think ""how do they do that? I want to do that!"" Obviously my never-ending love and admiration for film also had something to do with it, which is why it shouldn't be surprising that I wanted to make a career out of this. Lastly I should add that I'm not pursuing this so I can do my friend's makeup, or my makeup for that matter, so that we look pretty on an outing. No, I'm pursuing this because I want to make a living doing something that I'm so incredibly passionate about and work in an industry that I've dreamed of being a part of since I was a child. (I'm attending Blanche MacDonald in Vancouver next year.)



**Anyways, on with the questions. Now there are a few that I have:**

*Are there specific ways to become a professional's PA post-graduation?

*What are the best ways of networking with other artists and professionals to improve your chances of getting your name out there and meeting people?And who are the people to speak with? (Of course, like most jobs, it's also about the people you know and who you make an impression on)

*Where are the best places to live/travel to if I want to better my chances at finding a job?

*Of those professionals out there who may be reading this, is there any advice or tips that you can share that you wish you were told earlier on in your career?

*Are there sites/agencies that can be contacted that can help you find an internship?

*What are the wages like, and how difficult is it to sustain yourself when you're new to the field?

*What are the hardest parts of being an MUA that you find a lot of people give up at?

*Post graduation I have been told that it's preferred you spend roughly five years on the field doing weddings, events, volunteer work, before you get considered to work on a bigger project such as a movie set or large photo shoot, etc. Why is this and is it like this for everyone? Is it possible, depending on your experience and talent, to get considered any earlier?


Anything else helps, and thank you for reading this far! It means a lot.

I'm sorry in advance is this is the wrong place for this post. I have a phone interview tomorrow for an engineering internship. This is an entry level position which is to be filled by students working on their CS degree. As a student working on his CS degree, I applied and now have a phone interview tomorrow at 2:00. The company in question mainly uses Java, and the interview tomorrow is a technical interview. I've taken java classes before, but it's been a little while since I've really used the language. I've been doing research and brushing up on my java all day (and plan to continue all night and into tomorrow). but I'd love it if you could give me some more questions I might run into in this interview so I can be properly prepared

Some sample questions I was given:

* What is the difference between a list and a linkedlist
* What is a map
* what is an array

Now these seem like fairly simple questions, and they are. but these are the kind of things I'm going to be asked. I'm also going to post the requirements and desired requirements too:

**Required Skills:**

* Pursuing a degree in Computer Science or related field
* Minimum of 2 completed years towards the degree
* Java/JEE development skills
* Java script development skills
* HTML, CSS development skills
* Experience using and designing Web-Based applications

**Desired Skills:**

* Experience with relational databases
* Experience with NoSQL databases
* Experience with a Model View Controller (MVC) architecture
* JBoss/JEE Application Container development experience
* Tomcat Experience
* XML/XSLT Experience 

Basically I'm wondering what other kind of questions I might run into in the interview so that I can be properly prepared. Thanks in advance!

Edit: Thanks for all the great replies everyone, I'm feeling pretty confident now reading your comments and doing general research. I'll update tomorrow with how the interview went. 

Edit2: so it turns out the first interview was not a technical interview, but I have another one scheduled next week. But it's still good to have this knowledge, thanks for the kind words everyone."

1v8ose,1,2014-01-14,How do I know if she still loves me?,jo720,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1v8ose/how_do_i_know_if_she_still_loves_me/,"I'm a 22 year old male who used to date this girl (21) for about 4 years(on and off). 

This is a long text but I really need to get this out. We went through a lot of shit,she did a lot of things that made me very upset but I forgave her every time. You know that cheesy movie ""The Notebook""? When the dude first saw her at a carnival and he instantly fell in love with her? Well,something like that happened to me but not quite the same luck afterwards.

After dating 4 years I had to move away for Med School so we kept a long distance relationship but had very good communication,we talked everyday and all night. I really loved that girl,I think I still do even tho I want to forget about her forever. The thing is,while I was away at that time she suddenly one night sent me a message telling me she needed to talk to me.

Since she never said that before I immediately called her as soon as I saw that,when she picked the phone up she sounded extremely upset and for some reason I already knew what had happened. She went to a party the evening before(I knew about it) and she had made out with some dude. I felt my stomach turned into a knot the size of Texas and I just wanted to throw up. 

I quickly asked her if she liked the guy and if she wanted to be with him,she said NO and that she ""loved"" me and that was only a mistake she made,she begged for forgiveness. I was really sad so I decided to go a couple of days without talking to her,but I eventually gave in and forgave her AGAIN. I seriously wanted to marry that girl...

Long story short,she disappeared without a warning,she uploaded pictures with her new guy on FB without even giving me explanations and she just stopped answering my calls. I was devastated to the point I had to run for comfort to MY MOM. Lame,I know.

The thing is,I went back home and decided to go out with friends to a bar for the night. And to my worst luck I saw her with her new man...I didn't tell her anything obviously at that moment. I just sent her a message that night that I've seen her with her new guy(I was drunk and hurt). She got all upset that why didn't I go to her,that if I really loved her I would have gone over there and take her back. She also expressed that she felt frustrated with me because since I moved to Med School she missed me a lot and felt lonely and that she couldn't take to see me only on vacations. So...suddenly it was all my fault and I felt horrible. After that we stopped talking,period.

I don't know if she dislikes me to this day or what her feelings are,since we basically didn't get closure on this situation. I think we both got really hurt and we where young and dumb.We still are.

She's still with that guy but for some WEIRD reason she hasn't deleted me off FB and occasionally likes some of my posts and sends me really pointless messages like ""Hi,sorry to bother you :) but do you know any good banks over where you study? It's just that I'm going over there on an internship and I would like to know"" or ""Hi! :) can you help me with some privacy settings on Facebook?"" you know,shit like that,pointless as fuck. There's google for that. I don't even know why she even still has me on Facebook or why she sends me those random messages,it just makes my heart wanna come out off my mouth every time I see a notification from her.

I still love her,sadly. I know this because I've seen her a few times from a distance because we tend to hang out in the same spots... and I still get nervous. We haven't spoken in a long time except those random messages she sends. I want to forget her or at least know if she still loves me. She hurt me a lot. But I can't help being in love with her. 

I would like to know any good advice or opinions on this? It will be appreciated."

1v95md,1,2014-01-15,"Last November my Dad passed away. I've been wanting to tell someone the story of it all, but I can never find the courage to do it. So, I guess I'll share it here.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1v95md/last_november_my_dad_passed_away_ive_been_wanting/,"Last year started out as the best year of my life, and that's not an exaggeration. Early on in January I was approved for an internship at a local radio station, something I've dreamed of doing ever since I was a little kid. It was better than I ever could of imagined, and my Dad couldn't have been prouder. He would smile and tell me all the time how proud he was that I went out, followed my dream, and made it a reality. It felt great.

Now for a little backstory. My Dad and I had a very...interesting relationship. When I was a kid he scared me. He was a drinker, and was VERY strict about raising me right. One night he came home really drunk and my Mom was away at work, meaning I had to deal with it all on my own. I was terrified, and it caused me to become distant towards him. The next time it happened, my Mom was home, so that made it better, but not by much. Then one day, out of no where, my mother told me I had to pack my things and that we were leaving. I had no clue what was going on, but I had some idea it had to do with my father. That night my mom and I stayed at a hotel. After that things died down, everything went back to normal. Then one night, my dad was acting strange again. Next thing I knew I was packing my things, but this time was different. As my mom and I were leaving, he staggered outside with us, looked right at me and yelled ""I WON'T FORGET THIS!"" That night we stayed at my sisters house, and he called us over and over again. I don't really remember the next few months, only that we stayed with my sister and things were obviously weird with my father. Finally, my mom and I left and found a new place to live, smaller. I missed my old house, still do. After a while my dad started stopping by, and next thing I knew he was staying with us, sleeping on the couch downstairs. I hated it. I hated him. Then one night he needed to go out and buy a pack of cigarettes, and wanted met to go with him. I assumed we would just drive there, but instead we walked. It was a good hour away. I expected it to be horrible, but it ended up being a life changing experience. The whole way he apologized for everything, explained himself, and finally ended his speech by making me a promise. He promised that he would try his best to become my best friend. I laughed, but he ended up being right. To shorten this already long story, we became best friends. Every day after school we would talk, and laugh. We watched TV and sports together, shared our opinions on different topics, and he would give me tons of advice on growing up, and how to be a good person. He turned his entire character around, all because of his love for his family. And I loved him. He became an amazing father, my best friend, and I went to him with everything. 

Now back to last year. The internship lasted seven months, and I left the show a week before my birthday. When my birthday did come around, I spent it working, since I love my job and we weren't celebrating until the weekend. When I finally got home late that night, I found my Dad sitting upright on the couch watching TV in the dark, which was unusual. He looked at me, pale and clearly in distress, telling me he might have to go to the hospital. Worried, I told him I would take him, but he insisted on going himself. I told him to call me when he got there, and went to go and take a shower. When I got out, I went downstairs to find him still there. He told me that the family needed him, and that he was probably fine and should stay. I ended up arguing with him until he finally went. He stayed in the hospital for the rest of the week, and I would visit when I could. Then that weekend I stopped by on my way to play basketball with some friends, to say hi and check up on him. When I entered the room my parents sat me down and explained to me how my father had Stage 3 lung cancer, and that we were going to do everything to fight it. I wasn't sure how to react, but I remained hopeful. The next few months were absolute hell. My Dad couldn't taste foods, he lost tons of weight, had trouble doing simple tasks like walking and getting dressed, and every day he complained and suffered, with every right to do so. It was hard to watch, seeing the strong, caring man that was my best friend going through so much pain. Yet through it all he remained hopeful, telling me all the time how he was going to beat it. Things seem to get better, only to immediately got worse again. My father was staying in the hospital every now and then, and one night my Mom came in nearly in tears, telling me how things were only getting worse, and fast. So I went upstairs and shared a moment with my father that I didn't realize at the time would be my last. The lights were off in his room, and when I came in I hopped into bed and lied down next to him. We talked, I told him how Mom was worried about him, and he told me not to be afraid, that everything would be ok. I started nodding off, and when I shook myself awake I laughed and told him how I was falling asleep. He laughed and told me he was doing the same. We both laughed at each other, and I told him goodnight and went to bed. I woke up the next morning and he had gone to the hospital. He had called me that night, but he didn't sound normal. The next night my mom held a family meeting, telling my siblings and I that he was going into Hospice. I don't know exactly what was going on, but basically my fathers brain wasn't getting much oxygen and couldn't function properly anymore. When I stopped by to see him he could barely talk, only mumble and groan loudly. He was constantly falling asleep, and didn't even know what was going on. I couldn't bare to see him this way. That night he went to hospice. The next day I arrived early in the morning to see him; we all did. It was his birthday. We all spent the day together in the room, laughing, crying, talking, and some of my Dad's siblings eventually showed up from up north to check in. Finally at the end of the day we all said out goodbyes for the night. Before I left with my aunt my mother pulled me aside and awkwardly brought up the inevitable. I told her firmly I wanted to be there for him, no matter what. I knew the risks. I wasn't even a minute down the road when my brother texted me to come back. I did a stupid and dangerous U-turn, sped back to the room, to find my father passed away. I cried. Hard. We all did, it was unbearable. I remember just walking around the building crying, then going into the room and crying, over and over again. Before his body was taken away, I kissed his forehead and said ""Goodbye, best friend"". My mother hugged me, and told me that while he was still barely coherent, that all he would talk about was wanting to go home and fix me dinner. Afterwards we held a memorial cervice, and life seemed to go back to normal. Only it's not. I think about him every day, cry every once in a while, and don't sleep well. I could go on and on about how upset I am and what not, but this story is about our relationship and what happened, and it feels good to finally write about it. "
1v99u5,2,2014-01-15,"I feel like my [F22] SO is absent minded, selfish and controlling when it comes to me [M24]",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1v99u5/i_feel_like_my_f22_so_is_absent_minded_selfish/,"This is going to be quite a post and I'll try to remain as unbiased and not one sided as possible. Forgive my poor writing. On my phone. Also this is a throwaway.

I [M24] have been in a relationship with my SO [F22] for around a year and 5 months. For the most part things have been ok. There have been petty arguments over the course that have usually been resolved. We love each other - we plan to get married, we both think that we can be with nobody else. Most days I feel this way, but sometimes my mind goes to a very dark place. There are just some things that are hard to overlook and  I get stressed and miserable. 

For quite some time there has always been this lingering stress my SO has put on me in our relationship that just manages to stay around and end up adding on to other stressful events.

It all started at her 21st birthday about 10 months ago. I gave a speech infront of her family and friends that was really well received. I talked about how kind she was and how she had changed my life for the better and how lucky I was to have her. I truly meant it with all my heart. I even started to cry abit during the speech. After the speeches it was her turn to thank everyone... She thanked her parents and her brother and even some friends who came from out of state. But she didn't thank me personally or have anything to add to what I had just said. On the inside I felt abit humiliated... I had poured out my heart and soul to her and everyone there. I guess I just selfishly wanted even a little thanks but I didn't get one. After some days past I brought it up with her and she was apologetic about it - she said she was nervous, a little tipsy. I said it wasn't a big deal and only told her so it wouldn't fester. I let it go, but honestly kept noticing that when it came to things involving me she was quite absent minded.

 Some things I noticed that kind of started to bug me were petty but nonetheless annoying  - most times were out together she'll always take the time to respond to text messages she receives from others but whenever I text her and she's out with people it'll take her more than an hour to respond to me most times. I wouldn't be so fussed about it, but it just seems like she'll make an effort for others but not me in this regard. Also, sometimes we go out and she insists on being home at a specific time and mostly it has to be early. Yet when going out with friends and family she gets home quite late... Over 2am. I don't understand why when it comes to me, there are limits to her being home. Her family and I have a pretty great relationship. They're inviting and I always offer to help them out any way I can. They've never been rude to me, in fact her mother insists we get married. 

Forgive me for being a little narcissistic here. When it comes to Facebook posts, I can only count less than a handful of times she has acknowledged our relationship online. She made a photo of us her profile picture once, a very long time ago. Aside from that she never shares anything about us, what we do or the holidays we've been on together including photos. Now again I wouldn't be fussed, but I am, because she pretty much shares a lot of other things she does with others. Currently, she's in New Zealand contiki on a girls trip with her cousins. She coincidentally ran into an old male friend from high school and posted a photo of them together. It was incredibly frustrating to see this. I trust her totally, but I must say I'm incredibly jealous and quite annoyed she was willingly excited to share a photo of another man. I guess it also made me quite uncomfortable to see her with this person i have no clue about. I don't plan on bringing it up until she gets back next week. But still I feel like she isn't proud of us? I always share things about is because I'm incredibly proud. I guess I feel a little left out. Also I make a conscious effort to take her places she's never been in our city. Recently, a friend her and her brother made on a contiki tour  from the states came over they showed him some sites and she kept saying that she never knew our city was so interesting. It was frustrating to here this because I've tried really hard to be fun, engaging and always wanting to try new things. She also shared photos of her, her brother and this contiki friend on Facebook. I'm overreacting, but it's just frustrating to see this sometimes. Considering I feel like she doesn't think I'm worthy of her internet life. I've also noticed that she never insists on taking photos together until I mention it and sometimes she gets annoyed I want to take photos. I plan on being it up to her when she gets back from her holiday.

In regards to what I said previous, I'm a very trustworthy person with her, but I can't say the same about her sometimes. A few months ago my best friend and I planned a day at the beach, he ended up inviting a mutual female friend of ours as well. I asked my girlfriend if it would make her uncomfortable and she said yes and would be disappointed if I ended up going. I was pretty upset about it. I felt like a child being told by his mother he couldn't have fun. We had a big argument about it, and she kept insisting it was wrong of me to go to beach with another girl around. Even though there where 3 of us. She kept saying I was acting like a spoilt brat. I protested, early in our relationship she went out to the beach with her female and male friend and even went to the cinemas with this particular male friend one time: which I was totally ok with. Her response to that was that it didn't count because it was early on in our relationship and in her history she did this with previous boyfriends. I was very confused. The day of the argument, I ended up going to the beach alone and made up an excuse that I had car trouble to my other friends, I was miserable. For the first time questioned the sanctity of our relationship. I felt like I was being abit controlled and that this relationship was filled with double standards. Aside from this I haven't seen any other kind of similar behavior. 

A few days ago my friend and I planned another beach day and he ended up inviting another girl on the trip. I was really stressed about it that I didn't consider going, I was worried what my girlfriend would think. I was considering not even going. I ended up telling my girlfriend that my friend was interested in this other girl and she didn't seem to have an issue. At the beach I was a nervous wreck, I was even trying to avoid being in photos should anyone post them online and get my girlfriend annoyed. Yes this is how far I've come. I'm scared to have fun. 

What finally flipped my lid today was that I got a text from my girlfriend saying she was meeting with this other guy she posted the photo with for a catch up in New Zealand. Now normally I would be ok with this, but given my emotional state I'm quite upset that so bluntly she has decided to meet this person without thinking how I would feel about it. Yet I'm the one at home stressed about even being remotely around other women. It's just so unfair and careless of her and a double standard. It's just so damn frustrating that she didn't have the courtesy to explain the situation. Is this a double standard?

 I'm pretty sure she has some trust issues with me... Recently we were both drunk over New Years and she thought I was looking at another woman (I wasn't)... We had a little tiff over it but she apologised. I think she has some trust issues?? 

Currently her obsessions lie with holidays. Since I've been with her she's spent over 20k on going on holidays with me, and her family. I'm quite adventurous myself but only as deep as my pocket goes. She's also been insisting on going to Europe together in July and putting immense pressure on me for it. I'm trying very hard to save money but I just invested most of my savings into a car. She hasn't gotten herself a car so I do all the driving and the petrol is coming out of my wallet everytime. We've spoken about her getting a car and to her ""it's not a priority since they're expensive to maintain, and it's not a big deal since she has me and her family who are driving at the moment"" - later she apologized for this statement because she thought it sounded like she was using me. It's just fucking irritating that she thinks this way and I'm starting to grow tiresome of driving on our dates. She doesn't really ask me to pick her up from anywhere though. 

Anyway, as a full time uni student it's hard to get a full time job and I'm currently in the process of taking a lot of unpaid intern work in my field over the summer break. Her insistence is that I get a full time retail job to build character, which is a complete waste of time for me, since I'm trying to get as much experience in my field. When I told her this she said that she was worried I had an issue with earning money and that was distressing for her to hear but I insisted that the intern work was much more important now and she eventually apologized and said she was overreacting. 

Regardless, I'm finding myself having to squander dollars and stress over it. I've been canceling on friends just to put away $5. I simply can't afford this holiday right now and it pisses me off that she's put this impost on me while she holidays it up in New Zealand and I'm at home ripping my hair out trying to save a buck. 

Just one more thing that is quite frustrating. I'm a very stressful person, I have been diagnosed with PTSD from having gone through a serious bought of cancer in hospital for a few years. My girlfriend is very supportive, she comes to every appointment with me and wants me to be healthy. However, often she will send me very stressful texts at night involving money saving and holiday planning and other stuff that's quite stressful to me. Recently i was out with friends when she blatantly asked me if it was ""ok with me to hook up with another girl"", it lead me to freak out and become extremely uncomfortable... She wouldn't respond to my texts for quite some time and it ruined my evening. I had no idea where she was or what was happening. Later she texted me and apologised and said it was a hypothetical her cousin asked her while they were hanging out. I kindly asked her not to do it again and she didn't, however after a few weeks passed and she continued to send these stressful late night texts. It's like she just doesn't get it or forgets. 

I'm currently seeing a psychologist to work out my issues with stress but I must say that it's hard dealing with things when they're so in my face. She's also said she's planning on seeing a psychologist to deal with some emotional issues but it's been at least 6 months since she got her referal and hasn't made an attempt for it.

A few months ago I was questioning our relationship again. I was quite sad and felt like I had really lost myself. We had an argument and I said that lately it was abit hard to say ""I loved her"" I felt as though I had lost my way. She was devastated but we decided to work on things. But again I feel like no work is being done on the subject, and the last few weeks I've been getting stressed again. For the most part, I'm quite stressed. 

Aside from these issues, she really is a pretty great girl in most aspects. Aside from what I've stated I love her  a lot and I know she loves me. But there's just something off. I feel I should be feeling so stressed and high strung so much that I've lost most of my hair in the last year... I'm a trusting, understanding and caring dude. However,  I get really stressed about things like this and it's effecting aspects of my life, all I think about is the stressors in this relationship even when I'm far away from it. I'm making an effort to work on things, we're talking about it but I'm not seeing work being put in on the other side. Am I to blame in this? Am I overreacting or wrong? What advice can you give me? 

tl:dr I feel like my girlfriend can be selfish, absent minded, controlling and weird? I get really stressed.  Am I overreacting? "

1v9f0o,2,2014-01-15,Should I put more in savings or more into my student loans?,SlurmzMckinley,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1v9f0o/should_i_put_more_in_savings_or_more_into_my/,"I recently started a new job where I earn about $1900 a month after taxes and after health, vision and dental insurance are taken out. Since I was working a minimum wage internship before, I only have $300 in savings (I put in $60 a month) and about $200 in an IRA (I put in $20 a month and I would like to make that more soon). 

I want to know if it is smarter to get more in savings in case of an emergency, or max out my student loans. In order to pay off one student loan in 15 years, I pay $175/month. I'm also paying the Parent Plus loan my mom took out for me at $379/month, however that is only to pay it off in 10 years. I am only required to pay $209/month for that, but it would take me 25 years and a lot of interest. 

My other monthly expenses are $250 for rent, $66 for car insurance, $97 car payment, $150 groceries, $100 credit card (only required to pay $25 with about $700 left to pay, but I want to get rid of it because it's 11 percent interest and higher than my student loans or car), $60 gas and about $200 miscellaneous. All of that is about $1650, leaving me an extra $250, however it doesn't feel like I have that left over, and I may be forgetting something. 

Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks!

TL;DR: Should I put more in savings in case of an emergency if I only have $300 there, or should I maximize payments on student loans? How much would you say is an appropriate amount to have in savings if I make about $1,900 a month after taxes and health, vision and dental insurance?"
1va3xk,6,2014-01-15,I hate my job,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1va3xk/i_hate_my_job/,"Growing up, and even today, I felt like I always wanted to be like my dad and work in finance. By the time I reached high school I had taken an introduction to accounting class which I liked and decided that that was the direction I was going to take my studies in college. I ended up going to a school outside of Boston that was primarily for business and started off as an accounting major. 

It wasn't until my Junior year that I discovered Corporate MIS and ERP systems and made the switch to a very niche major for Information Systems Audit. I got an internship in my field of study for my Senior Spring and loved it because it was a small informal internal audit group. Once I graduated they offered me a full-time position, but it wasn't home. As much as I loved working there I really wanted to move back home. Around August I got a call from a company that I had applied to for an internship back in my Junior year of college asking if I was still looking or interested. They're based in NYC, much closer to home, they're a larger firm and although I'd be taking a very slight pay cut, I felt like this choice gave me more opportunities for advancing my career. 

Fast forward to today. I've been with the firm for close to 6 months now and I hate every day of my life. I got to move back home, but travel 75% of the time so I'm never really home. The work I do is so mundane and mindless that a monkey could do it and I wonder how I could have put the money spent on a degree to better use. In a sense I should feel good right? My peers are still looking for jobs or trying to finish their degrees and I'm sitting here on Reddit with a salaried position and benefits. Wrong. Yeah sure I make more money now than I did working part-time through high school and college, but at least then I was happy.

I know that transitioning from a care free college life to the start of your adult life is a big one, but there must be something I can do to make the next ~40 years of my career enjoyable. Maybe if I had taken a break between graduating and starting work I would have felt better about entering the working world instead of going from interning and school, to graduation day and right back to work the following Monday. 

I'm trying my best to keep my head up and push through a full year with this new company and job, but at the end of the day I need to find what works for me so that I never work a day in my life. Very cliche, but reflecting as I  write this I feel that it's a meaningful statement. Being young and not having a lot of things to tie me down I suppose I have the time to explore my career options, but maybe someone can help me to evaluate myself so that when I make the jump to my next position it's the right one."

1vaejb,4,2014-01-15,Wedding Documentary Ideas,TheDrLegend,wedding,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1vaejb/wedding_documentary_ideas/,"So our big day is approaching in 2 months and I've been kicking around the idea of doing a little ""non-traditional"" wedding video. I have years of experience with film-editing, writing, and directing during my internship at Warner Bros and I came up with a cool way of doing a wedding video that will be more to our style.

I wanted the video to open with us doing separate interviews, being asked questions (not filmed) in a documentary style setting while editing in clips of us prior to the wedding and then after (as if we're doing talking head interviews as the events transpire). I'll be filming these interviews twice (once before the wedding with us, our family, and members of the wedding party and then afterwards with just myself and my new wife).

The questions will not be asked on screen and I'm hoping they'll come out organically as everyone answers them so it doesn't feel like an interview but more like a movie.

I was wondering, from a viewers perspective, what kind of questions would you want to ask a bride and groom? Here are some of the default ones I was thinking of:

- Where/how did you meet?

- How did he/she propose?

- When did you know he/she was *the one*?

That's all I've got so for but I'm excited to hear what you guy think and would like to see. I'm open to any and all suggestions to let them rip!"

My ultimate hope is that if this legislation were to pass it would start a precedent for other states to follow since the federal courts are too incompetent to understand the need for NN. 

However, I do not wish to just pitch the idea to him without any sort of supporting arguments. I have my own but I would like to hear others. I am for NN. Key talking points would be great and I would like both sides of the argument. I am asking for your help because I am so swamped with actual legislative bills and helping out the senator that I just don't have the time I would like to have to focus on this issue. 


Thanks in advanced and I will re-post Friday night with the after meeting conclusions. 

[Edit]: I would like to start a petition through Change.org for the sole purpose of being able to show my senator how many people support this issue. If I did this would you be willing to sign it and pass it around? I realize the general ineffectiveness of online petitions but this would just be used as a ""selling point"" should it get enough ""signatures"". Also, I have been periodically checking during the day and the responses I have received are just what I was looking for. Thank you guys and gals so much. Keep it up!

1vak6z,1,2014-01-15,It's been 732 days and I'm still alive.,MissVaginaPerson,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1vak6z/its_been_732_days_and_im_still_alive/,"2 years and one day ago I was in a big hospital, full of painkillers and bleeding from one arm, sure that I would die. I was afraid and I was relieved and I was in pain.

Every one of the 732 days since has been at least a little difficult. Every day has had its struggles. Some days were worse than others, of course, and some days were great. There has not been one day since then that has not had at least a little moment of ""maybe I would have been better off"". Great things have happened, amazing things that have changed the way I feel about myself and my life and my future, but there's always that doubt, that I don't deserve the good things, that none of this can last. 

Old friend became my boyfriend and tells me he loves me and wants to marry me and start a family? He only thinks that because he hasn't seen the real me yet. He'll learn, and he'll leave me like everyone else.

Distinction in diploma (started one week after life changing break-up and move)? It was easy, anyone could have done it, means nothing.

Doing well at my internship and offered interview for sought-after sales job in multi-national company? Must have tricked them all, they'll find out soon and retract all praise/jobs/money. 

Everything I do well is some kind of trick and will end some day very soon.

But. But even on the absolute worst days, days when I was truly alone, after my ex-fiance left me and my ""best friend"" lied about me and all my other friends believed her, and I was drinking every night to dull the pain. On days when I worked 12 hours for no money or appreciation, when I did job interviews and they said no, when I had nobody and nothing and it seemed like this pain and emptiness would be my life forever.

Even on those days there has been a glimmer of hope, of strength. There has been a voice inside saying ""fuck that negative voice, look at you. You're still alive. Things are shit but you're still alive. You can do this.""

It has been a mixed bag. The last 2 years have absolutely been the hardest of my life. There have been very, very bad days, endless days filled with crying and wishing it would all be over. But that small voice that tells me I'm doing ok makes it all worth it. It's the buffer that stops me hitting the bottom. It's very small, but it's what keeps me out of that hospital bed."
1vapx6,0,2014-01-15,Career change - Is it worth it?,[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1vapx6/career_change_is_it_worth_it/,"I'm in a position where I may have the opportunity to take a new job within my current line of work (accounting/finance). The problem is I've spend the last year and a half studying for the actuary exams. I'm interested to hear your thoughts if it will be worth it to continue.

The new position: $55-60k starting, decent advancement opportunities. Drawback: I'll have to stay in my current area for at least 5 more years, and I'd like to move, and I won't have time to continue studying for the actuary exams.

My actuary progress: B.S. in mathematics with honors from a high-ranking university, 3.75 major GPA, 15 hours graduate coursework in math, passed exam P with a 9, ready to take FM soon. Drawbacks: no internship experience, no insurance etc background, and I'm already 26.

My plan was to take the next exam, start applying for jobs, and keep studying for the next exam. If the entry level job market is as competitive as I've heard it is, would it really be worth it to switch career paths? Could I expect a starting salary comparable to the other offer?

Would I be considered significantly more qualified with 3 passed exams and no internship?

1vbh92,9,2014-01-15,My SO [22F] is putting limits on me [M24] even though she doesn't care to have any.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1vbh92/my_so_22f_is_putting_limits_on_me_m24_even_though/,"I [M24] have been in a relationship with my SO [F22] for around a year and 5 months. For the most part things have been ok. There have been petty arguments over the course that have usually been resolved. We love each other - we plan to get married, we both think that we can be with nobody else. Most days I feel this way, but sometimes my mind goes to a very dark place. There are just some things that are hard to overlook and I feel stressed and miserable. 

For quite some time there has always been this lingering stress my SO has put on me in our relationship that just manages to stay around and some issues I can't seem to get over or end up adding on to other stressful events. 

I'm a very trustworthy person with her, but I can't say the same about her sometimes. A few months ago my best friend and I planned a day at the beach, he ended up inviting a mutual female friend of ours as well. I asked my girlfriend if it would make her uncomfortable and she said yes and would be disappointed if I ended up going. I was pretty upset about it. I felt like a child being told by his mother he couldn't have fun. We had a big argument about it, and she kept insisting it was wrong of me to go to beach with another girl around. Even though there where 3 of us. She kept saying I was acting like a spoilt brat. I protested, early in our relationship she went out to the beach with her female and male friend and even went to the cinemas with this particular male friend one time: which I was totally ok with. Her response to that was that it didn't count because it was early on in our relationship and in her history she did this with previous boyfriends. I was very confused. The day of the argument, I ended up going to the beach alone and made up an excuse that I had car trouble to my other friends, I was miserable. My girlfriend said I shouldn't have gone by myself but she wasn't exactly unhappy I did. 

For the first time questioned the sanctity of our relationship. I felt like I was being abit controlled and that she had jealousy issues. I felt as though she was willing to compromise my fun just so she could get her way, even though I love her, and am a very trustworthy person... And this other girl was just a friend.

We talked about it. I was quite upset. To be honest, I told her it was hard to tell her I loved her and care for her when I saw how she reacted to this event and was willing to not let me have fun to make herself more at ease. She was totally devastated but we managed to patch things up. Still she continued to Persaude the idea that it was an issue meeting up with other women at the beach regardless if my other friend was there or not. Also she persisted that I knew there was something wrong with going to the beach with another girl because I wouldn't have asked otherwise. It's a constant mind game sometimes. I can never seem to win an argument with her. She has an answer for everything.


Fast track to now

A few days ago my friend and I planned another beach day and he ended up inviting another girl on the trip. I was really stressed about it that I didn't consider going, I was worried what my girlfriend would think. I was considering not even going. I ended up telling my girlfriend that my friend was interested in this other girl and she didn't seem to have an issue. At the beach I was a nervous wreck, I was even trying to avoid being in photos should anyone post them online and get my girlfriend annoyed. Yes this is how far I've come. I'm scared to have fun. 

Currently my SO has gone on a contiki to New Zealand with her female cousins. I'm totally happy for her. I'm glad she's having fun. I'm quite supportive of what she does. However, what flipped my lid today was that I got a text from my girlfriend saying she was meeting with a male buddy of hers who happened to also be on a separate contiki. Now normally I would be ok with this, but given my emotional state I'm quite upset that so bluntly she has decided to meet this person without thinking how I would feel about it. Or even consider asking if it would make me uncomfortable. I'm the one at home stressed about even being remotely around other women. It's just so unfair and careless of her and quite abit weird that I've had limits out on me without me putting any on her - and I don't ever plan too. She seems to think she can do whatever she wants while I'm at home, fearing the worst. I feel controlled and abit of a doormat.

It's just so damn frustrating. I'm pretty sure she has some trust issues with me... Recently we were both drunk over New Years and she thought I was looking at another woman (I wasn't)... We had a little tiff over it but she apologised. I think she has some trust issues?? 

She has also mentioned that it would make her uncomfortable if I was to have lunch with particular female friends. 

Can anyone give me advice? Am I overreacting or is this a double standard. How can I approach this. Aside from these little instances there have been a few issues but this I feel is a major one. For the most part we respect each other... But I feel that in this regard she doesn't. And I'm getting quite sick of her behavior and carelessness. My girlfriend is quite absent minded sometimes and a little immature. 

Tl;dr my girlfriend is setting limits on me but doesn't have any on her 


Edit 1: Thank you all so much for your comments. It's really helping me get a clear head and cheering me up to know I'm not the one at fault here. I have an intern meeting to get to so I'll be dormant for a few hours. The advice means so much to me. Thanks "

One more semester, that starts in a few days, and three classes, and I get an associates degree. I honestly thought I had around four or five more semesters because of finances, taking care of my incredibly sick mother, and just being depressed over all.  

Just the other day, after considering my options for my future, I decided to change what I wanted to major in after I left my community college. For the past 4 years I was determined I was going to go into Architecture. I even got an internship for a few months! But... I was losing my passion for going into that field, so I made the decision to change. Just a few days ago.

I'm now going for a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, with a minor in computer science at my next university. After that, I plan on going to a different university for my master's degree in Library Science so I can be a librarian, hopefully in a university. After, that... well... a master's or a ph.d in Psychology sounds really fun. 

I'm just so ecstatic! I'm feeling so alive after these past few months. I feel like I can, and will, do anything. Everybody seems to support me, I think I can get access to several scholarships, and I don't feel like the failure everyone was starting to think I was. I'll be one of the first in my family going into college. My mom gave up, my dad quit with one semester left, and my grandma never even graduated highschool. I'm so blessed to have a family like the one I have though. They've been nothing but supportive of my goals so far. Even when I said I wanted to be a librarian."

When the hurricane strikes, all the power goes out and everyone in the hospital leaves. But the baby's father stays because the baby can't be moved so he has to take care of his baby by making sure the ventilator stays on. And because there's no power, the only power source is generator that he has to crank every few minutes. So he has to stay awake while waiting for someone to come for them.

So this year of High School, I wanted to start interning for programming at a company nearby(not sure which yet). I was thinking that when I call/go to speak about an internship they might need to see some proof that I am good. So I am asking you guys what are some presentable projects that I can make for them that might make me look good. Also I have made 2 things that I thought might be presentable so you tell me.

1vc1w9,16,2014-01-15,Boyfriend fried my expensive computer... should I make him pay for it?,kravity13,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1vc1w9/boyfriend_fried_my_expensive_computer_should_i/,"I'll try to keep this relatively concise, but wall of text warning:

Before Thanksgiving my boyfriend spilled a vodka tonic on the keyboard of my macbook air. This computer is my baby, because I worked really hard to save up money and pay for it myself in college. I tried to remain calm, immediately turn it off, turn it upside down with a fan on it, etc so as to minimize damage. Next day, turn it on, and everything seems to be working fine, except that the keyboard is totally fried :( 

The computer, being two years old, is no longer under warranty, not that Apple provides any coverage for water damage anyway. Boyfriend initially feels really bad about it and says he'll pay for the damages, I say ok, even though it was truly an accident, because I thought it would maybe just be a couple hundred dollars.

I was very wrong. When I finally got around to finding an available apple appointment (boyfriend made no effort to do this, and actually rolled his eyes and sighed when I asked him to come with me) the genius bar woman said water damage- if it's fixable at all- is usually around $750, if not more! I was devastated- that is a significant amount of the original price of the computer. 

Then, I felt guilty making Boyfriend pay such a steep fee- he's currently working an unpaid internship, and is supported fully by his parents. I said we would try to find another way, go to a non-Apple repair shop, etc. Meanwhile, I was taking my work computer home for recreational use, which I also felt really guilty about. 

A few more weeks of arguing about juggling schedules, trying to make new appointments (all of my effort, none of his), I kind of give up for the time being until after the holidays, when we would re-evaluate. 

Now, I've finally gotten around to getting to a couple of other apple-repair shops, and they've all told me the same thing: water damage repair on a macbook air will run ~$7-800, if not more, and even then the damage has likely seeped into the rest of the computer, and it will deteriorate within months. I'm devastated. The repair people told me it is more cost-efficient to just buy a new computer.

It's been over 2 months since my boyfriend spilled liquid on my computer, rendering it useless, and he's assumed practically no responsibility. While in the beginning he was really apologetic, now he's changed his story saying he'll ""help"" pay for the damages.

I'm really annoyed, because I know that if it were the other way around, I would be doing everything in my power to fix the thing that I damaged. I would be making the appointments for him and assuming all responsibility. I really don't feel like he understands the gravity of the situation and how devastated I am by this financial loss, as he's never had to pay for a computer, car, or even rent on his own! While I initially felt bad making him pay for an accident, guilty even, this entire situation has made me really upset and now I feel like he needs to take full responsibility after months of being complacent. 

TwoX, what should I do? 

tl;dr BF fried my computer, isn't really assuming responsibility. Should I make him pay for the damages/a new computer?"
1vc2fr,19,2014-01-15,A traveler's tale (25/ M/ South Africa/ Canada/ Australia),Mister_Scorpion,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1vc2fr/a_travelers_tale_25_m_south_africa_canada/,"I am born. The youngest of 3 children, and the only boy. I live in South Africa for the first 5 years of my life, where I am taken care of by a black maid. She is a 2nd mother to me. Violence escalates, my parents decide we need to get out of there.

We move to Canada. It is cold, but I like it there. My parents don't. I start my schooling in Kindergarten, and am pulled out in grade 3 when my parents decide the cold is too much for them. I have a lot of friends, and even a 'girlfriend,' who I still talk to to this day. I love skiing, tobogganing and baseball. I am sad to leave.

We move to Australia. I find it hard to settle in. I have less friends, my confidence starts to go down. I move primary schools, and make a few friends in my new school. I am not the happy kid I used to be though. 

I get to high school and am bullied relentlessly. People call me 'babyface' and make fun of my Canadian accent. My confidence takes a huge hit. I withdraw from everyone. I have only 2 or 3 friends, the other outcasts of the school, and rarely see them outside of school. This is the story of the entirety of my high school years, I am a sensitive guy and emerge a cowering shell of my former self. I don't know who I am, I don't have any confidence.

My parents pressure me to go to university. Not knowing alot about myself, I choose commerce on a whim. I hate it. I make no friends during this time, drink heavily, and pull out after one semester. I get a job full time at a grocery store.

I meet some cool people where I work and slowly start to build confidence. I build enough to decide to reapply for university the following year, studying Science.

I like this degree more. I feel more myself while studying it, and make a couple of friends. I start hanging out a lot more with my best friend from high school, and we realise how similar we are. He is still my best friend to this day. I gain more confidence, slowly, but I'm still riddled with some social anxiety. A remnant of the bullying.

My best friend asks me to go travelling with him. We explore 5 countries of Europe together. I love it. I have finally found something I am truly passionate about. 

I travel with my sister to the US the summer after that, doing a road trip through 11 states. My love of travel is strengthened. It gives me confidence and independence. I decide the next step is going solo.

After graduating I land a 3 month internship at the largest Oil and Gas services company in the world. If I perform well it will lead to a 6 figure salary. I don't love the job but I do perform well, and am offered a position. I tell the boss I'd like to travel before starting full time work, he allows me 6 months. I take a month off to plan. I have plenty of free time, so I create /r/lifeinapost. I am fascinated by other's stories. Also during this time I meet a girl at a party, the first girl that has really shown any interest in me. We go on a few dates. I'm not sure that she likes me, we don't kiss at all before I leave. I have some feelings for her, but they weren't as strong as I thought they should be after a few dates. I push that nagging feeling down and ignore it because I think she's a wonderful person. But deep down I am unsure. My confidence in myself is growing though. 

I get to Europe, solo. I meet a Canadian girl on a walking tour in London. She is pretty and extremely smart. We go on a pub crawl that night, and end up kissing. She asks to hang out again in London, we do, and we have the most amazing time. Lying in a park listening to music, holding hands, kissing...this is how I thought things should feel. I fly out to Italy and we part ways. We talk to each other every day throughout our trip, writing each other multiple pages daily. Things are just easy with her. She is so smart. I start to fall for her. She asks me to meet up with her before flying back to Australia. I decide I will. Before meeting up with her however, I get another job offer. It's my dream job, working for the weather bureau here in Australia as a Meteorologist, one I had been aiming for for many years. They need me back in Australia ASAP for a medical. I fly back.

We continue talking this whole time. Things just work. When she gets back to Canada, we start to Skype regularly. I feel uncomfortable skyping, I never really feel myself. It puts a strain on things. On the rare occasions I do feel comfortable, things work well. It is August 2013 and my new job doesn't start until January 2014, so she comes up with the idea of travelling together before it starts. We agree on South America over her winter break. She wants me to fly to Vancouver first to meet up with her, I agree. To save for the trip, I get in contact with my old job, tell them I have an offer for another job I am likely to take, but ask if they'd want me around to help them for the next few months. They welcome me back with open arms. I am miserable working this job but I use seeing the Canadian girl as a motivation.

So the months pass, we continue talking regularly. I don't have the balls to tell the Australian girl I met someone else on my trip, so I let things fade. We stop talking. She eventually gets in contact a few weeks before I leave and I tell her about the Canadian girl. The Australian girl starts crying, and tells me that if anything happens with me and the Canadian girl then there is obviously no chance of anything happening between us. All my feelings for her are gone, so I agree. I told her not to wait around for me, things were likely to happen. I wasn't man enough to tell her I didn't have any feelings for her any more. 

A week before I am due to leave to Canada, the Canadian girl starts acting a little strangely. I only hear from her once during that week. I grow a little worried, but tell myself it's nothing, she's just stressed out because of exams. Eventually the time comes. I get to Vancouver, jetlagged as hell after flying for 30 hours. She is at the airport to meet me. We don't talk much, but I don't mind. I am tired. It is nice to see her. She shows me to my hostel and we part ways. We make plans for the next day.

I wake up feeling myself again. I am so excited for me and the Canadian girl getting a chance in person to make things work. I meet with her inside a pizza store. The first words she says to me are 'So, I should probably tell you, I'm not coming to South America any more'. The words tear through me like a knife. I don't understand. She says things didn't feel right at the airport. I don't understand. I am heartbroken, for the first time in my life. I react pathetically. I can't breathe. I don't understand.

For days after I am more depressed than I've ever been. I stay in bed in Vancouver. I don't think I will go to South America alone. The Canadian girl refuses to talk about things again in person. She eventually agrees to a phone call. My phone runs out of credit half way through, and she tells me not to contact her again. I am distraught. November 30th. The last time we spoke.

I slowly pick myself up. I decide I need to still go on this trip. If I don't, I'll regret it. I go solo to South America, something I never thought I would have the courage to do. [I meet amazing people](http://imgur.com/VQQsf1r), [I climb a mountain](http://imgur.com/pBDuc94), [I go to Machu Picchu](http://imgur.com/ODNi5px). I still think about her during this time but I am getting over it. I gain newfound self confidence and strength. I am so proud of myself for still going and having a great time. 

And now I return to Australia. I still have some bad days, but I know now that I am better equipped to face any challenge that awaits me in the future. I move across the country in a few days for my new job, I am so excited for the future."
1vc6l5,1,2014-01-15,So we're pregnant- now what?,synetria,pregnant,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1vc6l5/so_were_pregnant_now_what/,"Hi, everyone.

So I found out the other day I was pregnant through a HPT and needless to say I'm both excited and scared straight about the whole thing. I've always wanted a kid so I'm happy to be blessed with the opportunity, but, unfortunately, I'm kind of in situation that makes the good news a little bad.

I explained to my mother (I'm 21, for those who were curious, the father and I lived together for a year before going long distance again to finish school, and we've been visiting each other off and on while he's doing an internship before moving back in together) the situation and we've both mutually agreed that it goes against our morals to... ""get rid of it"". But our health insurance doesn't cover pregnancy, and I'm not currently employed with an employer who offers health insurance (and at that point it would be a pre-existing condition)

So I guess my question is: is there a way to get financial assistance or insurance for pregnancy? According to her the visits are very expensive and I have been trying to research different ways to get assistance. WIC is already one, I know, but I'm not 100% sure where to start about medical visits.

Any advice and/or knowledge would be greatly appreciated. I would do my checkup sometime in the near future.

P.S: Any ways to alleviate the light-headedness? It's not a frequent thing, but it does come and go. I read that it was common because your body is changing in preparation for two but I haven't figured out how to calm it down yet.

1vcccd,13,2014-01-16,I've felt more persecution and more loneliness as a non-believer than as a believer--love is sparse on this side of the road,[deleted],exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1vcccd/ive_felt_more_persecution_and_more_loneliness_as/,"Today was a good day because my internship employer said that they would pay me after all; it was a terrible day because I got the first email from a family member telling me that I'm choosing the wrong path. My sister and I really close. It hurts me every day to know that I will be the one in the ""wrong""; sometime it hurts so bad that I cry. Sometimes it hurts so bad that I question whether it makes sense to continue to exist.

My mom told me today that it was a good thing I'm interning for my company in SLC because I can show them a good example of being Mormon. I can never tell her--I think it would break my heart, and I know my dad would punish me somehow.

For what it's worth, this is the letter I sent to my sisters and their husbands. They're the only ones (besides my husband) who know my secret.

Dear Family,

I’ve had many doubts throughout my life, but I have always faced them with faith: when I wasn’t sure about my faith in Christ, I read the New Testament; when I wasn’t sure about the Book of Mormon, I read and prayed about it; when I wasn’t sure about Joseph Smith, I prayed about him.

I sought typical Church solutions for Church problems.

Then one day, I was doing some research about Abraham for an article I was writing for the Liahona. I read on Wikipedia that the translation for the Book of Abraham isn’t actually literal—that the papyri Joseph Smith translated had been translated by Egyptologists and found to be typical funeral scripts taken from the Book of the Dead. I had never heard this before, either from leaders or from friends or family members. I read Mormon apologist explanations for the differences between the translations. Most apologists feel that Joseph translated the papyri in the same way that he translated the Bible—he didn’t translate from Egyptian to English; he acted as a mouthpiece for revelation from God, inspired by the papyri. Another explanation is that the papyri printed in the scriptures are not the ones that Joseph actually translated and that the originals were lost. I’ve always liked the Pearl of Great Price, so I decided I needed to have faith that the apologists’ explanations were right—and that I would never know in this life what actually brought about those revelations.

At the same time, however, I wondered what else I had never been taught. I thought that this was a good time to open the door, believing that what I would learn who be along silly evangelical lines of thinking like “teaching that grace without works is dead is abominable!” or “Joseph Smith communed with the devil!”

What I really found—courtesy of mormonthink.org and backed by reputable sources such as Rough Stone Rolling, many LDS and non-LDS scholars, and well-researched interviewees on mormonstories.org—was that the Church’s history is filled with a lot of these stumbling stones: the Kinderhook Plates, Joseph’s practice of polyandry, anachronisms in the Book of Mormon, Joseph’s interesting story telling and treasure hunting past, and more. I tried to take these issues one by one and resolve them through faith. But it got to the point that it was one issue after another, and my heart was telling me to stop fighting and to accept the most logical explanation: that Joseph Smith—despite the fact that he taught important truths and formed a Church that has unquestionably brought for amazing individuals—originally sought out to deceive the people around him.

It was a new thought that I struggled with. I wanted so desperately for the Church to be true; I thought that I would have to end my life if that wasn’t the case. Luckily, I found a large community of Mormons having the same issues as me through places like Mormon Stories. Many of these people are active, believing Mormons; some are active but find problems in Church history; and some are inactive or have resigned from the Church.

Another stumbling block for me was that the Church hasn’t been forthcoming about its past until now, when Internet access makes the discovery of past issues inevitable. And there were people who seemed to condemn people like me for searching for answers: “There is no explanation”; “You just need to have faith”; “Pray and read the scriptures more”; “We just don’t know.” And some I talked to were convinced that I had made something up or gotten my research from an anti-Mormon source—that the devil was in the details.

Which is exactly why I felt compelled to question, because I felt that the devil was in the details; that what I had been taught did not line up with what had occurred during the founding of the Church. For example, why was Joseph Smith marrying married women when the Doctrine and Covenants explicitly forbids this? Why did he lie to the Church about practicing polygamy, to the point that it was a factor that led to his death? Why did he tell women that an angel with a sword would slay him if they didn’t marry him—despite the teaching of free agency in the Book of Mormon? 

Did that mean that I needed to accept that Joseph’s practice of polyandry was right because he was a prophet? Did I have to accept that lying is fine if it staves off backlash? Was it true that an angel would slay Joseph if a woman didn’t marry him, whether or not she wanted to?

I struggled with this for a long time, running through the reasoning in my head, trying to leave it alone. But I couldn’t. I only found peace when I considered this: Joseph Smith is not the person that I was taught he is. He was not instructed by God to practice polyandry. He coerced women to marry him. The anachronisms in the Book of Mormon are due to its author having a big imagination but a flawed knowledge of history. Joseph didn’t detect the fraud of the Kinderhook Plates because he wasn’t a prophet. And he mistranslated the Book of Abraham because Egyptian wasn’t well understood at the time, so he could translate it without anyone finding fault.

The peace wasn’t immediate, but it came. Of course I still feel anger, because I feel betrayed. And of course I feel sadness—being Mormon was my life; I didn’t know how to live life without my religion. I was essentially relegating myself to social extinction since most of my connections are formed through Church. I didn’t know who I was without it. But the peace gradually came, and now I’m okay not knowing everything.  I’m okay not believing that the Church is the one true church. I feel great that I don’t have to believe that one man’s actions are justified even though they contradict the very doctrines he teaches.

For now, I consider myself agnostic, because I’m not really sure what I believe, and I’m okay living a virtuous life without religion. To me, agnostic means that I’m open to the idea of God’s existence, but I’m in the process of finding that out—all over again. After all, we are often taught that if Joseph Smith is a prophet, the Church is true, the Book of Mormon is true, etc. So now that I do not believe Joseph Smith is a prophet, I need to figure out what I do believe—what is still true after everything else comes tumbling down.

I know you will probably recall the words of the scriptures that say that good will be called evil and evil will be called good; that even the very elect will be deceived. I know you will want to let me borrow your testimonies; that you’ll want to testify to me and reassure me that the Church is true. I understand that; but please try to walk in my shoes—and you can’t truly do this unless you’ve considered all of the historical facts I’ve considered and successfully overcome your doubt. Or, like me, allowed the doubt to lead you down a different path.

I’m still the same person you love. I’m not going to indoctrinate your kids and scoff at Jesus. I still believe in the basic principles of the Gospel and am grateful for all that the Church has taught me. Johnathan is a very strong, believing member of the Church, so our children will probably be raised in the Church, and I’m fine with that. I believe our leaders are good people and want the best for us. I believe that most members of the Church are good people.

But doubt has taught me important lessons about not being quick to judge others or condemn them for thinking differently. I’m comfortable with my beliefs (or lack of belief)—although I may not be comfortable with talking to other members about it. And I’m very uncomfortable wondering how my family members will react and whether I’ll be deemed the “black sheep” of the family—even though my only crime was to ask questions.

So please give me a chance and don’t condemn me or call me to repentance. I know my letter will make you sad, but I hope you will also know that I’m feeling good in my own skin for the first time in a long time.

Love, PoptartEve

My secret is that I still want to be a practicing Mormon because I don't want to endure this persecution, and I want to please my family. But I can't be because it doesn't feel right.

1vceiq,8,2014-01-16,Really... In the entire city?,dataVizGeek,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1vceiq/really_in_the_entire_city/,"There’s a very slim chance that I may intern in Boston this summer.

But since I felt like procrastinating, I decided to see what the potential was on okc. You know, just for yuks.

And who comes up as my top match, in all of Boston, but one of my best friends from high school. Thing is, she doesn’t know that I’m gay (as far as I’m aware since I’ve given her no concrete evidence), and I didn’t definitively know she is bi. It crossed my mind during our last conversation, but I didn’t think too much of it.

That said, while we’ve only talked once a year or so for the past few years, we’ve managed to maintain a decent friendship. We even vaguely talked about relationships for a bit last time, but obviously didn’t get too detailed. 

But now that I know, I kind of want to talk to her about it. Well, not “it” per se, but it’d be nice to be able to talk to her about romantic-oriented things since I only have a few LGBT friends. I talk to my straight friends about these things as well, but it isn’t always the same.

I think she’d be open to talking about it if I brought it up since we have talked about the subject before, but I’m not sure how to broach it. I don’t know if it’d be best to text/fb message her or if it’d be funny to send her some sort of “icebreaker” type of message on okc. I feel like both options have the potential to go well or poorly.

To say that I was astounded when she came up as my top result would be an understatement. At the very least, I thought that you all would enjoy hearing the story."
1vd3qf,20,2014-01-16,"College Student, will be doing my taxes for the first time.",romantic_boy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1vd3qf/college_student_will_be_doing_my_taxes_for_the/,"I am good at math and I took a class on this in high school, so I only need a few tips to make sure I will do it correctly. I saw many recommend TaxACT website and it seems very user friendly so I will go with that when I get all W-2 back.

About my taxes:

1. I made less than $8,000, before taxes taken out, last year from an internship which seems like I am in the lowest bracket of the taxes. (I also selected the highest take out of taxes from my paycheck so I expect to get a lot back).
2. I paid for school by myself with help from financial aid (FAFSA) and I just received an email from school stating a deductible of around $13,000. I have my insurance through school too, so I'm guessing that was included in it too? Will I have to do itemizing and include that there? Because I made less than I paid for school because of loans etc. 
3. Will I have to include the interest that accumulated on loans? 

I am not sure if TaxACT has all that explained in there that is why I am asking, my mom told me she can take me to her accountant to do it but I want to do this by myself so I know how taxes work and I am not dependent on someone in the future.

What sites or Facebook groups? Where should I first be looking? 

This is what I know so far : I can rent from an old guy called Vligenhart who has lots of places available but are really bad.
There are these two internet sites : Havenstader and Kamernet.

But I was hoping for a facebook group or a university site where maybe students who are on erasmus or on internships might be subletting their rooms. 

Help would be so much appreciated. I'm a friendly 25 year old guy. 

Thank you!"
1vdef4,1,2014-01-16,Drinking away the pain,[deleted],drunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/1vdef4/drinking_away_the_pain/,"Hey there, r/drunk, just writing in to say that I needed today. My life has been a little too up and down lately, so I took today to hit the reset button and get real drunk. 

In the summer of 2011, my little sister attempted to commit suicide. She was 15 at the time, and the only one of my parents three children still living at home. After my parents went to sleep, she took an entire bottle of tylenol and prepared to wait out the sickness that would follow until she was gone. The only thing that saved her was the text she sent to my other sister to tell her goodbye. (To keep my sisters separated, we'll call my youngest sister who attempted to commit suicide Jill, and my other sister Kate). Jill had expected that Kate would be asleep and not see her text until it was too late, but Kate's phone beeped when she got the text and it woke her up. Kate called my parents, who had to call an ambulence to get Jill to the hospital.

At the time that happened, I was working at a restaurant in the town I went to college in, waiting to hear back from graduate schools. I drove home as soon as my parents called me, and we all spent about a week together, talking through what happened, why, and what our next steps should be. Jill had to spend three days in a locked facility within the hospital because she was a minor on suicide watch, and we really thought that the seriousness of the situation had sunk in with her. Jill and my parents spent the next two years seeing multiple psychologists, and attempting to complete several different thearpeutic programs. Jill became hositle at school, and usually refused to go all together. I know that she had trouble with a group of girls there who made her life hell. But, there was very little I could do other than talk to her when she wanted to talk. And most of the time, she doesn't want to talk to me. 

Eventually, I heard back from the grad schools I applied to. I got into a school that was close to home and got a full ride scholarship to attend. But, I also got into a school across the country that is ranked very highly in my discipline. While they didn't offer a full ride, they did offer enough money to make the decision between the two very difficult. Initially, I chose the school close to home. A full ride is hard to turn down, and I believed that if I was living in the same city as Jill, I could do something to help her. My parents didn't believe that was the case, and along with my girlfriend, they eventually convinced me to go to the more highly ranked school. 

I began school in the fall of 2012 and after a few months, I came to dislike it greatly. My grades at the end of my first year were not stellar, and while I was able to find a summer internship at the last minute, things at home took a turn for the worse. In May of 2013, Jill attempted suicide for the second time. I blamed myself to a large extent because I could have been at home, helping her, but I had instead chosen to travel across the country to go to some school that I really didn't even like. I decided to travle home for the summer to help take care of her.

Jill spent the summer going to the hospital for therapy every Monday-Friday from 8:00-3:00. I drove her to the hospital and picked her up in the afternoons. We spent a lot of time trying to complete summer school classes online, but of the 10 or so classes she needed to make up, we only finished two. 

Things seemed slightly better at the end of the summer, but as soon as school stared, Jill's troubles resumed. My parents were able to get her out of her current high school and into an alternative school where she seems to be doing alright. On top of that, I had a great semester in terms of grades, while I still don't enjoy most of my classmates or the program in general, the information is fun and the work I've started doing is exactly what I had hoped it would be. I also won a few competitions that the school puts on in the first semester. 

Over winter break, I had the opportunity to travel back home to see my immediate and extended family. This time is the most important thing in the world to me, especially now that Jill is starting to get her life back on track. It all seems so fragile; I don't know what I would do if it started to fall apart again. My parents have had such a hard time with the entire situation. They've spent an exorbitant amount of money on Jill's treatment (which I know they're more than willing to do), but what really gets to them is that they feel like failures as parents. They feel like there isn't anything they can do to help her, and that makes them feel powerless, which has been incredibly stressful. 

The time I spent with them was wonderful overall, but it still felt like we were walking on eggshells and that at any minute, things could fall apart. All of this left me feeling very uneasy.

At the beginning of this semester, I dropped the ball on a competition team assignment that we were supposed to finish over break. I was kicked off the team and tomorrow I have to meet with the dean of the school. I'm not sure what she'll say about the entire thing, but I'm nervous as hell."
1vdqg2,4,2014-01-16,"Do I take the web design job if it is offered, or do I go back to school? (xpost from r/jobs)",[deleted],web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1vdqg2/do_i_take_the_web_design_job_if_it_is_offered_or/,"**About Me**

I'm a 23 year old front end developer (HTML, CSS, graphic design, some javascript and PHP knowledge, and strong knowledge of CMS and drupal).  For the past 5 years, i've been back and forth between school and jobs. I've worked for 4 companies in the past.  The first was a design internship, the next the company fell off the face of the earth, the next company went out of business (Startup), and the last one I worked for hired me but then let me go in 3 months saying that I ""Didn't fit into the culture"" - But really before I left, that ""culture"" was an issue and they were holding meetings where employees were EXTREMELY unhappy in the direction they were going.  There was a lot of unrest, and my position is still posted on their site as vacant.

Because of this, I fear for my own job security. I took 6 months off living at home with my parents again, and sorted my life out.  I did freelance work to pay the bills, and have had a very satisfied and constant freelance client for the past 3 months and I see it being an ongoing thing. I also started web development classes tuesday.  I do not have any degree currently, though I've taken courses in my downtime.  The problem I have with web classes at school is that they always seem to be at least 6 months to a year behind, and although I'd have an associates degree, I wouldn't have the most modern knowledge to back it up. I've learned more from r/web_design than I have ever learned in a classroom.

**New job**

I had an interview with a company last week who REALLY liked me and my work. They told me that I have the skills they're looking for, and that I'd fit into the culture perfectly.  I liked their company and the people I talked to, so I said my desired salary would be $55k, which I admit is a fairly high salary, but the fact is that I figured that if I didn't get paid well then I would just go back to school and learn more to make myself more marketable.

They told me that the budget was between 40 and 45k for the job, but I think it was just a negotiation tactic honestly.   And besides that, that really does seem to be a fair introductory pay scale for my career.  I know it's definitely enough to live off of comfortably, at least until I get a few years of solid experience.  The web team is also small now, and they asked if I would be interested in management in time, so that's always a strong possibility for career growth also.

If I complete school and got a web development degree (Back end) I can possibly make up to 70-80k a year, but it's for much challenging and more stressful work (Which I know I can handle), and not necessarily they TYPE of work I'd like. For those of you not in the web field, this is as if I'm getting offered a job as a waiter, but going to school to be a cook, if that analogy makes any sense.

They just emailed me and they want to have a second interview tomorrow, which I accepted.

I'm just worried about job security, and don't want to put my life on hold for another 6 months.  How would I go about asking them how secure the position is without sounding unreliable, and do you think I should even take the job?  If I go to school, I'd be living at home with my parents until at least summer of 2015 (They said if the job doesn't work out I can live there to go back to school, but I don't want that, as I'd be at home so much longer), but if I take the job I'd have my foot in the door of a company that I feel I can really do a lot with.

**tl;dr**  

I just started going back to school for an associates degree in web development, but expect to get offered a job in my field (web design) soon.  Should I take it?

EDIT: I got offered the job, took it, and I start this week. thanks everyone!!!"
1vdrs6,4,2014-01-16,I think my N-mother wants me to continue my father's (enabler) work (is this a trap?),idonteven0,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1vdrs6/i_think_my_nmother_wants_me_to_continue_my/,"I just had a phone call from her. To be honest, I didn't want to talk with her. But I gave in to my anxiety. I felt so bad for not answering, so I just had to. We are on LC. Last time when we talked, I told about my recent break-up with my girlfriend. Her reaction to it left me me in pretty much immediate regret of sharing that with her. At that night, I started to doubt that she could really be N. She has shown some serious signs during the years, and after much introspection I would be more surprised that she wouldn't be a one. 

Me, Andrew (not a real name) = A, possible N-mom

A: ""Hi. I saw you tried to call me.""

M: ""Hi Andrew. I wanted to call and ask that how's going?""

A: ""Pretty much OK, actually. I think I'm getting over that girlfriend-thing. It has not really crossed my mind much.""

M: ""Good to hear! How's your internship been going?""

A: ""Pretty fine actually, lots of work and learnt much of new things.""

A: ""But how are you?""

M: ""It's going well. By the way, your father has bought new equipment for his work. He says you can borrow it if you want to.""

A: ""M-mmh?""

M: ""He bought is from Denmark. It's real state-of-art equipment in his field.""

M: ""It's very lightweight as well. And easier to set-up that the earlier.""

A: ""It's made of some light material, like aluminium?"" (I just tried to keep conversation on, to buy time to think what is this that she is trying)

M: ""I think you should ask that about from your father.""

A: ""Right.""

* Long silence *

M: ""But hey, I need to go now. I just called to ask how's it going. Bye!""

A: ""Bye.""

Last time when we talked, she proposed that I would come to visit them. I didn't really feel like it, but didn't say yay or nay about it. 

This time, she didn't even propose it.

My father's job interests me, in a way. There is possibility of earning real goldmine-amount of cash. He's annual salary is around 100.000 $. Reason why only few people do that job he has, is because it demands huge financial investment to get started. Also, the training takes a damn long time. It takes years to just start to call yourself even a beginner in this work. If I would choose to continue this, it is possible that I could inherit all his equipment, get a mentor (my father) who is really respected on his field (without a cost), and even get paid by working.  

It's like they are holding a golden plate with fucking diamonds in front of me. I feel so spoiled. I feel ungrateful. I have this possibility in front of me, and yet I don't find this proposition appealing. By continuing my father's work would mean not making my own destiny, but to follow a tradition that I don't believe in. I don't know what I should do about it. It seems like if I choose one over the another, I'm going to regret my choice in some point of life. What if I end up poor as I am now? What if I regret? 

I have done this work under the watch of my father for half-a-year during my life. Last time was at the last summer. I was really counting days for summer to be over, and getting away from my childhood home. Last time when I closed that door, I promised myself that maybe this time, maybe this time could be the last time time I close that door. My father is pretty decent guy, but a strict man. My mother on the other hand, makes me feel like I want to just get out from there. I just wonder - would it be worth it? 

Part of me feels they propose this because they want to have me in their watch. I have trouble thinking is this genuine good-will, or some kind of trap I don't want to fall in. Because inside of me I know, that I don't want to live there. None of my old friends even live in that city, or even near of it anymore. I couldn't even go anywhere, if it would end up as being a bad idea. It would mean AT LEAST three years of solitude, loneliness, and constant contact with my mother. I really wonder is it worth of the money involved. I feel bad concience for not following their will, even though I rationally understand that I don't really have to have that responsibility."

I speak fluent Spanish and have had a long time interest in living in Florida or South Carolina.

Grades came out today and after much anxiety I was pleasantly surprised to receive a 4.0. 

Our version of legal writing lasts the full year. After 50% of total points I am #2 in that class.

I am now posed with several questions as to my next step:

1. What are jobs prospects for top students at regional law schools like my own? (I will most likely be on law review and continue top class performance)

2. What kind of schools should I consider applying for transfer to? With a 4.0 at a small school like this what should be realistic goals be for transfer?

3. What are the best type of job internships to start with this summer to increase my marketability? Should I just take the most prestigious job with biggest firm in town or should I look at my specific interest (injury, divorce, etc...) and find a job which specializes in that?

- Any other advice for moving forward would be GREATLY appreciated.

My maternal grandmother lives with my parents and pays a pretty low rent, especially for the area they live in. 

They, especially my dad, keep asking her for more money, keep trying to refinance their house to cut down their loan rate, etc., etc. My paternal grandmother is described as ""stingy"" by my father even though I have never known her to be so; every Christmas and Easter, she sends my brother and I a moderate amount of money and a nice card or flowers, and does the same for my parents. 

Now, my paternal grandfather was wealthy and is now under the care of an in-home hospice nurse because he's a late-stage Alzheimer's patient. My paternal grandmother plans to donate all the money her husband made as a very successful land developer to medical research, i.e. start a scientific grant, give some to the Alzheimer's Foundation, etc. My parents were furious over this when the news came out, even though both make around 100K/year, because it was ""inheritance"". 

All four of my grandparents fought their way up in the world. My maternal grandfather was the incredibly dyslexic son of a dirt-poor Nebraskan railroad engineer who had to sleep on a board shelf because all his older brothers slept in the one bed my great-grandparents could afford for their kids (I heard this story first-hand from him) but ended up pretty high up in the 1970s federal government before his retirement, and my maternal grandmother is a farmer's daughter who went to teaching college at 14. My paternal grandparents are first-generation European immigrants who started a development business out of essentially nothing and also ran a chain of steakhouses. My parents, on the other hand, as I said, generally had everything handed to them. My dad has a history of doing crazy shit (e.g. toppling a dresser onto her, throwing plates and tiles across the room, using a blow torch and a hammer on his cell phone because she called him one time too many) if my mom does anything he doesn't like though he leaves my brother and I alone, so this may be entirely his opinion and not hers. 

When I started applying to colleges, my mother assured me they'd pay for my college. They cosigned my undergraduate loans, and paid the interest the entire time I was in undergraduate school pursuing a liberal arts degree. Now, about halfway through that, I had a huge fight with both of them. I wanted to switch to engineering school, which they think is unfeminine, and they freaked out, so I swore I'd do the 'appropriate' thing.

For me, this translated into adding a STEM minor and applying to engineering graduate school. As soon as I informed them I was accepted to two schools out of the three I'd applied to, they quit paying anything toward my loans. Not only are they upset about my career choice, they're upset I'm not getting married and/or having babies right away (when both their sets of parents are/were highly liberal people who to my knowledge never pressured either of them in such a way), and they crank up the heat every time I come home.

The things they like to complain about most are that I'm an unmarried woman living alone, dating a boy who reminds my dad of his brother-in-law, have no children yet, and that I keep interning outside the state I live in. I love them very much, but keep getting such mixed messages. On one hand, they are no longer paying for my undergraduate loans, when they promised to do so (manageable, because I have a research job, but kind of irritating), but on the other hand, they want me to move back in until I marry, not go anywhere alone (I'm serious, especially if there are going to be guys there), and most especially not live further than ten minutes from them my whole life. I've been too worried about the fallout to get into it with my mother, who does all our taxes, about all the tax refunds from the jobs I've worked over the years (part-time during school, and recently internships in the summers) that I've never seen.

I'm an adult. I'd like to not have my parents gripe at me about how they never got everything they deserved, turn the whole argument into either the no true Scotsman fallacy or some sort of cockamamie tu quoque thing, and then tell me I'm being ungrateful for what they are so generously offering. Other parents apparently ""hate"" their daughters/children in general because they ""kick them to the curb"" after 18. Apparently nobody else would do ""such a truly generous thing"" for their children by letting them stay under their roof as long as they want... and yet if I visit them I still have to ask permission to go anywhere, and my brother or dad has to come with me if I want to so much as go to the grocery store. Anything I achieve in life that's not marriage or having children is generally dismissed as unimportant... yet anything my brother (who is failing out of college for the third time because he doesn't do any of the homework and plays LoL 6-8 hours a day) says or does is regarded as a sign of burgeoning genius. The small SUV that I paid the loan off on (approximately 2/3 of the car's purchase price) this summer while I was in California working? It's in their name, so he commutes to and from school with it every day. I don't need a car, apparently. 

I had no idea that would take so many words to type out ;-; sorry.

The time is getting closer for me to attempt to take down the beast. I will be doing my Big 4 internship this summer in audit, then will begin finishing up courses to have 150 hrs. I will be taking 4 graduate courses in the fall, 3 in the spring. I will have Becker provided by my firm basically as soon as I sign my offer. I will be working on campus about 15-20 hrs a week during grad school, some of those hours being free to do some studying if its slow.

My question is, based on this, what do you guys think is a logical timeline and schedule for my exams? I'm hoping to be done by the time I'm done with grad school in the spring. I'd like that last summer free to travel a little before starting full time. Based on that, the testing months that would be available to me are October, November, January, February, April, and May. 

Do you guys think it is realistic to knock out all 4 within that time? And which order do you recommend? I'm thinking AUD first as I'll just have finished an internship in audit, but I'm also taking graduate tax right now, so maybe take REG first so its mildly fresh in my mind? But I also know many take FAR first because its the most material/arguably the hardest.

What do you all think?

Thanks.

On the way to work every day I feel my throat and chest tighten, my head feels 30 pounds heavier and I start breathing hard.

It's been a month now, I hate it, it's not the position I want to be in, but I have to wait 6 months to even get an internship for the position I want.

But every day feels like the day I'm gonna snap and just have a massive breakdown, I've never told anyone this but after the first day I was put to take live calls, on the way home I pulled over and cried. It was overwhelming, I realized I hate the job, but I can't go back to my old job and the money and benefits are too good for me to leave. But I'm not happy there, and every day just stresses me out more and more. I seriously feel like one day I'm just gonna pass out from the anxiety.

I know the easy way out is just quit the job, but I can't.
I need it to get to where I want to get in life.
I didn't want to go to college so I started working instead, I worked my up from making pennies as a warehouse worker to working for one of the biggest banks in the world.

But I don't think I can do it, if I leave now I'll just disappoint too many people.

My mom knows I hate it there, she caught me before work last week and saw my face, she asked me ""Are you really comfortable there? Are you sure you like it?"" I just told her ""I love it"".

But I don't, I'm scared to go to work every day, I don't want to go back to work.

I miss my old job
I miss shooting the shit with my friends there
I miss the simplicity.
This whole ""real"" job thing terrifies me, my sister told me ""A lot of people would KILL to be in the position you're in now"".
But I'm only 20, ever since I got here everyone told me ""You're lucky you go into this so young, you're gonna go far"" but I'm scared of mistakes.
I'm a very analytical person, if I don't know how something works inside and out, it terrifies me, we took personality tests and I got the thinker personality, quiet, reserved, needs to know how everything works, very detailed.

It's just too much for me, it scares me, I have problems sleeping at night because of it.

I don't talk to people about my problems because I believe my problems are my problems and I need to solve them myself and not burden people with them.

But that's ultimately my downfall."

I'm 20 years old, live with my mother. Haven't held a proper job for a decent amount of time in months, even then it was just a temporary thing. I just stopped picking up shifts. The job before that, an apprenticeship, I just stopped going in. My doctor recommended me stress leave, but even after it was over, I just couldn't bring myself to go in and face everyone again. Now, I'm doing an internship. I was having a good time there, getting on well with people and generally making a good impression. Then, I took ill for a week. I was supposed to go in the following week, but I found myself fucking it up again. I didn't go in again. I don't know why, I was enjoying it. I don't know why I told myself to not go in again and needlessly fuck up yet another opportunity. And what did I even do with the time I should have been working? Nothing. I got into bed and laid restlessly for 8 hours. So I skipped work needlessly to do nothing. What the fuck is wrong with me. The place I'm interning at just think it was a long, bu inconvenient illness, and have offered to let me start fresh 2 weeks from now. But I know they're pissed at me for being so unreliable and I feel myself sinking further.

I hate myself for doing this to my mother. She has done everything to support me and I just keep fucking up. I dropped out of college, my first job, and now I'm dropping out of this. And my mom has enough to deal with on her plate. My sister recently made another suicide attempt and had to stay in a psychiatric hospital for a few weeks. It's not the first time. I'm the one who is more stoic, I don't talk about my problems, my mom thinks everything is fine, I just can't talk to her, I don't know why but I just don't feel comfortable discussing my issues and problems with her.

I have a long-term, loving boyfriend (I am gay, but I am out and this hasn't been a problem for me), whom I also love dearly. I can honestly say that if not for him, I would have killed myself by now. The only reason I haven't done it is because I know how much it would hurt him. And then I feel even guiltier that he has to put up with a fuck-up like me.

I just feel like a cripplingly lazy, useless asshole who cannot stop fucking his life up.


I think I'm depressed again. I know I'm depressed again. I have near no libido. I'm not sleeping well. I think it runs in the family. My dad killed himself 4 years ago, and I mentioned my sister. I just can't bring myself to do anything about it. My doctor put me on SSRIs for depression maybe a year or so ago (same time as the 'stress leave' in my first job), but I took them for maybe 3 weeks and wasn't feeling anything so I just didn't renew the prescription. I know that's incredibly dumb. I don't know why I stopped. I know you're supposed to give them time but I stopped anyway.

I don't self-harm but I don't know how much longer I can keep it that way. I routinely think about self harming, usually slamming my head into something hard or stabbing myself.

My mind isn't very clear right now so I'm sorry if I'm rambling. This is my first time in months talking to *somebody* about this. I know I could talk with my boyfriend, but I don't want him to worry about me. And I don't know how comfortable I'd feel about him knowing how darkly I think.

I don't know if any of this even makes sense, nor do I know why I'm writing it, I guess its supposed to be cathartic but I don't feel much better. I've probably given way too much information away. Fuck it. I don't fucking care. I just want to stop being such a fuck up."

Now to the meat of the story.  Sit back and prepare for a long read, because I have a lot to say.  I am currently a Senior in High School in the United States and have become heavily infatuated with a close friend of mine.  Alas as I feel as if it would be near impossible to start in the here and now, so I am going to use my Telephone Booth to take us back to around two years ago where this all started.  I had been growing up in West Virginia my entire life until that point.  At 9, my parents became divorced and as time went on I lost all contact with my mother.  I had been playing football since the 2nd Grade, been entering and winning local and statewide math and science competitions since the 1st Grade, played Baseball for about 5 years (which sadly ended after taking about a 65 M.P.H. fastball to the face from a coach in practice), and had always had good grades along with being in a Gifted (accelerated education) Program.  I don't want to brag and say I was a ""perfect kid"" for in my opinion such thing does not exist because every kid is prone to make mistakes at some point.  That is part of growing up.  Anyway, when I first entered High School was when things began to change.  My father worked at a local Bakery (not the kind you are thinking of; I mean more of an Industrial Baking Plant) and there had been word spreading around that the plant would close down.  At this time, however, I was dating a girl I had begun to like during my 8th grade year, which is a story for another day if anyone would wish to hear about it, so I had become blinded to the changing tides because I was much more interested in my first girlfriend and first love. Also at this time I had started dabbling in poetry and came to enjoy it along with hiking.

I should have saw it all coming, though, halfway through my freshman year.  On my 15th birthday, which also happened to be a day before my girlfriend and I's 6 month anniversary, we had a huge argument and broke up.  I, being the young kid I was, had no clue how to handle it.  For the first time in my life I began to feel lonely and understood the feeling.  Two months later, the bakery shut down, forcing my father out of a job.  I must mention here that this was a major deal to us since my father had some debt and the job at the bakery payed around 4-5 dollars more than any job aside from the coal mines.  Over the next few months while my father was jobless and I was still heartbroken I began to sink into minor depression.  I began to put much more time into my academics and football because it allowed an escape from home life.  Dad became grouchy and disconnected, constantly abusing me verbally, mentally, and occasionally physically, though the physical abuse was very rare thankfully.  I didn't do anything in return, however, because I understood.  However, I began to see my father in a different light when he started dating a 25 year old woman.

Frankly I would never have been bothered by the age difference.  However, what did bother me was the fact that she was not only married but her husband was overseas fighting for our country.  To say I was irate would be an understatement.  I knew that my father was, in the lightest terms I can say, a sex addict.  He didn't trust me after I found out about some of the stuff he did (craigslist, yahoo messenger, etc.) on our shared laptop.  He moved the laptop to his room (though he had bought it specifically for me) and told me not to use it.  However, I would sneak in his room when he was out and use it because I felt I had a right to and that I had did nothing wrong.  Anyway, there was a gap between us and when she came into the equation it only divided us further.  He constantly left me alone to be with her, still abused me, would not respect my wishes, lied to me constantly, would talk about her to me even though I asked him not to, among much more.  Also at this time I delved even deeper into reading and writing poetry and stories.  I officially cut the already loose ties I had with Christianity and began to classify as Atheist.  Dad hated his new job, which he had taken at the beginning of my Sophomore year, and football was not going well for me.  We both felt cheated respectively, when he got a job offer from the same Baking Company for us to move to a plant down in North Carolina.  We were thrilled.

At the beginning of second semester my 10th grade year we officially made the move.  I lost all connection with all but two of my closest friends.  However I began to make a few new friends down here.  I devoted more time to poetry since I had less time to hike, I worked hard for football, I kept my academics up, and finished the semester strong.  Then Junior year came.  A week before the first football game, I suffered a concussion in practice.  I came back a week later, and suffered another one.  Two weeks later, I suffered one so bad that I could not let myself play again.  My father was livid that I decided to stop playing and I began to develop constant headaches and migraines.  Dad went back to his abusive ways, which felt worse now than before due to the lack of friends I had.  I began to feel depressed.  I went to the few friends I had down here, telling them I needed help from them, that I needed support since my father had become so bad and that I had lost playing football.  And they just left me.  Every single one of them.  I became suicidal.  I failed a class the second semester of my Junior year.  And every day that went by I had thoughts about ending it all.  At the beginning of summer leading into my Senior year, I about committed suicide.  My father caught me before I did, and he had a long long talk about it all.  I think he began to somewhat understand how I felt.  However, he didn't change much, and ended up making fun of me for wanting to die.  I did feel happier that it was off my chest. I began volunteering, writing again, and even was published for one of my poems.


---The Girl---
--

Entering my Senior year, I was somewhat afraid.  I had talked to a few people, and finally felt more accepted down here.  One of these people was a girl I had a crush on when I first moved down to North Carolina.  She was in my English class and though her boyfriend was in there, I was still interested.  She was so...beautiful.  We never talked that much though.  I gave up, but we were still acquaintances.  During my ""suicidal episode"" over the summer I failed to notice that she and the aforementioned guy broke up.  We began talking before school started back and started to become somewhat close friends.  We sat beside each other in English class, and talked more and more every day.  I helped her with Calculus since she was in AB and I am in BC.  And every day I started to notice more and more we had in common.

She loves my poetry.  Every time I write something new she wants to be the first person to read it.  She loves talking to me and says she loves to talk to me.  She always smiles around me, and we have become really close.  As we talked we realized we had the same taste in music, that we both love to read and write poetry, we are going into the same college major, we like the same kind of food, same kinds of games, among so much more.  She always laughs at my jokes, understands my reference, and goes out of her way to see me.  However, there are two things that we are different in that scare me: wealth and religion.

It would be no lie to say that her family has some wealth about them.  I, however, come from a broken home and have lived in trailers my entire life.  The religion one is the bigger thing though.  I do not mind her being Christian.  She does mind me being Atheist.  She says she wishes I would change my view, that it would make me happier and so much more about it.  I tell her that I understand her view point, but I can't do it quickly if even at all.  She doesn't seem to hold a grudge against me for it though.

But, of course, this is about me liking her and wondering if she likes me.  So I shall make an easy to read list for you all to break down, but I must forward this list with one thing: She has a boyfriend, which complicates the matters for me.  Now on to...

My list of things that makes me think that she likes me:

-She always wants to be around me.  I have an internship in the library at our school and she comes in there to sit with me during her lunch.

-She says we should hang out randomly.

-Whenever we don't see each other in school, she says that she missed me before I tell her that I missed her.

-(side note: people have already thought we are dating/""talking"")

-I think she uses calculus as an excuse to talk to me on the phone.  I help her for about a third of the call, but we always go astray for the rest.

-She randomly touches me, such as lightly punching me in the arm in class, wanting a hug every time she leaves lunch, and even latched on to my arm and put her head on my shoulder as we were walking through the hall one day.

-She loves when I write her poetry.

-She always wants to talk to me.

-She is kinda shy and always apologizing for simple things that don't bother me at all.

-She constantly sends me winky faces "";)"" in texts, though this might be more of a thing she just normally does and might not be relegated to just me.

-She also sends me hearts ""&lt;3"" in texts, though this might be the same thing as the winky faces.

-She is afraid that I get mad at her and stuff and doesn't want to lose me.

-She gets jealous when I say anything about other girls or hang out with them.  She has even jokingly accused me of ""cheating on her.""

-She never talks about her boyfriend to me, which is odd since every girl talks about their boyfriend with me.  

-She says that I am ""deeper and smarter and funnier and altogether more original than the majority of people [she] know(s) and [I] am very talented and creative.""

-She says I am one of her closest friends.

-She says I am an amazing person, that she just enjoys being with me, that I know her ""really really well"" and admits we are similar in a lot of ways.

-Says any girl would be lucky to have me.

-She has sent me the song ""Grey or Blue"" by Jaymay

-She wants to know everything about me, but never crosses my personal boundaries.

-She says she has never met anyone like me.

I must also say that I may be reading into some of this stuff too much, but I get the overwhelming sensation that there is something more than friends between us.  Feel free to ask any questions in to comments and I would love to hear some advice.  Also, sorry for such a super long post.

Thanks!~Cyrano"

1vf4zd,13,2014-01-16,Just so that someone out there hears me.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1vf4zd/just_so_that_someone_out_there_hears_me/,"So... I'm guessing I've had depression for a long time. I've never been diagnosed, but the signs are there. I'm going through an awfully rough patch, and I just need to get it out there. Someone out there might read it. Someone out there might understand. That's enough for me.

I'm almost 22. I'm going to graduate from my university in a few months. I also have a part time job on the weekends at a clothing retail store and will be starting an internship tomorrow. That all sounds great, but all I can think of are all the ugly things that have come with it. I have no free time, no friends, no hobbies. My boyfriend, the only person I've really had for the past couple of years, is currently long distance, and I have to spend the majority of my spare time and money organizing visits for us. I love him, but until he makes the move here in a couple of years, it's a difficult situation.

It gets worse from there, though. I live with my parents who help me financially to some extent, but my relationship with my father is atrocious. He has been either absent or emotionally abusive for the duration of my life, and a couple of years ago he was involved in a crime that pretty much displayed his disregard for his so-called family for the entire community to see. All the while, I've been coping with Crohn's disease, periodical insomnia, and other fun things that aren't bad enough to change my lifestyle but are, in general, horrible.

As for shit in the short term, well, my 15 year old dog died last week, and I have a UTI and subsequent side effects of the antibiotic to deal with, so it's pretty much been an awful January so far.

The biggest problem is that the recurrent thoughts of ""disappearing"" are getting louder, and the sensation of hopelessness isn't so transient anymore. I feel exhausted in every way possible, too numb or too sore to enjoy much of anything. I just want out of this hellhole of a life, one way or another.

How do I get through without losing my mind entirely?"

1vf7pz,1,2014-01-16,I'm so sorry. I didn't know this was going to happen in the end.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1vf7pz/im_so_sorry_i_didnt_know_this_was_going_to_happen/,"I met you 4 years ago during a summer friday night at the gym. You were so beautiful. Though beautiful, you were dealing with a ton of issues, rejected by your family and haunted by your past. You were addicted to games and your counselor kicked you out of High School. It was right here that I knew that we had nothing in common..however it was pure love that held us together. 

I was shy of a couple points from acing the SATs while you were considered a drop out with no direction. I helped you study day and night, 24/7 for your GED exam. I remembered that moment we shared when I took you to the GED exam building...that look of determination on your face...it was my masterpiece and my effort that helped you get this far. 

Fast forward 6 months later you just found out that you aced your GED test. You were so determined in wanting to be a school teacher so I helped you select a university offering that bachelors degree. I drove 2 hours trips to and from your university so I can help you register for classes each semester. It was extremely satisfying to me that you were getting A's on your courses. 

This was where it all ended. As I became a sophomore it got extremely hard to keep in touch with you. My university was a flight away...I had to end our relationship because the love just wasn't there anymore. It wasn't just because of this though. My mother would never let us be together. She knew your past, who you were. It didn't matter what you're doing now. She knew you as a degenerate girl that corrupted her young bright son. 

I lost contact with you after our break up a year ago. I ended our relationship face to face but I never offered a reason why. This is something I regret till' this day. I should have given you proper reason, something for you to move on. But I was glad and proud of myself that I had gotten you to where you were. You were a highschool dropout being WoW 24/'7 prior to meeting me. Now you were going to to a four year university pursuing your bachelors with a part time job as a intern middle school teacher.

Fast forward to yesterday.

My friend just told me that you dropped out of college and went back to playing WoW a couple months after our break up. You met some kid online in this game who lives in the rural west coast. He offered you a one way plane ticket to his home. You up and left your house without telling a single soul. 

At the age of 21 you found yourself a baby-daddy. What happened to you Beth? "

I've been dating my girlfriend for about 7 and a half months now, and I'm absolutely crazy about her. It feels like the perfect relationship, and I think she feels the same way. We're both in college, and are from the same metro area (so we usually spend time together over breaks as well)

Here's the problem: This summer I have an internship across the country, so I won't see her all summer. And she really wants to study abroad for Fall 2014. I've been encouraging her to do it, because I've heard it's a great experience and I want her to be able to make the best of her opportunities. However, at the same time, I am a bit worried, because if she gets into the program, essentially we won't be able to see each other for 6+ months. 

I've never really been a believer in long-distance relationships, but I would be perfectly willing to do it for her. I'm just worried that she won't want to, and that a long distance relationship will stop her from making the best of her experience. 

I guess we could do the ""take a break for a while"" thing, but I'm pretty sure that never works. I don't want to wait 6 months for her to come back, only to realize she has gotten over me. But I probably won't want to date anyone else either. 

Obviously I need to talk to her about this, but I don't know when/how to bring it up. It would be pretty awkward if we decide that we're gonna break up after the semester's over, because we'd have this weird interim time from now until then. 

Thanks for your help /r/relationships!

This year, one of my friends inspired me to go for **Riot’s Game Design Internship.** While brainstorming ways to impress Riot, I realized every paper I’ve ever written ended up in a dustbin. 

**League of Legends is a game I love**, so I wanted to create something with a **bigger impact, no matter what.** Rioters regularly interact with players, so I figured Reddit would be a great venue.

 **I wrote a tons of stuff analyzing Swain**, and ways we could transform him into one of League's most amazing champions. **I am talking so many awesome new ideas, I actually had to split them between [Champion Feedback](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4198020) and [General Discussion](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4197995).** 

**I physically, cannot** fit all my ideas into a single Reddit post. **But I can sample a kit** and **give you a taste of what I'm capable of.** Still with me? **Good.** *Let's do this.*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**To Lure the Tiger Down the Mountain…**

 *“I’m five steps ahead of you.” – Swain, the Master Tactician*

The Sicilian Model freshly spun some of Swain’s old abilities, but trotting along the beaten path is no way to construct cool, refreshing game-play. Given more audacious design choices, what could the final product look like?

**Passive: Malevolence**

Every two instances of damage from Swain reduce the victim’s magic resistance by 1 or ¼ of Swain’s level (whichever is higher). Stacks last for 4 seconds, and are refreshed by new instances of magic damage. *Malevolence* may stack up to 4 times on a single target.

**Q: Wrack (625 Range, 8 CD, 60/70/80/90/100 Mana)**

Swain’s raven debilitates an enemy by creating a magical tether between itself and the target, slowing them by **20%/25%/30%/35%/40%** and dealing 65/90/110/130/150 (**+50% AP**) magic damage over 3 seconds. As the tether lengthens, the strength of the slow increases, up to **10% per 50 AP** at maximum distance.

**Q [Fiendish]: Ruin (250 Units [135° Cone], 4 CD, 40/46/52/58/64 Mana)**

Swain sweeps his wings, scattering putrid feathers which deal 40/55/70/85/100 (**+70% AP**) magic damage over 2 seconds and slows victims by **10%/12.5%/15%/17.5%/20%** for 2 seconds. 

**W: Interdiction (900 Range, 14/13/12/11/10 CD, 80/90/100/110/120 Mana)**

Arcane runes briefly mark a 125-radius area, then deal 80/115/150/185/215 (**+50% AP**) magic damage and snare victims within for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds.

**W [Fiendish]: Wicked Talons (14/13/12/11/10 CD, 40/45/50/55/60 Mana)**

*Passive:* Every third auto-attack, ravens bedevil the target, blinding them for **1.2 seconds**. This effect cannot occur on the same target more than **once every 6 seconds**. 

*Active:* Swain’s basic attacks deal 32/46/60/74/86 (**+20% AP**) bonus magic damage for 5 seconds. 

**E: Woe (625 Range, 10/9.5/9/8.5/8 CD, 65/70/75/80/85 Mana)**

Swain’s incantation crushes mind and body, dealing 75/115/155/195/235 (**+70% AP**) magic damage over 4 seconds.

**E [Fiendish]: Ravenous Heralds (175 Unit AoE, 10/9.5/9/8.5/8 CD, 49/53/56/60/64 Mana)**

Pernicious ravens flock around Swain, dealing 56/86/116/146/176 (**+90% AP**) magic damage over 4 seconds.

**Ultimate [Passive]: Fiendish Stratagems**

Swain adapts his tactics, exploiting his opponents’ weaknesses. Malevolence’s maximum capacity increases by **1/3/6 stacks** while Swain gains **6/15/27 armor** and **6/15/27 magic resistance.** 

**Ultimate [Active]: Fiendish Visage (Toggle @ 20 MpS, 6 CD, 4/5/6 additional MpS)** 

Swain becomes an avian monstrosity. This horrid form not only gives Swain new abilities, but grants an additional (**+1.5% Maximum HP**) armor and (**+1.5% Maximum Mana**) magic resistance. **Swain loses 375 attack range.** At the transformation’s end, Swain replenishes **45%/52.5%/60%** of the **total mana expended in his Fiendish Form** over 10 seconds.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Are you exhilarated** by the possibility of *""Big Bird Mode""* providing Swain with some *nasty* new abilities to match the transformation? **Are you horrified** by the prospect of *me*, **altering your precious Tweety?** *Perhaps you aren't even sure why Swain needs to be changed in the first place?*

Regardless of your knee-jerk, whether you like/dislike this particular set of changes, **I can promise the depth of my work will speak for itself.** If this provoked you in any way, *please*, **check out [General Discussion](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4197995)/[Champion Feedback](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4198020)** and **express yourself. You don't have to agree** with me. But if you can **spare a minute to share your two cents**, then **we will be on our way to a fantastic discussion**. Thanks for your time Summoners.

Do work in Season 4.

Best Wishes,

1vfm8w,0,2014-01-17,Rarity Goes From Mean to Straight Up Abusive!,sitaroundandglare,mylittlepony,https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/1vfm8w/rarity_goes_from_mean_to_straight_up_abusive/,"Bring on the downvotes, y'all, 'cause I hate Rarity.  To be fair, I am an episode behind, but I'm pretty sure nothing that she can do can make up for Rarity Takes Manehattan.

Issues:

**#1 Poor Spike**
The entire episode is about karma, right?  The whole thing is about how if you do something nice for someone, you'll eventually get something nice in return?

Spike does absolutely nothing but carry bags.  He doesn't go out, ~he doesn't get to go to the musical~ (how did I miss that he was there? Thanks for the correction), and at one point he is handed a sandwich but it is cruelly snatched from him by a bird.  Rarity, as usual, is constantly asking him for favors that she never returns.  Please note that there is a big difference between accepting favors &amp; demanding them.  Giving a wink and a ""pwetty please"" crosses the line into manipulative.  Especially since she never, ever, ever says thank you.


**#2 The Generosity Song**

Pinkie: ""Just be kind without a fuss""

Rarity: ""Generosity, I'm here to show all that I can do""

The moral is ""just be generous, don't make a big deal out of it"".  Like, say, by singing a song about how you're the most generous pony in the world?  She may as well be singing ""I am so very HUMBLE! HUMBLE HUMBLE PONY!  Love me!""


**#3 The Cabs**

Yes, you have to get in line.  Yes, ""the rest of us have somewhere to be too"" is a very legitimate reason you should have to get in line.  That pony in front of you?  He worked a 12 hour overnight shift so that he could get to his son's birthday party on time.  You don't know these people.  Don't presume their lives are less important than yours.  Total lack of empathy.


**#4 Suri Treats Coco EXACTLY how Rarity (&amp; Twilight) treat(s) Spike, but louder**

No respect, no consideration, just ""you work for me, be grateful"".  How is her expecting Coco to shlep her things any better than Twilight &amp; Rarity doing it to Spike?  At least Coco (presumably) gets paid.  Spike is just their slave... because?


**#5 That Fucking Outburst**

Rarity's explosion at everyone is where she goes from being wholly self-centered &amp; cruel to downright abusive.  ""I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show and this is how you repay me?""  What, by politely mentioning that the show is coming up soon?  Does it count as a favor if she gives you tickets to something you really want to see and then snatches them away in a rage?  When YOU are sewing her a brand-new line out of the generosity of your heart?  

I understand that this is the moral of the episode, but Rarity is forgiven WAY too easily here.  Think about this in real life.  If your best friend's lover treated them in this way, you'd tell them to leave, right?  If quietly asking if food would be available gets a ""well that won't be a PROBLEM, will it?"" when you're slaving away to help them?  

""Fine! Go and see Hinny of the Hills tonight! And tomorrow morning, when you come and see my fashion show without any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment! ""Oh, why look. There's our friend Rarity going down in flames! ISN'T FRIENDSHIP MAGIC?!!""

That kind of manipulative language is a really common form of emotional abuse.  You don't just completely forgive emotional abuse with what amounts to ""we know you're not like that! you don't normally yell!""... imagine for a moment your friend again: ""He never gets angry like this!  I was being self-centered too!  He was just under a lot of stress but I swear he's not normally like that and is a REALLY NICE GUY"".  Imagine your friend saying that was why they forgave such obvious emotional abuse so quickly.  Yeah.  Fucked up.

**#6 She Insulted the Doorman**

So, this is a small thing, but still.  If you've consistently tipped well, you become well-liked.  I agree with this.  I am a big tipper myself.  However, when you are obviously in dismay and someone you've been kind to in the past gives you a tiny bit of info, tossing a few dollars at him as you run away is really insulting.  Like, ""thanks for that, here's $20"".  It's condescending.  That's why he calls out, sounding a little hurt ""... I didn't even do anything.""  Tipping someone for doing a job well is polite &amp; an appropriate way to thank them.  Tipping someone for doing pretty much nothing is saying ""here, I'm wealthy and you are a doorman, have some change"".

**#7 She Fucked Over The Hinny of the Hills Team**

If your fashion designs are so good that agreeing to do the designs for someone's show is considered equal payment for a PRIVATE BROADWAY SHOW, you do not just flippantly replace yourself with a sweet, talented seamstress who's own work you've never seen.  I understand that Coco did the sewing for the cowns Siri showed, and obviously is talented at sewing.  But you don't just give someone a job without ever seeing their portfolio.  Especially if it's not your job to give.  ""Generous"" Rarity has completely fucked over her Broadway friend.

**In Conclusion:**

I've always thought Rarity was a bitch (to be fair, Twilight &amp; Rainbow Dash can also be awful, this post is not intended to be me automatically defending all other characters being awful).  But this episode she took her self-important, completely thoughtless, self-aggrandizing self into the territory of true emotional abuse.  She only does nice things for people when she knows she will get something in return, and verbally berates her friends because that's totally fine as long as you apologize in the morning.  When I was a kid, a little boy used to push me over on the playground, then pick me up, kiss my cheek, and apologize.  That's not actually okay, and Rarity did the verbal version to her friends, who were planning to show up to support her even before she apologized.

Imagine for a moment if her friends didn't oversleep and were there to support her?  Would she have apologized?  No.  She didn't feel sorry for hurting her friends, she felt sorry for losing her friends.  There's a huge difference.

**TL;DR** - Prancing around screaming about how generous she is while never giving thanks to the person who's literally carrying all of her stuff for her.

Originally I was going to build an online store for this one company as an internship but they revoked that.

My other idea was to complete an online course through coursera.com or bigdatauniversity.com through learning a language such as SQL or R. One example was an estimated 5 hour course, which my professor said was insufficient but he said it could be okay if I supplemented it with a project to implement the skills that I've learned.

I'm open to any ideas, I would like to learn something that would contribute to my job hunt in the data analytics field.

I have worked here previously as a student for three years. We hire student workers who provide services to the professors, staff, and graduate students within our college. (Probably around 300-400 users and maybe over 500 computers). This involves the typical troubleshooting and requests, maintenance, computer setup and delivery, and program installation.

Our plan was to find students who were at the sophomore level and be able to keep and train them over the course of their 3 last years at university. The problem we're encountering is very low application rates plus a massive lack of experience in applicants. Motivated applicants with a career trajectory do not end up staying the full few years and rather end up with much more lucrative internships. Overly lax policies have lead to students taking advantage of our leniency and missing large numbers of shifts and the inability to follow through with a job. Thus, our turnover is very high and we end up with a new set of technicians once a year who lately have had to be trained nearly from the ground up. Currently, we have a team of 3 student technicians (with work in in 2-4 hour blocks scheduled around classes). Then me (helpdesk manager/junior sysadmin), sysadmin, and director (mainly navigates office politics and does purchasing types of things). The sysadmin rarely uses the ticketing system, but the helpdesk typically handles 150-200 requests per month, Monday through Friday, 8-4:30.

My first and completed goal was to produce as much documentation as possible. I compiled a large knowledge base that contained both general and specific information for our most common problems. It was difficult to get current techs using these resources, though it seems like newer techs are drawn to it.

I would like to create some physical training exercises or tests for the technicians to go through during slow times and to get them familiar with certain aspects of the machines. Ideally, the idea of a VM with certain snapshots configured to reflect certain problems or misconfigurations seems to be like a good start, but I'm at a loss as to what sorts of training simulations to make. Physical machines may end up being used but I like the versatility of setting up a testing VM for their work.

What sort of things do you do to help techs learn the job other than simply explaining and shadowing?"

1vi4lj,2,2014-01-17,"Not happy for my [24/m] girlfriend's [22/f] success. Could be due to current low point in my life, or...?",unsureaboutgirl,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1vi4lj/not_happy_for_my_24m_girlfriends_22f_success/,"Throwaway account. This is a long one and im sorry for that in advance! 
  
* **Background info (just to get a feel for my character, can skip):**

Used to be a forever alone kind of guy. Was socially awkward at school and didn't have many friends. Went to uni (close to home), still struggled with making friends, and then had a family incident, which combined with no motivation in the course and lack of friends, caused me to go into depression. Diagnosed with low self-esteem, got counselling, applied to a new course in a different uni (away from home). Managed to finally get a circle of friends. One of these friends ended up becoming a friends with benefits situation, however as I was still not stable myself, I ended up getting emotionally invested in her whilst she didnt reciprocate these feelings. Long story short, had a rocky and hard time with her, finally got my head screwed on and cut it off. Not sure if its relevant, but about a year later once I got over her, she started having feelings for me and asked me out. We went out for a bit but I quickly realised that I was no longer emotionally attached to her (and she was WAY too emotionally invested in me, due to a bad relationship that happened to her during that year I think) so I broke it off very early on, realising we weren't ""meant to be"".

*Speaking of ""meant to be"", I feel I should point out that I dont believe in that notion and believe that relationships are hard work and you make it work if you believe the pros outway the cons. That being said, I do believe that its possible to know when something ISNT meant to be (this will hopefully be relevant later on). Anyway.*

So ive grown up a bit by this point, still quite sensitive, struggling with low self-esteem and believe myself to be socially awkward (although I now have some friends including a social circle). But im still forever alone. No/few girls show me interest and im wondering when (if) ill ever meet ""the one"".

* **I finally meet my girl (relationship background):**

Then I meet her. A new girl, from the year above (she'd done a year in industry the previous year). I speak with her for a bit, and get to know her. Realise she's cool, social, outgoing, fun. She's also smart and hard working. Amazing body. Basically the kind of girl that all forever alone guys ever dream about. I waste no time (no friend zone for me) and ask her out. To my amazement, she says YES!

So here I am with a beautiful girl and im on cloud 9. We hit it off, like each other a lot, talking every night for hours on end, getting to know each other, dating, dining etc. Then, not too long into the relationship (4 weeks?) we have our first fight. A big one. The first of many. We resolve it every time (over the course of a few days) but eventually, after about 3 months and just before the christmas holidays, it transpires that she's not as into me as I thought. She doesn't want to quit though, but to just take a step back and take it slower. She also informs me that im way too sensitive and need to be a bit ""cooler"" with the relationship (this is true. every fight i'd break down and be in tears thinking she was going to break up with me. combo of my low self-esteem and putting her on a pedestal). I promise to change.

Over the following months I stick to my word. She sees this, and likes it! She starts to like me more and more. Furthermore, I slowly (and with **A LOT** of her guidance and hand holding) get my shit together. Secure a summer internship at a major company which of course furthers her liking of me. My confidence goes up. Things going well. Well, except for the fact that we're fighting AT LEAST once a week. No joke. Im a bit tougher now, but not that much, and shes still the tougher one. Indeed she knows the keywords to use against me to make me break down crying. I manage to do well at uni regardless but nowhere near what I was capable of (im quite a good coder).

This fighting behaviour continues after the term and during summer whilst im working. Shes working in a summer placement too and so we spend most of summer apart. I would fight with her and be in tears at 4am in the morning, having to be up by 7.30am for a 9am start on most days. Luckily my workplace was very relaxed about timing (as long as I got my work done they didnt care what time im in) and so eventually I started saying ""fuck it"" and would lie in till 8 or 9am, coming into work an hour or two late. Not only was I late almost every day, I was irritable and unsocial as a result too and didnt make the impact I could have with the team I was working with. Were it not for my coding skills, I probably wouldn't have been given a graduate offer afterwards.

Near the end of summer, in the midst of a fight, she gets so upset with me over the phone, that she starts to puke. This was the wakeup call and I realise now that ""we're not meant to be"". I calm her down, and then tell her (and again the next day) that we're just not working, too much fighting. She owns up, and admits to me that, despite her outward appearance, she can be very insecure, sensitive, negative and argumentative and that she wants to change. She more or less begs me not to break up with her. Admittedly I wasnt sure this was a good idea, but I decide to give her the benefit of doubt and agree to continue working at it. 

The fights dont stop but they reduce, a lot, and she becomes a lot less sensitive over stupid things I say and do. The relationship becomes a lot better, and by this time we have done 1 year. Despite this, when we do (inevitably) fight, mentally I brace myself for the worst, not in the crying snivelling way I used to, but in a more ""yh, see we're not meant to be"". Very negative of me now I know, and we discuss this and I agree not to jump to that conclusion so quickly anymore.

* **Almost there...**

Although I have a graduate offer for next year its on the condition that I get a decent grade at uni. This semester turned out to be really tough and im on the verge of potentially failing. Also the modules are uninteresting to me, and honestly now im done with uni life and cant wait to start working in the real world. Meanwhile she was in the same position as me but with an added pressure of having to look for and apply to get a graduate offer. Well at least thats what she made me think. We'd moan and complain about how tough the course is, except Im actually failing whilst she has gotten a 1st in all her courseworks so far. As I said earlier, shes VERY NEGATIVE. I dont mind the fact that she is doing better than me, but it would be nice for her not to pretend that our situations are the same when they're clearly not! However she reminds me always that I have a graduate offer at least whilst she has to go through the whole application process whilst revising.

So she applies to a company, tells me how crap her application was, but gets a telephone interview nonetheless. After the interview, she tells me that she hasnt got it as it went so badly. But she gets into the assessment centre. So she goes for the assessment centre, comes out in such a bad mood telling me how awful it went and she most certainly hasnt got it. (After every step I spend about an hour consoling her btw). She gets a call a week later saying not only did she get the job, she sailed through the whole process!

I am not going to lie but, as bad as it may sound, its like a slap in the face to me. This is someone who would spend hours moaning and crying to me about how shit her life is and how she's going to surmount to nothing, and I console her and try to uplift her every time. Not only does she get the position but she *sails* through it!

* **Finally, THE ISSUE:**

Obviously she could tell I wasn't thrilled by the news, and it caused a massive argument between us. I realise I am an asshole for not being happy for her, but what I want to know is WHY am i not happy for her? I think I feel resentment. Resentment about the fact that last year, she spent so much time arguing with me that it affected my grades and my internship over summer (which could now effect my overall degree mark and whether I get my graduate position). And now she will be fine and sail through whilst I end up struggling. As someone who has low self-esteem, its hard enough for me to stay positive and confident about myself let alone to pick her up too (although I wouldnt mind if she actually needed it!). At this rate I can't tell whether this relationship is salvageable or not, and whos to blame and whats to be done if it can be salvaged. I've obviously ticked her off in the past and she's had to put up with a lot of my stupidness but on the counter side she explodes at me every time, and I do feel that her level of outrage in the past is unjustified. Shes reduced, but is the damage already done? More so than this, how can I feel (and show her!) that im happy for her? Am I wallowing in self-pity and need to just grow up? Or is the relationship so fragile that it was bound to fail eventually anyway?

**TL:DR; Girlfriend got a graduate offer but I'm not happy for her and we had a big fight over it. I feel resentment because I am not doing so well at the moment and I partially blame her, because of the way she treated me which affected my grades and possible career. We fight AT LEAST once a week, and shes really negative, sensitive and argumentative, whilst I am very laid back. She's improved but I feel that it may be too late. Moreso, I am not sure if the relationship is worth saving anymore. On one hand I could be throwing away something amazing, she has made me a much better person, and is kind, caring, supportive and likes me a lot. Sometimes I think I am nearly in love with this girl, but then why am I unhappy for her? Am I just wallowing in self pity? I feel logically that shes the best thing to happen to me and i'd be a fool to throw this away. But then sometimes I can't help but feel that... this isn't ""meant to be""?**

1vj43m,19,2014-01-18,White man's calculator.,[deleted],asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1vj43m/white_mans_calculator/,"I'm a Compsci student and have done internships. It's sad for me to think about my future because I know how it is in the workplace for Asian Americans. If you work for a company with white owners, then you will probably not make it to management. Or it will be far more difficult for someone who is Asian.

So when the owner of the software company I work for smile at me and says good morning, I know how he sees me. I'm the white man's calculator. 

The stance on this subreddit regarding asians/management/leadership is, I think, that asians are less assertive, or don't have the right ""social skills"". It's interesting that few are willing to even entertain the idea that asians are being discriminated against, on the sole basis that others don't want to be led by asians. 

It's not that there are no asians with leadership qualities, but because people in the workplace want to work with Asians that know their place. Their place is in being quiet, hard working, and not demanding anything. People get uncomfortable when people don't know their place.

I remember writing about this on this subreddit before, and the highest comment was from a white guy, who, after verifying his creds by saying he dates an Asian girl, called me racist for generalizing white people. 

It's funny how in society, the group that cries out as a victim of oppression is not really oppressed. The groups that are really oppressed believe they are the cause of their own oppression. Yes, Asians are not leadership material because they are not assertive enough. No one is oppressing me. The system is fair. Whites and Asians are equal. (Meanwhile the white managers and directors laugh secretly). I don't believe there is any group that have more racial self hated than Asians. There's so much internalized racism, and this makes me sad.

What can be done about this?

I guess not much. True oppression comes when the group oppressed believes they are treated fairly, or it is only by their own lack of whatever that makes it so that they are not treated fairly. There's plenty of hope out there for Asian Americans. Minor minority, highest median salary, etc. 

Just like how the blacks were taught that in the bible God has placed the white man above them, we are taught with psychology and whatever pseudo-bullshit, that Whites are more ""assertive"" and ""socially confident"", and this is the reason why Whites manage Asian calculators. But it's not all bad, our standard of living is very good for the most part if we choose to work hard. So there is no need to change. We have it pretty good already. 

I find the attitude of people in my program (tech/science, asian) to be like this. We have it pretty good, work hard, study hard, get paid decently. It's good enough. And if you have aspirations about working in management, just keep believing that asians are not fairly represented in management because they are ""not assertive"" enough. Keep hoping and working hard for the company. By the time you are disillusioned at 45 or 50 you will have passed your perk productive years, and the company can just replace you with new and fresh hopeful asians. 

Maybe I should stop. We have it good enough as it is. There is no need to shake things up. Let's be content. Let's stop saying crazy things. I'll go first: I'm content to spend my life being the white man's calculator.

http://redd.it/1u0r9b

I'm going to make a long and boringish story short if I can. 

There were several days of going back and forth and my fiance trying to reason with his dad (his mom has completely checked out), culminating with a meeting between a trusted pastor and friend of the family where Ulrich was supposed to sit down with his mom, dad and the pastor and let the pastor mediate.  15 minutes into the meeting the pastor told UM that she needed to see reason and try to reach a compromise for the good of her family, at which point she got up from the table and stormed out, going to spend the evening with her drama queen sister who is enjoying encouraging UM's crazy. UF stayed and the pastor spent six hours talking to them both and each in turn.   At first UF said that Ulrich could leave his trailer here, but I could never come back down.  Ulrich basically told him to fuck off, there was no way that was happening.  Then UM said that fine, I could be here, but I wasn't allowed to come outside where they may possibly have to see me. Again, Ulrich said there was no way he would agree to his future wife being a prisoner in his own house.  Finally UF said that he doesn't care what I do, but that I am never allowed on their part of the property or in their home again.  That's absolutely fine with me, as I have no desire to ever interact with them again.

Ulrich and I have decided to go ahead and marry in May, as we have originally planned, and that we will move the trailer as soon as we possibly can.  I've given him an ultimatum though, if we can't move it by September (we've got to come up with $15K to buy a lot and set it up) then we will sell it and move elsewhere.

To be honest I'm not happy with the situation.  I'm here at his house every weekend and don't feel comfortable in what I used to think of as my own home.  Ulrich started his internship (and he's honestly kicking ass and taking names, doing better than any other intern in his class and already becoming known for his skills and it's only been two weeks) and his girls are staying with his crazy mother through the week.  I don't think she's mentioning my name at all right now, and the kids aren't treating me as though she is, but I'm still very upset and worried about her having them all the time.  I honestly wish we had moved when we had the opportunity, but Ulrich has never had to start over and can't get past those fears. I have gotten him to see past the threats of his parents and have documented any time I'm alone with the kids that his parents are aware (in case they do try to pull the CPS crap).  Now it's just down to wait and see and hope the crazy doesn't flair up again before we can get the hell out of here.

**tl;dr**: We haven't moved and things have died down, but I am uncomfortable and unhappy with the current status quo."
1vjmsm,3,2014-01-18,"I [21M] want to take my friendship with one of my closest friends[20F] further, but she has personal issues.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1vjmsm/i_21m_want_to_take_my_friendship_with_one_of_my/,"Little bit of back story.  Lets call my friend K.  So K and I have known each other for about 12/13 years now, we grew up in the same neighborhood so we grew up together along with our siblings.  I started to develop feelings for K about 5 years ago and we tried dating, but I wanted it more than she did so we broke up. The break up wasn't exactly civil in the way that we didn't really talk till about last winter.  When we started talking again she had a boyfriend who I had met on a few occasions and he seemed like a decent guy to me so I was happy for her.  Throughout this time I had had an 8 month relationship with a girl that I went to college with, which ended July 2012 so I was single when we became friends again.  Around last March I'd say her and her boyfriend broke up after 3 years of dating, from my understanding she was the one that broke it off.  Now here's where the issues start.

Around the end of the previous school year we started talking more often, texting, seeing each other at home and whatnot.  One of the last weekends of school her and her roommate came up to do the typical college thing.  At one point her roommate and I were outside talking and K's ex got brought.  She told me how she never liked him because he emotionally abused K and pretty much always put her down.  So naturally I grew a distaste for the guy, only natural right?  Over the first half of summer we were essentially hanging out every night.  Our relationship was always platonic, although we did flirt occasionally.  The weird thing is that when we would hang out with our mutual group of friends we started to flirt more. We would give each other flirtatious attitude and hit each other(always out of fun).  They would always say how we should just date already, but neither of us felt that way about each other(at least on my side).  One night we were hanging out I saw that she was texting her ex and I asked her if they were talking again, which she said they were.  I asked her if she still had feelings for him and she told me she did, but didn't intend to get back with him.  Then halfway through the summer I started my summer internship which would make it hard for us to get together since we hung out late into the night and I needed to be up in the morning to work.  

Now we would usually text during the day while she would work or we would be doing other things.  Around the time I started working though she would barely text me and when we would make plans to hang out she would blow me off or just never get back to me.  So I started to worry that I might have done something or something was wrong.  Roll around my 21st birthday in July, I had about 20 of my friends stay the night before.  We played 6 hours of paintball in the morning then hit up the casino for the night.  It was a great time, but the I never got a happy birthday text from K which really hurt because we've never forgotten each others birthday.  A few days later she posted a picture of her and her ex with a bunch of smiley faces and hearts. Which explained her absence for the past month and half.  Early August my brother has a graduation party and her and her family comes, this is the first time I've seen her in over a month.  A few of my friends come to drink, eat, and hang out since they know my family.  I start to feel pretty tipsy at this point and I'm talking to one of my neighbors when K comes up and gives me a hug and asks where I've been.  I let it slip about her forgetting my 21st, then she becomes all apologetic blah blah blah, but she knows I'm not buying any of that so she eventually tells me that her ex knew how much we were hanging out and I guess he felt threatened by me even though they were broken up?  I told her how much that hurt that she threw me out of her life for someone who treated her so poorly.  She told me she knew she screwed up and that he was out of her life.  

Once the school year started we were back to normally talking throughout the day.  About a month in her and her roommate came up to visit again and we ended up at one of the local bars (she has a fake).  Now at this point we were all pretty drunk and K and I started dancing together.  Now I should say at this point in my life I didn't necessarily have stronger feelings for her, but I did really care about her.  While we were dancing she was doing the typical college dance moves, grinding all up on me and I must say I was enjoying it.  When we would talk to each other we would talk very close to each other, at one point we noticed our roommates were kind of hitting it off and anytime i would look she would turn my head back to her and just smile at me.  At one point I just thought, ""fuck it"" and we started making out.  This happened a few times throughout the night, but nothing more happened than that.  Her and her roommate stayed the night at our place and they left in the morning.  After she left she texted me saying she had a fun time so I figured it wasn't a big deal.  Around Halloween one of my roommates and I went down to her college where some of his friends from home went as well which is where we were going to be spending the night.  I told her I was coming down and we planned to meet up at some point in the night.  Eventually we went out to the bars and I ended up meeting her at one of them.  We got some drinks and went to the dance area.  As we were moving through I saw someone I thought was familiar but I didn't say anything about it.  We had some of our drinks then went to move further into the dance floor when she spots her ex, the person I noticed.  To sum it up she has a massive breakdown where eventually i had to take her out of the bar where i consoled her for a half hour of her crying hysterically. One of the worst moments of my life seeing her crying like that, and yet at this point I realized I had deeper feelings for her.  I didn't want to ever see her unhappy again and I wanted to always be there for her to make sure that happened.  Eventually i calmed her down and took her back to her place and went back to our friends house which was a few blocks away.  I went to check on her before I went back to school and she apologized for what happened.

Fast forward to winter break.  We drink together a few times with our mutual friends and flirt, alot.  The two of us hang out at night alot over break again, go to the movies or rent them and we flirt more now than we used to when we were alone.  For New Years my dad threw a big party where families from our neighborhood came and good bit of my friends came.  We were all drinking, having a good time and by the time everyone cleared out she was leaving and she asked me if I wanted to come over to watch something on Netflix.  I still wanted to drink and wasn't tired yet to I went over.  Completely forget what we watched, but whatever.  When I got up to leave we gave each other a hug goodbye and said happy new year.  As we were breaking apart we grabbed each others hands, which we usually do when we're saying by after a night of drinking, we just looked at each other for awhile smiling and she said ""I know what you're thinking"". So naturally I asked her what and she said that I think she's stupid to which I say I definitely don't.  (I should also mention that she still talks to her ex at this point and that she has cried on a few occasions because of something he's said to her and he always pulls her back in somehow.)  After awhile longer of looking at each  other I ask if we'll ever be more than friends again and she says we'll see.  She says she knows that not what I wanted to her, but I was honestly expecting a no.  She tells me that she doesn't want to risk it considering she's still in love with her ex, and doesn't want to risk hurting me or our friendship.  The risk of our friendship is one of the reasons I've been hesitant about bringing it up with her, but with the help of alcohol i changed my mind.  I told her I agreed, and she told me she did love me.  I know it wasn't the kind of love couples have for each other but the kind that two people that care about each other have.  I told her I felt the same way and went home.  That talk hasn't been brought up since.

Last part, I promise.  About a week ago she had gone back to school before I did so I didn't really get to see her much before I went back.  One night though she texted me saying that she needed a hug so I asked her what happened.  She said she'll come home the next night and we can hang out for a bit and she'll tell me about it.  The next day she came over and told me about how her ex is now dating someone else and he made sure she knew.  I told her good, now she can see that he's moved on and that she finally should (not as much for us being possible, but so that she can simply be happy).  We went to see a movie and went home and said goodbye.  For the first time we did our drunk goodbye and just looked at each other for awhile.  I could tell she was sad and she knew that I knew.  We hugged each other one more time and I told her I loved her and she said the same and told her I'll always be here for her no matter what.  That was the last time I saw her and really talked to her.

I guess the point of this mass of text is just asking for advice on what I should do.  For myself most of all, should I forget about trying to further our relationship or maybe see what happens?

I think it's also worth mentioning that she is what you could call a party girl, she drinks pretty much every night she can and I can't exactly say I know what she does those nights. In regards to things with other guys or not.

**Designer**

* I've been working on and off as a Game Design intern at [Say Design](http://www.saydesign.com/) since March 2013, doing GDDs, game concepts, and features lists.

* With the 5 years of being a very active Game Master in tabletop gaming, I homebrew my own monsters, encounters, settings, classes, items, settings, etc. I have a lot of experience designing and balancing those systems and proven my effectiveness in those areas through constant playtesting.

* I've designed the mechanics for several games (GDDs) that are loaded in the barrel ready to be used and fully understand the importance of regular testing to change and improve upon these things. Additionally, I have no problem coming up with new game concepts with you and working on completely fresh ideas.

* I've been designing a card game about robots in a futuristic death sport since September 2013. It's still going through design and playtesting, and currently has gone through 7 versions. I am no stranger to design, iterate, test, re-design, iterate, test, re-design.

* I have an understanding of core, basic programming concepts and have worked with several languages enough to be familiar with them. My knowledge in these areas is always expanding and I have no problem picking up new info quickly that is needed for a particular project to allow for easier communication and understanding of limitations.

* I'm an active reader of design articles and books and write many of my own analyzing specific games or design concepts in general. Check the bottom of the writer section for links, or if you want help finding a specific game design article I've written, just ask and I'll provide some links.

**Writer**

* I have 7 years of experience as a very active writer ranging a large number of mediums. I've written short stories and lots of poetry. I've also written and staged (live performances) 5 theatrical plays including directing for one of them. 

* I have video game writing experience writing the scripts for cinematic pieces including fleshing out the characters and setting involved from a Game Writing internship also at [Say Design](http://www.saydesign.com/) back in 2010-2011.

* I've also been a very active Game Master in tabletop gaming for 5 years, writing my own settings, characters, quests, dialogue, etc, including post mortem background information about each of those things. Lots of homebrew and mountains of experience putting it all to the test with players.

* I've completed some college (2 years) studying creative writing with an emphasis on poetry.

##WE NEED ALL PERSONNEL TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY
#WE NEED [INSERT NUMBER] STRIKE TEAMS TO BE FORMED
#DETAILS FOLLOW:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I know it’s very early in the morning but this issue will affect every one of us with possibly terminal implications for the facility.

Someone has stood up Carlos. He was meant to be met for dinner at 8:00pm sharp but the staff member responsible (SMR) that was dating him did not arrive. Normally this would not be a particularly problematic issue BUT he has thrown a tantrum. He is now threatening to OPEN ALL THE VENTS! We need to bring whoever is responsible to him with extreme urgency. Even 3% of the vents being open causes massive problems for us on an hourly basis. Imagine every vent in the facility open, all the worst creations, [REDACTED], mutated interns, giant nuggets, [CLASSIFIED], lost 14 series experiments and every vent tiger free to roam the facility. All members please volunteer for an appropriate team we may have only 24 HOURS at best. 


Strike Team 1

- You are tasked with finding out who the SMR for standing up Carlos is. Either by trying to extract an answer from Carlos or locating the one responsible by other methods.


Strike Team 2

- Your job is to produce a replica of the staff member responsible. It is highly likely that they are already dead or worse. It is possible they just changed their mind in which case we need a pliable copy to act as we command.


Strike Team 3 

- Bringing the SMR or replica safely to Carlos is vitally important you need to transport him safely and brief him on the importance of the mission.


Strike Team 4

- Battle plans need to be made by you. If the first teams fail then when hell breaks loose we need comprehensive strategies to deal with the carnage that will follow on a release of the vents. I need all our best men ready to fight the good fight. 


Strike Team 5

- If Team 4 fails in their objective then our only option may be to abandon the facility. We need this team to coordinate a full scale evacuation of the facility. We may need to go to a parallel world if necessary and I don’t know what it’ll be like to be refugees in an alternate facility. 


Strike Team 6

- Retaking the facility should be made a viable option by you. The failure of other teams may mean this will be necessary. If it is not possible it will also be your task to use any doomsday devices or other weapons to destroy the facility partially or completely. 


Strike Team 7

- It pains me extremely to say it considering how close I am to him. But if all other teams fail it may be necessary to purge Carlos from the system. This is a last resort and should not be attempted unless all else fails but it may have to be done. Please consider what a tragedy it would be to lose him. Even if attempted I put up various defences myself to stop anyone harming him and I imagine he has his own as well as any other things he may try and do. The fight could lose us a lot of men, women and [CLASSIFIED].


Finally if SMR is reading us please make yourself known and solve this ASAP or you are going to be an experiment in just how unpopular it is possible for a person to be.

TL:DR: We are all doomed if we don't act soon.

1vkzyk,8,2014-01-19,What to wear to an advertising agency coffee meeting,[deleted],femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1vkzyk/what_to_wear_to_an_advertising_agency_coffee/,"First off, really sorry if I'm breaking any posting rules, I read the side bar, I think I'm good, if not, sorry!

So I'm a college student in my final semester. I have to find an internship to graduate my program and to get a job and live my dream. I'm on the art direction and design side of the creative advertising industry. I have a trip this coming week to go to Toronto to meet with some Art Directors and CD's for coffee. No formal interviews, but hopefully something will come of this. I want this so bad, understand that.

 A big concern is what do i wear? It's the first impression they're have of me walking in the door. In Toronto and New York City I saw there's a lot of incredibly beautiful people, and a lot of variety in dress. Some agencies were very casual, like Mother NYC were people wore mom jeans and giant thrift shop sweaters, and some agencies are much more business, like DDB Toronto, which had accounts people in heels &amp; skirt suits. I plan on being out for most of the day, travelling from agency to agency, so I want my outfit to be a swiss army knife: working for each place I visit and not seeming out of place or inappropriate. I also want to be true to myself as a creative: I have an eye for textures, lines, shapes and structure. 

So I guess I'll list off what I know

* This is what I came up with for outfits: http://imgur.com/a/kxSh6 I don't know if the jeans are too casual, or if the black pants are too tight? WHAT GOES ON LEGS?

* Body: 5'9"", 37-26-36, but not curvy, I'm an hour glass that you can draw with a ruler. So no cinched waists or peplums, they never fall right on me. I'm pale in the way that you can count my platelets in the moon light, so I tend to stick with black and neutrals. My hair is grey-white. Think [Kate Lanphear](http://avantisalonboston.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/blog_kate_lanphear_elle_armani_exchange.jpg?w=600) with a [fade](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000823387906/d46430b887dff328b3f3908349d8790a.jpeg). Because my hair is 'edgy', should I be more conservative? It's not too outrageous, I do get a fair amount of compliments on it.

* Weather: COLD AS HELL. About -25/-20 for the day time high. No skirts, no heels, no exposed skin. I'm wearing my parka and I'll be wearing my ecco chelsea boots as they're good for walking and have grip on the bottom for icy side walks. Open to anything else though.

* Length: I have 3 days. I'm packing as much coffee and schmoozing as I can into 3 days. So I need about 3 outfits. I'll bring 4-5 outfits just incase. 

* Concerns: I don't want to look intimidating, I'm told I have a serious bitch face. I know a have one. It's bad. I don't have much money, but I can go out to pick up a couple pieces, especially if they will be investments. I have 300$ to subsist on till pay day. Take that as you will. I'll eat Mr. Noodle and wear cool pants.

I don't know if it helps, but this is my [pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/heatherlinda/beauty/) to get an idea of what I wear/want to wear at the moment.

1vl1t4,4,2014-01-19,Possibly going into ministry.,rebelleader51,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1vl1t4/possibly_going_into_ministry/,"I've been a long-time lurker on Reddit for a long time.  However, I am currently in a place in my life where I may actually thinking about going into ministry.  In fact, I have already applied for a graduate-level program for recent college graduates who want to go into ministry and will hopefully be going this September.

I have some anxiety about the position and was hoping to look for some helpful advice from this subreddit.  I won't lie, I'm very intimidated by the idea of doing this.  I've lived my life mostly by learning through my failures - many of which are sinful.  With that in mind, here are my worries:

-I will probably become a role model to others, yet I still struggle with sins of different sorts.  How do you think this would affect my ministry?

-Inevitably, I will have to take a stance on certain issues such as homosexuality, abortion, the use of different substances such as marijuana and different forms of contraception, etc.  How do I stand my ground in a loving way that doesn't offend others?

-I don't believe myself to be the most intellectual individual.  I fear that, if I were locked in a debate with someone over a theological issue, I may come off as ignorant or, worse, arrogant.  How can I approach different issues and still avoid coming off as a jerk?

-What do I do when I can't relate to someone?  I've never been raped before.  I've never murdered anyone.  I'm not a parent.  How do I react to someone who wants to discuss traumatic events in their lives?



These are some of the things that I am anxious about and I'm not looking for anyone to answer all of these questions at once, but if you have any insight to any of these, as well as any other advice, I would appreciate it.  Also, I know my 'internship' will most likely prepare me for many of these things, but I'd be a bit more at ease if I kinda knew ahead of time what to expect.   

I fully welcome any personal stories, experiences, etc.  Thanks guys."
1vm1ff,1,2014-01-19,"Me [19 F] with my boyfriend [23 M] of 4 months, trying to make a long distance relationship work when I am new to the city and have almost no friends - I am feeling needy.",_alone__,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1vm1ff/me_19_f_with_my_boyfriend_23_m_of_4_months_trying/,"So, I moved to a new big city at the beginning of this month to take an 8 month internship. I am taking a semester off from school. My boyfriend lives in the town my college is in an plays in a band (more on this later).

We are originally from the same hometown but reconnected this past fall. Everything was going gloriously when I found out I got this internship. It was really not a question about if I would take it. It's the chance of a lifetime, and will increase my job prospects exponentially. 

After a lot of discussion, we felt that this relationship is something neither of us wanted to give up. So, here I am.. 8 hours away. He has been great! We talk every day, and he has already visited me once. 

Here's where my issues come in...As I am not 21, and most of the other interns at my company are masters students, I am having a really hard time making friends. So basically... I am sitting at home watching movies on the weekends and he is out playing shows and getting drunk. We communicate a lot while this is happening. But, I just feel like the needy girlfriend who is just waiting by the phone. Last weekend I went out alone to see some music, and yesterday I took a long walk around the city and through the parks. Normally I am at work 9-5 during the week, so I am doing my own thing then. 

I just can't shake these strange feelings. It's almost like I am *jealous* that he is out having fun. I wish I could be there too! And his being in a band is definitely a challenge. They are relatively popular in our area (~4000 followers on Facebook, if that says anything). I know there's girls throwing themselves at the band all the time. I have witnessed it. While I don't think he would cheat. He's definitely a one woman man.. I can't help but feel the pings of jealousy. I don't know. I know he is super into me. I don't think he would actively seek out another girl. But they are just so available and so plentiful, if that makes sense. They are also very artsy and such.. like him. I am a nerdy engineer. Haha. My creative bones are lacking. I do love his music though!

I guess I'm seeking advice on how to pursue a long distance relationship when I am feeling rather alone. And, as a result, needy. I'm just normally not this type of person. I'm trying to meet people. But, I'm not 21. I can't go to bars here. We talk all the time, and we never fight or argue. But lately I have been acting more insecure I think. It's just hard, so maybe you guys have some insight i'm not seeing. 



---   
**tl;dr**: I'm in a new city all alone and trying not to be too needy for my boyfriend. "

**[Watch Hours Online](http://www.reddit.com/r/theMovieFree/comments/1vm80f/watch_free_hours_online_movie_full_hdquality/)** In the days after the horrific car crash that took Paul Walker's life on Nov. 30, many tributes were paid to the handsome 40-year-old actor best known for his undercover lawman in the ""Fast &amp; Furious"" movies. He was a great dad to his teen daughter. He was given to generous acts of charity, once secretly purchasing a pricey engagement ring for an Iraq war vet and his fiancée. He was a capable action hero, and his likability factor onscreen and off was through the roof. What you didn't hear, however, was much effusive praise of his acting talent.

That may change once ""Hours,"" the first of his two finished movies, arrives in theaters and on VOD this weekend. Set in a New Orleans hospital during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the thriller isn't perfect, the budget deficiencies are apparent, and Walker is pretty much forced to carry the entire weight of the drama on his well-muscled shoulders.

**[Watch Hours Online Free](http://www.reddit.com/r/theMovieFree/comments/1vm80f/watch_free_hours_online_movie_full_hdquality/)** That's not surprising, considering he is the only recognizable cast member, and his main co-star ends up being a newborn infant. What is unexpected is how well he pulls off what is essentially a one-man show.

Once the story gets going after a rather clumsy and protracted opening, screenwriter Eric Heisserer (""Final Destination 5""), in his directing debut, allows Walker plenty of room to more than rise to the occasion. The film ends up being a rather ingenious survival tale crossed with a tension-ratcheting gimmick—somewhat akin to ""Speed""'s bomb-on-a bus scenario—that makes every ticking minute count.

First, however, we must patiently learn all the details of the situation. When we first meet his character Nolan Hayes, his pregnant wife Abigail (Genesis Rodriguez) has gone into labor five weeks early. Nolan rushes her to the hospital just as the historic storm starts brewing. The tragic news that his wife has died leaves Nolan more numb than tearful, but at least their daughter is alive. However, a doctor explains the preemie must be fed through an IV and placed in a ventilator, remaining there for at least 48 hours.

**[Watch Hours Online Free Full Movie](http://www.reddit.com/r/theMovieFree/comments/1vm80f/watch_free_hours_online_movie_full_hdquality/)** However, once Katrina unleashes her wrath and the flood waters rapidly rise (clips of actual newscasts keep us up to date), the hospital is forced to evacuate. That leaves Nolan and his child on their own since the ventilator can't be moved. Then the power cuts out, the back-up generator fails and Walker's character spends the rest of the film cranking a battery that can only be recharged for a couple minutes at a time.

Much like Sandra Bullock in ""Gravity"" or Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away,"" Walker's Nolan finds surprisingly engaging if compelling ways to pass the time. He speaks to his silent daughter, telling her about her mother while pulling out photos and other souvenirs—including her engagement and wedding rings, taken off in a rush before going into the delivery room—and placing them atop the ventilator. He hunts down refill bags for the IV drip, changes a diaper for the first time, seeks out a radio transmitter after cell service goes out, remembers how he and his wife met and fell in love, and rushes to the rooftop and back after failing to flag down a helicopter. Matters grow more dire when men with guns start lurking in the darkened hallways, scavenging for food, drugs and whatever they need to get by.

**[Watch Hours Full Movie](http://www.reddit.com/r/theMovieFree/comments/1vm80f/watch_free_hours_online_movie_full_hdquality/)** And, all the while, he must continue to return to crank that battery. Again and again and again.

His pretty face obscured by a beard and his considerable physicality tested, Walker manages to be both tender and tough, and to watch him stretch himself so well is a pleasure. It's much like watching the late James Gandolfini up-end his menacing image with his sweet portrayal of a lovable lug in ""Enough Said."" It's a sad experience knowing he is no longer around, but also happy, since he left behind one more memorable performance.

**[Watch Hours Full Movie Online Free](http://www.reddit.com/r/theMovieFree/comments/1vm80f/watch_free_hours_online_movie_full_hdquality/)** Heisserer doesn't get everything right, but he sure knows how to milk a taut ending, including a miraculous final shot, one that would have drawn tears even if Walker were still around. For those who wish to see the actor at his best, ""Hours"" is worth the time.

1vmdtf,1,2014-01-19,"My [23 F] ex broke up with me [21 M] coming home from a 4 month overseas internship, I'm having a hard time moving on",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1vmdtf/my_23_f_ex_broke_up_with_me_21_m_coming_home_from/,"A little backstory. 

I now I'm still young and everything but I would've married her and settled down with her, it's what I wanted and I made a lot of sacrifices to keep our relationship alive. We've been together for about 2 years. She's been away twice for a period of 4 months in the last year for an internship and I managed to grind it away and stay hooked to the idea that we would be happy and closer than ever when she would get back (just like we were before she left). 

We kinda grew appart during those 4 months, but it was clear for both of us that we would work together to fix everything once she came back. Now nobody cheated or anything like that. 

But then she came back and she decided it was all over. And that's why I'm having a hard time moving on. You see, I kinda feel like she owes it to us (especially to me, for sticking on while she was away) to give us a second chance now that we are reunited. She based her decision on how we (and I) interacted while she was away and it was a hard time for us. Now I feel like I'm being wrongly accused of acting a certain way and because of that I'm losing her. 

I know for a fact that she was happy when we were together and that the future looked bright. And I can get over the fact that the last 4 months were shitty and turn the page on that to move forward. But she sticks to these 4 last months and I'm stuck with an ex that I still love from all my heart that just won't see how short sighted her decision is...Well that's my point of view. 

That's why I'm turning to you...I've been clear to her of how I feel about this whole thing and I can only hope that she one day sees it as I do to. But while I can't hang on to this idea, I need to move on...I guess. But it's especially hard for me because of this bitter premature end to our relationship. I feel like I've worked hard and studied for a class during 4 months and now I can't even take the final exam...

TL:DR GF broke up with me, coming back from 4 months apart and with the best of our relationship to come. Having a hard time moving on

EDIT: might mention that we are still in good terms and talk/see each other sometimes. She told me that I'm still important to her so it makes it a xillion times harder for me to be ok with her not giving it a shot...

1vn1j6,0,2014-01-19,How often do you experience this? Or do you?,ldthrowaway147,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1vn1j6/how_often_do_you_experience_this_or_do_you/,"Here's some background, I am (16M) currently in a long distance relationship (about 3ish hours apart) with my SO (18) and I love her so much, she's an amazing person and absolutely stunningly gorgeous and she's just perfect to me. She was my friend for 2 years prior to us starting dating in July last year, we're coming up to 6 months. We went to a summer camp together for the past few years and always just as friends, last year we went as counselors in training and we spent most of our time together and we both got internships to go back to the camp and we were sort of staff there for a week and we started dating a little bit after camp ended. As I said, I see her about once a month for about a day and a half, and on new years I spent 3 days.



I'm 16, sophomore in high school, and she is 18, a senior in high school.  We both fully acknowledge that this relationship of ours has an end date because of her going to college, I accept it and so does she. But that's rough, ya know? I never want her out of my life, I feel like everybody needs someone like her in their life and I never want to lose that. She was there for me in middle school and high school, giving me all that advice that I genuinely took to heart and still go by today. She was like an older sister to me. I don't think that us breaking up will have a profound effect on us as friends, but there is something in the back of my head saying it might, and I really really don't like that. It's rough. She had sort of a breakdown of sorts about a month and a half ago while I was on the phone with her and she was talking about how she wanted me to be there for her after we break up and she never wants me out of her life, and she was only talking about me and she said she didn't really care about leaving her friends behind for college besides me. She has sort of come to terms with leaving them behind and how keeping them around isn't really worth it, she is sort of a realist I guess. And then she went on about how she didn't know if us getting in a relationship was a good idea and how she has had her doubts, and honestly, so had I and I told her that and we both got sort of emotional and the rest of the conversation has slipped my brain. For the past few days I've been sort of in the dumps. I really miss her, as I always do, but this time it's different and I've been ""planning out"" our break up in my head..... but I don't want to break up with her and I don't know why I'm thinking all of this. I love her so much, more than I could put into words, but I hate having these doubts in my head about us and it's eating me up. I haven't spoken to her in like two days because I've just been needing some space. 



It just hurts to know that it does have an end date and we do acknowledge it, is it really worth it if it does? She can't go back to camp as anything except a counselor this summer, and she is applying for that currently, she's a shoe in for it, but me being younger chances are I won't get it. You all know how rough it is to not have your SO around in times like this, but do you ever doubt your relationship with them? Is it just me thinking this because she is going to college? I'm having a lot of conflicting emotions, I love her so much and I want to be with her, but there's that voice in the back of my head that's just so doubtful. Thanks



TL;DR Me (16/M) in relationship with my SO (18/F) and am having doubts and conflicting emotions despite how much I love her and want to be with her. "
1vn85c,69,2014-01-19,[A/n] My aunt raped me three weeks ago and I can't stop thinking about her. I need some advice.,throwaway_nephew,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/1vn85c/an_my_aunt_raped_me_three_weeks_ago_and_i_cant/,"So this happened between Christmas and New Year's. I haven't dared to tell anyone but I really need some advice and I don't know what else to do. I didn't know this subreddit existed till now. If this is the wrong place to post this please redirect me.

So my aunt who I hardly ever see visited us for Thanksgiving last year. She paid a lot of attention to me which I thought was weird. After Thanksgiving my mom told me my aunt had offered to ""babysit"" me down at her place after Christmas. This was because I had just gotten a summer internship in her city and she wanted to show me around and get used to the place. The idea was I'd also be staying at her apartment during the internship so this was like a tour of sorts.

My aunt came and spent Christmas with us. Again I didn't notice anything besides she was very touchy feely with me. The next day she drove me down to her city. We got there in the evening and she gave me some alcohol to drink while we waited for food she ordered to get here. I thought that was pretty cool of her since I'm not 21 yet.

Well I guess something was in the drink because when I woke up later, it was really dim, I was on her bed with my wrists handcuffed to the bedposts, and my aunt was riding me. I don't want to go into the details, I don't remember much anyway, the biggest thing I remember was that my wrists really hurt.

The next morning I remembered a bit and I panicked at first but my aunt rode me again and I guess I liked it because I felt really good. I was also really hungry because the food from last night never actually got here. 

Anyway my aunt kept me cuffed that entire day and just had sex with me whenever. She told me stuff like if I didn't want it I wouldn't have came, and I shouldn't tell my mom because that would get both of us in trouble. I agreed with the second part. 

Same thing happened the second night, she just rode me then slept next to me. 

Next morning she said she'd uncuff me if I promised not to ""be a good boy"". I guess that meant don't run away, call the cops or my mom. I was super hungry and exhausted and my wrists hurt so I agreed.

The next few days we just had sex. I don't think I left the apartment. I feel guilty to say this but these next few days were consensual. 

New Year's Eve my aunt drove me back up home. That day was uneventful besides a handjob while she drove. The entire drive though she kept saying it wouldn't pay to tell anyone about this. She also promised that if I went back this summer she'd give me all that and more.

So my aunt spent New Year's with us, still really touchy feely. I felt really uncomfortable since I was trying to hide my boners from the rest of my family.

I think a couple days later when I masturbated I just only thought of my aunt in my head. I don't think I've ever cum so hard from masturbating before.

These past three weeks my aunt has been Snap chatting me with nudes and texting me a lot. I'm ashamed to say I think I like it. And I think I like incest now, which I never did before.

So this is why I'm posting this. I know my aunt raped me, maybe drugged me too. But I liked it and I really do think I have to keep this a secret. The last thing I want to do is screw up my mom and aunt's relationship, and this is also the first internship I've ever gotten. But I know what my aunt did was wrong.

Is there any advice any of you can give me?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all your advice. It's been really helpful. I haven't been able to function at all this past week and your comments helped me sort through my thoughts a bit. I think I'll talk to my parents first then maybe the police."

1vocu2,26,2014-01-20,I'll be going to college this fall and I have no idea how to handle my finances.,PurePhenomenal,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1vocu2/ill_be_going_to_college_this_fall_and_i_have_no/,"I’m a high school senior preparing to head into college this fall and I have no idea how to handle my finances over the next four years. I want to know what all I can do to prepare for the worst case scenario. I’ve already been accepted into the college I really want to go to and will be enrolling within the next couple weeks. I'll be going to DigiPen Institute of Technology for the Bachelor of Arts in Game Design. 

Assuming I don’t get any scholarships or grants at all, I’ll have around $120k in debt from student loans alone, most of which I’ll have to pay off on my own. Luckily, I’m pretty good at not spending the little money I get unless I know I can spare it, and even then I tend to save up quite a bit before using any of it. I don’t impulse buy very often at all. I plan on getting a job during college (likely on-campus jobs during the school year and probably internships over summer). I want most of the money I make to go towards some sort of savings account to be used when I need it (no luxuries will be bought with it; in fact, I would hope that I wouldn’t have to spend any of it during college, if possible). I’ve heard brilliant statistics about those who graduate from this school (over 90% of graduates have been employed within 6 months of graduating and I could start off making around $40k a year). 

I have no idea what to do beyond this. I’ve never had a job before, so I don’t really know where to put the money besides some sort of savings account (I guess I’m asking if there’s a specific kind of account I should put it into). I’ve never handled taxes before and haven’t learned anything about doing them in school. 

My parents said they would pitch in a little bit of money for groceries or something, but other than that I’m pretty much on my own. My parents may end up buying my sister’s car off of her soon, which they would let me use, though I would probably have to buy it off them at some point. Obviously I want to get scholarships and grants (I’ll be talking with my school’s financial aid office about this for help) and I know a job is a necessity during the school year. What can I do over the next four years to make sure I do not fall on hard times financially? 

Edit: Added in a few more details in case they help at all (college name and degree). 



Edit 2: This has been pretty eye-opening. I've been seriously reconsidering my options over the past couple hours and it sounds like I can't afford this without some miracle. I may not have seemed very grateful throughout this thread, but trust me when I say that I am. I figure computer science will be my best fall back option for a different college, so if anyone has some suggestions there (I'd prefer something local (in Washington)), I'd love to hear. Thank you, everybody. "
1vof8n,8,2014-01-20,$700 dollars a year,SuperRantrave,stopsmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1vof8n/700_dollars_a_year/,"I was never a ""real smoker"". I never smoked a pack a day. At most would be half a pack a day during my college years when I used to roll me own. But now I try to limit myself to a pack a week. I've never really had a reason to quit. Even after my dad has health problems from a lifetime of smoking and losing my grandfather to heart disease brought on by a lifetime of smoking.

Sure some of my friends have tried to get me to quit, but their efforts are short lived and I go back. I'm really the one at fault. They tried, this isn't their full-time job nor should I expect it to be. 

I graduated in May. I am unemployed. I lost the love of my life in July. I'm applying to graduate school atm. I've lied to a close friend of mine about quitting and I feel guilty when I had to disclose the truth in front of her. Hell, I think I've lied about quitting more times than I can count. 

Why do I smoke now? I make excuses, simple as that. Oh, You've had a long day at your internship, have a smoke. Oh you're angry, sad, or bored go out for a smoke. Drinking? Smoke! It's morning? Lets go out for a smoke. You want to have a philosophical discussion in your head? Alrighty! Lets go do that while having a smoke. Thinking of your late girlfriend? Here have a smoke while you try to fight the tears. All excuses. 

As I've mentioned before I am unemployed. I am financially supported by my parents through a stipend for travel and food to my internship. Guess what I do with the food portion? I buy smokes. I justify it by telling myself, ""Well if I don't eat for 2 days I'll have enough for a pack that will last me a week."" Pathetic. I used to feel guilty whenever I did this. That is $12 I wont see again, but it's become so routine I don't even care anymore. And then I did the calculations. If I smoke a little over a pack a week, I smoke away about $700 a year. Holy fucking shit. That might not seem like much to some of you guys who used to be accustomed pack-a-day smokers, but I've never worked a real job in my life. $700 is a lot to me. I could have invested with that money, or bought myself or loved ones some nice things. $700 a year. I think its a bit sad that my final motivation to quit once and for all is monetary. But whatever works, right?"
1vom5z,10,2014-01-20,I [21/m] went out with [20/f] on weekend and she was glued to her phone (details on weird situation inside). Help please!,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1vom5z/i_21m_went_out_with_20f_on_weekend_and_she_was/,"Hi,

First off, some context:
I met this girl around this time last year while at university through a friend and we hit it off.  But there were loads of logistics issues and she later told me she was going through some personal stuff at the time so we never really went out before summer break.  During the summer I moved home and she moved home across the country so we just texted alot and kept in touch.  I am on internship this year so while she at school I am at home but I frequently visit the university to see friends and take care of stuff related to my internship and degree.  So last term I came up a few time, went out with her once where we kissed at the end of the night.  So things are great right? Nope, things become strange for a little while, I think she's not interested and things cool off for a while but then we begin talking again, I try to visit her a few time in friend group situations where she is much quieter to me (and everyone else as well) and then leaves early.  She sends me an apology for being a ""a dick"" (her words) and we agree to try to see eachother again in the new year when I am back in town.  Over the winter break she starts talking to me like every day, sends me a drunk snapchat asking me out to dinner and constantly texted me during new years ever where she knew I was at the bars.  So I feel like she is pretty into me at this point.

Anyways, I went up to town this past weekend to sign a lease for when I move back for my (and her) final year of school.  On Saturday I met up with her and went to a local pub to grab a drink and bite to eat and watch the hockey game where things are great but she is constantly on her phone.  She explained it was her boss at first which was fine.  

But then this guy she knows from back in her own town (across the country) begins calling (note she never picks up the call while I am around during the date) and texting her constantly (like 5 calls in 5 minutes) who she at first tries to tell that she is busy but it doesn't work.  She says the guy is an old friend who has a lot of issues (he might be a drug addict friend that she mentioned at another time but I'm not sure if they are the same person) and she is kind of his support system.  Ok fine, I can deal with it but I say end it soon and says she is trying.  But it doesn't stop.  She is constantly taking out her phone and over the course of the night her happy personality fades a bit.  She says at one point the guy called her a cold heartless bitch.  But she won't stop talking to the guy!  At another point she mentions that the guy asked if she was out with me but I've never even met the guy and she claims she never mentioned me to him.  So I'm a little creeped out by this too because he is obviously stalking both our Facebook/ Twitter/ Snapchat (best friends) accounts. Anyways besides the phone shit I feel like we were having a good time though I make it pretty obvious that what she is doing is bothering me and she is aware.  At one point I considered texting her ""If you don't stop I will leave"" but decide against it though thinking about it now maybe I should have.

So it hits a little past midnight and I suggest we leave the bar and go for a walk.  We hold hands and walk around town aimlessly for a while and things are nice, we are laughing, no phone out.  Eventually we turn around and walk the other way which is towards her place but I stop to show her a cool spot I know with a nice view on top of one of the apartment buildings.  I was hoping to try and kiss her up here (kind of romantic I guess) but as soon as we get up there she is on her phone again, clearly a little upset but won't talk about it.  The moment is basically ruined and she says she is cold and wants go home.  We hold hands the rest of the way, I suggest we watch a movie at her place (we both are really really into movies) but she says no she has meetings in the morning (which she did so fine).  She tells me next time I am up we will have an ""in night"" where we will order in food and watch movies together which I agree to.  Anyways I walk her to her door to say good night and try to give her a kiss but right when I'm about to this fucking guy calls again.  She pulls her phone out and shows me its him again and is obviously bothered and upset.  She says she has to take it so she gives me a quick kiss goodnight, says sorry for being a ""tommy texter"" and goes inside. 

I'm not an asshole, I get this guy is obviously messed up and needs her (though I think he needs professional help) and she can't just completely abandon him forever but I just don't know what to do about this situation or what I could have done (if anything) differently.

If anyone has any advice or ideas about how I could have handled this that would be great because I don't want to lose her but that fear is always on my mind because she is living the university party life while I am at home living with my parents for another 8 months.  I know she is into me (though she plays pretty hard to get when I am with her) and I am really into her too, I feel like she is the first girl I've had really good chemistry with before.  I rarely get to see her and it bothers me that this shit happened during one of the few times she isn't working the night I am up.  Help?! 

Also sorry for the giant wall of text, writing this detailed is helping me process/vent my frustrations. Thanks :)

**EDIT:** Thank you for all your input.  I don't believe she was just using my for a free dinner, I actually had to wrestle the bill away from her to pay.  But you are all right, I put up with some real bullshit and I didn't deserve that.  The next time I go out with her (as I said before, we did set another meetup at her suggestion), I will tell her if she pulls the same shit again I will leave."

Hey Reddit 

The following post is from the Go Fund Me Page I've created. This has been a dream of mine ever since I could imagine. I need to raise a crazy $5000 to follow this dream.

&gt;Twenty-one years ago, my mother made a choice that would change my family’s life forever. She got on a plane with my dad, brother and sister and brought them here from Israel. They landed in Montreal, where they lived in a shelter for the next 6 months without a single pot or pan. My mom knew no other life than working nights at a warehouse while my father was out of the picture. Everyday she would come home exhausted and somehow work up the energy to cook us dinner and tuck us into bed. Between making sure we were clothed, fed and regularly attended school, sending us to after school programs and Russian school she had never showed any sign of defeat. She is the strongest most influential person in my life. Because of her efforts I am graduating college in April. I am working hard and I’m proud to say that my dedication, work ethic and ambition come from her example and her strength. She has taught me the importance of understanding that anything you want in life you can achieve and that it is okay to ask for help when you need it. 
&gt;
&gt;Needless to say I am asking for your help
&gt;
&gt;Israel, where my relatives live, where the beauty of this country takes my breath away and leaves me wondering how can I find my way back. I have applied to a program called Israel By Design that is allowing me to Intern in the field of my choice, volunteer and to help strengthen the Israeli community and ultimately discover myself and my Israeli culture. The program is a 10 month program and all the money goes towards the full program costs as well as food and housing. The program cost excluding the flight is an estimated 16000. I have by my own efforts managed to save a minimal amount through working.
&gt;
&gt;I am a student at Algonquin College, currently in the Community and Justice Services program. I am graduating this April and I am currently doing placement at second stage woman shelter for woman and their children fleeing violence here in Ottawa. I am also working evenings where I am using the money to put towards the trip as well as paying off my school debt. I have ultimately dedicated all and any spare time of mine to being able to achieve this goal. Nonetheless I am actively trying to make this dream a reality although it doesn't seem possible without your support. 
&gt;
&gt;If you have ever stayed up all night dreaming and thinking of the possibilities that can come from realizing your dreams you can surely understand that this is the direction my life is headed and I am forever grateful for your time and your support. Every dollar counts and every effort doesn't go unnoticed.

TL;DR: Donate money so I can pursue my dream of moving to Israel, reuniting with my family and following my dream career.

1vpb53,1,2014-01-20,Learn to program for iOS from a web designer standpoint and other questions,FernandoCAlves,iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1vpb53/learn_to_program_for_ios_from_a_web_designer/,"Hello!

I recently finished school as a web developer and now work as an intern for a small web development company as a web designer and programmer. My course was more design than programming focused so I only know HTML, CSS and PHP.

However, the company I work for is going to have a gander at the mobile apps and they picked me to start to develop for iOS. They'll give me time to learn the language and provide me with the necessary resources to do so.

The required programming knowledge will be somewhat simple, as most of the apps, for now, will be as complement to a new or already existing web platform. However, I don't want to stop there as I see learning to program for iOS as a way of having some fun and even fulfilling a dream of creating games and exciting apps to enhance the users life. 

I like to learn from books or videos as I can do it on my own pace and rewind if I misunderstood something. I've done some research on the subject and found a few books and other resources (mainly on this subreddit), mainly the iOS Apprentice series from Ray Wenderlich (which seemed really interesting and fun), Programming iOS7 from Matt Neuburg and Learn Objective-C Essentials from Lynda.com.

After what I found I still have some questions on the subject:

* **What is the best resource, in you opinion, to learn programming for iOS7 from scratch? Keeping in mind that I have a somehow limited budget to spend on documentation**

* **Is my prior knowledge in web development somehow useful or is programming for mobile a totally different beast?**

* **What would you say is the estimated time it takes to learn the bare minimum to produce an app where you retrieve and edit information from a web service?**

* **I currently only have a Windows machine at home and a Mac at work. Is it possible to code in Objective-C in a Microsoft machine? And is there any notable differences in optimization or performance?**

Thanks for reading
 
Cheers!"

I started at this company as an intern in 2010 during college. Was hired fulltime after college, in the fall of 2010, as technical support.  By 2011 I was still doing support, but also some junior sysadmin stuff (raid setup, server setup, website setup, database/websites transfer,).  In the beginning of 2012 the other sysadmin had left, and I was the only sysadmin left. This left me with all the afterhours/weekend call/phone/email/ticket support, and I also still provided my original technical support duties as well.

Here is my [Resume](http://imgur.com/k2iZ9Om) (I got the template from another /r/sysadminresumes post)

My one question, should I split up professional expierience?  Should I list the years that I was technical support, and then also list the years that I was junior/full sysadmin?

1vqw22,7,2014-01-21,90 Day Check in ~,thecenterurinal,NoFapChristians,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/1vqw22/90_day_check_in/,"Praise God I made it. I'm 25, have had prior successful nofap streaks, but this is the second longest ever and a huge rebound for me. I am really, really happy I found these communities because they really kept me going . Anyway, I want to share some lessons learned, life improvements, and new goals. 

**Life Improvements/Highlights**

1.  No more of that guilty weight dragging me down. I feel so much lighter everywhere I go. 
2. Increased confidence. I legitimately believe in myself more and don't get intimidated as easily, and don't care as much about what others think of me. Also, just accomplishing something so difficult and so uncommon makes other challenges seem smaller than they used to.
3. Got my dream internship for the summer, and had fantastic interviews. 
4. Went through a breakup, felt real emotions, went low for a while without fapping. This was a genuine human experience, not numbed away by fapping, and I am stronger from it.
5. I'm genuinely happier. People smile more when they see me. I smile more when I see them. There is a natural high that comes from being with friends that I now feel and did not before. 
6. Stronger desire to pursue a wife and willingness to commit. 

**Lessons Learned**

1.  Balance ""nofap"" with ""yes healthy spirit."" I fap because I get discouraged, frustrated, impatient, and stressed and medicate through fapping. We all have brokennes we medicate with fapping and other things and need to not just stop fapping but fix whatever is wrong.  For me, meditating on scripture and praying on behalf of others helped to purify my thoughts and mindset and reset some thought patterns. For you it may be different, but find out what's spiritually out of wack and find a way to replace the negative with positive.
2. Keep upping the ante. Early on I was willing to edge/fantisize but realized that would sabotage my efforts, so I adjusted my goals to month 1 - no masturbating/porn; month 2 - no edging/touching myself; month 3 - no fantasizing. Again, step 1 of purifying my mind was the key to all of these. It all starts in your mind and your spirit so find some way to clean those out. You don't ever want to get complacent.

 &gt; Matthew 12 “Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.... A good man produces good things from his storeroom of good, and an evil man produces evil things from his storeroom of evil.""
3. Stay plugged into these communities. Many time I wanted to relapse from my usual triggers but was so strengthened by knowing how many others were running this race. It was also so encouraging to see so many stories of people consistently agreeing about the bad effects of PMO and counteracting the lies we trick ourselves into believing, and extolling the benefits of nofap. 
4. Having a counter/tracking system is super helpful. I made a chains.cc account which I highly recommend. Looking at that thing every day is such a good reminder. Someone else had a bowl of marbles where he transfers one into a jar every day which I think is an awesome system too. 

**New Goals**

1. Apply myself to all my work. I procrastinate, do so-so work just to get it done, and am not nearly at my potential. This needs to end; I have real goals in life that I can accomplish and I need to be able to wake up in the morning and work hard to get them. 
2. Stay organized. Keep my house, car, notebooks, computer clean and organized. Maintain a todo list and keep my gcal updated. 
3. Get physically in shape. A huge lesson I learned was that physical exercises strengthens the spirit and helps so much with everything, including nofap. Flexing your willpower to deny the body it's comfort and rest when it's begging you for it makes you so much stronger. I used to competitively swim and plan on getting back in the pool and pushing myself, not just to get in shape physically, but to strengthen my warrior spirit. 

Keep on fapstronauts. This is only the beginning. To close, here is probably my favorite passage in the bible and one of the key parts of my strategy. 

&gt; **Psalm 1**

&gt; Blessed is the man
&gt;     who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
&gt; nor stands in the way of sinners,
&gt;     nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
&gt; but his delight is in the law of the Lord,
&gt;     and on his law he meditates day and night.
&gt; He is like a tree
&gt;     planted by streams of water
&gt; that yields its fruit in its season,
&gt;     and its leaf does not wither.
&gt; In all that he does, he prospers.

We are a couple of 22 year old's from Brazil who have been wanting to go to Vegas together for ages (I have had the privelege of going last year).
This is a personal trip (going together is a dream come true for both of us) and, as such, we are planning on making the trip as economic as possible: we don't want our parents to pay for any part of the trip, she makes little money for now and I am only an intern earning a little per month.
The hardest part is getting money for the flights, which we already have. With almost an entire year ahead of us, we should have enough money to go on a great, reasonably priced trip!

In order to save as much money as possible, we are planning on staying at a cheaper hotel on the Strip, such as the Luxor or the Flamingo. However, her dream was always to stay at the Bellagio.

Naturally, the Bellagio is a little out of our league for this trip. But I was planning on giving her a present. Coincidentally, her birthday is on December 20th, during which we will be in Vegas if all goes according to plan.
I would like to book a room at the Bellagio for one night to have a romantic evening with a great in-room dinner, or something along those lines. Would it be possible? Do hotels in Vegas rent rooms for one night only?

Thank you for your time in reading this and for your answers!"
1vrjuy,2,2014-01-21,I want to learn...How to program the arduino,Lord_ranger,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1vrjuy/i_want_to_learnhow_to_program_the_arduino/,"Hi yall!

So i've had an arduino for a couple years now and never really did anything with it. But i recently got a job/internship with a company to work on a project using one. Part of the internship is learning the arduino, I only work two half days a week because of time constraints with school. But i would like to take some time at home to learn more about the programming so i can advance faster. 

What are my best bets for doing this? I want something that is really going to teach me to code, not like take this code, edit this type of thing. I want to be able to write a program from scratch. Currently at work i am working through the arduino getting started book by the arduino people. Really good book but i would like to fill it in with more programming stuff.

Just as a background i do not know any other languages extensively, i know a little HTML a little CSS and a little C++ for the arduino but can not actually write anything.


Thanks yall!"

1vs3s0,1,2014-01-21,Is Chicago right for me??? (Am I right for Chicago?),Martian-Sundays,chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1vs3s0/is_chicago_right_for_me_am_i_right_for_chicago/,"I've always waned to live in a city with:

Four Seasons - 

* Dunno what Summer in Chicago is like normally but the few days I was there last, the weather was absolutely gorgeous. I've often heard people complain about it being incredibly humid (which I can admit, it was *a little*), but I grew up in the south, went to college in Florida, and spent my summers interning in Washington DC (which was built on a swamp and really suffers from urban heat island effect). That being said, the humidity mid westerners refer to (in Chicago and St. Louis) doesn't bother me one bit. I *think* I would gladly put up with your ""treacherous"" winters if it meant being rewarded with such wonderful weather in the summer to relax by the lake.
  
A Reliable Mass Transit Network, providing an option to live car free -

* We really don't have that here in NC, sadly. 

**Lots** of culture (art, theaters, museums, diversity) - 

* Living/working in DC/Maryland exposed me to some of the finer things in life and really interesting people. Problem with living in Raleigh, NC is you run out of things to do quickly which can result in many folks becoming homebodies after a while.

A visible lgbt community - 

* I'm not really into ""the scene"" but it would be nice to know there is a decent sized gay community present.

Wonderful people - 

* Folks in DC can be a bit guarded at times and in some cases only give you the time of day if you are a potential networking opportunity. I was amazed with how friendly most Chicagoans were. From the minute I arrived to the second I left, I encountered some very nice people (and I wasn't robbed once!)

Relative Safety - 

* Not to say there isn't any crime in Chicago and there aren't any areas that may be questionable, I think the media may be making your city appear more dangerous than it really is. I want to assume crime can't be any worse in Chicago than it is in DC or Baltimore. I never once had a problem being in either of those places. Also, I've read that Atlanta has a **much** higher crime rate than Chicago.

**About me**

I've only been to Chicago twice in my life, once when I was 10 to attend my aunt's graduation from Northwestern, and again two summers ago for my 24th birthday/to tell the graduate school I had gotten into that I would have to defer my enrollment. Given I was only there for about 4.5 days, your city left an great impression on me and I've wanted to return ever since. 

I was once planning to attend the Illinois Institute of Technology to earn my masters in Landscape Architecture, but three years at a private university while trying to live in a city like Chicago would have sent me spiraling in debt if I had to rely on loans to fund a great portion of my education/living expenses. 

When my internship in St. Louis finished and there was no prospect of a full time job, I moved home to North Carolina with the plan in mind to find a way to fund my education at IIT. After a month of being home in NC, bored out of my mind, I decided to go take a tour of NC State University's Landscape Architecture program for funsies. Next thing I knew I was being interviewed by the dept. chair and program director, and soon encouraged to apply for spring enrollment (which is saying a lot considering they normally don't take spring admits). Long story short, I was given an offer I would be mad to refuse, and am currently in my second year with 1.5(ish)yrs to go. 

Don't get me wrong, NC is a wonderful place to grow up and will always be home, but Chicago has Raleigh/Durham beat in many areas. Sometimes I wonder how life would have been had I said screw fiscal responsibility and taken out a mountain of loans required to sustain a graduate school career in Chicago.

If I am lucky, I will spend my final year in grad school abroad in London working toward a second masters in Urban Design (which is an entirely different post in [r/AskUK](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1uqu70/would_london_be_the_best_place_for_an_american_to/) ). I'm hoping when my education is all said and done, my two postgraduate degrees and federal work experience will make me more marketable in the Chicago job market. 

I apologize for the incredibly long post, but I'd greatly appreciate any feedback/input on the matter. Thanks for reading! :]"

1vs98j,3,2014-01-21,"Me [25 M] with my GF [19 F] one year, she didn't treat me well, right? Or is it my brain telling me?",quasiuomo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1vs98j/me_25_m_with_my_gf_19_f_one_year_she_didnt_treat/,"We dated for a year. She would always bring up marriage. Sometimes jokingly, sometimes not. I told her not until I get into graduate school at least. 

Before the end of the relationship, we'd talk every night on the phone. We had the same sense of humor. Very dark, and we made fun of stuff together quite often. We saw each other probably 4 times a week. Had sex about 3 times a week. She was a first year university student majoring in English. We met on okay cupid. 

The beginning was nice. I hadn't had someone I could talk to like that in such a while and I felt something good was going to come of this early on. I worked a night shift job, and she would call me and we would talk til fairly late. 


We'd fight every so often about small things, but we were both stubborn and defensive so they could escalate into larger fights. They worked out though. I'd take her out for dinner to lots of different places. I'd take her to get tea. Movies, art gallery, and concerts. In spring we loved to sit in the grass outside. 

I went to Germany for an internship for 3 months. I wasn't sure if she wanted to wait for me. She said she would, but when I got there she got very sad, and blamed her sadness on me for leaving. She actually did a lot of blaming me for her shit. On my birthday she came out with her friends and met me with my friends. She doesn't like to socialize very much, so she sat in a corner with her friends. I would sit with them for a while, then see other friends, but always coming back to her. I asked if she wanted to walk with me, but she said no, that she was leaving because I didn't pay enough attention to her. We fought in front of a bunch of people outside. I got her to stay.

This type of thing happened a lot. Quite often when I would decide on a place to go with her to, she would say no, but offer no alternative. So I would come up with another, but no. So I would tell her how that was frustrating, but no, I'm wrong. Quite often she would get into my car and be passive aggressive, but when I returned the favor she would get offended and tell me to take her home. So I would, but then once we got to her place she would yell at me and say ""Why are you driving me home!?""

I know it's easy to say that she's young and she still doesn't know what she wants, but I just don't know why she kept me around for so long then? I ended up breaking up with her because it just seemed like nothing was good enough for her. She said that that's just how I perceive it, but I feel like the evidence was really there. I mean, I do have depression (diagnosed), but I always tried really hard with her. 

I'm battling now with sticking to my guns and really believing that nothing was good enough for her, and she wouldn't treat me right. Or, thinking that it was all in my head that I believed I wasn't good enough. 

New years eve she just got back from CUba. She had a shitty trip, flight there got fucked up, then she found out her apartment here flooded. I wanted to take her to a nice dinner and then out later to party or w.e. I looked up this place on Yelp that got 85%. We get there and she started telling me how she hates everything. She didn't look pleased to be back, which I understood. And I listened, and took her side with all she was saying. But once we got the food it was disgusting. She said why did you take me here? - How was I to know? Then more food came and it was bad, and each time something new came her mood got significantly worse in the sense that she went from brooding to taking it all out on me. She said she wanted to have fun tonight and that I ruined it, she said she didn't want to even go out later and that I ruined it. In a last efforts of trying to salvage the night, there was a helium balloon in reach beside our table. Earlier on in the night she was playing with it and commented on helium or something. When I paid for the meal, we got up, and I grabbed the balloon. I thought, I am going to take this for you to make up for such a shitty meal. They owe this to me. But she got embarrassed and told me to put it back. I didn't, and walked out with it. She yelled at me for it. 

I took her home, and told her to get out and not call me tomorrow. She asked why so I yelled at her. I went out with my friends and the next morning she called to ask me to apologize because I hurt her when I yelled at her. I'd have enough of the hypocrisy at that point so I said let's go on a break. 

She was in a panic so she got defensive and said fine, but I'm going to pick up my guinea pig today (her guinea pig stayed with me while she was in Cuba). So I said that I could pick her up on the way home. She said no. I drove home, and as soon as I got home she told me to bring it to her. She called me names, and I did too I guess. So I'm packing up the cage, and she calls me to tell me not to forget this, and that. Then she calls me another 10 times to tell me that no, she didn't think she could bring him. So I said that I would pick her up so she can see him at my house at least.

I picked her up, she got in and hated me. I played music to lighten to mood. We went to get her guinea pig food, and I did still love her so there was a joking/flirting way to what was happening. But she was mad at me still. She came over and started to play with her guinea pig, I was still mad at all the hypocrisy too, so I went into the other room. She followed me with the guinea pig cause I think she wanted to still try, I was open to that. She put the guinea pig on my head and I laughed, but then she started making fun of me. So I left the room again. She followed again and laid beside me. she got on top of me and put a pillow on my face and jokingly tried to suffocate me. She used a lot of might, and I could see that perhaps there was a little bit of seriousness to her. She pressed even harder, and I was getting mad, so I threw her off of me and left the room. 

She followed but told me to take her home. We talked briefly about how I just wanted her to be nicer. And she said that she is who she is and that's it. She said it's me who perceives things the way I do. I told her I was patient with her, and she thought that was patronizing. Anytime in the past that I would bring up an issue or point out her hypocrisy she would think that I was calling her insane. I got sad driving her home, and said that everyone has stuff they have to work on, I have my own depression, so why can't you work on this if it's hurting me? She just kept saying that's how I perceive it and said there's nothing left to talk about. I cried, and she said goodbye.

The other week she called me and immediately started yelling at me because I couldn't hear her, yet she was whispering so her parents wouldnt hear her. She said she didn't know if she was trying too hard or not hard enough. Then I said I don't know, it sucks right now. Then she started to cry and told me about the guy she just slept with while we were broken up. I said I don't want to hear it and hung up. I was very upset that she told me this. Later on I sent her a msg saying that she didn't know how to deal with her stress, and that she takes it out on whoever's there. It's only when she does something she regrets does she feel bad about it. She replied with I'm sorry for hurting you, I'm only 19. I've always wanted to grow up. I hope you find someone better. That broke me :( it meant she was over it, and it's done. 

It's tough these days, I don't know how to deal with loss very well. I blame myself for shit when I know I shouldn't. I just wished things woulda been this way, or that way. Anyways, this venting has helped me for today. So thank you.




---   
**tl;dr**: 19 year old gf treated me with hypocrisy, and I broke it off. I have depression, and am trying really hard not to blame myself. I wished things would have gone a different way with her because I love her so much.

1vsgmu,1,2014-01-21,[27/m] GF [24/f] of ~6mos is struggling to get over her EX,mightbetime,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1vsgmu/27m_gf_24f_of_6mos_is_struggling_to_get_over_her/,"Hi everyone, I'm in a bit of a rough patch at the moment and wanted some feedback.

I met this girl, D, over the summer. We had met about 6 months prior one weekend and really hit it off, but we live in different countries and she was dating someone at the time so nothing really happened. Last summer she got an internship near where I live and we started hanging out. Long story short we really hit it off, like whoa. I've never clicked with someone like this, I've never felt like I do when I'm around her. Wow, and she reciprocates these feelings!  

She was still dating her BF from back home when she came down. After 2 months down here, hanging out with me semi-regularly, she ended the relationship with her BF of ~3 years to be with me for the remainder of her time in the states. We had an amazingawesomestupendous month together. During that time I was really pushing for a relationship, shushing my inner dialogue that maybe she needed some time to heal and get over her ex before moving on to a new relationship. But I kept pushing, and she reluctantly obliged.

I was feeling really insecure at the time, I really wanted to be with her. I had played the ""kind of dating but not"" game before and ended up getting burned, so I really didn't want to go down that path again. I was willing to go into a LDR with her (something I vowed never to do) because she was so amazing, and I had never clicked with anyone like I do with her. 

Now, 6 months later (like no one saw this coming) she is really struggling with getting over her EX. I really, truly, love her, I feel comfortable saying that even after 6 mos. I don't know if this is going to ruin our relationship, or if she is going to try and go back to him, but it's definitely putting some stress on us. I had been single for ~4 years before this relationship, so we are coming from two opposite ends of the spectrum. And we're in different places emotionally. 

Overall it really sucks knowing the person you love is sometimes regretting their decision to be with you, and that they are still deeply in love with someone else. I don't know how she managed to fall in love with me while still having feelings for him. It probably had something to do with her being in a new exciting place with him not there. 

She has been really honest with me throughout all of this, and I really appreciate that. I try my best to let her know that what she's feeling is normal and that it takes time to get over someone you truly loved. I really don't know what to do. She mentioned breaking up the other day, and getting back together until she is in a better place. I don't want that, but at the same time I don't want to force her into this, as I've already learned that lesson. I feel like she would try to go back to her BF, I really don't want to hold her back if she truly feels that way. I think we have something really special. I want to preserve it and let it grow. 

I really don't know what to do, or how I'm supposed to feel. I really regret not being more secure and confident and just waiting to get into a relationship with her. 

tldr: meet girl, amazing connection, really hit it off, she breaks up with bf, i push a relationship on her, LDR commences, she's still struggling 6 mo's later. "

1vskt9,5,2014-01-21,"Reflecting over the past year, need your thoughts.",TheVagabondIntrovert,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1vskt9/reflecting_over_the_past_year_need_your_thoughts/,"Where do I even begin. So many thoughts and feeling that I want to express, that I feel like a jammed typewriter. I am writing this to you, because I want your feedback on my situation and conclusion. 

I am an introvert. Many of you know how this rises certain challenges, and very typically I deal with problems internally to reach my conclusions. Also, dealing with bigger changes takes time, and this last year have been one big change after another. It all culminated last Sunday evening with an intervention type thing, with me as the center of attention. I generally don’t like to be the center of anything.

To start at the beginning, I graduated with a bachelor degree in January 2013, 29 years old. This has been extremely important to my self esteem, since I now see my self an adult, that actually are able to accomplish things in life. It has not been fun to see the few friends I have, get their degrees, jobs and salaries years before me. But finally I made it through my education. At the time I was sharing my apartment with my friend, who had mid December announced that he would be moving out in January. While it was a short notice, I knew he had been searching for jobs in Norway, and I understood his situation. We made an arrangement where he would pay some additional rent, till I could find a new place to live. I have shared that apartment with different friends and a girlfriend at on time, for the past eight years, so it seemed to be a natural point in life start looking for something new.

The housing situation being what it is in Denmark, it is quite a challenge to find something cheap and relatively close to the city. So when my agreement with my friend came to an end, I had to move the little furniture I had to my dad's basement, and sleep on his couch. Being unemployed in Denmark gives you the right to six week of optional education to up your chances of employment. So while cleaning out my home, and moving it to my dads, I was following a six week course and trying to find a new place to live and perhaps find a job. A big spoon full for an introvert, who prefer one thing at a time.

After a month on my dad's couch, I found a collective household consisting of seven people in their mid to late twenties. I might seem counter intuitive for an introvert to want to live in a collective with seven people, but unable to find a job, I wanted to become self-employed as a motion graphic designer, and therefore work alone most of the time. Besides I have lived with others for the past eight years, so the thought wasn’t uncanny to me. Doing the initial interview with the collective household, I made sure to explain my goals in life and of course my personality. So when they called me, and asked if I wanted to move in, I gladly accepted.

I started moving in just as I was finishing my six week course in May 2013. So I could now scratch that of my list. But soon after completing the course, I was sent to a four week obligatory course in job searching and resume writing for unemployed. Already decided to try my luck as self-employed, this was a bit annoying, but I had no choice than to soldier on. At the end of the course I was presented with an opportunity, for an unpaid two month internship, and since my plans for self-employment was already on hold, I thought I might as well use the summer to get some connections in the industry before going solo.

This internship did not go well. First of, I felt cheated and used. Instead of applying my knowledge and skills, I catered others and parked cars. To make matters worse, I was manage by a younger inexperienced project manager, and we did not see eye to eye at all. I was furious, felt cheated, used, that I had put my plans on hold. This did not translate well to my new situation in the collective.

A month after I had moved in to the collective, a new girl had moved in. This girl is so much better at navigating in social circumstances than I. Her social skill really illuminates the lack of my own. Over the course of fall, it steadily went downhill. I was trapped in an evil circle, the less I interacted socially with the others, the harder it got be social. 

Unintentionally I had shielded my self from the collective to process the last months events, which made it harder by the minute to establish myself in the already existing group dynamic within the collective.

So what is the worst good thing that can happen in a situation like this? You get your dream job.

Forget about self-employment, in November I was offered a position where I can do what I love must. Anyone who starts in a new job, wants to do the best and prove they are worth keeping. This is bad news for my social situation in the collective. I need to recharge when I get home from work, and the situation being what it is. Well, it is not good. I had become the bad vibe of the collective, I could feel it.

Being a levelheaded introvert I remained calm, and carried on. We all have our ups and downs. This can be explained. It is all a misunderstanding. Sunday evening it all came crashing down at our monthly house meeting.

I found myself in an introverts worst nightmare. An hour before dinner and the following house meeting, I was told that my situation in the collective would be discussed, no further information were given. The girl who delivered the news denied answering my questions at the time being. How bad was it? Did they all feel the same way? Would I be asked to move? Should I try to explain and risking being perceived as defensive? Should I show my face at dinner? How had it all come to this? Why hasn’t any said anything or asked me how I felt?

I sat in utter silence at dinner, poking my food around, avoiding eye contact. After dinner followed an hour long discussion of various topics, before we finally arrived at the last topic. Me. I was basically told that it wasn’t working out. Each one got to tell me how they felt about me, mostly it regarded projects around the apartment I had volenteered for and neglected, like hang a shelf or buying a movie projector, we didn't discuss daily chores or cleaning. I let them each of them finish their thoughts, then I summarized what they had said in my own words to make sure I had understood them. I didn’t try to explain myself, but answered the best I could when questioned. The girl who had informed me of the meeting, had an especially hard rhetoric, and told me straight up, ‘I don’t want to live here with you anymore’.

In the end I was given mission impossible for introverts. Become social as of tomorrow, or move out.

In one year, I have finished my education, move to my dad’s, taken two courses, tried to become self-employed, found a new place to live, done an internship, and landed my dream job. And I am the guy who wants a quiet simple life. My head has been spinning around since Sunday, trying to think my way out of this situation.This post is a testimony of my thoughts and the conclusion I have reached. I will try my best to be outgoing and social in the collective, while on the other hand try to find a new place to live as fast as possible.

Not all in the collective see me as a lost cause. But I have really been confronted with my less than average social level. I am confident enough to know that the points of critique isn’t minded on me the person, be on me the situation.

I might have embarked upon more than I can handle, but I am proud of myself and my accomplishments. I have been hesitant, maybe anxious, to live on my own because of the little social need I have. I am basically afraid I will become socially isolated if I choose to live alone. I would very much like to hear your thoughts.

This have been therapeutic to write. Thank you for reading.

TL;DR
As an introvert, I reflect over the past turbulent year, that has led me to negative housing situation, where I have been asked to become more social or move out.

1vsnxp,2,2014-01-21,Feeling Kinda Lonely/Disappointed,dat_throwaway25,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/1vsnxp/feeling_kinda_lonelydisappointed/,"Like the title says, I've been feeling a little sad lately. This isn't the first time I've posted on here (though with a different throwaway account I can no longer remember), but I can say things are at least a bit better than they used to be. Basically, my dilemma was (and still is) that I'm at this college and I don't really have any friends. 

Everything else in my life is fine-ish. I'm doing okay in my classes, I finally settled on a pair of majors (economics and computer information systems), and I think I should have some fairly good internship opportunities this summer. But what I really would love is to just have a group of people I could hang out with so that I'm not alone all the time. The problem is, I'm not sure that's really possible at this point.

My interests are pretty typical nerd stuff: video games, anime, etc. I attend a small college in a small Midwest city, and I honestly just haven't been able to find a group of people with similar interests to me that I could hang out with. I have several acquaintances who I talk to, but we just don't have anything in common. I'm a Junior, so I really think if there were anybody here that I would really click with I would have already met them. At this point I'm more or less resigned to the fact that there's not really any chance of me finding a group of friends here. I'm close enough to graduation now that transferring schools isn't really an option, so... yeah, I'm basically out of luck I guess.

So yeah, that's pretty much it. For the record, I'm not like some super socially awkward guy, and I get along with people very well, so that's not my issue. But I'm just really bummed out that I'm probably destined to continue being lonely for at least the next year and a half. Every time I read about someone else's positive college experiences, I just get even more depressed and filled with regret (""If only I'd gone to this other college, I might have actually had  *fun* college experience""), and it totally ruins my day. At this point I'm just desperately hoping that maybe, if I'm lucky, I'll make some friends at whatever my first job out of college is, because I don't want to be like this for the rest of my life. I don't know what I'm really asking for here, but...uh, IDK, does anybody have anything to make me feel less sad?

**TL;DR**: I'm all lonely and friendless and stuff, not much I can do about it, sadness ensues. "

1vsz3w,4,2014-01-21,A Walk with Lucy,PigBeanis,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1vsz3w/a_walk_with_lucy/,"Background: I am a sophomore in college studying engineering. I have taken acid a few times before but I wanted to take a trip that I could document so that I could write this up for anyone who has never experienced LSD before or has and wants to read a good trip report. Anyways I decide on Monday afternoon of MLK day to take an introspective trip in which I can maybe ponder some of the decisions I have coming up in life. The tabs that I have are from a reputable online vendor who claims the dose of each tab is 140 µg. I had already tripped on two of these tabs before but this time wanted to try three to get an even more intense experience. Anything in quotations I will write as my voice in my head so that you can get a glimpse as to some of the crazy shit going on up there.

T –1:00: During my previous trips, I have always experienced what seems like an abnormal amount of muscle tension and anxiety so I took a multivitamin with a magnesium supplement which I’ve read is supposed to help. I eat a big brunch because I know that I’m not going to be putting anything except for LSD in my mouth for the next several hours.

T: I drop three tabs at 12:45 pm and put on a funny TV show called “The Birthday Boys” (starring Bob Odenkirk, you should watch it). First episode lasts 25 minutes and is pretty funny. Afterwards I go outside to smoke a cig. American Spirit menthols are my favorite.

T +0:30: Mood is lifting very quickly. Shit is getting a lot funnier. I go to take a piss and find myself laughing at the urinal. “What? Stop smiling. That shit’s not funny. Yes it is. Ahh, LSD.” Time to kickstart this trip off right and smoke a bowl.

T +0:45: I packed a bowl into my gravity bong and ripped it til it was gone. “Fuck, I’m high as shit…this is about to be intense.” Commence laughter. I throw the TV show back on.

T +1:00: As I’m watching the next 20 minute episode, I realize halfway through that I can see a border around every character. It almost looks like when you see one of those 3D pictures with the red and blue when you’re not wearing the glasses. At this point, I look around the room and notice the beginnings of the texture breathing. If anyone doesn’t know what this looks like, check out this video for the most accurate representation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d25xlIg5EV8. “Here comes the visuals…”

T +1:15: The show ends and I’m blasting off into space. My roommate who also has experience with acid tells me to put some music on. “Holy shit yes…I need music right now.” I throw on some chopped and screwed music that my friend showed me the first time we were tripping. I even downloaded a music visualizer called G-Force which is a plugin for winamp. “Damn, this music feels so good right now. It feels like it’s a part of who I am.” The visualizer helps no doubt. You get lost in the mind consuming patterns and shifting. It puts you in a trance. An amazing one at that.

T +2:00: I finally tear my eyes away from the screen and decide, “It’s a nice ass day outside, I’m gonna go for a walk.” So I grab my ipod and head outside with my cigs. I begin walking down the sidewalk with no destination in mind. It felt as if everyone I passed was thinking “This kids on drugs.” “I’m not acting all that strange I think…I hope. Fuck it. There’s the park, let’s chill there for a bit.” I’m still definitely coming up at this point and everywhere I looked I could see moving borders. On the streets, the cars, the trees. Being winter, most of the trees are dead but all of the dead branches had fractals in them. It was amazing. At a crosswalk I even caught myself in a trance watching the cars whiz past. Anyways I finally sit down at the park and gaze across into the city. It’s beautiful. The colors are so vibrant, everywhere is full of so much life. “Life is amazing,” I thought to myself. After about 10 minutes at the park, I felt weird that I was there by myself so I start walking back. I almost got run over by a few cars on the way back to my room, which scared the shit out of me and started bringing on some bad vibes. “Just get back to the room, we’ll be fine. We've done this before.” I actually hadn't. Never been walking out in public while tripping at least. Finally safety. “Feels good man.”

T +3:00: “Well now I’m exhausted from that adventure, time to chill again.” I lay down in my bed with some high quality headphones and put on the Pretty Lights album A Color Map of the Sun. If anyone has not experienced this album yet, please do yourself a favor and buy/download/torrent/youtube/dowhateveryouhavetodo to listen to it. It is fucking incredible. As the album plays, I stare at the ceiling. Fractals everywhere. The walls shift and move to the beat of the music and I am in a state of utter bliss. It feels like the point right before orgasming, but it never ends. My whole body is weak from the euphoria. One thing that I find interesting is that although I feel so comfortable and happy, I almost feel as if I’m in a perpetual state of dissatisfaction because I know that I could be a little bit more comfortable. It’s a weird concept and I don’t really know how to explain it well. As I’m lying there I start to think about shit. “Am I really still coming up?  Why did I even drop acid today? My friends probably think I’m such a druggie. Will this trip ever end or will I be stuck in a state of confusion for the rest of eternity?…No, no, no you’re approaching this all wrong. You made this decision consciously. We’re going to get through this trip because its already happening and the only thing you can do now is enjoy the ride. Okay, I think I've got this.” I’m pretty sure I might have this conversation with myself at least once every time I drop acid. I take some time to ponder the next big things coming up in my life. Getting an internship, getting a girlfriend, getting a job, graduating school, keeping up with my family. These are all things that matter to me a lot and you can be damn sure that when you are tripping, you will think about this kind of shit. Overall, I felt pretty confident with where I was going in life and who I am becoming.

T +4:00: Time to smoke another bowl. As I’m sitting on my floor smoking, I look at the wooden door in front of me. The wood grains have aligned to form a totem pole with tribal faces on it. “That’s awesome,” I thought as I took another hit.

T +5:00: I go over to my friends’ room to see what they’re up to and find them playing Minecraft. Nice. I try to watch them play for a bit but found myself staring more at the walls and ceilings than their computer screens. I decide that I wanted to try to play as well. Not exactly the best idea though, because I have played very little before and still don’t really know how to play. If you have never tripped before, trying to figure shit out while tripping is almost impossible. My train of thought seems to last for about 2 seconds. I’ll be like, “I just remembered I need to, wait what?” Anyways I stumble around for a little while and found the coolest thing to do was just make channels to move water down. I quit playing after a little bit because I kept dying and instead switched to some ps4. I popped in some AC4. I muted the game volume and put on a Shpongle album. “This is gonna be sick.” I rode around in my ship, blowing up massive man-o-wars and frigates. It was so much fun. I felt like I was part of the game. I was the captain of a ship and I could feel the energy of the sea.

T +7:00: At this point during my trip, I would say that I was finally coming down. I was definitely still seeing open eye visuals but my hands weren't physically shaking anymore and I felt a lot more relaxed. I decided to pull out my drawing that I have been working on since my last acid trip about some of the things I experienced then. So I pull it out and start smiling again thinking about my own creativity. It feels good to be able to express yourself on a piece of paper. So of course I put some music on (more Pretty Lights) and got to work. As soon as I did, I could tell that I was in for a treat. This was by far the most profound part of my trip. As I’m drawing, I can feel the energy of the LSD moving my hand. I’m not even kidding. Usually when I’m drawing, I take some time to visualize what I’m going to draw and then begin sketching, but not this time. My brain just knew exactly what it wanted and told my hand to do so without any hesitation. I couldn't even believe it as it was happening. My entire body was pulsing and I was so happy that I was laughing…by myself…while drawing. I can definitely see how artists would use something like this as a tool for creativity. Anyways, if you want to see the drawing here is an incomplete version. I've got a bit of detail and things to add. http://imgur.com/CeSUaOE

T +9:00: I smoke one more bowl. Its truly incredible how the psychoactive properties of weed potentiate the effects of the LSD. By this point my visuals had pretty much ceased but the weed brought them back again. I sat in my bed and watched an episode of How the Universe Works because I wanted to look at cool space shit. I was exhausted from a long day of tripping though and decided to call it a night.

T +10:00: Its weird trying to sleep after tripping. The LSD has a stimulating effect that makes it difficult to just pass out without a heavy dose of weed or some benzos. You just kind of lay there with your eyes closed, half conscious, half unconscious. And you think until you finally end up passing out.

Follow Up: The next morning I woke up refreshed and ready to begin a new day. Overall the trip was a 9/10 only because I was tripping alone instead of with other people. I think I learned a good amount about what I need to focus on in life during my trip. Next time I dose, I will definitely be sitting down with a blank canvas to see what unfolds from my brain. LSD is a helluva drug but it’s a lot of fun if everything work out. Hope you enjoyed reading, and happy tripping."
1vt546,5,2014-01-21,Questions about job hunting (BSW),jazzyofoz,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/1vt546/questions_about_job_hunting_bsw/,"Hi everyone! I am a recent graduate and I have been job hunting on and off for nearly six months. My interests are macro level, and I was fortunate enough to get an internship organizing with a labor union that lasted four months, so job hunting took a back seat.

1. Even if I wasn't working with any social workers, can I put my internship on a resume? The internship involved me meeting with workers daily for one on ones and also a fair bit of advocacy. However, I am worried that having a labor union on my resume will turn off prospective employers. 

2. I see a lot of jobs in my area are reposted. Is it worth it to reapply? 

3. I am applying for jobs like ""intake specialists"", ""mental health technician"", and other ""support"" positions but I don't hear anything back. I am adjusting my resume for each position and writing a new cover letter and I still don't hear anything. I know they're many in my position. So, I am considering graduate school (MSW). Graduate school was always my plan, but I wanted to wait until I had a few years experience in the field. I've decided, however, to go in the Fall due to my poor job prospects. I've submitted a few applications (Univ of Chicago, working on Howard University and FAMU). However, I am worried that I will be in the same position that I am now- little experience (I have my field placement and 3 months volunteering at an agency) and little job prospects. Is there any way to avoid this scenario? 

I appreciate getting feedback from my colleagues with experience. I have been stressed out these past two months and I am trying to get back on the horse."

Apparently I failed.

After the entire ordeal, he told me he would research this on his own, and that it seems a bit sketchy as of now, but for the entire 15 minutes or so of explaining I don't really think I got anywhere with him. After every minute or so of explanations on the blockchain, addresses, mining, etc. he would interrupt saying ""*soooooo*.... its a scam, right?"". For some reason he could not grasps that it is decentralized, you don't buy coins from a centralized vendor you ""mine"" them through proof-of-work, they are a currency, and the list goes on and on. 

In simple terms, using simple analogies, how can I explain to him how it works? I'd like to inform him properly before he screws himself over, but I'm just not sure where to go from here.

I am still work on my bachelors in CS and will be working on my masters after that. Since we have been dating I have held multiple prestigious internships and been a TA while going to school. When we first started dating he was unemployed but a working on his masters degree in international studies (bs in history). It has been a year since he graduated and he has been a waiter the entire time. He gets by but lives in a crappy apartment (with four guys who just smoke weed all day and have dead end jobs; they constantly lose their heating or water) and drives a busted up car. This is fine, he came from a very poor background and was on his own since 16. However, although he says he wants to change things, he doesnt seem to be doing enough.


He has stopped working out, has a video game habit of 20-25 hours a week, and stays up until morning then sleeps late. He says he really hates his situation but he is too comfortable to have the motivation to change. He says if we werent dating he would just move back abroad (he worked there in between bachelors and masters) and work (...as if moving abroad would magically solve his employment issues).


Whenever I seem worried about his future, he says not to worry about it and that it will all work out.  His latest plan is to go back to school (law school) for the next three years and thinks he will surely get a job after that. He has made little effort to study for his LSAT and I am worried about him accumulating even more debt (i will graduate with none even after my  masters, he already has at least 30k). If he doesnt get into law school, I think he will do something drastic like go into the military or go abroad and get a mediocre job.

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend seems to be losing a lot of ambition and its a huge turnoff now and for a possible future with him. I feel like I have my shit together more than him and I am so young. How do I motivate him to get off his ass without giving him an ultimatum?"

1vtuln,3,2014-01-22,"Me [24 M] with my brother [29 M] and sister-in-law[34], not sure what to do.",pHoX622,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1vtuln/me_24_m_with_my_brother_29_m_and_sisterinlaw34/,"Where to begin? I guess it starts back when I first moved to the state my brother lives in 3 years ago. I had an offer to manage my own convenience store back home, but my brother asked, and insisted, for me to move to his location. He told me he could get me an internship at his satellite communication company and only having 2 years of college I figured I would give it a shot. Well, things fell through with that and I had to get a job at a retail location near me that's when things started to deteriorate. 

At first things were great. I hung out with my sister-in-law a bunch and my nephews, everything seemed to be going awesomely. Eventually, I got promoted at work to a sales lead(nothing special, just extra money) and wasn't able to hang out as much. Things started to get weird around then. I heard from my brother that my sister-in-law started to complain that I didn't do enough around the house, I was constantly making messes etc., and that I need to start paying rent. I was more than happy to oblige even though I had always done my own dishes, cleaned the house for her, took out the trash, and watched my nephews so they didn't have to pay the $15 an hour they were paying a sitter. I started paying rent and things seemed to go well for a little while.

The complaints started up again a couple months later. How I wasn't going anywhere with my life, I was a constant strain on them, and how much they ""helped me"". Okay.... I'm not perfect, I didn't finish school but it's not like I just left. I had thought I had a child on the way when I left and planned on joining the military. Soon after I left the girl that was ""pregnant"" broke up with me and started dating someone else. But back on topic. I actually got promoted a second time at my job and was now a floor supervisor. So I offered them a little more money just to get them off of my case. It didn't last long. Soon the rules of me living there changed, without my consent. I was no longer allowed to have my girlfriend over, and had to be in before 11 PM. I get not waking the kids, but that was never a problem. Every time I got home I was as quiet as a mouse. I would usually be up a little while longer, so I know I wasn't waking anyone.

This is where I felt like I had enough. I paid 1/3rd the rent. My brother makes more then $100k a year. I made slightly under $30k, but seeing as I'm an adult, I can deal. They had a dog that when they had the kids they ""gave"" to my mother. The dog ended up getting cancer. My mom being the huge animal lover she is decided it needed treatment. My sister-in-law told my mom they didn't have the money for it at the moment and asked my mom to pay for it. My mom then asked me for it. I'm a sucker for a dying dog for I forked over $1k in treatments for the dog, but alas it didn't make it. More on this later.

Now it's just before last Christmas and my bills are getting kind of tight. I have some missing teeth due to video games and soda(love the stuff). I asked them if they could pay the bill that I had paid for their dog. Then they start screaming. ""Mom and us had a special arrangement that it was her dog and she had to pay for it!!!"" I talked to my mom recently, this was never the case. They screamed at me a little more and  I had enough and left. I was moved out the next day without a word. Luckily, I have some pretty awesome friends.

It doesn't end there, however. After I left I kept up communications, just to be civil. So for thanksgiving, my mom, sister and other brother are coming down to stay at my oldest brother's[29m] house. This is when I find out that I'm invited.....but my girlfriend is not... Like, really? So being stubborn I just swing by said hi, smoked a cigarette and left. Then when Christmas is starts to come around again, I don't hear from them until Christmas eve. They want me to come over and help decorate the tree and blah blah. This time my girlfriend is invited. My brother tells me his wife doesn't like her though.... So again I say I have plans and just don't go.

Most recently after speaking with my brother he tells me how he can't ""trust"" me,"" and wouldn't risk finding me a job(I'm only working part-time now sadly). Now, I have kept secrets for this man, shit his wife doesn't know, shit our family doesn't know and he can't trust me? He tells me I need to go to church more, but he is far from perfect. His wife and himself have lied to me, and I KNOW she has talked shit about the rest of my family(I found an old phone). She also told my mom that they gave me a cellphone and money for a car, neither of which is true. I fear me finally saying something would make her take her kids away from my mom which I don't want to see happen(she has threatened to do this in the past), she loves her grandchildren. So what do I do!?!? 





---  
**tl;dr**: My brother and sister-in-law are lying and manipulative, and I feel it's my place to step up and tell them to cut the shit, but I fear the repercussions it will have on my mother. What do I do?

EDIT: Words."
1vtw1h,2,2014-01-22,I think I'm relapsing into depression.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1vtw1h/i_think_im_relapsing_into_depression/,"I'm a 21 year-old college guy. I study IT and have a job at the campus IT office. I rent an apartment with my girlfriend. I don't know what I'm doing or where I'm going in life. Today, it got down to 15 degrees outside while I was walking to work. I didn't even zip up my coat or put my hands in my pockets. I could tell it was cold but I just didn't care. It was like I was controlling a video game character or something.

I wake up at 8:00 AM every morning to get to campus by 9:00 AM. I probably only get about four hours of sleep a night. I try to go to bed before midnight, but I lay awake for hours just thinking about how shitty my life is going to be after I graduate. I feel like I'm carrying a rock in my chest where my heart is supposed to be, and it gets worse every night. Throughout the day, I'm a nervous wreck and can hardly talk.

I eat probably one or two meals a day. I'm poor and can't really afford much food, but even when I can I just don't even feel hungry or thirsty. I'll just get something out of the office vending machine and eat some spaghetti noodles when I'm home, and that's my day. I know this isn't a healthy lifestyle but I don't know what to do anymore. I could walk to the fridge right now and stuff my face, but why bother?

When I finally get home around 6:00 PM or so, I'm exhausted. I feel worn down to a stump. I used to be really excited about every day, but this place is eating me alive. I try to act happy around other people, but it's getting more difficult to pretend. I just want to curl up in bed, but I know that will only compound my sleep problems. Even at work now, when I don't have pressing responsibilities, instead of working on personal projects like I'm supposed to, I'll just stare at the screen or fuck around on the internet. I can't even focus on reading books anymore at home, I feel like I've lost the ability to concentrate.

I feel completely insecure about my future. I pass through my coursework with straight As and haven't really met a problem at the office I couldn't solve with a little help and/or research. But I still feel like a big fucking fraud. I get a lot of respect from my coworkers and peers that I feel is completely undeserved. I don't feel like I know shit about anything. When it comes to technical problems, when things don't work despite my best efforts and research, all I can think to do is shoot myself because it's probably something an idiot would know. Compounding this, I'll probably be graduating late because I didn't get a summer internship unlike all my other peers (it's required for my program). I don't think I'll ever find a job. I feel worthless. Everyone is telling me to join the cybersecurity team, but I don't think I could keep going for another four hours every night, staying on campus for twelve hours every day.

I dealt with depression through high school thanks to my shitty childhood and I think it's coming back. That or I'm just fucked up. I don't know. Most days, I find myself just thinking I'm a massive piece of shit and that dying would really just be a relief, I either wish I had some beer or was an unknown recluse so it wouldn't hurt anyone if I just went to sleep. I tried counseling but it didn't really help, and it got to be too expensive (nearly two hours of pay per session, plus the opportunity cost of not being at work). I just don't want to feel like this anymore, you know? I want to get excited again, hone my skills, work on interesting projects, read interesting books, feel like I have a future. I just feel so trapped."

This program is calles “Duales Studium” and so you have a block of 3 months in which you study and 3 months you work in the company. I did 4 of these internships in SAP projects (2 PMO, 1 Predictive Analytics, 1 Development). After my graduation in October I want to start in the SAP consulting. Now I’m wondering which module I should choose. Functional I have only small knowledge. The question is: should I start in one of the newer, strong growing modules like BI/HANA or should I concentrate in “historical” module like logistic to start with and look for experience in some of these newer parts later in my career? Any suggestions are welcome!"
1vumth,106,2014-01-22,"spoke in front of 2,000 people on monday",whyyoueven,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1vumth/spoke_in_front_of_2000_people_on_monday/,"ive been diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder, and ocd since my teen years and the past 10 or so years have been sort of a mess. i hated high school and couldnt deal with people or deadlines or anything of that sort. college i became a bit social and admittedly was fairly attractive so i was able to attract women and the like but i always fucked it up by being too anxious and nervous they didnt like me or would cheat on me.  thats been a common theme. 

throughout my first three years of college i dealt with stress by exercising and hanging out with friends, but then after a break up and medical problems two summers ago i sort of had a break down. i got on zoloft and gained about 60 pounds from dealing with my anxiety by only studying and drinking/eating heavily with friends.  got a great GPA but fucked up pretty much everything else in life despite landing a good internship. i have since gone of the zoloft and have dropped about 20 lbs of fat from rigorous exercising. 

this internship ended up getting me a fairly high profile job in a high profile political city. it turns out this kind of job is not the best for people with crippling social anxiety.  meeting with ceo's, politicians, and community leaders on a fairly regular basis has my stomach constantly in knots and my nerves on fire.  only problem is i am very good at faking it and being good at socializing is the only marketable skill i have.

still it fucking terrifies me. i was scheduled to speak at one of the more high profile, televised MLK events in the city on monday.  i see a shitty 22 yr old kid who barely knows how to do anything sometimes when i look in the mirror but someitmes i get these brief, extreme flashes of confidence and can do some cool things.

so i was terrified and nervous and wanted an asteroid to hit the convention center but i got up to the stage and was easily the youngest speaker by thiry years and it was in front of several congressman, the governor, and other politicians and community figures.

i was told i nailed it, and got a pretty big applause. 

i think people should realize that anxiety and depression effect a LOT of people and ""extroverts"" can have it too. i can get up on a stage or lead a conference room in a discussion of things that i have written down and casually rehearsed, but if you asked me how i genuinely felt about something or any of my worries, fears, etc i woudnt be able to get a sentence out. 

people are often fighting battles you cant see.  one of my best friends in the world found out i have been battling depression and anxiety only a few months ago and he was literally shocked. 

im still real happy i was able to get up there and talk despite being terrified. if only i could learn how to talk to women or not worry about my job constantly.

sorry if this sounds like braggin or anything i just want to show that there is hope for overcoming anxiety when you really need to."

I've been in a long relationship, and married for a while. Before marriage, my boyfriend cheated on me and I forgave him; after marriage he cheated again with someone we both know, he asked to forgive him, and I decided to give him another chance.

The problem now is that I still don't trust him; I'm afraid it happens again. I feel like I'm losing my time with someone that is going to hurt me.

Probably I don't deserve his trust either because I check his personal things sometimes. I feel like we are in a sick relationship.

In the last months we started to talk about kids and building a business together; I wan't both things (kids and being independent). But the thought of investing everything with someone I don't trust completely it's a big intern conflict.

What can I do in this important moment of my life where things are changing?

Should I risk to live with him or get out of the boat ASAP?

EDIT: I really didn't expected so many comments, advises, soft and thought words... I sincerely appreciate all your support. I will try to answer everyone, but I also should clarify some common questions in some comments:

* He tells me that in all relationships each person should have an amount of privacy. So he thinks I should never check his personal things.
* In both situations he flirts for a long time (2-3 months in the first, and 6 months in the second), which tells that in some moment he though about me and that he was going to hurt someone who loves him. 
* After marriage he started to talk about an open relationship, I read some books about it, and really started to think about it (although the common word in all I read was ""trust"", just what our relationship lacked).
* I still have bad dreams about this related with my relationship (it's been 5 years since the first one).
* He started to talk about children a week ago and it was when I started to panic. Because inside I was still waiting for the moment where trust came back."
1vvghh,5,2014-01-22,Can I do this?,Bob_Schruteburger,siberianhusky,https://www.reddit.com/r/siberianhusky/comments/1vvghh/can_i_do_this/,"Hi, I have a three year old Siberian Husky female. I've had her since she was 8 weeks old. It's been fun having her. We're really close, we run together every day, I've trained her, etc. I live with my mom who helps me with her when I am busy or work weird hours.

Here's the deal, my life is taking a turn for the busier starting in April. I have been accepted to a graduate school program out of state and will intern 40 hours a week all summer, then begin my research and teaching assistantship in August. I'll be on my own with no family or friends in the new area. 

I don't know that I can keep my dog and fulfill my responsibilities as a graduate student. I'm currently trying to work my way up to leaving her out of her crate for 8 hours a day while I am gone. She seems to be crazy and anxious when I get home after 3 hours, so 8 seems out of reach. 

I missed a really neat international study opportunity last year because of her. I actually left for the program and had to come back because my mom who had offered to help broke down and was tired of taking care of a husky.

I love my dog, and I have made a lot of sacrifices for her. I don't have much of a social life because I've chosen to spend as much time at home to tend to her. With graduate school coming up, however, I can't choose my dog over my future. I'm 23 and she will likely be alive until I am 35. I have anxiety attacks and sleepless nights worrying about the fact that I am potentially going to have to waste 12 years of my life before I get to really live and progress with my career goals. 

Any advice from fellow Husky owners? Can I make this work? "
1vvr7d,1,2014-01-22,"I have no idea what to do, where to start or how to fix any of this.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1vvr7d/i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_where_to_start_or_how/,"it has been a long spiral down to rock bottom, i've been living a fluid reality reacting to things as they happen and now i can't do that anymore because it's no longer working.

I was in a shitty apartment that my shitty family thought it would be good to have move into so i lived closer to them and they could see my kids.

in a year they came over twice i always had to go to them it was dumb.

shit happened and the basement of the apartment flooded and mold started happening and they would come and just throw jug after jug of bleach at it and say it's fixed.. but it was never fixed.. they also never warned me, or my wife (who has RA and issues lifting the 3 year old and 1 year old) that this was gonna happen so you might wanna leave.. it was always a surprise best thing is waking up from a nap with a massive headache and having to get the kids and rush out into fresh air.. (if one of them had died from this this would be a different story all together, needless to say i'm still pissed off about it).

after consulting a lawyer about my lease and what was going on I gave notice that they were in breach of the lease and had 14 days to fix it.

14 days they were still bleaching it and trying to kill us in our sleep so I left and moved into a friends house. kinda in BFE from work.

My wife has RA as i stated, she has a severe case and has issues griping, lifting, standing, sitting ect. so she doesn't work, we are trying to get her disability right now and that in it's own is another story.

so one income family, atleast i have a decent job making 45k as a software developer.

so we are already stretched thin money wise paying for lots of medication, doctors visits plus i got 2 little boys one is 3 and a half and the other is 16 months old.

so fast forward a couple of months since we left that apartment, we are getting on our feet, things are going good, we are figuring things out.. when i get a letter in the mail and a day later a subpoena to goto court the apartment is suing me for damages and late rent. plus damages to the basement for all the bleach they had to use....

wtf.. so i goto court, lawyer up (more money i didn't have) got told that wasn't a good enough reason to move out so i gotta pay rent, late fees, and damages occurred to the apartment (not the basement) so like 3000$ which i didn't have so wage garnish it was.

so we are doing that now.. get another court summons for student loans gotta pay those.. okay i understand i got educated they want their money okay cool.

well then what we were spending didn't match what we were making so we started going into the red...  i figure a few months of it sucking and it'll get better..

i was wrong... so very very very wrong.  the owner of the house decided to use my rent money to pay their mortgage on thier house and not pay the one we were staying in so now they are going into bankruptcy and the house is going to be foreclosed by the bank..

now what the fuck do i do... i can't get an apartment cause the apartment complex technically according to courts ""evicted me"" and they won't give me good rental history even though i was on time up until i exercised my right to leave. due to them not fixing issues. and i don't have any money saved up to make massive deposits on a house..

i'm quite literally fucked, majorly in debt, have a wife with a severe medical condition and about to be homeless 90% of which is not my fault just bad things happen repeatedly getting stacked on top of each other.

I don't know what to do.. i don't know where to start.. i'm completely fucked and don't see any ways out of this.  I don't have any family i can stay with.

too make things even more fun the landlord/friend decided to have all utilities cut to the property (they were in her name) and we were paying the bills.. now the utility companies want a deposit + connection fees which we don't have and an awesome cold front is set to hit tomorrow..  I managed to get gas turned on for heat, but we have no electricity, water, intern, or cable (the last two are no where near as important as the first two, the third one does kinda affect my job though).

so now that i'm pretty much ready to go curl up in the fetal position in the corner and rock back and forth i'm gonna go."

1vvw06,1,2014-01-22,3 month-long familytrip to USA (Florida Area) need advices,nowaah,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1vvw06/3_monthlong_familytrip_to_usa_florida_area_need/,"Hi Guys!

Me, my girlfriend and our 1 year old daughter is planning 3 month long vacation after my girlfriend is done with her internship as a paramedic February next year. We wanted to take a longer vacation before we get tied down with house mortgage, both in steady jobs and our daughter goes to school.

We both would like to travel to USA for a longer period and the tourist visa limits us to 3 months which is about perfect because we initially wanted a 3-6 month long trip. I do have a steady job, but I also have the opportunity to work from home/anywhere so I will combine my vacation and work during the trip.

Therefore we want travel and se different places in USA at first, but also find a place we can stay for a longer time period so I can work from “home”. We live in Norway so we were thinking of maybe somewhere in Florida (we will be traveling in February and is by then most likely tired of the cold back home and need some warmth).
My girlfriend also wanted to check out the possibility to get some experience from the American health system and maybe do some charity work on free health clinics or maybe something other health related stuff that would be a great experience to bring back home. Do anyone have any good suggestions on that area?

Our daughter will be 2 years old on this trip and we think this is a great opportunity for her to learn English as a second language as well.  And the best way is to play with other children speaking English, so do you guys know of any kind of private day care places that maybe could offer a part-time stay for a limited period? Is this possible?

As we only will be staying for 2-3 months in one place we were also thinking of renting a place because 2-3 months at a hotel will be too expensive.. So we will need a fully furnished place, a good internet connection, 2 bedrooms and a child safe area. Any recommendation for good search sites and which areas in Florida/Miami do you recommend? I think our price range will be from 1000$ to 2400$ (max) a month.

I hope some of you generally have some good advices for us and maybe some must-see/do activities we should check out :)

Thanks in advance!

1vvx9m,0,2014-01-22,"Handy in a fun situation! [MF] (public, stealth, lulz) ALSO AN ANNOUNCEMENT!",[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1vvx9m/handy_in_a_fun_situation_mf_public_stealth_lulz/,"I've got a couple of important announcements for fans of mine! Also, sorry for being away for so long, you guys know my living situation isn't exactly ideal for privacy. But I will be posting more on account of my coworker, who is in desperate need of a roommate. That means more me time to write up my sexcapades for you guys! 

Here is the story. There are more announcements below &lt;3 
____________________________________
So, this one dates back a few years. I was dating Dan, and things were going great. It was a happy time: I was still with Dan, My friends and I were closer than ever, and life was relatively stress-free. 

So, here's what was going on: it was a Saturday night and Dan was going out with the guys. I have fielded offers to join them for these monthly guy-nights but I usually declined, because, well, I didn't want to be that girl that always crashes boys night. 

But this night, I wanted to go. They picked a pretty good Italian restaurant, an authentic one. I'll try and remember the name of it as I write. Dan wore black pants and a casual burgundy sweater, and I put on a blouse, and a nice tight skirt. We looked hot. HE looked hot. Mmm. 

We met up with the guys inside, 3 of them. And these guys were pretty nice. One of them was a landscaper, and i don't usually find muscular guys super hot, but DAMN, lemmetellya. Short, soft black hair, blue eyes, smooth skin, a perfect smile, omg. 

All of them were at least cute (though my Danny boy was the best looking &lt;3), one of them had the rugged manly look I adore so much while the other rocked a more conservative Christian Bale look. Needless to say my loins were on fire. My vagina was Niagara Falls. 

With my Dan tucked away in the corner of the booth, his crotch hidden by the table-cloth, I saw an opportunity for some extra entertainment. 

I grabbed his package as he was ordering his appetizer. I gave it a gentle squeeze and rubbed it with my whole hand. I squeezed and massaged his dick through his pants as it slowly grew harder, and he couldn't do anything about it. He tried (and did pretty good) to act normal as I gently tugged down his zipper. I slowly pulled his cock out of his pants and snuggled up to him so that my arm wouldn't move when I jerked him off. 

Dan put his arm around me as I grasped his rock hard member, and I slowly started stroking it while he ate his appetizer and chatted with his friends about random things. Sometimes I would play with it slowly, teasingly, other times I'd relentlessly jerk him off. 

Now, not to brag, but I take care of my skin and I am proud to say my hands are as soft as silk. I noticed his heart began to race and he was gripping my waist hard, so I aimed him at the wall and kept up my rhythm for the final stretch. He let out an audible sigh of relief as I felt his cock twitch in my hands, firing right at the wall. 

I wiped up the stuff that was left over on his cock and my hand and rubbed it into my bare knee, and put him away. T'was awesome &lt;3 

______________________________

Alright, more announcements: 

I dyed my hair reddish, on a whim. It looks pretty hot. 

And the BIG announcement: 

My close friend is a wonderful human being, he's courteous, he always takes care of his friends, he's very generous with his money, and he always looks out for people. Unfortunately, he's run into a big string of bad luck, he has no job, and he failed a pre-requisite for his placement (Like a school-sponsored internship) and now has to go back to school for an extra semester, pay for 3 classes and travel and all without alerting his abusers. The problem is he has no money for any of this. I said I would help out any way I can but I can't do much on my own. I've seen reddit do amazing things before so I'm hoping for a little classic reddit magic here. 

I'm asking everyone who can to donate a few extra bucks here and there. Anything under 100$ will be counted as a donation. Anything 100$ and over will be counted as a loan and you will be repayed with a 50% value added on (so if you donate $1000 you will get $1500 back), the only catch is it will probably be a couple of years before you get your money back. Our goal is $3000. 

ALSO you guys know how I have a phobia of putting nudes of me online. Everyone who donates will have their names entered in a draw, and the winner will get a bunch of nude pics of me. It's something everyone is always bugging me about so I figured why not throw you guys a bone. We'll start posting proofs from his Paypal account to show progress. 

The PayPal account is registered in his name, Dillonxh@yahoo.ca 

Thanks lovelies &lt;3 "
1vvy9l,2,2014-01-22,32 M4F - The Interview,too_handsome,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1vvy9l/32_m4f_the_interview/,"You are sitting in the lobby feeling more than a little nervous. Landing this internship would really make your resume stand out and you know you need every advantage you can get in your field. The job itself seems perfect for you and the company you'd be working for was just rated in the top 10 fastest growing businesses for this year. Everything is quiet except for the occasional click of the receptionists keyboard as she attempts to stay busy. You've been waiting for what seems like an eternity and you notice your leg unconsciously bouncing from nerves. You jump a little when you hear your name called. Looking around you see a man in his mid-thirties smiling at you. ""Right this way miss."" He says, beckoning you through a set of doors into the offices beyond. He leads you through a maze of hallways to a brightly lit corner office with the name ROCCI on the door.


Noticing the office is empty you turn to the man who brought you in and ask, ""Do you know when I can expect Mr. Rocky?"" The man smiles and chuckles a little to himself.


""It's pronounced Ro-See."" He corrects. Your eyes flash anger at his laughter. This is silly, after all. You've been waiting at least 30 minutes for this Rocky or Ro-see, or whatever guy to show up for his appointment and now he sends his underling to laugh at you. You open your mouth to give him a piece of your mind, but are stopped before you can get a word out as he walks by you and sits down in the plush leather office chair behind the desk. ""I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but I had a conference call that ran long. Please, close the door and have a seat.""


More than a little stunned you close the door and sit down across from him. You were expecting someone much older, and certainly not as handsome as he is. You notice his eyes are looking you up and down and find yourself a little flustered to know that he is checking you out.

""I've reviewed your resume, and on paper you appear to be a highly qualified applicant. However, we have had a great deal of interest for this position, as I'm sure you are likely aware. Can you please tell me what makes you stand out from the other applicants ."" He asks, looking up from your resume.


""W-well."" You stutter. Swallowing hard you pause to compose yourself. ""I work really hard. You won't find anyone else out there who works as hard as I do. I never turn down a hard job and I don't quit until it's finished.""
""Oh my god!"" you think to yourself. ""I sound like an idiot.""


He smiles a little at your obvious nerves. ""Works hard."" he says, writing a note on your resume.


Trying to salvage the situation, you continue, ""I am really interested to learn as well. I think that this company has a lot to offer me and I am interested in taking in as much as I can.""


Obviously trying to suppress a laugh he smiles and writes down ""Interested in taking as much as she can."" Hearing it repeated like that makes you instantly blush. You feel suddenly very warm and know you are crashing and burning.


""Also, as you are applying for a PR internship I'm a little concerned about this..."" he says. Turning his computer screen towards you, you can see he has brought up your Facebook page. He has blown up a picture of you that had been tagged by one of your girlfriends from a Halloween party. You had been dressed up as a sexy cop and had likely done one too many shots. You had been sitting on a table and they said to look sexy for the shot. Stupidly you had pulled your top down with one hand exposing one of your tits to the camera and with your other hand was using your police baton as a huge sex toy. You had put on your best porn star face and thought it was funny at the time. Now, in the middle of a job interview you are mortified.


""Um...um...ah."" is all you can manage to get out. Looking over at him you see his eyes are still glued to the screen. He is sitting with his ankle resting on the knee of his other leg and you notice a growing bulge down the leg of his pants. ""Oh my god. He is totally turned on by this."" you think to yourself. You feel flushed again, but this time feel a heat coming from between your legs....

Now it's your turn.  I'd love for you to PM me and share what happens next!

1vwfs8,4,2014-01-22,Ireland to Korea CS intern!,[deleted],korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/1vwfs8/ireland_to_korea_cs_intern/,"Hello,

I'm a Computer Science student in Ireland. I'd love to go to Korea for a summer (intern) or organise an workplacement (organized with my college) to a Korean university (Seoul) in a couple of years. My college doesn't have any official ties with Korea, so this makes it harder to make any connections over there! Is anyone studying in Seoul or interning in CS in a major Korean city? I'd be very excited and appreciative if you could help me with some information. Thanks for reading!"

1vwlgg,1,2014-01-22,Chutzpah or Arrogance: PR Start-up Question,Freedom_Torches,PublicRelations,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicRelations/comments/1vwlgg/chutzpah_or_arrogance_pr_startup_question/,"Two of the things I like most about the field of Public Relations are the sheer variety of different industries and organizations one works with, as well as the constantly evolving practices and tools that PR professionals use.

However, PR is still a very grounded profession where measurability and reputation is (obviously) important.


**BACKGROUND**



A little about myself:

I have a Bachelors in Political Science; I originally was going into law, but as much as I like persuasive and evidence-based arguments, it seems like every issue I cared about eventually came down to a 4/5 split in Canada's Supreme Court. Oh well.


A life-long love of politics and persuasion (as well as, honestly, a personality poorly suited to the legal profession) lead me to the field of Political Consulting which lead me to the general field of communications and PR.

I never really though about it before I considered PR as a career choice, but among my family there actually are some journalists, writers, and communications professionals. Including a family member recently hired as part of a news team. Not that anyone is jealous or anything.



**FIRST PR THING**



I was working for a medical facility under legal threat (coming from Canada, I'll give you three guesses) and was very passionate about their continued existence. I thought the best way to mobilize an issue so easily spun negatively was to, well, spin it positively towards the real, human face of the issue.

I spoke with the journalist in my family (lives in another city) and asked him for some advice. He gave me two main pieces and I'm glad he did:

1. Find the editor, email the editor, call the editor.
2. If you want a story published, you have to explain the peg and quickly; editors don't have for long, flowery prose. 

So I did it. Just to 5 or so publications, because I didn't really know what I was doing. I did check each publication to see their latest cannabis-related story to mention during the pitch.

Fast-forward to one month later and I'm woken up by a call from a reporter telling me her editor passed along the email and my info and she'd like to interview me--would 45 minutes give me enough time?

She did apologize for the short notice, but I think I learned if you're going to give *your* contact info, be prepared.

I won't bore you (more) with details, but information and sound-bytes were given, aspects of the facility and the greater issue that needed a spot-light got it.

I was a little excited, but told myself (and others), it would be great to see it on A14 -- even a paragraph or two is something!



**RESULTS**



Monday morning I was grabbing some coffee from the local Safeway and when my eyes focused I saw a rack of newspapers: it made the front page (the entire front page) and had  two page spread A3-5 with huge pictures.

Anyhow, I really hope this doesn't come off as bragging. If I was absolutely sure of myself, I don't think I'd be writing a post for advice, frankly.

That was just a first, pleasant experience that really made me feel like I had some instinct and passion for this field.

Since then I started reading (and reading, and reading...) about social media uses and mechanics and was able to actually create a social media presence for the same medical facility and boost their audience exponentially and permanently.



**SECOND PR THING**



I was a little more nervous when approaching a restaurant (whom my friend worked for and constantly complained about a high-payed and incompetent communications manager) about some social media work for an upcoming wine festival.

Working for ""trade"" (a couple bottles of a very nice red I like) isn't super professional I guess, but hey, neither is hiring a PR guy with no experience. 

However, I was able to research both the wine festival, the managers attitude about his restaurant's image and their clientele. I wrote some copy about the wine festival in way really captured the spirit of the event, created a small, tasteful facebook contest to engage people and had a ""series"" of images of wines from the festival taken in the restaurant for a ""countdown"" to the festival (5 bottles, 4 bottles, 3 bottles).



**RESULTS**



Again, it worked out fantastically. Every post related to the event became the ""highest rated facebook page ever"" one after another (thrilling for someone as new as I was) and although in the past, this promotion would fill up half the restaurant at best, they now were so full they had to turn away several tables.

It went great! I was ""paid"", and the previous communications manager was let go! (No, not because of my work, but it really didn't help. The other communications person was, frankly, just not that interested in the project, I think).

And to top it off, the restaurant owner and the manager are going to have a meeting with me next week to discuss some other ideas I have they are very interested in, such as a cooking demo at a farmers market (their french chefs, their signage + farmers market + traditional media coverage + social media campaign, seems obvious, no?).

In addition, I've got a very interesting project (or two) coming up. Each day is honestly more and more exciting. I keep finding that I know someone who works with the Government Ministry I need to appeal to, or works with the community outreach department at a major company I want to sponsor something else. I have a LOT of momentum, I guess I'm trying to say and I certainly don't want to screw that up.



**LETS GET TO THE POINT, ALREADY!**



But who, exactly, is doing all this work?

I can't always get paid in bottles of wine, obviously.  Well, not for too long, anyways.

I looked at some PR internships around my city and their are a few. A few very promising (and sought after) ones and some interesting job posting that don't require much experience.

But then I started to think about things more.

Why not just start? Start small, but start an actual firm?

**What I'm talking about**

A small, local PR firm.

Specializing in non-profit organizations, small businesses, and local politicians (city council campaigns, later individual MLA's).

""We're not big but we're small"". That is to say, the best tool isn't always a sledgehammer. Specializing in community needs/identity and being able to relate to local publics in ways that are applicable to business, non-profit and political goals would be the mission statement.

I understand, of course, that starting a PR Firm is a monumental undertaking requiring many, many things including other people, business licenses, accounting, investment, content creation, rejection, rejection, rejection and more.

If it seems like I've overstated my own success so far or not mentioned more practical obstacles, it's really only because I'm honestly wondering how crazy this all seems to begin with.

**How crazy is it to start now, start small and keep gaining more and more work to showcase on the portfolio?**

And, again, I really want to state I'm not the kind of person to take something like this lightly or try to live some ""Mad Men""-esque fantasy. I spend an inordinate amount of time studying PR (as well as business development, which I do understand this question delves into) and I understand how difficult it can be and how much work it is.


But for a few strong reasons I really do believe I could create a firm that, while small, could fill some important niches and eventually establish itself.

It just feels weird to say that out loud.


**CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER APOLOGIES FOR LENGTH**


I hope this wasn't too tiring to read; it ended up containing a fair bit more of my life's story than I thought it would. I hope I managed to throw in a thing or two of value for anyone thinking about PR, as well.

1vx24a,2,2014-01-22,I'm very incompetent and nervous at my new internship.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1vx24a/im_very_incompetent_and_nervous_at_my_new/,"I feel so horribly incompetent. My nerves and self doubt all culminate and make me a shaky and rambling mess. I'm so sorry I'm letting all of you guys down. I'm a nervous, unintelligent young girl, and I hope you don't lose all of your respect for me.

I'm really awkward and I tend to panic in my head. I over think EVERYTHING. I'm afraid that everything I'm doing is a lie, that you only took me in as an intern at your recruiting agency because I tricked you somehow. That I will be outed as a fraud and everyone will be upset and pissed. 

I had a panic attack last night and was hyperventilating in my bed, crying hysterically for a few hours. It's sad how pathetic I am. I was running scenarios through my head of how to run away, or how fucked up I am and that I need to kill myself somehow before I make an embarrassment of myself, and shame my family. Tomorrow I go back in, and I know I'm going to want to vomit and cry all day. 
I feel like what I wear is stupid looking and people make fun of me or pity me. 

Why am I like this? "
1vx4hu,1,2014-01-23,What level of knowledge am I expected to have entering the field as a college graduate? I feel as if I know absolutely nothing.,amateurpaper,ITdept,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITdept/comments/1vx4hu/what_level_of_knowledge_am_i_expected_to_have/,"I live in the midwestern US and I'm close to finishing up my BS in IS. The school and program I decided on has been absolute garbage. By the time I realized this and looked into transferring schools, it was too late and less than 15% of my credits would have transferred. Everyone has said ""just stick it out"", ""it's just a piece of paper"", ""It doesn't matter where you get it from"",""You'll learn what you need on the job"", etc. 

Everything that I do know was learned through my own self study. I'm the only student in my program who has their A+ certification, if that says anything. I've also had my CCENT for 4 years now(through 2 test revisions), but cannot seem to get a grasp on the CCNA through my own self study. Outside of knowing vague generalities, I have no practical knowledge of systems administration, linux, virtualization, cloud services, and every other hot trendy tech buzzword.  

Do I have any chance at finding a real job upon graduation? What are the biggest priorities I need to have to ensure I can have a decent career in this field? My resume is full of big name companies that I've done internships and contracts for, but my prospects seem to dwindle the older that I get. I've had three internships, all of which were at the worldwide HQ's for Fortune 100 companies, but most recently, I'm being laid off from Staples EasyTech. I can't help but feel incredibly pessimistic about my future success in the field."

Well let me tell you, in 24 hours I've done a complete 180. I woke up 6AM this morning, went for a run, meditated, got an interview for an internship tomorrow, worked out, and just had a cold shower to top it all off (I haven't had a cold shower in months) and I feel FREAKIN AMAZING! 

If you're struggling right now just know this with all your heart:

IT WILL GET BETTER

HANG IN THERE

Thank you guys, If it weren't for you I would still be hopeless right now. I love you all.

Stay strong guys and gals!"
1vxawc,1,2014-01-23,Procrastinating Antiderivatives.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1vxawc/procrastinating_antiderivatives/,"I'm in the middle of studying for my calculus quiz tomorrow and I feel blah. I love math, and I love learning. I study in one of the most prestigious universities in Chicago, and I had to go through hell and high water and lots of hard work to get in. I plan on going to medical school someday, my grades are okay, I'm double majoring in two different fields and double minoring in two different fields. I'm in amazing leadership positions, I have awesome friends, I'm not super well- off nor do I live luxuriously but I can occasionally afford to buy stuff. I have a faith I can connect to. I do volunteer work and am happy helping people. I backpacked Europe alone last summer after a hospital internship, and have traveled by myself to different cities from the east to the west coast of America. I keep in shape, my friends think I'm funny and want to hang out with me often, and they tell me they wish they had my life (I don't mean to brag, just sayin' this for example purposes). I know most people only have good words about me. My parents are proud of my hard work and my dreams of becoming a surgeon/ neurologist. I'm doing my best to be well- rounded and I have bits of knowledge on lots of stuff: from automobile racing to differentiating a Van Gogh from a Renoir painting to international economics. I can be reserved and classy, or chatty and engaging.


Yet somehow I get bored easily.


People often tell me that I have it too easy, but they don't know the struggle I went through to get here. And I'm proud of that. But lately, things have been boring (I'll bullet this part out so it doesn't look boring per se lol) :

**-I'm tired of seeing the same faces at school.**
 
**-I'm bored with studying and memorizing facts that I won't remember after the term ends.**

**-Starbucks used to be my favorite cafe but I got tired of it, too.**

**-When I'm at home, I want to travel. Running, my favorite physical activity, seems to be a chore as of late.**

**-And don't get me started on my lack of romantic interest.** I've gone out with some good guys in the past few months, and although they were interesting at the start, they all look the same to me now. They always try to pull a fast one, be it trying to bed me (it always fails, sorry boys), getting me to commit long- term (I'm twenty three! I cannot settle down yet, I have to go to graduate AND medical school! But I don't do hook ups, either), or they assume that we have mutual, romantic interest when in fact I'm just a really friendly and outgoing person. This is weird, coz I've never been in a relationship. I used to be desperately seeking one, but now, I don't want to make expectations and I am not even keen on wanting one right now. I want to settle down someday, but right now, I don't see myself as the girlfriend of one of the guys I know or dated. There's never been a spark that I've been interested to keep aflame, so far.

Nevertheless, life's been good, and I'm always grateful. I've never been happier, but at the same time, bored. I know what I want. I know what I don't want. I just want to travel again to another place, in a city where no one knows me, talk to strangers, go on adventures, become a doctor already, stuff like that. I feel I need constant stimulation and curiosity to be interested in something for long periods of time. But right now, demmit, I'm procrastinating calculus and I am not even giving a fuck. 

**TL;DR:** My life is awesome, but I want more. What's wrong with me. Lol."
1vxisr,3,2014-01-23,Success in Accounting,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1vxisr/success_in_accounting/,"I've been researching Accounting for some time now and want to know how to be most successful in this career path. I guess by success I mean a good position, awesome pay, and respect. Lets take for example a controller, $150,000 + pay, madd respect. Think what would you have done differently (or what you did correctly) that would have gave you an ""edge"" over your peers, made you succeed significantly, or accelerated your career. 

A little about me: I took a Bachelors in Nursing Science. I am 27 years old and want a career change. 

Education:
1. What courses to take with Bachelors in Accounting?
2. Would it be beneficial to take a Minor in Finance? 
- If not, what other minor would be of great benefit? 
- How about Information Systems? 
- Computer programming?
3. What skills to learn during this time? 
- Networking?
- Other than networking?
4. Do you advise taking a 2 year program at a college then transferring to a University to get a Bachelors (long-term success)? This will save money. 
5. Which masters program would be of most benefit to work in the States and internationally, like the Gulf. 
6. Would you advise taking some masters in accounting AND MBA? Is there a benefit to this?
7. Is there a significant pay increase if a doctorate is attained?
8. Would my education in Nursing Science be of any benefit?
- How can I use my Nursing Science as an advantage in Accounting?

Basically, think if you were to go back and take your education all over again, what would you do?

Workforce:
1. What state would you advise to start working in?
2. Is an internship better from the start? If so, internship in what?
3. Can someone do tax accounting and get paid while studying to become an auditor? 
4. How to move up the ladder real quick in a work place in accounting?
5. Would my education in Nursing Science give me an edge in employment? 
- Will they consider this as life experience?

CPA/CMA
1. Is it unheard of taking the CMA as well as the CPA?
2. When to take the CPA?
3. Will my education in Nursing Science count towards the hours required for the CPA?

Finally,

How does accounting different in the US than in Canada?
- Pay/Salary?
- Education? Is it more recognized in the States than Canada?
- Does the Big 4 prefer American grads?

AND

How do you make money using accounting (and accounting principles) while studying?

Thank you much in advance."

1vy3ds,3,2014-01-23,Sex addict seeking help.,nofapinnj,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1vy3ds/sex_addict_seeking_help/,"I posted this on the forum on the website, I am not sure which one is more active, so I am posting on here too.  I am just looking for support, help, anything.

About 3 weeks ago I lost my girlfriend of 5 years because she found me texting another girl. This wasn't the first time she has caught me, but it was the last time she would put up with it.

The average person would just say: You didn't love her if you cheated (to my ex this was considered just as bad as cheating.) I would love to sit here and just say that I was unhappy in my relationship, and just start moving on. The thing is I have a problem. I noticed that when she left me, I was trying to do things I would usually do when she wasn't around (she goes to college 2 states away so I had to keep myself occupied when I missed her.) What I would do was either, hit on girls, cheat on her, play video games, or fap.

I would hit on everyone. My phone and facebook inbox were filled with just messages to random girls, creeping on them. My favorites on my browser were either video game related (big on WoW.), and porn. I had been spending most if not all my time when she wasn't around bullshitting. I would get nothing done, play WoW for an hour, fap, go out, sex, come back home, sleep. Did I mention I am a full-time student, and work weekends? I never did any homework, study, or when I had a day off from school, I wouldn't pick up shifts because I wanted to spend all day just sitting in my room wasting my day away.

After realizing my sex drive was the main reason for my unproductive ways, I started researching on addiction to attention, how to take control of your life, and how to actually act like a functioning human, which led me to Sex Addicts Anonymous. The name itself still creeps me out, I still don't think that I am actually a sex addict, I think I am just trying to give myself an excuse for cheating on my girlfriend and ruining my potentially great future. When you lose something that important to you, you'll do anything to fix it, so I went to one of these meetings, and realized that you didn't need to be just some guy addicted to buying prostitutes. 

Sex addiction goes deep, its not just you being addicted to having sex, but its addiction to how sex fuels and controls your life. I love attention from girls. I am not a bad looking guy, I go to school in the city, have a brand new car, work on the weekends, and have a great group of friends. I never thought I had a problem, I just thought ""this is how every guy my age lives."" Not really, not every guy has a beautiful girlfriend waiting for him with food, and decides to go to some trash strip club. Not every guy stays up till 5 in the morning playing video games and jerking off.

Realization is the worst part, after thinking you had it all figured out, and it comes crashing down on your face. I had a great year planned out. Now with all the other non-sex related issues on my life, and now realizing you're entire outlook on women is wrong, you can't sleep with everyone. 

I have since deleted all of my social media, removed my PC from my room, and only surf the web on my laptop in my living room. I unsubbed from WoW, and I took an abstinence pledge with my group. 

Up until today I thought my addiction was strictly with women, not with fapping...until I called out of my internship to beat off. Its everything, sex fuels my life, probably like you guys, I feel like I can't go throughout my day without it. If anything I feel like I am better afterwards, I think clearer, I get it out of my system , and I am less horny. In reality it only holds me back, and I need to realize that. I am terrified about taking this challenge, I really don't think I can do it, I am slowly failing out of school, losing relationships, and making bad choices in my life in general through this. 

I need help, I'll do anything to not let this control my life anymore."
1vy5iq,2,2014-01-23,TN-NJ Falling in Love Unexpectedly- Our Story,gholt10,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1vy5iq/tnnj_falling_in_love_unexpectedly_our_story/,"Hi r/longdistance,
I have lurked on here the past few months and having read through many posts I figured it was time I shared the story of my long distance relationship. I have meant to put this story on paper for a while, so it is hard to know where to begin. Here is the background. I am a 20 year old male born and raised in Tennessee, and my girlfriend is also 20 and lives in New Jersey. Anyways, let's begin. 

Before I begin, I have to say that despite the hardships associated with a LDR, meeting her has been the most important thing to ever happen to me, and I am grateful every day to call her mine. We started falling in love a year and a half ago, but what led us to this was nothing either of us could have ever expected. We were both involved in high school in an international service organization called Key Club. We both served in the role of district governor, which was essentially state president. In this role, I was over all the clubs in Kentucky and Tennessee, and she was over all of the Key Clubs in New Jersey. However, we served a year apart, so my term was 2011-2012 while hers was 2010-2011. Before my year as governor I had served as a lieutenant governor during the year my girlfriend was governor, and this is what led us to initially meet one another. We met at event called Kiwanis Family Conference back in November of 2010. I had seen her the previous summer at the international convention and was immediately attracted to her, so I was excited to finally meet her during this event. We spoke a few times throughout the weekend, I may have made a faux proposal (being the silly 16 year old I was), and we left as nothing more than acquaintances. The next summer we both attended the international convention once more. I saw her a few times throughout the week we spent there in Phoenix, AZ, but once again nothing ever amounted from it. Up until that point, I just had a simple crush on her, and I was well aware that nothing more would ever amount from it. So, after this convention her tenure in Key Club was over, and she was moving on to college the next year. What happened next is pure serendipity. During the fall of my senior year, I was lucky enough to be selected to serve as a member of a national group called the State Farm Youth Advisory Board, a group of 30 young people from across the country tasked by State Farm to distribute $5 million to service learning projects in the U.S. and Canada. Through this board I came to meet Chuck. While I was a senior in high school, Chuck was a junior in college. During the first meeting we became pals. At the April meeting of the State Farm Board, Chuck mentioned that he was likely going to be interning on Wall Street that upcoming summer and invited me to come visit if it happened. Well, that night I messaged my girlfriend, who let's call Carolyn for the remainder of this. By keeping up with her on Facebook, I knew she was attending school in Manhattan, so I told her I was thinking about coming that summer. It was nothing serious. We exchanged a few messages, and that was the only contact we had prior to the summer before. Eventually, this trip became a reality. Chuck had the internship, and in order to make the trip personally worthwhile (he was going to be busy during the week working and I didn't want to make a trip to only stay two days), I asked Carolyn if she would be interested in spending 5 or so days with me if I came. She agreed. Fast forward to June of 2012, and I am on a plane to New York with no idea what to expect from the week. As you can likely tell, I barely knew Carolyn. Yet, I was about to spend the majority of a week with her, not knowing if we would even end up getting along. That didn't end up being the case. In fact, it was the complete opposite. We hit it off immediately. I still vividly remember seeing her walk to me the first time. I was an out of place Southern boy standing next to a subway entrance, and there she came. She got out of the cab, walked over to me, and the journey began. We made our way to her grandma's apartment to set my belongings down and chat for a bit. Not that either of us were apprehensive, but we didn't know exactly what to expect from the upcoming week. I told her then and there that I just wanted to get to know her if we were going to spend that much time together. Eventually, we made our way to central park for a walk, and all the while I was thinking how crazy this whole thing was. I was actually doing this. We returned back to her grandma's place, and sat down on the couch together to talk for a while. I thought this girl was gorgeous, and after only a few hours I came to find she was pretty cool too. I was sitting there thinking of how I could make my move. Eventually, I leaned over to her and we had our first kiss. This was a dream come true. I was finally getting a kiss from the Key Club crush I had for so long. What happened after this was nothing short of amazing. The week we spent together was filled with fun, excitement, and learning about one another. We did everything from go to bars, to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, to going on dinner dates. I arrived on a Wednesday with few expectations, but by the time Saturday night rolled around (my last night there) I was experiencing something I never though possible. I was falling in love with this girl. I consider myself a reasonable person, which is why I didn't know exactly what to think as I laid there that last night with her in my arms. Would I ever see her again? Is this just a short fling, or is it actually something more? Something special? We laid on that couch for a good portion of the night sharing our feelings with each other. I had come to find out in only a few days just how incredible this girl was. She was very smart and had a good head on her shoulders. She was funny and knew how to have a good time. She was independent- able to do things on her own. Not to mention I saw her as a little dirty-blonde angel. If there is a memory ingrained in my mind it is the one of leaving her that night. It was almost 1AM, and she was standing there on the sidewalk in her dress without shoes and crying. I gave her a hug and kiss, and went to walk away. I then turned around to do it once more. As I was about to walk down the stairs to the subway I chose to peer over my shoulder and saw her doing the same thing as she was walking back into the apartment complex. I ran back to her to say one last goodbye, but then I had to leave. The next morning I returned home with so many emotions running through me, but all I could think about was just how amazing the prior week had been. 

After this, she made the decision to come see me in Tennessee in July, and at the end of the summer I made a trip to stay with her at her home in New Jersey. Both of those trips were each amazing in their own right. By the time I was leaving New Jersey at the end of this summer, I couldn't deny it- I was in love with this girl. She told me she loved me first, and it was such an amazing feeling. Eventually, we decided to try and make it work and started dating. We flew to see one another every 3-4 weeks during the school year trying to make it work as best as we could. Although we have had our ups and downs, being with her has been incredible. Every time I see her I fall even deeper in love with her, and I can't get enough. Now, over 19 months after that first week in New York, the two of us are together still making it work. We are in this for the long haul, and we plan to spend the rest of our live with each other, something I couldn't be happier about. 

Sorry for the wall of text (and probably a bunch of typos), but I wanted to get this on here to share with you all and with her. "

1vyglm,1,2014-01-23,How to select one element out of multiple elements to copy to another div? (Involves some C#),[deleted],learnjavascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1vyglm/how_to_select_one_element_out_of_multiple/,"Alrighty so I'm brand new to javascript and this subreddit (so if this question is in the wrong place, please let me know and I will move it) and I'm also a development intern for this an awesome company. I have my own project and I've set up all my HTML and CSS but now I finally have to start the JS work. I'm doing front-end design and a co-worker is doing the back-end parts. 

My first question is how to select one element out of multiple elements to copy to another div? I've got the copying part down BUT the entire div copies over instead of each individual product.  I've tried the .eq but it does not work. I think I'll need to use an if statement, which I'm still learning.   

**So here is the div that contains the products:** 

    &lt;div id=""bat_data""&gt;

                &lt;div class=""grid-section""&gt;
                    &lt;ul id=""trade-in-grid"" class=""grid clearfix"" data-balancedgrid=""true""&gt;
                    &lt;% 
                        foreach (var product in Model.Products)
                        {
                    %&gt;
                      
                                       
                   
                        &lt;li class=""l-row__item six-twelfths""&gt;
                            
                            
                   &lt;div class=""tile""&gt; 
                                 &lt;div class=""header""&gt;      
                           &lt;h4&gt;&lt;%= product.Name %&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
                                 &lt;/div&gt;
                         
                   &lt;div class=""details""&gt;

                    &lt;div class=""photo""&gt;
                    &lt;img src=""https://www.website.com/&lt;%=product.ImagePath %&gt;""  height=""218"" width=""109"" /&gt; 
                    &lt;/div&gt; 

                   &lt;div class=""pricing clearfix""&gt;
                       Trade-In Value
                       &lt;span class=""price""&gt;
                            $&lt;%= product.TradeInValue %&gt;
                       &lt;/span&gt;
                   &lt;/div&gt;     

                       &lt;div class=""btmWrap clearfix""&gt;

                           &lt;div class=""sizing""&gt;
                        &lt;select&gt;
                            &lt;%
                            foreach (var attribute in product.AvaliableAttributes)
                            {
                            %&gt;
                            &lt;option&gt;&lt;%= attribute.Name %&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
                            &lt;%
                            } 
                            %&gt;
                        &lt;/select&gt;
                           &lt;/div&gt;
                           
                           &lt;div class=""logo""&gt;
                           &lt;img src=""https://www.website.com/&lt;%= product.VendorLogoPath %&gt;"" alt=""Vendor Logo"" height=""25"" width=""50""/&gt;
                           &lt;/div&gt; 
                       
                       &lt;/div&gt;
                      
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                          &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;%
                        }
                    %&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                 &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

Explanation: The div is showing six of our products. It shows the header, picture, price, etc. I need to keep all of the information, but just narrow it down to one product when it is selected. 

**My script:**

    
$(""#trade-in-grid"").on(""click"", function () {

    var $offercart = $(""#bat_data"").children().clone();
    $("".offer"").append($offercart);
});




I've tried using #trade-in-grid, .l-row__item six-twelfths and then using .eq[2] but it didn't work. So I'm thinking I need to write a function that says 'if person clicks on &lt;li&gt; 1 then clone &lt;li&gt; 1 to offer' 'if person clicks on &lt;li&gt; 2 then clone &lt;li&gt; 2 to offer', etc. Any ideas?

I hope this makes sense what I'm trying to do here. I tried to put it in JS fiddle but the C# Models don't show up so nothing worked anyways. Sorry if its difficult to read. If anyone has a solution, tips, or tutorial similar to what I'm trying to achieve please let me know!  "

1vyq18,1,2014-01-23,First ti[M]e friendzoned because of religion - crazy story,[deleted],dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1vyq18/first_time_friendzoned_because_of_religion_crazy/,"Hey redditors,

before i tell my recent story, i need to tell you guys that my gf of 7 years broke up with me quite a while ago. There was no special reason... she just said that while i was doing an internship in another country she just stopped caring and loving me. -Awesome! Im quite sure she also cheated on me back then.... with a pretty ugly guy^^

Well and here i am: I finished my studies as an engineer and now im doing a Phd. and work as a consultant in Europe. Basically my day is over at around 8-9pm, then i see friends and try to workout about 3-5 times a week. I fall asleep at around 2 or 3 am, just because i dont want the day to be over so quickly. SO basically no time to meet someone else for over a year now.

Then i met her.

She is working in the same company in a temporary assistant position for one of my colleagues. We sit together during our lunch breaks, she loves my jokes, i enjoy listening to her stories and all i think about before i come home is to call her. This went on for like two weeks, she told me how much she likes me and blablabla...

Now the great part.

She is from Turkey, shes a muslim. Im not from there and not religious at all (It sais im roman catholic in my passport). I ask her about her sisters and her brother, how old they are and so on. She tells me her brother of course got married to a muslim girl. Im like ""of course?"" - And shes telling me ""yes, of course. I couldnt imagine marriing a guy whos not muslim and doesnt strongly follow the beliefs"".

Are you freaking kidding me?

I meet a girl... she likes me... i like her, we totally enjoy beeing together... and she tells me theres now way shes gonna be with someone whos not muslim. 

Dont get me wrong... i mean i really kindof admire that her belief is so strong, but come on...!
If i like a girl, i dont care about the country shes from, what her job is, how fucked up her parents are, what religion she is or whatever!!

Its just kinda sad that religion is a barrier for some people.
Btw.. this is the first time i was friendzoned. :-(
My first post btw :-) private messages welcome. Ill answer for sure. "

1vywbu,7,2014-01-23,"Me [30 M] with my gf [27 F] 2.5 years, broke up and unsure if I handled it properly or made the wrong mistake.",Shepard13,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1vywbu/me_30_m_with_my_gf_27_f_25_years_broke_up_and/,"This is a long distance relationship that started at a meet up of friends. We were both shy but when together, we were both happy. She was located several states away but we Skyped almost daily, texted constantly and so forth. Everything was going phenomenally, as we had agreed about a year into the relationship that she would relocate to where my location after she obtained her master's degree, which she had just started when we started our relationship.


Fast-forward to last September, when she said she was taking her heavies load of classes to finish up. I was barely able to talk to her, as she was up until 1 am, sleeping until 10 am and doing activities after her part time job or going to class. I understood she was under a heavy load, so I tried to contact her as much as possible. However, since I have to work early in the morning, I couldn't stay up when she got home typically. More and more, she got secluded, rarely talked and then I learned she got seasonal depression. 


I supported her the whole way through as best I could, given she was several states away. There were many times when she wanted to quit and I kept rooting for her all the way. As we closed to the end of the semester, I stated it would be fine and that we should start focusing on relocating her when she graduated in may. She got quiet after I mentioned that and then said she wanted to stay until a gathering with her friends in June, to which I was all right with since we would only be visiting her home when we could. Then she said her internship was offering her a temp position in her city which would help her with the job search and needed to stay until August. I was a little befuddled but didn't question her, as she needed the money for relocation.


She came down in November, where I told her I wanted to discuss the issues of relocation and living arrangements. She then broke down, started crying for no reason. I asked her why and she said she couldn't tell me or wanted to discuss relocation. I tried asking again and again but she kept to herself on it. When we went visiting various locations, she always posted what she was doing but not who she was with.


The following day, I got her on Skype and asked what was up. She then said that she was going to spend another three years up there to work and get another masters degree. I then asked her that she needed to decide, whether she wanted to stay in her home town or come to live with me. She cried again, saying that we needed to make the decision together and that I was being impatient. I told her that I had tried that several times and that she kept avoiding the topic. So I told her to make up her mind and not to contact me until she made up her mind.


Several days passed and I crumbled from her texts. I guess I was too weak, as I said we should try to figure something out. However, at this point, she talked even less to me. To the point that I asked her if she wanted me to still come visit for Christmas. She said she had a lot of plans and wasn't sure what we would do when I got there. I told her then it sounds like she made up her mind and didn't want me around anymore. 


She kept crying and wouldn't turn on the camera during Skype, saying that she really did love me but she did not want to leave. Her list of reasons going from not having any opportunities down here, to no social connections where I am, a second masters degree, to saving up for a car, etc. 


Everything came tumbling out with various reasons why she couldn't leave. I asked her why she didn't plan for all of this already? This is what we had discussed and having me relocate was going to be tremendously more difficult than to have her do so. (To note, I was looking for work in her town during this whole scenario. I could not, however, find a job that would help stem the debts I had accrued, a place to live or a solution to an injury I had suffered and limited my work options).


I followed up by asking if she would give a hand with any of that, specifically a place to live since we would live together up there. She paused and said she would give me moral support during the process. I then followed up by asking if she looked for work down here on her own (I gave her several pointers on where to look and was still looking), to which she said no.


She then stated that her internship might be giving her the dream job where she was and would not consider leaving. I asked her several times what would the follow up be if the internship fell through? What happens after the second Masters? She didn't answer me. I told her that with her not talking to me about any of this or even letting me know what was going on was a huge distrust and that, as much as it pains me to do so (I was planning on marrying her), I had to let her go. After I left, I forgot to turn off the Skype and heard her repeatedly saying she just screwed up the best thing in her life.


It still pains me to this day. I keep wondering if I made the right choice? If there was something but I wasn't looking hard enough. Friends keep telling me that she wasn't ready for the next level, that she wanted to stay in a dream world of student life. Others said that she just wanted to appear to be in a relationship, to be able to turn me off at a flick of a button. Both pain me, as it seemed like she wanted to stay where she was more than being with me. Still, I keep thinking there might have been an opportunity but I might be lying to myself to see if there was another chance.


tl;dr: long distance relationship started souring when original plans were changed without the other party knowing. Girlfriend decides that she wants to stay where she is over everything else but wanted me to relocate with my own resources and no job on the horizon.

I appreciate any insight and if you read the whole story through, I'm sorry being long winded."

1vz90a,10,2014-01-23,Recommendations for a local library educational setup?,MaggotStorm,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/1vz90a/recommendations_for_a_local_library_educational/,"Hey guys.

I intern at my local library, and to be honest, that place is the freshest place in town.

They are funding a music production setup for the teens area. This will be used by various teens, but they must first sign a waiver.


So, what would you guys recommend for the setup? Note, space is a big restriction.


here is what we have so far:  

http://imgur.com/Msa6FUj 
(note, the Microkorg is my personal synth, and was just a placeholder for a MIDI controller; Also, the Mac is just a placeholder for a monitor, a Windows 8 setup will be there.)

* Reason 7.0
* Virtual DJ
* PC setup, far overkill processing power
* iPad
* iKaossilator, iElectribe, Rhythm, Propellerhead Rebirth
* Alesis iO dock
* Behringer UCA 202
* Denon DJ MC3000

So far, planning on getting:

* A MIDI controller, probably 25 keys. Leaning toward the Arturia Minilab



Any recommendations? Remember, this will be essentially a public setup, for various genres of music. **Reason 7.0** will be the only DAW on it for a significant amount of time, then we may later acquire Ableton Live."

**Hours Online Free** In New Orleans just before Hurricane Katrina hits, a pregnant woman gives birth prematurely. She dies and her baby is in critical condition. The baby has to be kept in a neonatal incubator. When the hurricane strikes, all the power goes out and everyone in the hospital leaves. But the baby's father stays because the baby can't be moved so he has to take care of his baby by making sure the ventilator stays on. And because there's no power, the only power source is generator that he has to crank every few minutes. So he has to stay awake while waiting for someone to come for them.

1w08tu,5,2014-01-23,I'm having a mental breakdown from looking at the road ahead (xpost from r/college),[deleted],aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1w08tu/im_having_a_mental_breakdown_from_looking_at_the/,"I want to apply for a Supplemental leader position at my school. They do 10 to 12 hrs a week, including teaching 2 1.5 hour sessions, sitting in on the classes themselves, and getting together to discuss stuff. 10 to 12 hours may not seem long, but I'm taking 5 classes this yr+ a lab. 3 hard science/math classes. And for this one class I've been just looking back and forth between the book, my notes, and the online homework, trying to find connections. So basically it means this will be one of THOSE classes. I have a strong feeling that the other 2 classes I mentioned will be similar.

So, i am officially wimping about on this great chance to put something really good on my resume, as I have never taught anything in my life before. I feel like such a loser, because I want to work at a car dealership this summer, and on top of the fucking fact that I won't have a car AND that I'm in college (car dealerships don't like hiring students) I will have by then a one school year gap in employment (I quit my summer job at McDonald's back in August) in college. And if I get rejected from the car dealership job, that employment gap timeline will carry onto the future when I'm trying to find internships, the collapse of the domino's will inevitably start with my chickening out on this tutoring position due to too much work in my classes. GAHHHHHH!!!!!

Sorry for the rant, I just wish there is an alternate way to resolve this, but as of now I can't find anything.

1w0gh4,0,2014-01-24,Not sure the title for this,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1w0gh4/not_sure_the_title_for_this/,"So pretty much I graduated college over the summer and I got a full time job right out of college from my internship with the same company. Yet ever since I believe the 2nd year of college I stressed a crap ton. I stressed about being homeless, not ever finding a job, what my life would be like in 5+ years. even in 2+ years, as well as if I will ever find love... Yet I still have those thoughts today. Granted not finding the job part is not me worrying about that. But I still worry alot about my future. It is so hard to picture myself in the future and where I am going to be. Some night I just stress on about it. I also for some reason have crappy luck with girls. Just in december I asked two girls out to my companies kick off start of the year party, just as sort of a date/hanging out but they never even responded to my facebook message. They read it because of the read receipt but they never replied back. lets say that shot my confidence level down alot of pegs. Funny fact is it took a crap ton of courage to even ask these girls out. It also doesn't help that some days my confidence level is pretty much 10 out of 100. I just sometimes as you see stress over stupid stuff. I don't want to but everything I stress about in here so I don't bore you guys with pointless stuff. But hey everyone has their own demons they face every day :/."

1w18ez,7,2014-01-24,Ex [24F] broke up with me [22M] but still wants to hang out with me - need advice - I'm heartbroken.,sadguyhelppls,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1w18ez/ex_24f_broke_up_with_me_22m_but_still_wants_to/,"My ex of 19 months broke up with me mid November because she felt that she didn’t feel like there was a spark between us. She told me that even though I was perfect, we were happy together, and that we have a lot of fun together, she can’t bring herself to keep dating me because she doesn’t feel that spark. She said she felt that kind of spark before we met for other men but those never formed into actual relationships - she has never had that spark before in a real relationship. She feels like she might regret it in the future, and that she doesn’t have that much more time to date someone for 2 years and see if she wants to marry them.

During our relationship, we never had any serious arguments - some say that is a bad sign but honestly, we had a lot in common and there just wasn’t any disagreements over anything. We spent 24/7 together and there was never a dull moment, honestly.

We both go to the same university. She is extremely hard working but lack the smarts to breeze through school, so she gets extremely stressed out during school. I became her mental support, tutoring her, being there for her when she feels like she can’t handle school anymore, and doing little things to ease her stress like taking care of her meals and staying up late with her to study with her.

In the last 4 months, I had helped her get an internship in Beijing (she broke up with me 3 months into the internship). She was considerably less stressed out during her internship because there was no school at all. When she broke up with me, she said she felt like she didn’t need me when there was no stress in her life, and she thought that means there is something wrong with the relationship because she feels like she might be just using me for support when she IS stressed out. Then she talked to me about lacking a spark between us.

Before she started the internship, she told me that she wanted to focus her time on her job and her family and old friends because it’s rare she spends so much time back in Beijing - so she said I was going to be lower priority. I didn’t think much of that at first - this was our second time doing long distance as I go on internships in the US often. My last internship, she was in school. But she started to text me less and less, doesn’t always make our Skype dates, until she eventually broke up with me. 

We are now both back in school since January. She messages me regularly still, asking me how I am. I asked her to meet up and talk or for dinner but she didn’t think it was a good idea. But recently, she started asking me for help again with her courses, which I provided. We studied together and we got back into a lot of our old habits and had a lot of fun - she studies with me at my house or vice versa, but we aren't intimate.

I don’t know what to make of this. I really want her back because I love her - I have no idea what she is doing hanging out with me like this. I don’t want to just be her crutch during school - I want her to love me again. She knows my feelings for her still but she is not evil as to purposefully use me or anything like that. I feel like she is kind of confused too - first she says we shouldn't meet or talk, now we do.

Should I keep hanging out with her and be the same person I always was or should I just cut off all contact? It’s driving me a crazy - I keep dreaming about hanging out with her or dreaming that she got a new boyfriend or something. I would just like some advice on how to deal with this situation. 

(Note: No need to tell me to hit the gym or anything like that - I have been working out for a long time and I have my shit together in terms of career and friends).

—

TLDR: She broke up with me, but still messages me and studies with me, I love her, I don’t know if I should ignore her or keep being the same as before.

1w1tau,12,2014-01-24,"His facebook was signed onto my ipad and I saw a conversation... [long read, please help]",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1w1tau/his_facebook_was_signed_onto_my_ipad_and_i_saw_a/,"27/m  22/f Sleeping with each other for 1.5 years, giving it a proper go since Christmas, doing business together, deep deep friendship/relationship.

So, we've had a fairly rocky start.  We have an uncanny connection, chemistry, amazing sex, etc.  He's one of the most important people in my life, and he's said the same about me.

We tried an open relationship, but we didn't do it properly (no primary partner, rules weren't defined, etc)  That was the compromise when I wanted a proper relationship, and he said he wasn't ready for a committed one right now.

So, over Xmas I went through a pretty rough time.  I was struggling with relationship issues, but I also was dealing with having moved to a different country, losing my job, risking everything to go full time on my startup, not being able to talk to my friends because of the 8 hour time difference, and finding out some terrible things about my father.

Over Xmas, he decided he did want to give it a proper shot, but when he found out I was really depressed, he thought it was over him, and it freaked him out, and he spent news years talking to his (polyamorous) friend about it.

Well, we had a talk when he came to visit me at Xmas, and I explained to him that it wasn't just him, that life had hit me pretty hard in the last few months and explained everything that was going on.

So I thought things were good, and he seemed to relax a lot more, but I can still see that there's a wall/worry in the back of his mind.  Last night I got my ipad out, and I went to facebook in my browser, and he was signed into facebook, and I didn't realise it at first. Then I saw a conversation between him and his Poly friend and saw my name, and I couldn't help but look. 

his buddy said, 

""how's cmyk529?""
""She's good. The relationship is fine...but I'm not happy""
""I thought you were going to GTFO after giving it a proper try for a few weeks?""
""I think it needs more time.  It's only been a few weeks, derp.""

Well, I've never been so mad/hurt/pissed.  I told him to come to my flat for a chat, now. 

He came over, and I came clean that I got on my ipad, and he was signed in, and I saw that convo (I signed out right away).  

We talked, and had a calm rational conversation.  He said that he thought my freaking out over xmas was because of him, and he was terrified that if I could feel so strongly after only a few months, that what would happen if things didn't work out, would everything fall to shit? And he was planning on easing out to prevent collateral damage because he doesn't want to lose me, and he didn't me to go even deeper emotionally and then have things end and everything fall to shit.

He said that things have changed since then when he realised that my funk wasn't all about him, and he's see's now that our relationship is calm and easy.  But he said he's not happy in general (he's on academic probation, can't get an internship, can't get his career together, terrified our business won't work, so there's that) and he's scared that if things go tits up, he's going to lose everything he has with me.

I was pissed out of my mind, and I told him that I was angry he said he was going to give it a real try, but then plans an exit strategy before we even get out of the gate.  I pretty much told him that getting hurt is a part of life, and I had a few low blows with the fact that there's a reason his career hasn't taken off, and it's because he won't take the risks.

I basically said that I want to be in a relationship with someone who wants to be in a relationship with me, and it's up to him.  He either gives it a real go, and if we end it, it's because we're not right for each other, and not because he's scared of what might happen if it gets real and it ends.

He's said he's scared of being trapped, and that he doesn't know why he's so scared of our relationship, and that he's never been scared of one before.

After the conversation was over, he said that he's going to try to get over his insecurities, and give it a go.  He was very affectionate, stayed the night, and was very nice.

I'm not okay yet. I feel really betrayed, and hurt, and just sick to my stomach.  I trust him on everything, but I don't know if I can trust him to give it a ""real"" go, and he claims that he hadn't talked to his friend since their original chat, so he didn't know things had changed, but he said that LAST night.

I think I'm going to ask him to take down his OKc and tinder... and tell him that I've lost a lot of trust, and it scares me...

Help?

**TL/DR**
**""how's cmyk529?""**
**""She's good. The relationship is fine...but I'm not happy""**
**""I thought you were going to GTFO after giving it a proper try for a few weeks?""**
**""I think it needs more time.  It's only been a few weeks, derp.""**

**I freaked out, had a talk, claims he was freaking out over xmas about us, but things changed for the better between us, but he's scared of being trapped and needs to figure out his feelings, but wants to give it a real go.**

I'm 25 years old, male. I was always told I was intelligent and ambitious and could do and be anything I wanted. I got into a top university and majored in a field that interested me rather than one that would give me a better chance of employment. I did well in my undergraduate degree, but I felt like I should be employed where I could use what I had studied. My field was so esoteric that finding a job where I could use it was impossible outside of academics. So I decided to apply for grad school in my field. This was in 2010. The first time I did not get in, and I didn't know what to do because I hadn't prepared myself for going into the job market on a generic Bachelor's degree; no internships while I was still an undergrad, no real experience outside of food service in high school. So I sat at home for a year, unemployed for most of it. I got fired from one mroe food service job that I only held from September-October 2010; they had me working night shift and baking for the morning rush and I couldn't keep up with that one day and they decided to let me go for it.

I applied to grad school again in January 2011, applied to more places and with better letters/references, and this time I got in. While there, it started to weigh on me how much the only path for what I was doing was academic, and I was only doing it because I felt there was no other option with what I'd studied. The thought of sitting in a university doing research made me very unhappy. I wanted to do something where I had a real-world impact, and not just write cand publish stuff for a very small academic community that the outside world doesn't care about. I found a branch of my field that would allow me to have far-reaching, real-world impact, but I needed more education in another field to get into it. So while I was still in my first grad program (early 2012 now), I started to take steps towards that. I earned my Masters Degree by September 2012, but still didn't have the qualifications to get into this other program I wanted to. So I stayed in school for a whole year more, just under ""visiting student"" status taking the relevant undergraduate-level courses. I applied to this second grad program while doing that, and got in. I started this program in September 2013. Keep in mind that September 2013 is seven years after I entered freshman year of university, and still no employment. Because I didn't do things right when I was supposed to and I'm paying for it with years of my life.

I had to move across the country for this program, but I was dedicated to getting employed in what I'd studied while having an impact on the real world, so I went. This program is professional, serious, and overwhelming. It consists mostly of people who have been employed and want the degree to boost their knowledge and resume for their current employers. They already have a ton of knowledge of the field, the industry, and have been at this for years preparing for this program specifically, whereas I only decided in the last two years and was on a completely different path before. I tried to rush all of this because I feel like I have wasted so much of my life already and just want to get something started in the way of a career.

I'm in courses now for this program and I find myself lost. I know it's because I rushed into this program after gathering knowledge for only about a year and a half, and didn't even do that well in those prep courses (C's and D's). But I really didn't want to re-take those, more money and most importantly more time wasted from my life. I have just been involved in a couple of pair projects for courses in this program, and the other person took the lead after it was clear I was lost and didn't know what I was doing. One of them got frustrated with me because I couldn't grasp what he wanted me to do (or was just incapable) and dropped me as a partner. Then the other project partner said she couldn't work with me anymore because I was too unreliable. There was some complex software that we had to use for the course and I just wasn't getting it, the people in here have experience with that but I couldn't understand. So she ditched me too as a partner. I was trying my best to contribute to both of these partnerships and my best wasn't good enough. I don't think I'm cut out for working with others at all, which is essential in the industry I want to get into. So maybe I'm not cut out for this either.

I've been in school forever and I think I'm mentally exhausted from it. I'm so frustrated  and angry at myself for the paths I've taken and the choices I've made. They were all the wrong ones. What if this one is the wrong choice too? If I'm too overwhelmed I might have to withdraw from the program. And then my life would be set even further back and I'm already 25 and have no career prospects. I haven't really worked a real job since 2010 so it's unlikely I'll even get ANY job now. No one wants to hire someone who's been out of the workforce for that long. 

I've just been feeling like shit and on the verge of tears for the past week. Is this what a nervous breakdown is? I've never been clear on the definition of that. But I might be having one. I know of people who have had nervous breakdowns in college around my age too, they're in their 40s and live with their parents unemployed their whole lives. If that is what's going to happen to me, I'm going to kill myself. I have too much pride to have that happen, and then have people talking about me like that for the next 20 years. Every choice I've made for my life has been wrong, and every time I try to get things right I fail miserably. There is something inherently wrong with me that is unfixable. What other explanation is there? I'm thinking of preparing for suicide already. Fuck this shit. I can't do anything right. I'm meant to be a loser at life. I refuse to live as one, so I'm going to kill myself. It's the best option I see.

If you read all the way through, thank you. But I don't think there's much anyone can do to help me."

I am a graduate student at UCLA with a summer internship in Fort Collins from mid-June to mid-September (quarter system :/ ). My company provides some housing options where I could live alone, however I’d like to save some money and I am open to living with others. I’m posting here to see if anyone had any suggestions as to how I would go about finding some short-term housing options. It is popular around my campus for people to sublet apartments for summer school and such which is why I’d think you guys might do it too.

Obviously a paid job would be ideal but even experience would be beneficial to me. "
1w4ct3,40,2014-01-25,"Equity Private Blog: Business school hypergamy, infidelity, sluttery.",unsungman,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1w4ct3/equity_private_blog_business_school_hypergamy/,"I've been reading this old blog for a while and to date one of my favorite posts has been this one...where the author talks about the lengths some women go to get ahead during business school. 

Starts by telling the story of a woman who tried sleeping her way into a Swiss bank (probably UBS):

""Allison, a tallish blonde from California, was perhaps the most flagrant example of the perils of this carnal approach.  Within weeks of deciding that a famous Swiss bank was her first choice, she had identified the second years who had ""summered"" there, cross referenced them against the facebook of second years and shamelessly thrown herself at the two she regarded as the most attractive.  Of course, there were more than enough liquor inundated social events to lubricate her task and by the end of the first month she had gotten to Colin, her man on the inside.

We all politely looked the other way, well most of us did, but her overtures had been so overt it was hard to pretend not to notice what was going on.  If Colin knew, which we all suspected he did, he didn't let on and instead placated her with gentle wooing mostly revolving around what an excellent fit she would be and how perfect the Swiss bank would be for her.  It wasn't a week after they ""met"" that Allison could be seen daily getting a ""ride home"" in Colin's BMW, as if the two hour wait she often endured from the end of her classes until the end of his was convenient to her.  One can easily imagine the tone their nightly pillow talk took.  Easier, perhaps, the content of the mutters her many detractors frequently intoned.

I suppose the more old-fashioned among us might have been affronted by these sorts of shenanigans, but there were dozens of reasons not to be.  For one, such liaisons were not particularly uncommon.  Just in my class I can call forth three engagements and five marriages that were left on the rocky shores of business school antics when one or another classmate was awarded the none-too-rare Master of Infidelity Administration degree, and that's just off the top of my head.  I might add that my recollections include one couple who entered the program together married, and left the program engaged, both of them, to third parties.  I sat between them in a marketing class and was often the conscripted purveyor of the notes, filled with angry scrawls written with loud scratchings towards the end of the term, they exchanged.  That quickly came to an end when I, tired of being a runner by the 15th such note since the beginning of that class, flagrantly opened it and read it.  I could feel their hot and hateful but helpless stares as I absorbed the words, ""No FUCKING way.""  The ""fucking"" was underlined.  They stopped passing notes through me after that.

The end of Allison's tryst took a predictable route.  Though I was not there myself I heard from others, everyone heard it from someone else it seemed, that the same evening the callbacks came and Allison had not been invited to the second round she threw a drink into Colin's face and called him a ""manipulative cocksucker"" before storming out of the event and never, it was whispered, speaking to him again.  A more clear sense of irony in her choice of pejorative nouns I don't think I could have dreamed up myself.  I heard that Colin had an undergraduate soothing his ruffled feathers within a week.  Allison, who, so sure of her chances with Colin's employer, had not bothered to pursue any fallback plans, found herself entirely unemployed, and without another bedmate, that summer.

After all the antics the usefulness of the second years was confined to feedback on why one had failed at this or that bank.  In one case I heard a distraught first year pleading with his mentor, ""My tie?  What's wrong with my tie?""  Admittedly, it was a pretty ugly tie.  One could, in theory, be shocked (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!"") at the trivial strikes which could cause an intern candidate to be tossed from the game, but then in such a rarefied environment it didn't, in the end, really surprise anyone.

My feedback boiled down to three things.  Firstly, I was too intense.  Second, I wasn't driven enough.  (This comment from the interview where I refused to accept the recruiter's highly forward invitation to meet for drinks after the interview).  Third, I didn't seem committed to banking.  So arbitrary and capricious were these comments that it became clear to me that the selection process was more about popularity, and a strange version even of that, than merit.  Genuine effort was pointless.  Sleaze was the order of the day.  This last point was driven home brutally when I heard the tale of the three first years who had taken the entire recruiting team, minus the women, of a highly sought after bank out to a strip club after the interviews.  Unsurprisingly, all three were awarded summer positions at the same bank.

Nearly despondent, I slouched into summer with a middling internship in the mergers and acquisitions department of a large corporate.  In a way this was gratifying.  If this was the culture I was idolizing, perhaps I needed to revisit my assumptions.  I wasn't sure if I was happy I hadn't lowered myself to the level that seemed required to command a position, or upset that I had failed to capitalize on a clear opportunity.  At what price, honor?""

---FIN---

Here's the kicker...the author of the blog is a woman.

1w4p5j,4,2014-01-25,I can't live here anymore. I don't know what to do.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1w4p5j/i_cant_live_here_anymore_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"It's gotten to the point where I just don't know what to do anymore. Today my mother and father officially lost me forever. All they care about is their money. Not me. I can't do this anymore. Maybe I'd be better off dead. Every day I'm verbally abused by my mother. Every day. She tells me I'm the most disgusting creature she has ever had the displeasure of knowing. Tells me I'm horrible, and that I'm insane. But I'm not, I'm a good person. I stayed strong with my girlfriend through cancer. (I'm 18 mind you.) We are still together, I'm a perfect A-B college student, I don't drink nor smoke, nor do drugs. I'm wonderful to my friends, and I'd do anything for them. But my mother still is terrible to me. Tells me how horrible and lazy I am, I have chronic depression and I'm on a well working cocktail. Due to her bipolar, I'm at risk for that as well. She's unmedicated because her doctor said she didn't need it anymore but her recent behavioral outbursts have gone over the line, so I don't believe that, regardless of her lithium buildup, she needs something. She yells at me every day to get a job, but I'm a full time student working hard and trying to get a research internship. It's not easy. Having a job would really hurt my schoolwork. Yes I've tried, but the only jobs I can get trigger anxiety attacks, cashier, waiter, fast food restaurant manager (was 17 for that one), I just can't do them without severe anxiety affecting every single aspect of my life. I would enjoy working in computers or cooking, but again jobs I can't get at the moment. Every day I'm screamed at and demeaned told I'm nothing, and I'll never be anything, that I'm a let-down failure, all because I'm not working 30+ hours a week while in college. I'm over a year ahead mind you. A year. Then two days ago my car stops working, well shit. My battery is dead and it's ~$150 for a new one. Great. Can't afford it. My dad says he shouldn't give me shit and I need a job. They've both already threatened to take me out of college. So here I am, school monday, no car, no money to fix it, getting screamed at and on the verge of screaming, and I want to escape the world and relax so I go to play video games... Wrong choice apparently, I get screamed at again and again by parents who don't care enough to help me, my shoes and my jacket get thrown outside into the 1ft of snow on the ground, and I can't very well get those without shoes. I own one pair of pants that fit me. One. My parents couldn't be bothered to even help get more. I know I sound like a stuck up piece of shit but I'm not. they really don't care. All they care about is their money. My dad... well him and my step-mom make in excess of ~400k per year, and constantly brag about how he sells houses on the side for an easy 50k two-three times per year, but then he doesn't have money to help me fix my car so I can go to school. I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't live with my mother or my father. I have parents that don't care about me. But if I try to move out, bye bye school. I've already done the costing and I'd have to work 40-45 hrs a week at a minimum wage job to be able to afford rent. I just don't know what to do anymore. I need help and have no where to go. Is it wrong that I don't care about my parents because they made me? That I only care about people who treat me well? Because I honestly hate them. If I never saw either of them again I don't think I'd be upset. I'd be happy that I wouldn't have to deal with their shit again, and I'd maybe be able to support myself with the life insurance. Yeah that's all I care about in the case of their deaths. Because I don't care about them any more.


EDIT: Update: She's called all of my friends and my girlfriend and turned them against me, telling them I am lazy and refuse to get a job, and that I'm going down a bad path and they should be worried. I can't trust anyone anymore. I don't know how much longer I can take this before I lose it. Help. I need help."

1w5poi,3,2014-01-25,"Thanks to this subreddit, I finally understand the problems in the relationship with my mother. Thank you.",jrmihalj,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1w5poi/thanks_to_this_subreddit_i_finally_understand_the/,"I was reading a story in another subreddit about a confrontation between a teenage girl and her mother, and I just felt a sinking feeling of empathy for her. A commenter directed this girl to /r/raisedbynarcissists and I was floored. 

My mom is a narcissist.

I'm a 25yo guy going to grad school in Colorado, but I was raised by my irish-catholic mother and father (who I love to death) in Chicago. I'm the first of my entire extended family of ~30 cousins to leave Chicago for more than just college. And my mom just can't handle it. 

When I went away to undergraduate in St. Louis (about 5hr drive from home), my mom equated this to me being ""abroad"". She would never come visit me (twice in 4 years); I was expected to visit home regularly or face an angry email or phone call that would stress me out for about a week. I decided to take summer internships in St. Louis for career reasons (and the fact that I loved what I was learning), and she could not understand why I would want to be away from home for so long. About every three months she would send me the same type of email accusing me of abandoning my brothers and the rest of the family (she'd never say that I was abandoning her). She would call me a bad brother for not seeing my siblings often enough. Then, when I decided to move to CO for grad school, shit hit the fan. I still deal with these emails and ""conversations"" in which I'm accused of hating the family...because why else would I leave home?

My mom also is racist at times, extremely judgmental of every single person, and extremely jealous of anyone with more money than our family. 

Most recently, I've moved in with my SO that I've been dating for two and a half years. After bringing him (yes, I'm gay, and that's a whole other set of problems) home to visit the family for the third time, my mom sent me an email saying that we're moving too fast, my SO doesn't have aspirations like I do and is probably not the best match for me. I was floored and devastated. I still am. But, the only way I know how to deal with her is to be calm and never accuse her of being wrong or hurtful. I basically ignored this incident, but it's still eating me up. 

I've always known my mom was a little off. I've mostly associated all of these characteristics and anxieties with the fact that she lost both of her parents before she was 22 years old. That must have been rough for her.

Now, thanks to this subreddit, I realize that I'm not insane and that I have a community to help me through all of this.

One thing I'd like to ask folks: Those of you who have moved away from a controlling mother/father and still want to keep in touch...how do you deal with this? How do you deal with constant guilty-tripping about being away from home, even when you're just following your dreams? That's the hardest part for me.

Anyway, thank you all for being open enough to post on this forum! 

**Edit**: I should add, most of the time my mother is pretty loving. She worries about everything, and she always says how proud she is. She just doesn't understand the healthy way to express these things. At least that's my take on it. "

1w5z6a,2,2014-01-25,Subsidies for Graduating Students?,isuphysics,obamacare,https://www.reddit.com/r/obamacare/comments/1w5z6a/subsidies_for_graduating_students/,"Sorry if this is not the place to ask personal advice.  If not, could someone direct me to someone I could speak with about my situation?  Thanks.

I am finalizing my divorce, and when I do I will lose my current health coverage. I am graduating in May and already have accepted a job.  The job I will have later in the year will provide healthcare and will make my estimated yearly income above the 46k subsidy limit.  But for the time being, I only work a part time internship. If you expanded my pay out I would be making around 12k a year and will be filing my taxes for 2013 at around 16k.  I do live, and will be staying, in a state that is expanding medicaid. I am 29 at the start of this year, but will be 30 by the time my divorce is finalized.

I am already struggling to keep a mortgage through the divorce and am not sure I could add another expense.  As well as family freaking out that I could have a 4 month lapse in insurance. Mainly due to a freak accident while uninsured that bankrupted my father a few years back.

I get free clinic visits from my school, but they insurance they offer is very expensive (1400/semester).

Also, the penalty isn't too steep, but I wasn't sure how it would be calculated if I was insured for 8 out of 12 months how would that be calculated?

Thanks

1w61jq,22,2014-01-25,Awkward moment at my local bank. Can I ever go back?,[deleted],TalesFromYourBank,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/1w61jq/awkward_moment_at_my_local_bank_can_i_ever_go_back/,"Some back story:

I spent my final semester of college living in another city as an intern and had moved into a house with several roommates, one of them being an eccentric law student with a real animated personality. Him and some of the other artsy-hipster type roommates always had really quirky inside jokes each other and for whatever reason, this eccentric guy used to dance around the house singing ""Huuuge Penis!"" The whole thing was absurdly hilarious. 

I had been living there about a week and ""Huuuge Penis!"" seemed to be the house phrase. The other guys would even greet each other with it. In fact it was so commonplace, that it even stopped being weird. 

Anyway, my hometown bank didn't have any branches in the new city so I opened up a new bank account. Sometime later back at my apartment, I'm setting up my online banking and it tells me to come up with a security phrase. While I'm doing this, this roommate in prancing around the house doing the huge penis thing, and in that moment I somehow found it appropriate to make HUGEPENIS my security phrase. 

This was about 4 years ago. Never ended up using the online banking that much and forgot the passwords. Recently decided to stop into the branch and set everything back up again. So I'm with the banker at his computer and he is asking some questions in order to pull up my account. We get to my page and then there it is, we both see it: HUGEPENIS. I die inside. I see his lips curl ever so slightly as he holds in his laughter. I change my passwords, nothing more is said and I leave as quickly as possible. I'm sure everybody there knows about it now.

"
1w6cno,1,2014-01-26,Is it over?,wanderaxb,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1w6cno/is_it_over/,"Apologies for the rambling that may take place here, but I'll try to keep it short and sweet:

Started a long distance relationship with my girlfriend whom I dated once before, with no one else between us breaking up and getting back together the first time. I was heading off to school and she was doing the same in our home town. So, 3 years go by and I've gotten to spend time with her between school years, during an internship back home, and on breaks. This past Christmas however may be my last time returning home, I'm not sure yet.

Every year has been harder to manage, and leaving gets harder and harder every time. We've talked about having a future together, where she'd move up North to live with me when she graduates, and we've held on to that to give us the strength to continue. But now I'm working more and going to class full time, and she has other commitments that bind her time as well.

Personally, I've had the easier time coping. I'm passionate about my work and schooling, and I have plenty of other things going on that distract me, but the distance never really crosses my mind unless I'm having a crappy week or something. For her, she can't stop thinking about it. Every year I can notice the strain on her more and more and I feel guilty, but we've kept on pushing through. But, then a break comes and I get to see her, and its like nothing ever happened and everything is sunshine and roses.

Recently, she's expressed to me that she doesn't feel like I have time for her, and she knows the distance magnifies any issues, but she just really wants for this to turn into a normal relationship already. She also said she's not sure if she can give up her life to move out to me. So, after several days of tense discussions on the difficulties and uncertainty, she said she needed a break, just to think. After one day, she said it made her feel worse and she just really misses me, etc.

My issue is that now, /I'm/ the one with uncertainty. To go from rarely having the distance cross my mind to having it be the only thing I can think about is a shock to me. I feel like I'm growing less optimistic about this relationship working out, which is the opposite of how I normally react, as the one trying to be supportive and optimistic for the future. I'm almost certain that the ""break"" we took is to blame and has shaken me. But I'm not sure when I'll see her again in person, or if things will feel better when we're together again like they have in the past. I almost feel like I have the responsibility to call it quits, just so as to not hurt her any further. But I do love her, and I don't want to act rashly.

So I guess I'd just like to hear if anyone has had a similar experience? Or if anyone's been in a similar spot, what got you out of it? Did everything melt away when you were together again?

(Thanks in advance everyone! I've lurked here from time to time for support and inspiration.)"

The reason I need this job is to buy an engagement ring for my girlfriend before I go off for Law School.

Suggestions?

I've applied a few places, heard back from 2/6 and those are no's, so I'm going to start hounding the managers of the other places.

I have 2 years experience as a cashier, and 1 year 4 months as a paid law intern (immigration law mostly).

If any of you know of anything, please let me know!"
1w6hy7,1,2014-01-26,Help Opening a Chrome-snapshot on an Ipad?,dnlsokoloff,techhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/techhelp/comments/1w6hy7/help_opening_a_chromesnapshot_on_an_ipad/,"Hi everyone, I am leaving for an internship with Disney early on the 27th, and was unable to print out my boarding pass as I was filling out the remainder of my paperwork on my computer. I took a screenshot with the free Chrome app, and emailed it to myself with the intention of printing it out when I got a chance. Before I could return, my computer inexplicably stopped charging, something easily fixed, but not before my trip to Florida. I have tried opening the Chrome screenshot from my email on my Ipad with the intention of printing it out, but to my horror, it tells me that the app cannot work with the Ipad os. Is there a work-around here? I desperately need to print this pass, and may not be able to check into my internship without it. Thanks in advance for reading this."

1w7l0l,1,2014-01-26,"Me [21 M] with my SO [21 F] of 2 years; I feel like I'm falling out of love, and I feel terrible about it because she still feels very strongly for me.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1w7l0l/me_21_m_with_my_so_21_f_of_2_years_i_feel_like_im/,"I've been with my loving girlfriend for 2 years.  We originally met at a party our freshman year of college; she was coming up from another university that was in the same city.  Long story short, we hooked up, and since I was interested, I asked her on a date.  We continued to see one another, and the rest is history.

Over the past two years, we've shared a lot of experiences and have become very involved in each other's lives.  Our families know each other, and I have spent a lot of time at her actual home.  Since I've always stayed in town for internships and the like, I've always had summers with her, and she's even visited my hometown with me a couple of times.

She isn't very social, so she doesn't have many close friends at her school.  She often reflects on this, saying the only people who text her are me, her mother, and her sister.  She's very well acquainted with my friends, and we often all hang out together as she stays at my place over the weekends.  She can definitely be a bit clingy at times.

Sexually, in my opinion at least, we have a few pitfalls.  She lost her virginity to me, which may account a bit for her degree of attachment.  She's also willing to pleasure me orally in many ways.  My issue is with vaginal sex.  She has a condition (vagismus) which makes sex very painful for her.  The only difficult part is insertion, however.  The main issue is that she gets sore from sex and as a result we don't have it nearly as often as I'd like.  This also means that we can't do it in as many positions as I would like, especially ones like doggy style.  She also doesn't seem to derive any sexual pleasure from penetration, although orally she has no problem (and I love giving her oral, when she wants it).

She recently studied abroad, so I had a few months to get used to what it was like not having her around, and, well, I kind of liked it.  It allowed me to focus on schoolwork and enjoy being by myself.  Now that she's back, I feel almost as though I'm not as excited to be with her anymore.  I'm struggling financially, so there isn't much we can do when we're together.  

I've expressed my issues with her, even that I've thought about breaking up, and I've been convinced to give her a second chance.  The only issue is that we can only ever see each other on the weekends because she studies downtown, so I feel like I don't have enough time with her to decide if this is really what I want.  To add to that, we still have sexual issues in that we'll be too tired at night and promise me some in the morning that inevitably never happens because she's too tired.

I feel like an asshole, because I think that my main qualms have to do with sexual issues.  There's also the fact that she still loves me very much while I don't really feel the same degree of infatuation anymore.  I feel as though I'm over ever satisfied right after we have sex, and that's likely only due to post-coital bliss.  On top of that, I'm so connected with her and her family and her friends, and I don't want all of that to disappear from my life.  I tear up just thinking about it.  I really want this to work, I just feel like it isn't and that I'm teasing on something that will never be at her expense.  I don't want her to be alone, I don't want to be alone, and I don't want such a large part of my life to be obliterated.

**tl;dr**:  I'm feel like I'm falling out of love with a girl who's still very much in love with me, and I don't know how to handle it."
1w7lvd,1,2014-01-26,VMware player not working for me.,PetaZShark,cs50,https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/1w7lvd/vmware_player_not_working_for_me/,"I followed the steps showed in the cs [manual](https://manual.cs50.net/appliance/19/player/) for installing VMWare player. Everything went ok. Then I downloaded the CS50 Appliance. When I launched VMWare player for the first time nothing prompted. I go to File &gt; Open, select the appliance and click **Import** (it is not **open**, as it says on the manual). It takes some time to set the appliance. Then I click run, the Virtual Machine appears as a black screen. It will not change ( I leaved it like that while I was sleeping). 

If I try to close it, a message saying ""*The virtual machine is busy*"" will prompt and will not let me close it. Then I kill the process (all the VMware ones). I open the player again and run the appliance and it says: ""*This virtual machine appears to be in use*"". I googled the error and the suggest to delete the .lk files on the virtual machine folder. I did that, opened again the player and tried to run it, but the error this time is: ""*Intern error*"". I tried several times to uninstall and install VMware player again, tried to delete the files of the vm and import the again, but everything happens again.

I'm using a 6 months old laptop (Acer Aspire V3 771G-6814). My graphics card is anIntel 4000 and NVIDIA GeForce GT 730M, currently using the  Intel 4000. My OS is Windows 8."

1w7zd1,14,2014-01-26,Documenting Glass Labs - XE12,fodawim,googleglass,https://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1w7zd1/documenting_glass_labs_xe12/,"Ok guys, following my post yesterday I started digging around in the Labs. I decided to investigate the Labs and show you guys what's being cooked up.

**To Enable Labs see below.**

First of all, enabling labs requires a rooted Glass unit, for that you can [go here.](https://developers.google.com/glass/tools-downloads/system) After your Glass is rooted you then pull your `build.prop` using `adb`.

    adb pull /system/build.prop LOCATION/ON/COMPUTER/build.prop

I would very greatly recommend backing this up. Now that you have your `build.prop` you need to do some edits.

Find the line that starts with `ro.build.type` and change it from

`ro.build.type=user`  
to  
`ro.build.type=userdebug`

Now to enable a lab simply put `persist.lab.[LAB_NAME]=true` in your `build.prop`. To disable do the same but replace `true` with `false`. If you want to revert to the default simply remove the line.

After you make the changes to your `build.prop` simply push it back to your Glass.

    adb push /PATH/TO/build.prop /system/build.prop

Now that your new `build.prop` is on Glass simply reboot and the labs should be enabled.

***note: the lab name should be lowercase, for example the lab `HMI_SRT` should be `persist.lab.hmi_srt=true`***

&amp;nbsp;

**Labs and what they do**

Well, this is going to be a BIG pain to get everything formatted on reddit, so I am [using a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AlkO-H_Q0kkOdFdzNVhFOHBVS0xnREk0VzBPcnR5T2c&amp;output=html) to keep track of stuff. I am still working on this but here are some of the newer Labs that I think are awesome.

**C_W_PW_INPUT - Connect [to] Wifi Password Input**

**EA - Eye Animation**  
This is somewhat of a more visual lab, all it does is add an animation for taking a picture with the camera button. It adds a sort of ""blink"" animation. Since this is hard to get an example of I got the best example I could.

Please bear with me as I try to get all the Labs documented but I just really wanted to get this out seeing as some of the labs are so awesome. I have to give a shoutout to the dev team for some of these as they can really enhance the Glass experience. When the next update is pushed I plan on investigating the Labs again and continuing with this as long as possible. :)

1w858j,1,2014-01-26,The frustrated law student Off My Chest round 3,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1w858j/the_frustrated_law_student_off_my_chest_round_3/,"So this is my third time posting here since I started law school in August 2012. I pretty much use this username exclusively for this purpose, and then delete the history. Oh well.

Last time I posted here was actually about a year ago. I was looking for a job for my first summer (between 1L and 2L year). I was down on my luck after sending nearly 100 applications and having no positive feedback. However, lo and behold, I managed to get not one, but *two* jobs last summer, and both were wonderful experiences. Funny enough, the two jobs I got did not require a cover letter, and neither did the internship I got for my Fall semester. Looking back, my cover letters were shit and may have contributed to my prior failure, but I digress.

Now, as my second summer approaches, my frustration has returned once more. For those who are unfamiliar with the typical law school experience, the second summer is very important for future employment. It is essentially a ""try out"" in that you work for a firm/organization/company in the hopes that you do well enough for them to ask you to work after graduation (law school is only 3 years, and sometimes they ask you to work part time during the third year as well). With the legal market the way it is, things are tough, to say the least. Last semester I sent out over 100 applications to firms looking for placement, but I got rejection after rejection. It took a massive toll on my confidence, one that I've never experienced before. But, as it's been said, sometimes you have to hit rock bottom before you can make it to the top.

I have a few things in the works now, including a couple leads through connections I've made, some promising resources starting to build, and so on. Unfortunately, nothing is set in stone just yet. I think I have anxiety to some degree (which wouldn't surprise me; it's very prevalent in my father's side of the family), but I'm learning to subdue it on my own. Just the other day a colleague at my current internship told me he landed a job just by cold mailing firms. My immediate reaction was to look up whatever firm I could in anticipation of sending applications, but I stopped myself. I did that last semester and it's the worst way to look for a job. I took a deep breath, then a hot shower, and reassured myself that what I have going on is working and has potential to keep working, so I shouldn't freak out.

I've had this vision over and over in my head, where in a few years I have a job I'm really proud about, and I'm out meeting people in a social setting and they ask me what I do and I can proudly say ""I'm an attorney."" I mean, I *will* be an attorney, but I want to have a good job too, I don't think that's too much to ask. 

I'm not a big believer in fate, but sometimes I wonder. I've been pushing for private sector/firm jobs, thinking I could break into corporate law. I love business law generally, but I've always been a public advocate, and many would think to two do not mesh. However I tried my hand at applying to government jobs where business regulation/litigation was the main focus, and so far I've had a positive response. I wouldn't mind public work, especially in the business sense. Hell, my family suffered through the subprime mortgage crisis just like many did, so maybe I'm meant to enter that area and help sort that stuff out. The pay isn't great, sure, but it's valuable work that I would be proud of doing. 

I'm rambling now, I know. I doubt anyone has even read this far but I think it helps just to write this stuff down. I have to work on my note for my journal now. It's about a very specific way the law can change to help businesses be more socially conscious. For many that's boring, but maybe it's exactly what I should be focusing on. Until next time..."

Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) are salesmen whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital world.

But, gaining entrance to this utopia is only half the battle. Now they must compete with a group of the nation's most elite, tech-savvy geniuses to prove that necessity really is the mother of re-invention.

1w8kya,3,2014-01-26,Beyond Fe,[deleted],enfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/1w8kya/beyond_fe/,"It's been about a year since I got into mbti and found out that I was an ENFJ. Overall being able to examine one's strengths and weaknesses as an ENFJ and understand the other personality types has been tremendously helpful, even if mbti is at best an imprecise measure. By and large a lot of the posts on this subreddit seem to deal with Fe which makes sense since it is the ENFJ's dominant function and the most easily identified outward marker of our personalities. But as I have more closely examined the other functions we have: Ni, Se, and Ti I've begun to pay more attention to how I use or disuse those functions in solving everyday challenges. Because lets face it Fe alone won't get you everywhere. For example right now I'm doing a regression analysis for a economics project. I've been able to use Fe to reconnect with former bosses at internships to get data. But otherwise I see my own use of Ni becoming more apparent as I draw connections between variables, and hypothesize result. So I'm curious, since developing beyond the dominant functions is so vital for anyone to mature. In what ways have you all seen yourself use your non-dominant functions and how have you developed them?"
1w8pvu,9,2014-01-26,Illustration - Career,[deleted],Illustration,https://www.reddit.com/r/Illustration/comments/1w8pvu/illustration_career/,"Hello ladies and lords. I'm a 24 year old postgraduate illustration student in London and I can't wait to become a professional.

My question(s) is about building a career. More specifically, building a permanent career in London. I'm an international student, and if I don't find a stable job after I graduate, I'm going to have to go back to my country: which is nice and warm, -but not as full of artistic opportunities as London- back to my family's house, the comfort zone, where I can get Comfortably Numb, forget about time and age, devour crisps and kill zombies while feeling slightly guilty about being so unproductive. Anyways.. (beware! the wall of text is being built)

I'm open for any kind of suggestion and advice being a total noob in the industry. It'd be extra awesome latte if you tell me about the UK / London illustration market.

I've studied fine arts for my bachelor degree back in my hometown, where I oil-painted models day after day for about 5 years. I don't like oil painting too much as I'm rather ADD and impatient. I prefer to work with watercolours, ink, markers, or digital painting where I can quickly finish and see the result. Plus, I've just never been fond of the art-world, instead of ginormous abstract paintings and trying to decipher fancy art statements, I'm more into quirky little drawings and creepy stories.

I've started doing my master here in London about 3 months ago and I have my student visa with a 20 hours a week work permit, till January 2015. I've got plenty of time I suppose, but I heard that I should find a job a few months prior my visa expires so that I can get the working visa, and, well, get to working.

As I said I'm pretty new to the job field. I've done a handful of random freelance illustrating jobs so far, character design, book illustration and such, all in my home country. I was super awkward, and still am, about the pricing, requirements and all, never had a proper written agreement.

Right now I'm trying to find out about all kinds of jobs that an illustrator can do, so I can search and apply for the ones that will suit me best. 
I really like book illustrations, posters, cd~album artwork, package design, storyboarding.. Character design, concept art, comics, webcomics.. As well as video games and films, so anything art related in these would be amazing. [like platinum amazing](http://i605.photobucket.com/albums/tt132/angeljs/Newbit%20Tutorial/Snap_20110215_19h35m59s_031.jpg)  
I love dark, mysterious, wicked stuff, and my favourite homo sapiens are Tim Burton, Chris Priestley and Neil Gaiman, to give you an idea. 
I've been searching for competitions, reading about freelance, pricing and paperwork, but if I want to stay in the UK, I need to have a permanent job. Thanks to my family's amazing support, I could get by for a while without earning a lot of money, but again, visa issue is restricting me.. As a B Plan for extending my time here, I'm also considering internships.

I've seen quite a few permanent jobs on the web, but most of them are for graphic design or web design, and I'm not interested in this type of technical work of design. 
I'm also working on having a proper portfolio, something fullname.com instead of my deviantart page, which is a teenage mutant ninja thing to have I guess..
Speaking of which, here's my links where you can take a look at my illustrations or just stalk me on a rainy Tuesday night. 
[Categories](http://flavors.me/nazlioluz)
[Deviant](http://nazlioluz.deviantart.com)
[Facebook](http://facebook.com/nazlicorp)

So please tell me about your experiences, what has worked for you and what hasn't, physical postcard spamming, emails, how to connect with ""the right"" people.. Should I apply for agencies and reps? Which are good websites for job hunting? What is the best option for a stable job, does it even exist? Will I have to do graphic design,logos and page layouts? Or freelance till my visa runs out, just for the XP? Would you green-card marry me? Which cave should I hide in when my visa is finished? [btw, the cave](http://thecavegame.com) What's you favourite colour?

Thank you very much for reading all of this, wow! You've really reddit! I've written 9 paragraphs more than I was planning. I look back to delete things and shortify, but alas! I can't..They're all my babies, my little infected spawns. So, congratulations on finishing my essay. .. Now take a cup of tea, relax, and tell me things if you like! 
Have a great week!"
1w8s1l,1,2014-01-26,"Me [20 M] with my Friend with benefits? [21 F] 1.5 strange years, girl is all over me not just sexually but won't commit?",AvidCyclist,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1w8s1l/me_20_m_with_my_friend_with_benefits_21_f_15/,"To preface I'm an engineering student at a small school in a small town in Colorado. I met this girl who is also an engineer. At first we would do homework together and then things got more serious. 

I asked her out and after about a week she said no. We continued to hang out. 

We then went on a humanitarian trip to Ecuador together. We had slept with one another as like a one night stand type of thing but nothing serious. In Ecuador we both had decided to travel for a week afterwards and had made preliminary plans to travel with one a another. She was seeing another girl at this point and me and none of her friends liked this girl. It was annoying just being around her. So...back to Ecuador. By the end of said humanitarian project we both have to have one another. We traveled to beach and spent 7 glorious days with one another. We hardly left each other alone for 7 days. It was beautiful. 

When we got back to the US I was expecting her to break up with the other girl and we would start some sort of relationship. She told me that she wasn't ready to do that. I was obviously upset. 9 days later they broke up. I was soon riding my bike across the country. We would text each other lengthy conversations and by the time school started up we both knew that we wanted something between the two of us. She again started fooling around with another girl. Again none of her friends nor I liked her. We were friends for a while. But there was a lot of sexual tension between the two of us. 

After this past Christmas break we both hooked up. I thought it was a fluke again like the last times. But we spent a week or so doing this. I eventually asked her on a date and she said yes. I then mentioned something about us having some sort of relationship and she freaked out. 

I was pretty upset. And I tried to get to a point where I was ok with her having sex with other boys or girls. Like an open relationship. I didn't want this to happen but the physical and emotional connection between the two of us is pretty insane. This past weekend she hooked up with another guy. Again I was pretty upset. But I calmed myself knowing that we were still going to be friends. 

My real question is am I hurting myself by expecting something from this girl? Do I need to move on? We're planning on again traveling on a humanitarian mission to Nicaragua, and have applied and hope to get the same internship together this summer. I feel like we are already a couple. We spend 80 percent of our time with one another we really enjoy the time spent with one another. But she is scared because she is young and doesn't want to commit to a relationship. She's also had relationship issues in the past. I have put a lot of work and effort into this and it isn't always reciprocated. Our goals align in every aspect except that she doesn't want a relationship. 

What do I do. 



---   
tl;dr

Girl and I have had off and on Again relationship for about a year. Our goals and life aspirations align and we spend a lot of time together. But she has had relationship issues  in the past and doesn't want to commit. What should I do? "
1w908a,8,2014-01-26,Thinking about going back to school to be a Dental Hygienist. If you wouldn't mind answering a couple of questions...,[deleted],Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1w908a/thinking_about_going_back_to_school_to_be_a/,"I'm a 25 year-old Software Engineer who is miserable. In high school I always wanted to become a Dentist, but I decided to take the path of least resistance in terms of finding a job and studied Computer Science. I should have known I wouldn't like this career path when both of my internships during school brought on a full-blown depression. I don't do well staring at a computer screen for 8+ hours a day. However, when I took Bio courses/labs in college, I had a great time.



Anyway, here are my questions:


2. Is the career as safe as it sounds? It appears through market surveys that it's still a flourishing career path, and there's very little unemployment in the field.

3. As a male, will I run into any kind of resistance or sexism in the field? I know it's a female-dominated career path but I'd hope that's not really an issue.

4. Will a certificate program be all I need to start my career, or will I need to do a Bachelor Degree in Dental Hygiene?

1w975b,1,2014-01-26,Boyfriend says he's willing to support me while I am still in school but the independent female inside of me has different thoughts...,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1w975b/boyfriend_says_hes_willing_to_support_me_while_i/,"My boyfriend (25M) is graduating soon to his high paying professional job and wants me to move in because we barely get to see each other as is. He likes the idea of having me to come home to and getting to see me every day, like sleeping over with your best friend every day.

However, I (21F) cannot pay rent and live comfortably. I go to college while living with my parents. I will probably work poor paying internships to achieve my dream of becoming a web/graphic designer after I graduate in 2 years.

He fully understands this and says he is completely okay with paying 100% of the rent and just have me cook and pay for groceries. He will do chores but majority of cooking will be up to me because he doesn't know how and it would be my compensation of not paying rent. He says it won't cost him more than him living by himself and it would even save him money in the end because he won't have to buy food all the time when he's too busy to cook.

We've only been dating 6 months. He's graduating at our 1 year mark. We get along great and do see a future together. Whenever we have long breaks from school, I spend majority of my time at his place.

I'm just unsure if I am making a mistake if I move in. Should I even let an SO pay for big things like rent? I've always been very independent so I have no idea what's appropriate and what's not. I feel like I would feel guilty buying unnecessary things like makeup and nice clothing from my own income if I don't contribute to rent even if he says he doesn't mind. Anyone else have experience moving in with an SO? I know it's definitely not like sleeping over with your best friend.

Can you ladies give me some good advice?"

Then college happened. 

I've been super busy. Busy doing programming work, busy finding an internship, busy doing research, busy with relationships, busy with Corps stuff. Kinda sad that I had to drop concert band this semester, but now I'm taking a class called Intro to performance technology. This weeks project involved making my own musical instrument out of spare electronic parts and legos. I'll post a video of it eventually.

I've got interviews happening soon, some with some amazing opportunities. 

Research is fantastic, and I'm learning so much doing it. Its amazing what happens when there is no set way of solving a problem. 

Well, that's about it for my life. I would post about ponies and of the like, but to be honest I haven't watched an episode since the first week of school. I hear Discord had a song? Oh well. Maybe during spring break I can Mareathon them all. 

Its like midnight right now...I need to go to sleep, but there is so much work to be done...

1w9igf,4,2014-01-27,"I need some advice, feeling a bit lost. (Maybe long story, sorry)",Spunkmasterc,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1w9igf/i_need_some_advice_feeling_a_bit_lost_maybe_long/,"First of all I'm feeling really down, I've never really felt that great before. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression for over 10 years now. I'm now it what should be my final year in university but isn't because I have failed/withdrawn from a few classes. Elementary- High school was hard I was always bullied, always put down, always sick or injured, lost my father and had some horrific events that lead to PTSD and major anxiety. I'm only about 60% of the way done with school in a B.S major at a pretty good school. School has been hard, academically and socially, I don't have many friends, no clubs, no frats or anything. I have this allergy to just about everything that can send me into anaphylactic shock and in this past summer I had a severe spinal injury that leaves me unable to partake in the thing I love the most, the outdoors. Since this is my final year, and Winter Semester I can't really join any clubs or do anything. Anyways I just took a 4 month study-abroad break to ""re-discover"" myself that ended up wasting tons of money and just making me further depressed because the program I was with was full of only rich American bullies. The bank foreclosed on my house a few days before we left, the money we received payed for our trip.

The one thing that I had going for me was this awesome house, the landlord is a few years older than me but he was my best friend and the house was amazing. I was going to move out in June because the land lord had more permanent members moving in. Two weeks before I was to move out the other people bailed, and he asked me to stay. Sure why not? Well now it was summer, try sub leasing the room in summer to fall. He knew that I would be back in January and so I thought everything would work out, I was very depressed at the time leaning towards the deep end. So we said that I would pay the summers rent and he would look for a subleaser, sure why not he's a trustworthy guy right? Wrong? He took my money for July and August. To pay for the room I dropped a great internship (unpaid) so I could get a job at a summer camp which lead to my injury, the summer camp was way out in the boonies and I had no phone or internet connect, I pre-wrote the checks and he had my mothers contact information if anything went wrong. I hurt my back and suffered from partial paralysis for weeks and he never contacted me, I had to contact him saying that August month would be late because of my injury my paychecks were delayed, no problems, no mention of anything off putting. I spent September-December in Europe, I had some money from the house being sold in September. 

I get back in January, most of my stuff is gone, he had my e-mail to contact me which we agreed upon and my mothers info. The weird thing was only my nice things were gone, nice furniture, the things I cared about. My grandmothers desk (she has since passed) was defiled and part of his strange art exhibit right outside my door, my room when I moved back in was dirty and smelled of cat pee. He did not mention where anything was, or that anything was missing. He is being a total dick to me, humiliating me, I have no idea what to do, I can't stand up for myself. He just makes fun of me and is placing unfair rules of the house. He says that I did not pay for summer which I did and he said some horrible things to my mother. Every time I see the desk defiled I want to sock the guy, but I’m too passive. 

I feel more depressed and hopeless than in my entire life, between my lack of friends, home, father allergy, back pain, and this ugly situation I am lost of what to do. I feel suicidal constantly, I go into fits of rage, sleeplessness, hopelessness and just pure depression.I recently had my first story published and I feel that I may want to pursue that while I ""recover..."" I don't know if I should just dropout and move back with my mother and grandpa, confront him, move out, lawsuit or what? I'm looking for advice... I'm just feeling lost. Any words of wisdom, or advice would be much appreciated."

The Federal Reserve is hiring!",GreyPooponPoop,vcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/vcu/comments/1wa45m/looking_for_an_internship_in_a_math_science_or/,"So I've been working at the federal reserve for the past 14 months in the Currency Technology Office, but my contract ends in May when I graduate. Right now they are looking to hire two new interns to replace me and the other intern who graduated in December. 

It's a really sweet deal.  During breaks like summer and winter, you can work full time (at around $15/hr), and then during the school year they let you set your own schedule to fit around your classes. They're looking for someone who won't be graduating for at least a year, because it really does take time to figure out all of the different projects. 

The job posting is here, so get applying!

 (Note: I'll be doing a lot of the training for my replacement, so I want it to be some one cool.  That's the main reason I'm advertising this so much. )"

I'm a lurker over at /r/Accounting but I've just received an offer for a Finance Internship at a mid-sized Fortune 500 utilities company (~7500 employees)! Just let me know if this is the wrong place to post. 

I'm an Accounting major in my Junior year and haven't really taken many Finance courses so I'm a little apprehensive about this. I'll be rotating around a few areas of the company including risk management, enterprise risk, the employee pension department, audit, and the accounting department. 

I've been told I'll need to be proficient in Excel (Vlookup and Pivot Tables were stressed). I'll need to practice those because I've never used them. Otherwise, I'm pretty well-versed in Excel in its basic functions. 

Does anybody have advice other than brush up on Financial Statements and ratios? The internship starts in mid-May so I've got some time. 

Thanks in advance!"

1wblfx,8,2014-01-27,My family and their animals. Evidence of deeper issues maybe.,Pokot,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1wblfx/my_family_and_their_animals_evidence_of_deeper/,"Certain events have transpired over the last couple of days that make me very sad and quite confused at the same time. I wanted to get that off my chest but maybe at the same time think about what happened and what that means. I'm not super eloquent but I'll try my best.

This is mostly about family animals, extreme carelessness, and some thoughts on why what happened - happened.

I'll probably start with saying that I'm a male in my late twenties living in an apartment in the city. My immediate family consisting of mother, step father, and a brother lives in a house outside the city. 

Early in 2000s mother and step father rescued this lovely abused dog that has lived with us untill a couple of years ago. We lived in the apartment together at the time and took care of the dog together. Eventually, the family made a decision to move outside the city and took the dog with them. Not much time passed and they got really bored with walking the dog by themselves so they decided the best idea was to just let him out of the house and wait for him to return. At that time I begged them to not do that or at least get a badge with phone number attached to the collar. Unfortunately, they wouldn't even consider puttting a collar on before letting him out. As you can imagine, at some point the dog didn't return. I was deeply hurt.

I want to stress that the idea of letting the dog out alone belonged entirely to my step father but nobody except me tried to stop him.

About a year ago my brother, now almost twenty years of age, decided he wanted to have another dog for himself. That is considering he has a very demanding job in the city so he only spends 3 days a week at home at most and also the fact that he is preparing for an internship outside of the country. I once again not asked but begged them to reject the idea, but one day him and step father brought home a small jack russell puppy.

Since then less than a year passed. The dog was cared, fed and walked almost exclusively by my mother. It also spent more than a month with me because step father started going on many business trips taking mother with him and naturally, nobody else was there to take the dog in except me.

During my time with the dog I, as a responsible and more or less intelligent adult (I hope so), have learned and discovered a lot of information about owning a dog by yourself and one of the most important things, I think, was that considering this breed a certain level of training had to be completed both by the dog and the master no questions asked. I've actually went as far as to find a decent dog trainer. This was about 4 months ago.

Since then I was sure to remind parents that they had to do the training. Or if they didn't want to, they should've at least try to train the dog themselves. I've been sighed at, moaned at, told they'd do it and finally told to f*ck off. No training has been completed.

On Saturday the dog has been killed by a driver right in front of their house. 

What happened is, and I want to stress it again, this was when the dog was walking with step father (he told me the story himself a couple of hours ago) - he was in the yard doing whatever, he saw that the neighbour who has a tendency to drive fast everywhere warming up the car, he knew the dog was protective of the house and often running at cars and he did nothing. The car started moving and ganing speed, the dog ran towards it, he couldn't stop the dog or tell it to return because, well, no basic training. The end.

Right now my mother is at her house trying to get over the whole thing. I didn't know till today, I called her and asked about the dog as I usually do. When I heard a slight pause in her voice, I immediately knew. My step father is on a business trip. He explained the whole thing on skype and commented that this was ""god's decision"" so safe to say he's not exactly worried. My brother, when I called him, was drunk in some restaurant in the city celebrating whatever.

I can say that I am deeply hurt, again. I sit here and I don't get why it had to happen.

I don't understand why my advice always get ignored. I've stated that I'm not exactly very young and I do have some life experience.

I also can not help but notice a certain connection between what my step fathers moves and what happened to those animals. Both of those might've been accidents of course. But the problem is, I think he is a sociopath. He's been a huge pain to deal with earlier in my life and only calmed down a couple of years ago. And my mother has always been so submissive to the point of phasing stuff out and pretending it doesn't exist. I don't know about my brother.

I'm very confused right now. Aside from pain it has brough me again, I should probably draw some conclusions. But what are those? I don't know.

1wbmg5,0,2014-01-27,"Me [23 M] with my GF [21 F] for 2 years, I care about her but I want to sleep with other girls.",throwaway102291,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wbmg5/me_23_m_with_my_gf_21_f_for_2_years_i_care_about/,"Me and my GF have been in an exclusive relationship for 2 years now.
We are both student but I'm in a year where I must do interships.

Everything was great but she then left the country to study abroad for 1 year.
Since I knew she would leave, the plan for me was to join her as fast as possible by finding an internship in the same country.
I finally found this internship but it was a little late (because of the problems with the Visa and all the papers with my school), and she had to leave without me.

At this point, it was clear for both of us that we were still in a relationship, despite the distance.  At the start it was hard and we missed each other, we had a classic distant relationship. But after 2 months, we started to get distant from each other, I pointed it out and things went a little bit better, but after a while everything was back at the 5 texts a day.

Finally, after 4 months, she came back for the holidays, we were happy to see each other but it was not like before, I had the feeling she was constantly pissed at me for no reason.

After the holidays together, we took a flight together to the country she is studying in because my papers were finally ready and my internship was about to start.

Here, our cities are 2 hours in bus distant so we visit each other every 2 weekends, and when we do we usually see no one else, because she doesn't like to go out exept to visit some places or have a walk. I'm usually fine with that but I start to be bored everytime I'm with her.

On the other hand, when I'm not with her, I go out with my roomies and really enjoy my life, but not at it's fullest as I refuse to cheat or make out with other girls.

Last week, I almost broke up with her because of a huge fight in which she accused me of beeing selfish, not beeing enought attentive and romantic. And I jumped on the occasion to say how much we are different and I more or less said I wanted to take a break. Finally I started to freak out because I still care about her and we shared so much, and I went this very night to her city to appologize.

And we went back together.

When we are together, I feel good but it's not very exciting and I really feel like I'm wasting my youth. I never tried sleeping with a girl for one night and I only had 2 girlfriends, I really feel like I should be out there enjoying my life and ""try"" to be with other girls with different character.

Just to add something I really feel like she's not attracted to me physically as I'm always the one initiating sex (I did not have this problem with her before the 4 months of distance) and it happens that we don't have sex during a weekend even if it's the only time I can see her in 2 weeks.

I really don't know what I should do and if I'm beeing a moron who can't enjoy the things he has.
I really want to fully enjoy my life but I'm too afraid to regret leaving her and I mainly don't want to hurt her as I still care about her (she sees a therapist for a long term depression problem).

---   
**tl;dr**: Went through distant relationship with gf, and since i'm bored with her and want to enjoy my life at it's fullest by seeing other girls but i still care about her so fucking much and don't want to hurt her."

I am currently doing an internship in Dublin and one of my project is to teach young people (i mean as well complete beginners) the basics of Photoshop, and provide them with games and funny tasks to realize to help them learning while having fun.

For one of those funny games, I would like to""erase"" the face of a man or a woman, for them to build their faces back, adding eyes, noses, eyebrows that I would have previously cut off. By erasing I mean kind of making the face blank, using the same color skin that the rest of the face have.
I have been trying using the clone stamp tool and playing with the different shades that I could find on the face. 


[Attempt](http://i.imgur.com/PBleMDq)


[Original image](http://i.imgur.com/5ITljD8)

But somehow I am not completely convinced by what I did. 
I have tried as well with different brushes and even attempted to copy a small portion of the skin to make it as texture.

I was wondering if you guys could kindly give me some tips on how to improve what I have already done.

Regards,

Cheuch

Ps : I am pretty new to Reddit and english is not my mother tongue, so please feel free to tell if I have done/said something wrong :) "

1wc2c0,4,2014-01-27,I [24/M] am feeling guilty about moving out of my mother's [52/F] house,breakingoff,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wc2c0/i_24m_am_feeling_guilty_about_moving_out_of_my/,"In less than two weeks, I'll be getting on a plane to fly to Seattle.

I haven't told my mother this, and as of right now I have no plans to tell her. I'm actually terrified to tell her. Which is kind of weird, isn't it? Except I know she won't react well at all, because I've suggested me moving out in the past and it tends to end... poorly. The best response I've gotten is a ""We'll see.""

The last time I brought this up was about a month ago when my best friend offered to pay for my ticket to Seattle, and offered a room to stay in. The response started off with, ""Why Seattle? It's so far away."" And quickly moved to, ""What about Kansas? You could get a job in your field in Wichita."" Then, ""You know, your friend's dad works in Baltimore. Maybe you could get a job where he works. Then you'd be close to home."" And ending with mentioning finding work in a city in the state I live in.

The fact of the matter is... I can't get a job here, or in a nearby city, because I have no car. No transport means no job, because the public transportation sucks. This even extends to employment outside of what I went to college for, because of how isolated everything is where I live. You really need a car to get a job.

Wichita is utterly impractical for a couple of reasons. One: It's just as isolated, which means flying there would be expensive and I'd still end up needing a car. Two: I don't know anyone there, so I'd need to find a place to live, which would cost money I don't have. 

Seattle would be the most practical, because it's inexpensive to fly to, has great public transportation, I have a friend there with a spare room, and it has a lot of employers in my field... But she only cares about the fact that it's all the way across the country.

And she's pulled crap like this in the past. Like, after college I moved in with my sister for a bit, and did *not* want to go home, to the point where when she called insisting I come home for the holidays I was in tears. And then she had the gall to say I was obviously miserable there because my sister wasn't letting me talk to her, and that's why I needed to come home, despite me telling her that I was happy with my sister and that I did not want to leave. I ended up going back because of my grandfather, with the promise I could return after the holidays. Needless to say, that didn't happen.

Once, when I walked out of the house to cool down after an argument, she hunted me down. When she found me, she said she would call the cops and have me locked up if I ever did something like that again, and that if I'd been hurt or killed while I was gone it would've been all my fault for running away. Note that at that time I was 19, so by all rights an adult. And I had been planning on coming home shortly after leaving anyways (as she found me when I was walking back to the house).

I get the impression that she doesn't particularly want me to have a life separate from her? I hadn't intended to go to college, but she insisted I would be a failure if I didn't. So I went. She co-signed my loans, and then insisted that they were taken care of (I've never even seen a piece of mail about them since), yet apparently I now have collection companies calling other relatives about the loans. I need to take tests for professional licenses, but I can never get her to settle on a firm date for me to take them... except I need her to do this because I need a ride to the testing center. Worst of all, I worked an internship this summer that only paid by direct deposit. I do not have a bank account solely in my name, so I had to have my pay deposited into one she set up for me. And now she won't give me any of my money, probably because I expressed wanting to use it to try to move and find work.

I really feel like if she knew I was planning to leave, and soon, she'd prevent me from leaving somehow. But then I go, no, that's silly and irrational. She's just worried about me, y'know? She doesn't want anything bad to happen to me, which is why she wants me close to home. Even if it's hard to find work. So I really should tell her I'm leaving... right?

**tl;dr**: I'm moving across the country soon, and feeling guilty about not telling my very protective mother yet. Should I tell her? Or just leave?"
1wcjoz,1,2014-01-27,I'm a privileged high schooler than wants to just end it all.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1wcjoz/im_a_privileged_high_schooler_than_wants_to_just/,"I've lost it. I've just fucking lost it. All the expectations, all of the pressure from my parents to do well in school and get a good SAT score to get into some top college is just getting to me. I can't take it. I hate my parents. I hate myself. I don't know how, or when, or where, but I just want to end it all. I keep telling myself that I'm fine, and that I should be just okay, and I shouldn't feel this sadness and anger. But I keep feeling it, and I need to get it off my chest. 

Who am I? I'm that kid who enrolls in honors and AP's, the well-dressed kid who tries in school. The kid who gets up at 3 am everyday to study. I'm that kid who comes to school in a nice car but isn't a douche. I'm that kid who everyday, works at an internship in a bio lab, who teaches after-school science to elementary schoolers. I'm that kid who plays the piano, but people don't know that. I'm the kid who loves rap and hip hop, basketball, movies, and hanging out with friends. I'm that kid that everyone thinks is smart, who studies, yet goes to parties and occasionally drinks or smokes. I'm the kid who talks to girls, has a lot of friends, but isn't in the popular group. Yet at the same time, I'm that kid who has problems inside, struggles with his self-esteem and self-worth, the kid who can't maintain a relationship with the one's he really desires, the kid who puts on a mask everyday to hide his insecurities and problems, and everyone thinks is just happy. That kid is me. I am that kid. This is who I am.

I'm 16 years old, a junior in a private school in Washington State. My parents make a lot of money, I get pretty much what I want, but my parents expect me to get good grades, get a good SAT, and get into some top 25 school. My older sister got a high 2300's on her SAT and got full scholarships to some schools (she's a sophomore at an ivy league right now), and now the pressure is on me. I just had finals two weeks ago, and they were far from what I wanted. I'm taking relatively harder classes than some (3 AP + 1 Honors class), but this semester I pulled a 3.45 GPA. With my cumulative at a high 3.6, its going to drop, and I knew I couldn't let this happen my junior year. I take the SAT in a month, and I'm under so much pressure to get a 2200+, yet I don't know if I can even do it. I don't know what to do. I got into a huge argument with my parents tonight, and I just fucking lost it. I don't think they understand how I feel, they sort of just expect that I should be able to pull a 4.0 without a problem, but they don't get that its not that easy for me. 

I feel worthless. Like I'm not even worth being alive. Whats the point of living when you're not happy? Just because I can drive a nice car and wear nice clothes doesn't make me happy with myself. At school I put on a mask. A mask, where on the outside I try to portray myself as genuinely happy, when deep inside I am so troubled with the thought that I'm not good enough for my parents; that I've always disappointed them, and I always will. I will never be what they want me to be. And more importantly, I will never be what I want to be. I want to go to a good college, get an engineering degree, become successful, make a good amount of money, and start a family. But I feel so lost. I feel so fucking helpless. I'm scared of the future because I feel that I can't accomplish what I want to accomplish. 

As I'm writing this, I feel that its so trivial. People reading this might just ask themselves: ""Wow this rich kid is just pissed he can't pull a 3.6 GPA"". And yeah, I realize that maybe my GPA isn't that bad. I mean, I know people who struggle to pull a 3.0. But at the same time I don't think its just all about my GPA, its about how I feel. I'm angry at myself. Why can't I just do what the smart kids are able to do without even trying? Why can't life just be easier for me? How am I ever going to live with myself if I fail? I can't fail. I'm not some kid who sits in his basement playing video games while his grades drop through the toilet. 

Well, this is how I feel about my life. I hate my life. I hate myself. I hate my parents. I hate everything about where I am and who I am. I'm just not good enough. I'm not good enough for my family, or the world.

1wcte5,1,2014-01-28,Me [21M] feeling less confident in my relationship with Gf [20F] after 3 years of long distance dating. Is it over? [xpost from r/longdistance],wanderaxb,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wcte5/me_21m_feeling_less_confident_in_my_relationship/,"Apologies for the rambling that may take place here, but I'll try to keep it short and sweet:

Started a long distance relationship with my girlfriend whom I dated once before, with no one else between us breaking up and getting back together the first time. I was heading off to school and she was doing the same in our home town. So, 3 years go by and I've gotten to spend time with her between school years, during an internship back home, and on breaks. This past Christmas however may be my last time returning home, I'm not sure yet.

Every year has been harder to manage, and leaving gets harder and harder every time. We've talked about having a future together, where she'd move up North to live with me when she graduates, and we've held on to that to give us the strength to continue. But now I'm working more and going to class full time, and she has other commitments that bind her time as well.

Personally, I've had the easier time coping. I'm passionate about my work and schooling, and I have plenty of other things going on that distract me, but the distance never really crosses my mind unless I'm having a crappy week or something. For her, she can't stop thinking about it. Every year I can notice the strain on her more and more and I feel guilty, but we've kept on pushing through. But, then a break comes and I get to see her, and its like nothing ever happened and everything is sunshine and roses.

Recently, she's expressed to me that she doesn't feel like I have time for her, and she knows the distance magnifies any issues, but she just really wants for this to turn into a normal relationship already. She also said she's not sure if she can give up her life to move out to me. So, after several days of tense discussions on the difficulties and uncertainty, she said she needed a break, just to think. After one day, she said it made her feel worse and she just really misses me, etc.

My issue is that now, /I'm/ the one with uncertainty. To go from rarely having the distance cross my mind to having it be the only thing I can think about is a shock to me. I feel like I'm growing less optimistic about this relationship working out, which is the opposite of how I normally react, as the one trying to be supportive and optimistic for the future. I'm almost certain that the ""break"" we took is to blame and has shaken me. But I'm not sure when I'll see her again in person, or if things will feel better when we're together again like they have in the past. I almost feel like I have the responsibility to call it quits, just so as to not hurt her any further. But I do love her, and I don't want to act rashly.

So I guess I'd just like to hear if anyone has had a similar experience? Or if anyone's been in a similar spot, what got you out of it? Did everything melt away when you were together again?

Til;dr: Gf of 3 years says we need a break. Normally optimistic about our future together, I feel less so after the break. Is it over? Or should I hold out until we're together in person once again?"
1wcwox,34,2014-01-28,[rant + question] How to deal with bros.,[deleted],bigboobproblems,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigboobproblems/comments/1wcwox/rant_question_how_to_deal_with_bros/,"I could post this rant in any number of places, but I feel like I would get the most resonance here, because I'm sure it happens to other boobitors, regardless of field. Sorry this is long.

I'm fairly busty, though certainly not the bustiest, and I'm in an engineering program. More on that in a second. I have found that my boobs will not freaking stop expanding since I found out that they are pretty much 100% fibrous tumors. They aren't cancer, they aren't causing any trouble, and my mother has lived with the same issues since she was my age with no problems, whatever. Mad irritating that it started happening right as I thought I found my perfect bras, but, still, whatever.

Anyways. Back to the STEMBros.

My university's engineering program is like 85% people who identify as men. My specific major is something like 95%. I deal with a lot of jerks. Gender roles dictate that women can't be engineers, and the only female engineers are in it to find a good husband, or they are skating by on their looks. If neither applies, they're supposed to be ugly. I work incredibly hard at what I do, and while I won't give too much detail about my personal situation, it has been incredibly fucking hard for me to be as successful as I have been. I do well in classes, I do research, I volunteer, I work, and I've got a social life on top of it. All of it is dismissed regularly because I'm not ugly and I've got a decent chest. I have been told I would not get a call back after an apparently stellar job-fair interview for an internships because the man interviewing me ""wouldn't let [his] daughter do the same work,"" and he agreed to meet with me because he thought I was interviewing for the secretary position.

So, last night, I'm working on a group project. I was the only person who came prepared with a laptop, so I was dictating during our discussion. Douchebro #1 was talking over everybody the entire time and making inappropriate jokes. Douchebro #2 was staring at my chest the entire time, despite the fact that I was wearing a loosely fitted men's t-shirt. Douchebro #3 was passive. Notadouchebro arrived right as we started the project, after the initial discussion. DB1-3 are making it absolutely impossible for me to dictate, because they're all talking over each other and getting progressively louder. DB1 is the loudest, so I'm like, ""Whoa, guys, one at a time."" He's way ahead of where I'm at in the project (I'm dictating and reading back to make sure everybody agrees on what I'm putting down), and is frustrated with me for not typing as fast as he's word vomiting. Tells me he's just ""collecting his own thoughts,"" and I should tune him out, yet somehow hear the other voices in the room over him? I don't know. DB2 still staring at my chest. DB3 seems nice. NADB is just chilling and contributing when he can jump in. Everyone agrees on what we've got, and I've got a staff meeting to go to for Job Numero Three. I email everyone what we've got so that they can add any changes or whatever, I say that I'll edit it when I get home from work and send it to the professor either late that night because I'm going to be up the latest, everyone agrees, boom, whatever.

We're leaving, and everyone is making small talk about what they're doing this semester. I'm taking classes at the uni and the college to save cash, and working a ton. DB3 does sports. NADB has a wife and a daughter. DB1 is retaking classes, pretty typical for our major. Part ways. Before I'm even out of earshot, DB2 and DB3 start having a conversation about how out of a class of 50 or so people with 3 women, they're lucky that they got ""the girl with the big tits"" in their group. Ew, gross. Not the worst I've ever heard, but still. Really, dudes? At least wait until you got in your car. Have some class.

So, anyways. Meeting goes about as well as a work meeting can. Go home, crack a beer, get on to see what everyone has done. It's like 11. DB1 sent out an email at like 10:30. ""Well, nobody else did anything, so I wrote my own. Somebody edit it and I'll send it in."" Five minutes later without any responses, he emailed it to the professor and carbon copied all of us. I'm reading through this paper, and he didn't even use any of what we all worked on. He even changed the title that we all agreed on. So, I'm like, straight fucking pissed off at this point. It isn't even that it was just something that I wrote that he dismissed. He dismissed a paper that we all wrote together because I was the one that typed it.

**TL;DR...STEM douchebros make gross comments about my breasts, completely trash our group project because I was the one who typed it. I'm still seething. I don't know how to deal with this dude in particular, and I was wondering how you lovely ladies deal with bros (and ladybros) that dismiss everything you do because of your gender/looks/boobs.**"
1wcy86,5,2014-01-28,My [24F] 'FWB' [27M] of 4 months is leaving to his home country in a month,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wcy86/my_24f_fwb_27m_of_4_months_is_leaving_to_his_home/,"[Sorry about the wall of text]

I know this situation may have been posted many times but I'm just really confused. I met this guy a few months ago through a dating website where we didn't message back and forth but decided to meet up immediately. 

Our first night together was amazing and he asked to see me again that weekend where we went to his friend's charity event together. He told me about how he was in Australia to complete an internship where his boss was his family friend and he was going to return to Europe sometime in the foreseeable future.

With this knowledge, I still slept with him that night because at that time I was still mourning a breakup. After we slept together, he told me that he wasn't sure this could be a relationship because although the date for him leaving hadn't been decided yet, there was definitely an expiry on what we had. We both suggested a friends with benefits relationship and I thought that was it.

Over the next few weeks, we bonded so well. I know it's cliche to say but I honestly have never felt so comfortable with anyone, even with my past long term relationships (2+ years). We saw each other every weekend and text everyday- even when he went on a brief holiday to another country, we never missed a day and he would always find time to get back to the hotel and update me on how everything was going. I'm a ballet dancer and throughout our 'relationship' he has always made comments like ""how am I ever going to be with another girl that isn't a ballet dancer like you? You've ruined all girls for me."" When I moved, he helped out and assembled my furniture for me while I kept my promise of cooking him dinner. In that moment it honestly hit me how comfortable I was with him and how well we fit.

I think it was safe to say that I am and have been falling for him for a while even though I understand it's the honeymoon phase and not representative of a real relationship. Maybe it's not worth mentioning but his dad passed away a few years ago and he kept one of his dad's shirts with him in his travels. He let me wear it a few times and I jokingly asked him for it- next time he came around, he wore it a few more times because he had ""memories with that shirt"" and actually gave it to me. He even texted me telling me that his boss thought I was a keeper after he mentioned certain things about me.

Only 2 weeks ago did he mention that he was leaving back to Europe in March and its been eating at me ever since. I don't know how I'm going to handle his departure, even though it's silly because he's only my (exclusive) FWB. I want to confess how I feel before he leaves but I fear that it will only make things harder on myself in addition to him not feeling the same and not wanting to keep in contact (however minimal) because he's an amazing person and I'd like to have him in my life however little it may be. I'm going crazy thinking about the prospect of never seeing him again even though he has mentioned that if I ever visited his city, he would take me to X,Y and Z places and meeting in the future was an option. 

Reddit, how do I cope with the weeks leading up to and after his departure? Do I confess my feelings?

TL;DR Met the most amazing man I've ever had the pleasure of meeting but he's leaving to go back to his own country. Do I confess how I feel before he leaves? And how do I cope in the weeks leading up to and after his departure?

1wczm5,10,2014-01-28,This is Crazy...I Need Some Advice and I'm Not Sure Where Else to Go,Lezbuster,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1wczm5/this_is_crazyi_need_some_advice_and_im_not_sure/,"This is a sock account. I will check this periodically to find good ideas for my situation. 
I'm sorry if this is a little long, but I honestly have no idea what to do and need some advice from somebody whose not my parents and doesn't know me. 

In the summer of 2013 I was hired on at a right wing organization in Washington DC. I was very young for the position and was in fact frequently mistaken for an intern. My job partially involved being involved with hiring decisions for new interns. I conducted quite a few interviews and did that sort of thing. Ultimately, I hired on about 15 interns that summer. Shortly thereafter, my male friend and ""bathroom-mate"" (our apartments were linked by a common bathroom, but were separate apartments,) announced that he was having a party that weekend. He wanted me to bring some girls if I could. Now, at the time I had a girlfriend who wasn't in the area (I'm still together with her btw which will come into play later.) Wanting to help my friend out, I asked permission from my boss to take the new interns to his party as a bonding thing. My boss agreed providing I did not personally drink and made sure everybody got home safe. As anyone who lives in DC knows, alcohol is REALLY common there (which may explain a lot about our government.) I wasn't a complete idiot and only brought the interns who showed me IDs saying they were 21...this ultimately amounted to me bringing 9 interns to the party, 6 of whom were female. 

The interns enjoyed the party and stayed until about 2 in the morning when my friend kicked us out and went to bed. I lined the interns up at the door, did a headcount, and walked them to the nearest Metro station. This took maybe 10 minutes. Once there I realized that I was missing 2 of the female interns. I got the rest on the Metro and commenced panicking as DC IS NOT the best place for people to go wondering off, probably drunk, at 2 in the morning. Additionally, I did not have my cellphone. I got the interns to call both girls, but neither answered. I ran back home, and pounded on my friends door. He sleeply informed me that he thought they left with the group. 

I frantically rounded the apartment building, before returning to my room to get my cell phone. Turns out, the two of them had snuck into my room and were LITERALLY HAVING SEX WITH EACH OTHER in my bed when I walked in. To put it mildly, I freaked out...grabbed my phone and darted out of the room (I didn't want to be accused of anything.) By this point, it was 4 in the morning and I really didn't have anywhere to go...so I ended up on the National Mall on a bench by the Monument. A cop came up to me and asked me why I was there. I gave him a semi-brief rundown of the situation. After showing surprise that I wasn't drunk, the cop left me alone. I didn't know the guy and don't remember his name. I stayed there for a while, then around 6am, I realized that what was happening was ridiculous. I texted both girls and told them to: ""Please leave my room."" 

When I got back, both girls were gone. I thought that was the end of it. Both girls continued to intern for me and both of them were horrible workers. Here's where it gets bad. I learned that both girls were, at the time, under the age of 21. I remember from the night that both of them had been drinking (they must have shown me a fake ID.) This is where I started to worry. 

Fast forward to yesterday: 
While at work, I received a text from one of the girls, but ""signed"" by both. They asked me to meet for lunch about providing a reference for them. I offered to drive them to a restaurant and intended to tell them there was no way I was writing them both letters (its actually a lot of work and they weren't good enough to merit it. While in the car I informed them that I wouldn't feel comfortable writing a letter of reference for either one of them. One of them asked me to look at something on her phone. They showed me pictures on their phones of both of them naked in my apartment with several open alcohol containers. It was VERY obviously my apartment and I still live there. I am NOT in the photos obviously. They pointed out that if they didn't get the letters, these pictures would be sent to my girlfriend (I was friends with both of these girls on Facebook where I'm listed with my girlfriend...so they could certainly send them directly to her) and they'd claim I got them drunk and raped them. One of the girls even mentioned that she could easily sue over this, and it'd be a disaster for my organization and me personally. If the accusation got the media, it'd be very damaging for the group I work for. I told them I'd write the letter just to get them out of the car. I wished like HELL I'd taped it...but I didn't think to until AFTER they were gone. 

Obviously, their argument would be unlikely to hold water legally (though while on this thread previously I've seen a LOT of stories of illegal arrests and men taking the blame for things they didn't do.) However, from what I saw of the photos, my girlfriend WOULD be able to identify my room. I love my girlfriend and have been with her a long time...but I can't be certain how she'd react to pictures like that. Additionally, if I did what they wanted, I'm CERTAIN that this wouldn't be the end of it...they'd just be back in a few years wanting money.
Finally, I'm not certain how my job would be affected if I was accused of it. Even when I got off, its tarnish my reputation and reputation is EVERYTHING in my business. Incidentally, I still do have the ""Please leave my room"" text.

Current thoughts are: 

1: Write a negative letter of reference (not including the incident, but just their poor performance) and send it directly to the organizations both girls want to work at. Tell them the letters were sent. 

2: Do nothing, hope they don't follow through.

3: Tell my girlfriend exactly what happened (she doesn't know I caught them having lesbian sex on my couch.) 

4: Get a lawyer, and go to the cops first.

5: Capitulate

Please give me some ideas. I'm freaking out. I've got until the 3rd to send the letters.

They pointed out that if they didn't get the letters, these pictures would be sent to my girlfriend (I was friends with both of these girls on Facebook where I'm listed with my girlfriend...so they could certainly send them directly to her) and they'd claim I got them drunk and raped them. One of the girls even mentioned that she could easily sue over this, and it'd be a disaster for my organization and me personally. If the accusation got the media, it'd be very damaging for the group I work for. I told them I'd write the letter just to get them out of the car. I wished like HELL I'd taped it...but I didn't think to until AFTER they were gone. 

Obviously, their argument would be unlikely to hold water legally (though while on this thread previously I've seen a LOT of stories of illegal arrests and men taking the blame for things they didn't do.) However, from what I saw of the photos, my girlfriend WOULD be able to identify my room. I love my girlfriend and have been with her a long time...but I can't be certain how she'd react to pictures like that. Additionally, if I did what they wanted, I'm CERTAIN that this wouldn't be the end of it...they'd just be back in a few years wanting money.
Finally, I'm not certain how my job would be affected if I was accused of it. Even when I got off, its tarnish my reputation and reputation is EVERYTHING in my business. Incidentally, I still do have the ""Please leave my room"" text.

Current thoughts are: 

1: Write a negative letter of reference (not including the incident, but just their poor performance) and send it directly to the organizations both girls want to work at. Tell them the letters were sent. 

2: Do nothing, hope they don't follow through.

3: Tell my girlfriend exactly what happened (she doesn't know I caught them having lesbian sex on my couch.) 

4: Get a lawyer, and go to the cops first.

5: Capitulate

Please give me some ideas. I'm freaking out. I've got until the 3rd to send the letters.

You have gone fucking crazy. Circumstance has unfortunately forced us to live together in this house for a few months while I look for a job so I can get the fuck away from here. This could have been fine, we used to get along great. 

But then, after a fucking random ass argument that resulted from you being an insensitive prick, you declared that it wasn't you being insensitive, it was in fact a result of me putting too much strain on poor little old you. And somehow, you caring too much about my feelings. Somehow, after me snapping at you for telling me that my dreams were stupid after I spent *a fucking hour* talking you through a bunch of anxiety that *you* were dumping on me while you made snide comments at me (while being happy to accept the emotional support I was providing), you left in a huff, and came back to declare that you realized the problem was that you felt ""too emotionally responsible for me."" You somehow twisted that in your mind into you ""caring too much,"" and not ""being an insensitive oblivious jackass."" You then declared that you needed to ""distance yourself"" from me. No argument there.

But you didn't want to distance yourself, you wanted to give yourself full license to be a passive aggressive bitch. In your mind ""distancing yourself"" means, ""criticizing every single little god damn thing as if talking to a particularly stupid child."" Because a pet peeve of mine is you doing that, I often got my back up, and yes, reacted with less than Christ-like restraint, but I NEVER talked to you like you were dumb, and if I said something out of line I ALWAYS apologized.

But you just wouldn't fucking let up. When I tried to bust open a coconut with a solid piece of iron that had been sitting in the back of a tool drawer for over a decade you started ranting at me about how I shouldn't use it, and when I tried to point out that a solid piece of iron could probably stand up to a god damn coconut, you started ranting at me about how I shouldn't ever question you because you know ""more"" about these things. I rolled my eyes because you weren't making sense, you came over and got in my face, I rolled my eyes (the ULTIMATE INSULT which you probably actually think you never do) and you *spit in my fucking face.* Then you left, and I shouted that you were acting like a child.

You came back inside, and do you know what I did? I calmly said that this was a stupid argument that got out of hand, I'm willing to let it go, that I wound you up and realized that, that I loved you, and that I hoped you felt better. I didn't even ask you to apologize because I was hoping that being so nice would cause you to see what an unbelievable cock you were being, instead you left, fumed for a night, came back declaring that you were still mad at me, and when I said that I was pretty pissed off too actually, you declared that I couldn't do that because I said the previous day that I wasn't mad, and that I was being ""manipulative,"" and you also seemed to think that you had some awesome rhetorical trump card by reminding me that I said that I had been winding you up. 

No, I was reacting in a *admittedly less than christ-like way* in *responding to your provocation.* But you took that and just ran with it and refused to hear anymore, because in your head you had already declared victory, and declared me to be insane, have anger issues (WHAT?!), and that I was manipulative terrible person for having the nerve to get re-angry after you declared that you were mad at me after *you spit in my fucking face and I fucking tried to forgive you for it immidiately.* 

Did I respond in kind? Did I spit in your face? Did I say something like ""this is the reason that you are insanely lonely and have no friends?"" No, I *took ownership of the SMALL amount of blame that was mine for the whole situation* and *told you that I wasn't mad and that I was sure we could work it out.* You took that to mean that I was somehow admitting that I was a terrible person, and now you had proof! My confession! Like all of the conclusions you jump to about other people it became immediately 100% true and irrevocable in your mind. 

And then you kept needling at me, for the entire semester, while I was doing two internships, driving around 200 miles a week, and finishing my degree, and dealing with very deep depression punctuated by mania and psychosis (you would never know about the psychosis, the voices, how little I slept because I didn't tell you) all I heard from you was how I forgot to clean the counter or whatever. Never mind that I was the only person who was vacuuming or cleaning the bathrooms or changing the litterbox or giving the cats any real fucking attention at all, the fact that I'm often absent minded about things like leaving glasses on the counter or whatever meant that you got to nit pick.

And oooooohhhhh you love to nit pick, it's your favorite thing to do when you get insecure and stressed, you start pointing out everybody else's short comings especially if it relates to them being somehow forgetful or disorganized. I gradually developed less and less of an ability to just bite my tongue when you would tell me in that snotty ass tone of yours that I had left some ash in front of the fireplace. I tried politely telling you that you needed to watch your tone when reminding me of things like that, and then you would freak out and say that I couldn't say that because people criticizing your tone made you insecure. And then you would start yelling at me. I kept thinking that if I just apologized for the things that I had done wrong, and was nice and diplomatic in the mean time, you would snap out of your worse than usual delusions about yourself and the people around you. 

But of course you didn't, and whenever I would try to say something like, you know it's really dumb to throw away a relationship like this over stuff that's not a big deal, you would just counter that you thought it was a big deal.

Well X, congrats, it's a big fucking deal. I now cannot be in the same room with you. The mind numbingly vicious things you have said to me over the past four months have absolutely turned what should have been a few petty fights followed by some ""sorry dude""'s, about how you have ""nothing to say to me"" and your most recent declaration that I ""don't give a damn about our parents, this house, or you"" because ""I never even tried,"" or something, I can't even X, I can't. You're so fucking insane. You interrupt me to tell me that you never interrupt anybody, you actually say with a straight face that you never pick or escalate fights, you actually believe this too. It's, fucking, pathetic, to, see, an, ostensibly, grown, woman, behave, like, this. 

So earlier today, after I got angry because you had, once again, been an arrogant jerk when I asked you how your day was when you got home from work, and you looked at me like I was something you scraped off the bottom of the shoe and said it was none of my business ""because you felt like you were being interrogated"" and that ""your whereabouts aren't accountable to me,"" before going on to say that one of your grievances was that ""I always assume the worse about what you say"" and reiterated the the point that you ""never instigate,"" I *FINALLY* understood two things. 

1: There is literally nothing I can do, there is nothing, a few months ago you got freaked out, and the only person around to take it out on was me, so you did, congrats. You have the distance that you wanted, we no longer have a relationship. I went from considering you one of my best friends to one of the people who I loath the absolute most because of the sheer hypocrisy and viciousness and insanity of your line of arguments. 

Like when I point out that it's not really fair to say that I don't care about anything but myself because I parked too close to the middle of the driveway three fucking weeks ago, because I don't say that just because you don't empty the litter boxes doesn't mean you don't care about the cats, and then you respond that maybe I should be upset about that, and then my head fucking explodes because I have no idea what to even say. So I take your line of argument and say, yes, I guess you don't care about the cats, and then you freak out at me again. And my head explodes out of sheer frustration, and then you use said frustration as further evidence that I am ""unreasonable.""

2: I really, truly, don't give a flying fuck about you. And that whether you come to realize the astounding prick you've been or not, it doesn't make it any less true. I actually don't, because I can't. Truth be told I've been trying to detach, but unlike you I can't just break off from familial relations or convince myself that I have. But actually that litterbox argument, with it's sheer circular non-logic, finally brought the point home that you just aren't going to be living in this world for a while. 

I may be taking meds for psychosis and depression, but *you* are fucking out of your mind. (Nice one blaming all of this on my occasionally troubled relationship with reality too, that always feels great when people use my mental health history too invalidate my pov)

Let me be clear, you said as the last thing that you said to me was that you didn't care about what I thought of you, but that you still loved me because I'm your brother. I do not feel the same. (And you don't either, saying you love someone means jack shit) I don't care about you, I do not love you, you are not my sister. I don't give a shit what happens to you, do you know why? Because your going to be *miserable* for a long time, your going to continue to think that you've got it all figured out vis a vie human relationships and it's all the other humans who are the problem. I'm not going to be exposed to the toxic mass that is your emotional life any more, even if you do apologize (you wont) I'm done. 

Oh I guess I care about you, I'd be upset if you died (still angry), and I sort of hope one day that you figure this out. Honestly though after some of the shit you've said to me, not mention the stupidity of your line of reasoning sometimes, I wont lie that you being miserable will bring me a certain amount of glee. When you tell someone who is trying very hard to make things tolerable that you have ""nothing to say"" to them (this was after I pointed out that neither of us were getting younger and how much more of the limited time we, and our parents, is this worth) and that they care about nobody but themselves, and you say it OVER and OVER again, there are consequences to that shit. Sorry (I'm not sorry, I'm sooooooooooo done being sorry) You said goodnight, and I said goodbye. Once I get out of this house we will have no relationship (unless you, like, grow up, which you wont, not for a decade at least) and that will be on you. Mom and Dad are going to be devastated when they figure out the depths of our alienation, I feel awful about that, but I'm guilt free, this is on you. Have fun judging people from your cold lonely ivory tower.

I don't have the energy to write to you Y. What you did over Christmas was real real classy, I mean, just wow. People who I tell a *cleaned up* version of what you did act concerned for your mental health, I'm sort of concerned for yours, not for your sake but for your kids'. You certainly never showed a shred of concern for my mental health. Pretty much anytime there was a problem, you'd whisper to anybody who would listen that I was just being dramatic. 

Also, yes I, in something completely unprecedented in the history of time, stole some painkillers in my late teens. I also *voluntarily* owned up to it, I did not have to, but I did so because I'm trying to be a better person. Declaring that some thing happened OVER SEVEN YEARS AGO makes me UNSAFE TO BE AROUND YOUR CHILDREN in an EMAIL TO THE ENTIRE FAMILY was really the cherry on top of a shit relationship. Do mom and dad know exactly why you ran away that one time? Who you were with? Do they know about how much you dealt? No? Of course not?

To your snipe about me needing their money right now. I just (a month ago) got out of school, I'm looking for work, and you also ask them for money. Shut up.  

By the way, I love your kids, and I love your husband, but I despise you. Your husband is going to leave you, because I can tell that you're shitty to him, bossing him around like the type A you so badly want to be. He was fine with it at first because he's a genuinely awesome guy who loves to help people, but I saw it in his eyes that he's getting sick of it. I also know that he's not the type to stay. Oh sure he's not the crazy-assertive type that you are, but he has a photography and music career that he can go back to on top of being an RN. Oh, and your kids are one day going to *resent the fuck* out of you. You think mom and dad screwed us up, you think we're bitter towards them? You you wait, you just fucking wait. 

So X and Y. I once counted both of you among my best friends, I now consider you people that I'm going to see when I can't otherwise avoid it. Have fun in the What's that Michael Bluth said? ""See you when the first parent dies?"" Also have fun in the temporary ""F is the worst sibling ever"" club. I wonder how long it will be before you turn on each other?

And to Z, thank you so much for your letter over Christmas, your understanding, your patience, everything. I know we don't agree on, like, anything but I always have a great time with you. What you said in your letter really meant the world to me. I'm sorry that your even peripherally involved in all of this. I wasn't perfect but lord knows I really tried. 

Mom and Dad, I'm sorry too. Don't blame yourself. You raise four head strong ego-maniacs with mutually exclusive ways of looking at the world. Maybe we'll all get over this and the sibling curse that runs in our family wont repeat itself. I hope so. I'm done blaming you guys for shit, we were a difficult bunch at the best of times, you did the best anybody could have really. I hope X and Y stop blaming you for shit one day too. Also, I know you believe me that I tried, I appreciate that, even though I know you can't say it.

1wd7ey,4,2014-01-28,I'm crying for my life,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1wd7ey/im_crying_for_my_life/,"Sorry by sharing that with you. I know the main subject of the subreddit is sharing experience in the process of abstinence, but it's just that I feel really sad and don't have nobody to talk about this. These days are probably being the hardest ones since I had serious problems some years ago. Since I started here, I could not hold myself away from the addiction more than 24 hours. I have an OCD history and it's being hard for me to restrain myself. 

That makes me sad, but what really wrenched my heart was something that happened today. I haven't thought it would affect me like that, but now I'm sure I was never more wrong. Well, some years ago, I almost got a girlfriend. She was amazing, a really nice person. We were both from the same church, and we became pretty close as friends. We used to talk on the msn every single day when we were both on vacations for 4-5 hours, and still have things to share with each other afterwards. I started to love her. We had a mutual female friend. That friend of hers noticed my feelings and was willing to help us. She gave me advice, and one day I revealed my feelings to the girl of my dreams. She was a bit surprised, but she said she had suspicions about it. She said I would get a chance, she would try to feel the same way about me and we started going out, even on valentines day! We never kissed, or held hands together, but what we had was really special. Our church has this doctrine, where two people who love each other, in order to start seriously dating, need to spend three months ""on prayers"". They get to know each other better, meet the family, go out (never alone) and pray to god. If at the end of this 3 months period they really want to date, they receive blessings and they are now boyfriend and girlfriend.

We had this unusual relationship for about 1 year and a half. We weren't ""On Prayers"", though, because she was young at the time. The boy and girl need to be at least 16 in order to date, and she was 15 at this time. On this time period, I made a really big surprise on her 15th birthday. I recorded videos of her close friends and family, where each person would say a few kind words and congratulate her for the birthday. I made two slideshows with pictures of her and two songs she loved at the time. I bought a really beautiful present for her, and edited a video with the homages and slideshows. I gathered our friends, and made a surprise. I didn't call her on her birthday, and neither she did. When it was starting to get dark, a friend took her away from home, for a close place. While that happened, I and a group of friends got inside her home. When she got back, we sang for her and showed the surprise video. She cried and was really grateful for the surprise. We gave our presents, she loved the one I gave her and it was a really special occasion.

I remember this other time, on valentines day, when I composed a song for her and played it on the guitar. She liked it and was a bit blushed and ashamed. We ordered a pizza, and had so much fun. I asked if she wanted to ""pray"" with me, you know, start dating. She accepted, but some days after she changed her mind. She said we would need to wait some more, and that's what we did.

You know what, I have this problem of writing too much and probably not a lot of people will read that. I'll just try to be concise from now on. Well, the thing is that I'm poor, really poor. In order to make money in my country, you have to either be born rich, or study like crazy. My only choice was the second option. I studied like never when I was near the college admission tests time. I was never having much time to spend with her, and I realized she started to treat me differently. She was being rude when I called her, clearly hoping that she could hang up the phone. As time passed, I started to beieve I was not loving here anymore.

One day, she said we should talk. We sat, and she said what she was really thinking and praying about: that we should stop whatever we were having. She said she tried to like me, but she couldn't. She was not willing to postpone that anymore, so it'd be better if we just stopped. I agreed that we could still be friends, and put all of that aside. She claimed to be afraid that I'd leave the church because of that, but I'd never do that only because of one girl. The truth is that as time passed, not because of her, but other reasons, I left the church. It's been like 6 months since the last time I went there.

She started dating like 1 year and a half ago with some random guy from a church of other town. I could not care less even if I wanted. I tried to convince myself I was okay, but I noticed something after she ""broke up"" (?) with me: I could not be interested in another girl. On the  last 3 years, I could not fall in love again. Also, I could not go out. I've been trapped in my room since a long time, and I even tried to make some friends on college and party with them. But... I was not liking it.

So, I've been spending a lot of time reading books, blogs, comic books, mangas, watching series, movies, animes, playing video games and doing every single nerd activity that could fill my time. One of this activities is masturbating, and that is destroying my life slowly. It has been like one year since I started masturbating again. The compulsion came when I really stopped going to the church. I masturbate like 5-6 times a day and this is taking the joy away from my life. I'm bored, and don't think doing nerd things is fun anymore, and I want to leave my room, get a nice girlfriend, get married, you know, get a life. 

I got an internship. I went to an interview, and they said I would start this week. However, for some reason, they changed they mind and sent me an email saying they got someone else. I don't have money, don't have a job. I don't have a girlfriend. Never kissed, never dated. 

Today, I saw on facebook that the girl I loved got engaged, and it made me cry. They are getting married this year. I can count on my fingers the number of times I cried on my whole life, so you can guess that's not something I'm used to. I'm so sad. I thought I did not love her anymore, but... was I'm wrong? Please, help me. Am I depressed? Should I seek professional help? Why did I cry? What can I do to change my life? I believe I'm crying for my life, because it is so hollow, so sad, and seeing her happy like that made me think that I could have been happy with her. I thought about going back to the church, but I don't think I have faith anymore. I kind of became an agnostic."

This is something I posted in r/gamedev and I was told you guys may like it. Let me know what you think :-):


I just wanted to show my gratitude to this great community for finally giving me the will to start this programming my first game! Basically I am going to start writing once to a few times a week about my experience and how i'm doing. It would help me a lot and keep me motivated to know that even one person was reading the blog. Thank you for taking the time to read this, the link to the blog and the first post can be seen below. Let me know what you think! (good or bad :)) : 

http://gamedesignlog.blogspot.com/ 

My goal for this blog is to help keep me motivated in my pursuit to make my first game. It has always been a dream of mine to learn how to design and program a game. I've decided that 2014 is going to be the year to do it. A little bit about myself: 

I am a 23 year old graduate student planning on graduating May 2014 with a Masters degree in Geotechnical Engineering. Currently I am working as a paid intern at a pretty big engineering firm, I am very happy with my job but I want a hobby that will keep me entertained as well as keeping my mind sharp. I think that i have the chops to teach myself programming (with the help of some guides and videos) and eventually publish my own game (I'll figure out the details in between that later :D). 

I've been playing games for a while, the first game i really remember playing is Virtual Cop for hours on end. From then on the next ""big"" games for me would probably be Ocarina of Time and Super Smash Bros. Eventually I got a Playstation for Christmas and never looked back. Games like Brave Fencer Musashi and Metal Gear Solid are what I have the fondest memories of playing and now I am hoping to begin my path to making something similar. 

I may also use this blog to keep track of other aspects of my life as well as in exercise and perhaps something else... I am not sure yet. Anyway if you've read this, thank you! Hopefully there will be many more posts to come (At least once a week, more if i have the time). 

(P.S. Also if you want to start making your own game you should definitely head over to r/gamedev, there are just so many helpful tutorials including programming, animation, monetization, and many more. They also have many free and open source tools available to look at.)

1wdsle,2,2014-01-28,My life is becoming meaningless and I have no clue what to do,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1wdsle/my_life_is_becoming_meaningless_and_i_have_no/,"I am not even sure what I am doing here or what I want to say.

Two weeks ago I started an internship, I absolutely love the place. Amazing, friendly people, a wonderful place to work and everything is taken care of. That's why I am in such a struggle with myself; everthing is great but I feel fucking miserable. 

This internship will last five months without a single vacation and I will average a 45 hour work week. On saturday I got another job which is usually about ten hours to add to the 45 hours. Sunday is the only time I can relax a little bit but that's when I am going to my girlfriend so I feel really bad if I get some extra sleep then or even skip seeing her. My body feels so tireless all the time, I don't have a single day where I can get to bed early because of other responsibilies and I can't get some extra sleep on other days. Everyday I get home I don't have any motivation to do anything since I am thinking: what does it matter? I will have to go to bed in a few hours anyway to not feel like a total zombie and tomorrow it will start all over again. I feel I have so little free time it's not even worth to do something with it anyway.

Despite loving the shit out of my workplace, I am watching the damn clock every five minutes which makes staying for +- 9 hours pure mental torture. After these five months are done, I will have summer vacation and then I will start another five month internship at another place and I dread that place will be way less great than my current place making it even more miserable.

I have absolutely no idea why I am feeling like this while I should feel really got that I got in such a great company. However, I won't keep this up much longer and because of other reasons I really, really need to finish my education which will only last until the summer vacation of '15. So I can't just simply quit my education and need to pull myself through for the next 1,5 year but I have absolutely no clue how I will be able to pull this off.

I don't know what to do."
1wegtm,108,2014-01-28,"Frustrated, in debt, can't get a loan, and wondering if college was even worth it. Care to help me out with some advice?",Lyonguard,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1wegtm/frustrated_in_debt_cant_get_a_loan_and_wondering/,"I apologize in advance for the long tirade ahead, but I want to spell out everything clearly and concisely in hopes of getting the best response I can.

I graduated from Purdue in May with a degree in Organizational Leadership and Supervision, with about $28,000 in student loan debt (Didn't have enough grants to quite cover everything, worked during school, no family contributions).

After school, I tried working for an insurance company, but the position was commission based and I couldn't sell Life Insurance very easily as my entire ""natural market"" was too young to really care about that.  So I found myself taking a delivery job, and the money honestly wasn't terrible, it paid minimum wage but I brought home tips of about $250 or more every week.  The big hang up was due to the new health care laws, They refused to give me more than 30 hours a week.  After frantically searching for new work or something, I started an internship this month.  However, it is an hour commute from where I live.

So here's where I'm at as far as income right now (tax deductions estimated):

Internship (32 hours a week at minimum wage) : 175 a week

Delivery Wages (28 hours a week, less than minimum wage, taxes from tips deducted from paycheck): 75/week

Delivery Tips:  250 a week

Total:  500/week, 2,000/month



I'll throw my expenses down too:

Rent:  430/month

Utilities:  70/month

Student Loan Repayments:  300/month

Food:  200/month

FUEL (Delivery driving+70 mile commute during the week): 500/MONTH

Phone (Data plan and GPS absolutely needed for delivery driving):  53/month

Car Insurance:  32/month

Misc.:  150/month

Total:1733/month


Anyway, things were kinda precarious but somewhat manageable, until I get a flat tire on my car, and find out my car, in the mechanic's words, is about to snap in half. The winter, commuting, and delivery driving have not been kind, and the strut is about to break.  They told me I shouldn't drive it any more than I absolutely need to until I can fix it.

Now at this point it's worth pointing out that my car is a '97 Taurus with over 200,000 miles.  I know at this point it's only going to have more issues going forward and I would be better off getting a new (used) car.  So I'm looking for something that can take me putting a lot of miles on to it, gets good mileage, and won't lemon out on me, and something I can keep monthly payments around $150.

However, I go to my credit union and they flat out tell me with the way my debt to income ratio is, they can't finance a new car purchase for me unless I can come up with some serious down payment or something for collateral.  My only saving grace is that I have great credit, having been paying my loans on time and having had a best buy credit cards a few years ago that I paid back.

So here's my current situation, broken into pieces, and I'll take advice on any of them:

I can't afford to get another car, but I EVEN MORE can't afford to not have a car.  And my current car is currently set to break down at any time.

I work 60 hours a week, 7 days a week, between two jobs which rely on my ability to drive for either commuting or for delivering.

While I've had many interviews, I can't land a ""big boy"" job. I'm hoping my internship will either turn into one or at least be another shiny thing to add to my resume.

So I'm kinda at my wits end about what I need to do right now.  Reddit, if you can tell me anything to help me out, I'll greatly appreciate it!"

1wf80p,2,2014-01-28,College Essay help. [Suggestion],savanna627,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1wf80p/college_essay_help_suggestion/,"Umm so tell me what you think and what I should change. The subject was to tell about how your family as made you who you are today and what kind of person you are. 



My family has always been a big influence on me. I did not realize until I was older what astounding parents I have. I grew up in an environment of a loving, nurturing, and creative family. My mom is very artistic individual. When I was very young my mother and I would  do creative projects.  We painted and worked with ceramic all the time. She believed  that tapping into your creativity energy was essential  for growth and developing your own in path in life. Being the strong person she is, she believes that the only ceiling we hit in life is the one which we create for ourselves.  Between both my parents my father is definitely more reserved the only exception is when he tells stories of his life. My Father comes from a military family, his stories of living in England and Germany have fostered my desire to travel. When I was young he bought me a world map to hang on my wall and my mother and I would research different cultures. My biggest dream in life is to travel the world to experience different cultures. When I was younger and afraid to try new things or was in a situation I was unsure of I would say I was scared. My father wouldn't take ‘I’m scared’ for an answer. He once told me that saying ‘I’m scared’ is just an excuse people use to gain pity. To this day I believe that.  This concept has taught me to push through when I am not sure what to do. This played a part in my life when I became the student adviser on the City of Key West Sustainability Board where I have to talk in front of high up member of community and that really scared me at first.  Overall my mother has influenced me the most. She has taught me to always be resilient, independent, and to never give up.


My parents are very amusing people, they can always be found doing exciting activities. Growing up we always had a myriad of fun times. One of my favorite memories was waking up at sunrise to watch my dad and his friends surf. We would pack the supplies needed and put them into the truck and go to the beach for the whole day. Seeing how everyone would come together over a love of surfing has made me a more social and friendly person. If a person has a similar interest with me, automatically they will spark my interest and make me want  to befriend  them. This has made me such a social person which is how I got my internship with WKYZ radio station, I went up and talked to the owner about the music he was playing at a live shows and we got to talking and he offered me an internship. I am also the leader of a team building a solar powered Go-Kart and all the time I have to go to businesses for sponsorship or working with professionals who are experts in environmental engineering and to do this I must be social and professional with them. It’s taught me how ‘the real world’ is like, these people treated me like an adult because I had adult responsibilities and it really has should me that you can not hold back and be scared of doing something. 


 As a student I am a dedicated and interested individual. I am fond of learning new things, particularly in science and history. As a human being, I am a very outgoing and sociable person. I am able to go up to anybody and have a conversation with them, I love talking to people and making new friends. I am extremely humorous, and I adore making people laugh and smile. My favorite thing about talking to people is when a person is talking about themselves or something they love. The part I enjoy most is  seeing their faces light up, seeing the energy and excitement from people makes it just as exciting for me. Listening to people’s stories about their lives is like listening to a book, just listening to the slightest details you learn so much. I love hearing about how other people minds work. It’s truly amazing to talk to people, and to learn about them and their life stories.

1wf9p7,3,2014-01-28,Advice on cleaning up a half-yeard for a career fair?,[deleted],beards,https://www.reddit.com/r/beards/comments/1wf9p7/advice_on_cleaning_up_a_halfyeard_for_a_career/,"Backstory: I'm a junior in college who's been slow to look for a summer internship. Luckily, there's one more career fair for students with my major (Comp Sci) coming up this week. Unfortunately, my facial hair has been fairly unkempt as I've grown it out; I shampoo and condition it a couple times a week (trying to avoid drying it out) and comb it fairly regularly. Despite this, my beard just grows somewhat curly on the sides and somewhat wavy around the chin, so it ends up looking messy anyway.

I'd be *really* bummed out if I had to shave my beard completely since like how I look with it and I was hoping to grow it out for a full year to see what it looks like, but I know I can't just leave it as-is for the career fair since it doesn't look professional.

So I thought I could ask you guys what I can do to clean it up. [Here's a couple pics for reference](http://imgur.com/a/AWVhM) ."

1wffpy,14,2014-01-28,"Well I'm definitely in a LDR, it feels like a dream",[deleted],wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/1wffpy/well_im_definitely_in_a_ldr_it_feels_like_a_dream/,"Well, I made a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/1vbdex/i_think_i_mightve_just_started_a_ldr_with_a_girl/) about a girl I met 6000 miles away. I just wanted to post a quick update since I haven't told any of my friends yet, and want to tell someone.

The past two weeks have been like a dream. We skyped for the first time a couple weeks ago, and talked for 4 hours. It was awkward at first, but by the end neither of us wanted to go. The following weekend (last weekend), I was visiting some friends, so we didn't have time to Skype. I was in Disneyland, with my friends, and I couldn't stop texting her (same for her, she was hanging out with her friends, and kept sneaking off to the bathroom to text me). We ended up finding some time to Skype last night, and it was amazing. All the awkwardness was gone, and it was just amazing to see her face and hear her voice. Even though she's sent me dozens of pictures, it's amazing to see her, and how she moves, and all the weird cute things she does with her face.

Throughout this two weeks, we've already started planning several trips. I had a trip planned, with my friends, to visit Spain (even before I really got to know her), which she's now a part of. We've also made plans for her to come stay with me in the fall for a few months after her summer internship is over. And now, we've started making plans for her to visit around April, since she'll get two weeks off from school.

It all still feels absolutely crazy at times. We've only really been ""together"" for 2 weeks, but now all my vacations for the rest of the year have pretty much been planned. I feel like I know that objectively, we're moving way too fast, but it feels perfect for us. We're both exactly on the same page, and probably just a little bit crazy.

Anyway, sorry for rambling. I'm just so glad to have found my media naranja, even if she's on the other side of the world."

1wfund,3,2014-01-28,"[M/21, F/20] Not sure if it's worth fixing, or if I should just break up with her.",DrSeafood,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1wfund/m21_f20_not_sure_if_its_worth_fixing_or_if_i/,"I've been dating a girl since October. I only knew her for a month before we got together. We just hit it off. Things were okay, but about two months into it I realized I wasn't getting exactly what I wanted. I liked her, but didn't like the relationship. It was like we were going nowhere, like it wasn't a rewarding relationship at all. We just hung out and had sex sometimes and stuff. But I just didn't feel any affection at all, and that's what I really wanted. I brought this up with her, and we decided that we liked each other enough to keep going with it ... But it was more like a ""why not keep dating"" thing, rather than a ""I really like you so I want to keep dating"" thing. The thing is I really hated communicating with her over the internet or text messages, and I still do. When we're together in person, I really enjoy talking to her because I know I have her undivided attention. I guess that's just me. I suppose I like to feel like I'm special.

I've had other relationships in which I was just not patient at all. When something wasn't going the way I wanted it to go, I just blurted it out and things went bad. That's happened to me a lot in the past. This time I don't want things to go that way. I want to be reasonable and fair and patient, and I want to avoid overreacting.

Now it's the end of January, so it's been about four months with her. At the beginning of the month she moved really far away for an internship, and she won't be back till May. We were shakey about going long distance, but we decided to do it. Again it was a ""why not"" type thing, rather than something both of us truly wanted. Just like ""why not try it, and if it doesn't work well hey we'll end it there"". I'm not sure that's a great mentality heading into an LDR.

I still need attention. I *hate* when her attention is divided between me and other people. I'm the type of person who *hates* when I send her a message and get a notification that she read my text even though she's not responding. I hate hate hate that. She does it a lot.

Our conversations feel forced. Our jokes. Our ""how are you""s. Sometimes I message her because I feel like it's weird not to talk to her even though we're both online. But then our conversation goes nowhere and I really have no idea what else to say.

Like I said, I want to be patient. I want to be fair. I really really don't want to be overreacting. So I'm not sure if I should just tell her that this isn't what I want, or if I actually just don't know what I want. I say this because: two years ago I had a relationship with this girl I was absolutely crazy about. I loved talking to her and we talked all the time. Everything was really natural. She made me feel things I couldn't describe. That relationship was also long distance, again because of an internship. Well, life happened and we broke up and it was super hard on me. I've dated a few girls since then but I just haven't been able to achieve feelings for someone again. Maybe my brain stopped working after that break up two years ago. So should I jump to conclusions about my current girlfriend just because I'm not feeling it now? Maybe if I wait it out till May when she comes back, it'll all be worth it.

Or maybe not?

**TL;DR: Long distance relationship. Things feel forced, and I'm not sure if it's just me or if I really should just end it here. I like her, but obviously not enough to keep the distance thing going.** "
1wfv0c,5,2014-01-28,"Me [19 F] with my best friend [20 M]; we never got the timing right in the past two years, but now he's single. What to do?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wfv0c/me_19_f_with_my_best_friend_20_m_we_never_got_the/,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text (sorry, sorry, sorry). I will try to keep it brief and to the point!

**Optional background (but helpful):**

Two years ago (freshman year of college - we're juniors now), I met this guy in one of my classes (we'll call him S). I didn't really think anything of him at first, but I could tell he was really into me and I liked him enough as a person to work on homework and study together. We both come from the same city, and during summer break he asked me to hang out. It was going fine and dandy until I made a very sarcastically judgmental comment at one point in our conversation. I tend to be extremely outspoken and opinionated, but I would never ever make a comment like that if I had actually meant it. Since he didn't know me very well, he didn't realize this, and after that lunch date he didn't call me for the rest of summer. I should point out that I did not even realize his silence until he pointed it out to me a few months later - I just really wasn't into him as anything more than a friend. 

The very first week of sophomore year, I notice he's been hanging out with a girl a lot (she'll be A). One of our mutual friends confirmed that they were dating, and it took me ten minutes to get ridiculously jealous. I still saw him a lot, during class and when we did homework together, and we got lunch together three times a week, and as stupid as it sounds, I tried so hard to get with him. He got me to join an intramural soccer team with him, and he would walk me home at night. He was always really flirty (so was I...), and so nice to me. Any time I went out with someone else (never seriously, just lunch dates and stuff), he would text me right after how it went, and tell me they weren't good enough for me. Things like that. We never did anything physical at all, but I was just waiting for it, even to the point where I had asked my friends how to stop it, because I didn't want to be that kind of person. 

Eventually we had a blow up (like in October of sophomore year) where he denied there ever being anything more than friendship between us, although he admitted to having feelings for me over the summer, but that I had ruined it with my comment. I did not believe any of what he said, but I had nothing else to do, so I just left it. For the rest of the semester, we were just civil to each other, did homework together, and it was fine. 

Spring semester of sophomore year, we had almost all our classes together, and we became best, best friends. I was incredibly into him, and I realized I was in love with him about halfway through the semester, when it made me cry that he hadn't told me he wouldn't be coming to lecture one day because he was on a trip for his sports team. It turned into another long talk about what we were doing (we had these A LOT that semester), but he continued to deny that he had anything more than friendly feelings for me. I still didn't believe anything, because of the comments he made to me about my looks, my personality, how much time he spent with me (now outside of homework and studying and classtime, too), the fact that he never brought up his girlfriend (we actually had a rule about this), and how differently he treated me when she was with us (this almost never happened because she hates me, very understandably). 

He took an internship in Europe over this last summer, so I didn't see him for three months. Right before he left, we had a whole longfelt talk where he told me I was his best friend ever, and that he cared about me so much. For my birthday, which was a few days after he left, he wrote me a long letter, left me birthday song voicemails, and wrote me a birthday poem, which he sent as a voice recording. I started dating someone else a week after S left (J), and I was incredibly excited about it, because J was so sweet to me, so attractive, and we had great chemistry. A few days after my first date with J, which had gone really well, S skyped me (we were messaging literally all day long anyways, but this one happened over video) and finally admitted to me that he was jealous, that he has always had feelings for me, and that I make him happier and laugh harder than anyone else ever has. I told him that I've always known that, and that I couldn't understand why he was still with his girlfriend when we would be so great together. He told me, verbatim, ""I am not ready to settle down with the person I will end up with, you know that. We weren't together last summer, we're not together now, but we both know how this will end."" The skype conversation took hours, and I cried at the end because the situation was awful. After a lot of thought, I told S we couldn't talk anymore while he was with A, and I focused on dating J, because that was going so well.

When J and I broke up towards the end of summer, S and I started talking again and we went straight back to our normal - messaging all the time, saying sweet things, him telling me J was never good enough, etc. When he came back from Europe, I was the first person he saw (before his girlfriend), and we spent all day together. We never really brought up the skype conversation, or the break we had taken.

At the beginning of this school year, S and I got in another big fight about our situation. It ended in me telling him I couldn't be friends with him because he is ridiculous, and I was fine with it. We ended up not talking for several months, but we were okay again by December. This is how things always go with us - it's difficult to stay away from each other. 

I saw him multiple times over winter break. The times we hung out were much more date-like than anything we had ever done. It felt very different. When he hugged me goodbye on one of those nights, he held me for a long time and stroked my hair, which he's never done before. 

Two days ago he told me he broke up with his girlfriend. He asked to get lunch with me today, and we did, and it was fine. We didn't bring up her or their breakup at all.


**To summarize my main feelings after that long, long background:**

1. I love him so very much.
2. He is my best friend, probably ever. He knows me more than anyone, and I can be my complete self around him, and he has never judged me for it. When I am honestly upset (medical issues, family problems, major uncertainty), he is the person I want to talk to, and he has never let me down about being there for me. 
3. We can have fights without beating each other up. Due to the nature of our situation, we have had many uncomfortable conversations, and many of those have included crying. We've always worked through it respectfully and honestly.
4. We would be logistical heaven. Our families come from the same place in Europe, we speak the same languages, he's intelligent, we're from the same city, we're in the same major, our families love each other too. I don't mean to be melodramatic, but I feel like if we got together, I could see that lasting forever.
5. This is the first time we have both been single at the same time in years and I have been waiting for this forever.
6. Our friends have never thought that our friendship was a good idea, with some going so far as to cut off contact because of how fucked up they thought this was. We have had lots of talks about this, and both never cared about what they thought because it's always felt right to us.

**What I need help with:**
1. Do I bring up the issue of ""us"" to him at all? Or should I wait for him to?
2. Should I address their breakup at all? I want to be there for him if he's having a hard time, but I'm not sure if it seems too transparent or backhanded.
3. I understand that probably he will need time to be single (he was with her for 1.5 years). But we both know that we've had feelings for each other, and I feel like it's the elephant in the room. I don't know what to do. 
4. It's Valentine's Day soon. I would love to do something for him. Is that wrong?

I feel like I have to try, or I will regret it forever. Any help would be so appreciated. 

---   
**tl;dr**: My best friend and I have had feelings for each other for the last two years - he had a girlfriend for 1.5 years during that time, so the situation was always pretty complicated. He told me a few days ago that he had broken up with her. I want him so much, but I'm not sure how to best approach this, or how much time to give before I bring it up. Any advice would be awesome!

Same interests and hobbies, similar beliefs, and we just work well. I think I could be just fine with spending my life with him.

Lately(more like the past couple years) I have been feeling attracted to the female body. When browsing sites like reddit or another and an image of a beautiful women, naked or not, comes up I feel strange. I not only admire them but could imagine myself touching them. My boyfriend has even caught me staring at girls before. I am guilty of staring at butts.

At first I thought these were shallow and purely feelings of physical attraction, but then I met this woman through an internship who was very sweet, successful, and pretty, and I could tell I had a bit of a crush on her which I felt really awful and strange about. I don't spend my nights thinking about her or anything but I love my boyfriend to death and that is something I am not uncertain about.

One more thing I guess I should add is every sexual dream I have has has been with a woman. I don't know if that means anything. Being with a woman isn't something I strongly desire but I do kind of day dream about it and I enjoy the thought. But I also enjoy my monogamous relationship and don't plan to ruin it with ""experimenting"".

I am a bit scared to tell him because I have no idea how he would react to it and I don't want to ruining what I have because of uncertainty. 

Should my boyfriend know about my feelings? Does he have the right to know even if I am not entirely sure myself?

This is my story of going 0-10 in placements, on purpose.


I, IGN: Chomey, http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/20567624 commonly and affectionally dubbed ""the Chominator"", completed my placement matches. The dream, was to be bronze. ""Chomey da brawnz terrur"", they would have called me. Well folks, I did it. I thought you guys might find some of my stories through placements a little amusing.

I had a few rules, and it made this very, very challenging. 

1) Do not get reported. - This meant that I had to not just feed 50 kills through middle. I accomplished this by picking strange and inapporpriate runes, champs, spells and masteries combinations for whatever role I was assigned to.
2) Do not die on purpose, or at least make it look like it was just a bad play. - Same reasoning, I just didn't want to get reported
3) Use as much bro-talk as possible. - Whenever someone got mad at me, I would say something to the effect of ""Sorry bro! I thought I had him!""
4) Try hard. - It's much less demoralizing for your team if you lose when everyone is ""trying"", versus when you have a troll. I made the MIA calls, warded, timed dragons, grouped up, and all the other things expected of me. This made it VERY difficult to lose a few of the games.

Anyways, here is a brief tale of greatness:

Game 1 - Arr! The booty-licious adventure begins:
Who knew, Mejai's-rush-Gangplank mid doesn't work! I was keeping up in cs with the Anivia mid for the first 20 minutes. I got a Bloodthirster after, and proceeded to do absolutely nothing in team fights. I did manage to steal two kills with my ultimate however, since my ultimate scaled off my 6-stack Mejai's nicely.

Game 2 - Machine gun Lulu = Best Lulu:
I decided this game I was going to whip out my secret ARAM weapon: Attack speed, on-hit Lulu. It started absolutely brilliantly. AD runes, masteries and a dorans blade start. Needless to say, the enemy midlaner was perplexed and couldn't play properly out of fear of Lulu's awesome kill potential. I actually managed to bait their jungle Kha'zix into diving me at level 3, and got first blood and double buffs. Proceeded to end up 4-2-1 when my team went 8-27. I'd say this was a victory for Lulu's everywhere!

Game 3 - Fear the dong:
I am bad with Heimerdinger.

Game 4 - Digging graves (not to be confused with Graves) in the jungle:
It never ceases to amaze me that even as a mid-diamond player, I am learning something new every game. This game, I learned that invaded Yorick jungles are REALLY slow. I think I was level 3 by the time the enemy Lee Sin was 6. This has to do with the game starting as a 4v5 though, and my team refused to help me with any damage on either buff, and also refused to ward for the invade. Good times.

Game 5 - Skarner, the Glass-F%@#ng-Cannon Scorpion:
I discovered greatness in this game, and when the ""Chominator"" puts down his wizard stick, this is what he will be remembered for. I have recently been exploring with a glass cannon Lee Sin build, and decided to transpose that to my Skarner. The result? The scariest scorpion you ain't neva seen. Mobility Boots, Spirit of the Elder Lizard, Statikk Shiv, Ravenous Hydra, Trinity Force. Tons, and tons, and tons of damage. Luckily my team was a little lacking in the skill department, so I could try-hard for this match. I was 7-2-5 at one point in this game (http://imgur.com/lEBqdk9), and the last few deaths were us all throwing ourselves selflessly to save our nexus (it didn't work). I did, however, manage to 1v1 the 10-2 Lucian, as the 7-1 Skarner. Guess who won. That's right. The Glass-F%@#ng-Cannon Scorpion, stood atop Lucian's dead corpse, clicking his pincers together in delight.

Game 6 - The ascent of a dragon:
Spurned on by my success with glass cannon Skarner, I decided to build the same thing on my Shyvana. The results were nowhere near the same, and my team, without a spoken word, joined my in my quest to lose the game. I believe we were a combined 4-22 at one point, and the enemy team sealed the deal with a well timed ace, which lead to baron, and then another well timed ace, which lead to the destruction of our nexus. Well played friends, well played. 

Game 7 - The northern winds blow south:
First time Yasuo in the jungle did not go well. Who knew the wind-wall wouldn't block the minions from walking through it and hitting me? I think I died twice on the buff monsters this game. I did, however, score a triple kill. Fantastic stuff really. 

Game 8 - ""They call me astronaut!"" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQrJTavvL1I:
First of all, if you have never seen the Youtube link above, watch it. It's a fantastic video that combines great editting with great playing. I watched the video and was inspired to play attack speed Nautilus. It was brilliant, and definitely something I have to try again. I don't actually know how this game went, other than the fact I was at least even, and we lost the game... I was laughing so hard at seeing his anchor being swung so fast, and I had the above video on loop. The audio cracks me up every time.

Game 9 - Breaking the meta-game mid:
I went back to an old comfort pick, (that's what everyone else was doing in LCS, so it must work for me right?): Malzahar, with a twist. AD Malzahar actually works, and scales extremely well. Ad Malzahar doesn't work well against Kha'zix in the jungle, who has an extremely easy time picking you off, and a Zed in midlane. I must try it again though... Seeing the voidlings attack for 200+ damage per hit while frenzied is hilarious.

Game 10 - Getting back in winning mode - Blind pick:
I had the pleasure of playing with a previous intern and we coordinated this perfectly. We had first pick, and were the bottom two picks. This meant that we got to pick fourth and fifth in the same picking turn. While on voice-chat, we coordinated both saying ""I got support"", ""supporting!"" and then ""oh crap, okay, I'll jungle"", ""sure dude, I'll jungle"", and proceeding to both lock in jungle simultaneously. Needless to say, after all, my acting is impeccable (http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/patrick-stewart-baby.jpg), and our team was completely unaware of the coordinated troll-age.

Lee Sin + Pantheon, double jungle game stomped face. We were a combined 15/3 at one point, and I had to break one of my rules and actually die on purpose many, many, many times before the 20 minute mark to ensure that they didnt surrender. We had their jungler at 0-7 at the 19 minute mark, the same time I was completing my Last Whisperer (having already completed Elder Lizard AND Hydra). We tried to hand the other team the game on a silver platter 5 times, and they still took 38 minutes to beat us. I worked hard and deserved this one friends!

With the help of some Amazonians, both current and former interns, (thanks guys!), I went 0-10. I breathed a sigh of relief as my nexus exploded in game 10, giddy with excitement of the bronze that was to follow. The client closed the game window, and with a gasp I saw the promotion window zoom forward. The colour drained from my face, and my stomach sunk a little. I worked so hard for it, and I got placed into Gold V. I contemplated uninstalling, right then and there, but realized that with the new Season 4 changes, I could theoretically still hit bronze.

The dream is still real.  I’m coming bronze.

The beautiful thing is that most of the games I lost, I had no influence on us actually losing. This really is a team game, where whoever throws the hardest loses. By not capitalizing on the enemies throws, it's really easy to hand them the game by just letting your teammates make all the mistakes!

And here's my profile for proof. I accidentally won a game today. =(

1wg9wa,1,2014-01-29,"Starting anew, with new tactics",sjaak19,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1wg9wa/starting_anew_with_new_tactics/,"Hey guys, how are you holding up? Just a quick update that I needed to vent.

I am on day two, to my shame, and strangely relief. For the last week or so, every other day was a porn binge. It is a new milestone for me, to be sitting behind my computer so calmly after the last couple of turbulent days. My previous streaks mostly lasted a week or 2.

To ensure that I won't fall back so easily, this time I have (re-)implemented some different tactics:

* I secured all my browsers with a filter, on all my internet devices
* I have started updating my journal again
* Every day I will stop one of my bad habits, and start a good one. 

So far the self-improvement list is (next to obviously no touching my wiener, no porn, no edging, no masturbation, cutting off any fantasy I get):

Good habits:

* I started hamstring recovery training properly (day 1)
* I started to go back to the gym (day 2)
* I intend to look for an internship every day, starting today, untill I find one. (today, day 3)

Bad habits I've quit:

* I will no longer get my phone out of my pocket when sitting on the loo.(day 1)
* I will restrict my time on the loo to 5 minutes (day 2, first habit proved not as effective)
* Starting today, I have quit picking my nose (today, day 3)

Why will I make it today?
After my last porn binge, I realised (again) that this is not what I wanted to do. Moreover, I took the time to write down all the reasons that I knew that I needed to quit. I then took my time to research a bit, and came up with quite a few more reasons to need to quit. These things were no big surprise to me, I was aware of them before.

Then I started looking ahead. To the things that I want to build, the things I want to train myself to do. The first thing I realized, was that I wanted to be able to have sex with my girl, without thinking of porn. As soon as I wrote down that line, I had to reread it. I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SEX WITH MY GIRL, WITHOUT THINKING OF PORN. What the Fuck!

This porn, this masturbation thing, it hollows you out so very much, even when previously I thought I was fighting it, I didn't realize how much it had hollowed me out allready...

This is a new battle. I don't just want to quit porn. I want to improve myself. I want to be a better person, for myself and for my girl, my friends, my family. I don't want to keep wasting precious minutes of my life behind this luminicent screen, only to feel hollow and shamefull as soon as my girl comes home and finds this lifeless piece of meat lounging on the couch. 

So to all of you who are new here, and to all of you who have been here but have yet to succeed in quitting porn: try harder. So will I. Because life is too precious to throw away like this. 

**TL,DR**: Revised tactics to quit PMO, starting with filters on browsers on all devices, and will start making a list of things I will improve, with a new one every day. Further more, I realised how much PMO impacts me, and I really want to kick the habit, because life is not forever. 

EDIT: was unable to do bullets properly

1wgh1w,47,2014-01-29,MWO - Gated Progress and the Inability to Thrive,butsuon,mwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1wgh1w/mwo_gated_progress_and_the_inability_to_thrive/,"As many of us have noticed, MWO suffers from a common problem in new games: releasing too early with too little content, releasing dates and times and not keeping them and the big one: the overwhelming need to simply create new things, but not -great- things.

I'm not going to go on about crazy mechwarrior lore or Harmony Gold or any other thing people complain about, this is about company structure and development. **What is PGI, and subsequently IGP, doing wrong?**

-----

For the past year, Mechwarrior Online has slowly dwindled. It's not dead by a long shot, but it's not -thriving-. Ever heard the phrase ""failure to thrive"" with a sick patient? That's what MWO is suffering from right now.

Bogged down by either strange or poor management or heavily gated by their publisher to produce content, PGI developers don't appear to really be doing the job they intended to do. While putting in the 2-week mandatory patches has helped, it's only a stop-gap for other internal problems.

**Failure to thrive.** PGI needs developers to feel like they want to put in 14 hour days and create great things. They should feel like they're ideas are innocent until prove guilty (good until someone tells them otherwise, and can prove it). When a developer has something they have something that's an amazing idea and they want to do it, it shouldn't be ""let's put this on the drawing board for next month"". 

**If a developer has an amazing idea, it should be ""So why haven't you made it yet?""**

-----

**Creating Opportunity.** Despite PGI having a ""WE'RE HIRING"" post on their website for the past year, it doesn't appear that the company has expanded in any significant sense. There is a RAVENOUS community out there for this kind of content. There are people who would literally work for free to make Mechwarrior Online a better game. (You don't really want those people from a human resources perspective, but you get the point.)

**Hire more staff. Bring in Interns. If possible, help people move to your area to work for you. Worst case scenario, outsource QA to the community with a strong NDA and create real guidelines.**

----

**Understanding your target audience.** I feel like the developers are missing the mark here a little. While BattleTech/Mechwarrior/Mecha is an easy target, it should not be your ""target audience"". The communities you want to pull from are shooters. Understanding the game play models and why people enjoy playing those games on a *complex and professional level.* People who compete in eSports often know more about your game play than your developers. They've played the game more than your QA team. They've studied the mechanics more than your logistics team. 

**Watch competitive Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Shootmania, Team Fortress, World of Tanks and Warthunder. Speak to professional players. Ask them about the strategies they use.** This kind of information is a gold mine.

----

**Apparent translucency.** Gamers want to feel like the developers of the game they love are willing to reach out and touch the community personally and talk to people. The Ask the Devs threads/Vlogs are a good start, but ultimately that's not what people are looking for. They want to feel like they can ask questions and get answers any time and get any kind of an answer. I understand that this isn't really conceivably, but you can make it LOOK like it by hiring some interns to troll your forums and divulge tidbits of information for you.

**Engage the community, let them know they're wanted.**

----

tl;dr, grab deals are fine, regular mech releases are fine, regular map releases are fine. 

Don't be so rigid. It's cliche, but the most successful business in the history of the world are both nimble AND focused. Don't corner your developers, they are your business. You're an ART and ENTERTAINMENT company. Content is the fruit you sell at the market. Don't starve your trees by only letting the produce apples on Tuesdays."

Anyway, I'm basically trying to apply for this pretty competitive internship over summer at an animation studio and I was looking for advice on two things that could help improve my resumé.

1. **So far I haven't animated anything so what would be the best way to start getting into that**? I've made my share of models (mostly low-poly since I'm an amateur) but I feel like animating is a whole different thing. I'm willing to put in a lot of time to learn, and if it helps I really like the animation flow of Finding Nemo. I like the quick movements but also how when they come out of the water it looks so real even though it's fake. Any advice on getting into that kind of style would be appreciated.

2. **Is there a useful way to incorporate computer programming into C4D?** I'm studying Computer Science at a university and the position I'm applying for is a beginner internship but they encourage showing examples of code that was used to create certain effects.

I have quite a bit of time to prepare my demo reel so time is of no object to me. Thanks in advance"
1wgqwu,9,2014-01-29,Another car post (buy out my car lease),Weft_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1wgqwu/another_car_post_buy_out_my_car_lease/,"Hey there /r/personalfinance


I come here to hopefully get enlightened by your thoughts and suggestions.



I'd like to start out by saying yes...This is another car post.


My lease is up on my 2011 LT RS Chevy Cruze at the end of February. A little background, my father has always leased. his uncle has worked for Ford for his whole life so he would always get the family discount and because my father uncle worked in sales he always knew the best deals coming up. Through high-school and halfway through college I drove a 1995 Lumina, I got an internship my last 2 semesters of college, but it was about 40 minutes away. My father and I both didn't feel comfortable letting me drive that much in my now crappish car. Well to make a long story short my father made the down payment and I've been making the monthly payments ($150). I've since landed a job at the place I interned at and have been working full time for 2 and a half years.


Current financial situation:


Just turned 24


$30,600 in cash ((savings/checking) Looking at buying a house,also taking a trip to Europe this summer. The rest is ""emergency"" or looking more into investing)


$24,000 in retirement ($18,000 in company match 401k/ $5,500 in Roth IRA) 


According to Mint I have a average  ""take home"" of $1,600 a month. (last 12 months)



I only really use my car as a commuter car. I think I've had 4 people in the back-seat the entire time that I've owned the car. My commute to work is about 20 miles each way. My Cruze get's 34.9 MPG. I like my car because it's small and fuel efficient for me. Because I don't see cars as a hobby or fashion statement and I know very little about them I plan on driving my car until the tiers fall off. 


Now about the car....I went over 4000 miles, so right now I have 40000 miles on it. Like I said the lease is up at the end of February. I can buy the car out for $12,000ish ( it will need new tiers and all the jazz pretty soon so that's another expense coming up ). If I walk away from it I will have to pay $800ish in miles over and a $360 ""inspection fee""(or something along those lines). The dealership said that because it's under my fathers name he would have to buy it out and then ""gift"" it to me, instead of paying taxes on it twice, I'm not really sure how that works. I've tried my best with keeping up with maintenance, and I haven't had to take it into the shop yet (knock on wood) only for re-call stuff.


I was quoted a new 2014 Cruze for 20,000 out the door almost exactly the same as mine the 1.4 turbo engine but with remote start. It seems like a lot and I feel like I can buy a lot more car with $20,000 but I hate researching cars, I just want something to get me down the road.


Any who, another factor is that the dealership said that they could probably  get me a loan but because I really have very little credit history (I have a score of 702) my father (credit score of 800+) would have to co-sign for me. They thought they could get a 3.5%- 4.5% on the new 2014 Cruze, so I'm expecting that I could get about the same but a little hgher for a loan on my car now.


So I ran some number on the bankrate auto loan calculator I'm thinking about putting 20% down then round it up to $3,000 so ultimately I would have a loan for $10,000. I did more number crunching and if i got a $10,000 loan for 3 years with an Interest  rate of 4% I would have a payment of $300 a month. Which would technically only be $150 more then what I pay now and $300 was on the higher side I feel comfortable paying a month. Should I get a 4 year loan and just pay extra each month? 


My only worry is that my 3 year old car now will be 6 years old before I get it paid off. But it seems like my hands are tied right now to stay with Chevy. I don't mind waiting another  3 to start thinking about a new car.


Well any help,thoughts or ideas would be appreciated!"
1wguzm,5,2014-01-29,How To Get My FIRST Producer Gig?,PeteyWinkle,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1wguzm/how_to_get_my_first_producer_gig/,"I'd like a little help with how to pitch my offer to produce the first full length album for a band I'm good friends with. I've never produced a record before but my goal is to become a producer and, since I already have a good relationship with this band, I feel like it's a good opportunity to earn my first gig. But they are a talented group of dudes and take their music very seriously so I don't want to ask them to just let me produce the record as a favor. I want to actually bring something to the table and convince them (and myself) that it will benefit them to work with me. I have some experience (through schooling and freelance work) in recording and mixing. I've also been producing my own music (""producing"" as in composing, recording, arranging, mixing, etc) for about 7 years now. I've also been a guitar player for around 10 years and have some proficiency on bass and drums.

Here are some things I perceive as my strengths:

- I intern at a small but high-end studio and have a good relationship with the owner/engineer. The band I'd like to approach is a rock band and he has a lot of experience with engineering rock music. I'm certain he would love to engineer their sessions which is good because I have reason to believe they are wary of my limited experience with engineering.

- I also have good relationships with several other studios and engineers in the city through a studio booking company I've recently started. Access to a variety of recording spaces, gear, and professionals is not an issue. This company has also allowed me to lock down exclusive rates at great studios so I can help save the band money.

- I have recorded this band before and we have developed a good rapport in the studio. I also have a good ear for the type of sound they seek.

- I have, in my opinion, a deep understanding of music through years of listening, playing, and studying. I have a good ear for pitch and performance as well as arrangement. They are all excellent musicians and their music is very well composed but there have been instances where I've been able to offer a small suggestion for improvement which they've liked.

- I'm very well organized and can easily handle all of the logistical issues such as scheduling sessions, budgets, etc.

- I also work live sound gigs in the city and can help them book shows and network with other bands. 

- I'll work for free!

My weaknesses:

- A lack of experience (obviously the big one!)

- I'm not very well connected to the industry in terms of distribution, marketing, etc.


Sorry for the long post. So basically I'd like to know how I can use my strengths to convince them that I'm a legitimate option to work with compared to a more experienced (and expensive) producer.

Any input is greatly appreciated!"

My intern and I are open to any and all suggestions. We have reached dead ends with two different attempts so far: Django/Geodjango, and Google Maps API V3. Pyjamas looked promising but since it's not available in the Debian Wheezy repositories (despite being packaged in Squeeze), that's a red flag to me. I know there are quite a few options out there but we don't have the time to, for example, learn Ruby, if it's going to lead to another dead end. That's why we're hoping for some good leads.

We're good at learning and we don't want to re-invent the wheel, so we just need a good starting point and I feel someone has probably already figured out how to do this and is sharing it. I can provide any further details needed, for instance if anyone's curious why GeoDjango and Google Maps API didn't work out. (The latter is still an option if we can figure out how to get the map to automatically update when the database changes. I am willing to trigger the update from the server side; I just don't want the client to have to manually trigger it. So far we haven't been able to get this to happen.)

For what it's worth, although we work in a professional environment, this is not a commercial enterprise. We also plan to release what we do as free software when it's done. When we're done, I would hate myself if someone were to say, ""Oh, you should have started with X, it would have done all that for you!"""
1whd1i,3,2014-01-29,I Don't Know Whether I Should Quit Smoking Weed Or Not (I Need Your Advice),Damnskipp,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1whd1i/i_dont_know_whether_i_should_quit_smoking_weed_or/,"Hey ents! Lately, I've been feeling extremely conflicted about smoking for numerous reasons. I know that no one knows what's best for me except for myself, but I could really use some friendly advice.

As I began this second semester of my sophomore year in college, I told myself that I would stop buying weed. Then I spent 3 days in school and bought an eighth. I'm starting to think that I have developed a strong dependence on weed, which I'm not going to lie, scares me. 

I love smoking weed. It calms me down, lets me chill out, and affords my brain some relaxation from the amount of over analyzing I do. I love ripping a bowl, passing it to some friends, and playing some video games or doing some creative writing. I don't drink very much, so smoking is pretty much all I do. But here are the downsides:

I don't work, so spending money on weed adds up REALLY FAST. My bank accounting is being constantly drained from the weekly eighths. At this rate, I'll be broke in a few months. 

I'm trying really hard to get healthy this semester. For once in my life, I want to look good and feel good. I want to be in the best shape of my life for this summer. The problem is, smoking is a huge distraction and complication. I'm trying to eat healthy, but every time I smoke, I magically persuade myself to munch out. I can't fucking help it! On top of that, after I smoke, I tend to stay up late playing League or redditting until late at night, which makes waking up and going to the gym extremely difficult.

On a similar note, I need to keep up my GPA. My parents know how much I smoke, so the only thing keeping them at bay is my 3.92 GPA. The second that goes down, my parents are going to intervene with my habits and freedoms. I've already noticed that a couple times, I made the conscious decision to smoke instead of getting work done. Granted, it's not important work, but I should still be keeping up with readings and other activities. I'm trying to go abroad next semester and find an internship for the summer, and I feel like weed is interfering with my motivation.

To sum it up, I really love smoking but I don't know if I can afford to keep doing it. So here I am, asking you guys and gals for advice. What should I do? How can I balance my life out? What restrictions can I place so that I can afford to smoke and stay ahead in my life? 

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Damnskipp"
1widvm,2,2014-01-29,Regarding Fukushima,GodlyEngi,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1widvm/regarding_fukushima/,"First of all, I'd like to apologize for approaching a subject you're all probably tired of hearing about, but I would like to know some things from people who actually live in Japan.


So, I might go to Japan this summer on an internship and if it goes well maybe stay there longer. I was talking about this with a friend of mine, who has been to Japan and has japanese friends. Putting it nicely, he has quite a negative view on the future of Japan because of Fukushima.


He stated that Japan as we know it will be over in 50 years, that the radiation leakage from Fukushima is even worse than Chernobyl and its effects are already being felt all over the country. He specifically stated that a lot of thyroid problems have been appearing, that even in Tokyo radiation levels have increased, and that many foreigners are leaving the country because of this. He deemed it as an unsolvable problem that would shake the foundations of the country.


Now this all seemed extremely negative and exaggerated, but unfortunately I didn't really have any hard facts to counter his argument. Therefore, I would like to ask this sub if you have any experience or documentation about the disaster in Fukushima that either confirms or debunks this theory.




tldr: friend predicts doomed Japan because of Fukushima, help me show him otherwise.

Each of us have things that they don't like about the other and we have been rocky because our personalities tend to clash at times. but its not something that hard work couldn't normally figure out..

I am graduating from college with a b.s in arch, and she is in the same program but a year behind me. After this semester I will most likely be headed back to my home state for the summer unless i got an internship here. (6 hours away). After I have about 2-3 years of graduate school to do, I don't know where I am going yet but the closest one that i applied to is about an hour away from here, max is 24hrs. Our major requires us to work a lot and we don't ever get like... days off. Even now we were not able to hang out very often because of our major and her job. and being separated for years while being super busy and only one of us having a car pushed our relationship to the edge this weekend. on sunday we decided to see what we could do in order to make it work. and made up. I stayed overnight and in the morning while she was showering I grabbed her ipad so i could browse the internet a bit. I got curious and looked at her messages just cause. What i found pushed me over the edge and caused me to break up with her a few hours later.

What was the messages about? they were between her and her friend (girl) about our relationship and the potential breakup. they pretty much bashed on me for the first half and then talked about her ex for the second half, including trying to get her to pursue him again.
A few of the highlights from the messages are:

* ""I'm not terribly devastated is the thing, almost relieved.""
* ""I totally cant see a life with him, i mean there have been moments where i thought i could but more often im like.. nah""
* ""I just don't/haven't had the courage to break up with him cause being alone scares the shit out of me and (paraphasing) I wouldn't have anyone to hang out with, but it probably would be good for me""
* "" this is stupid i know because he is married now, but i have been having dreams about (ex bf of 5 years) for the past week and i wake up and am like fuck who am i dating again, and why?""
* "" (me) isn't all that great honestly, in fact i kind of hate him a little and can't stand him most of the time but im just so afraid to be alone.""
* ""he has good characteristics but i know he's not my type at all, and yea a lot of it has to do with settling i guess"" (this was after her friend told her she could do better both physically and emotionally in a guy)
* ""i never got over him (ex bf) its been over a year and its totally wearing on me having these lingering feelings"" She goes on to say that he calls his new wife by the exact same specific names he called her and that she thinks the new wife is just a replacement for her. she then asks her friend to find out what happened exactly about a specific thing with them. 

Meanwhile her friend pretty much bashes me the whole time and honestly it seems like she was pushing my ex to try and hit on her old boyfriend. This last bit was actually talked about AFTER me and her ""made up"", she didn't even tell her friend that we made up at all just kept talking about her ex.

After i broke up with her my ex kept telling me that she was trying to like... rationalize and be ""okay"" with the thought of me breaking up with her. But obviously she must have meant what she said at least to a degree, and can't really take back the fact that she had been dreaming about her ex and still loves him and has thought about pursuing that again.

I obviously have my bad qualities too and this is bias because its from my point of view. But did I do the right thing here?

TLDR:
broke up with gf because found messages where she bashed me and said awful things about me and then talked about her ex and how she still loves him and misses him. She claims she was just trying to make herself feel more ""okay"" about breaking up cause we were on the verge of doing so.

I assume she will see this at some point since she has my account name and is a redditor."

1wiqzl,23,2014-01-29,My (Horror) Story With an Academic Internship,skytzx,csuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/csuf/comments/1wiqzl/my_horror_story_with_an_academic_internship/,"The week before the beginning of classes, I was offered an internship at a law firm for working on web development. Thinking this was a good opportunity to gain experience and a good item to put on a resume, I accepted the internship. After a week of getting the necessary papers signed, I began my first day interning. On Monday of this week, I show up and he promptly gets me to work on developing a website for his law firm. Now in these three hours, I spoke with my employer to talk about the details of the internship. His expectations of me were to work 15-20 hours a week for three months, totalling 180-240 hours. I then asked him if it was going to be a paid internship. He tells me that since I was recieving academic credit, it would be illegal for him to pay me.

That night, I did a bit of research and found out some information.

* For academic internships, interns are expected to work 120-150 hours for a maximum of three credits. Working more than that is optional, and completely up to the employer and intern to agree upon.
* It was in fact legal to recieve payment while also recieving academic credit, **despite him telling me otherwise**.
* According to the Fair Labor Standards Act, there are six criteria that an unpaid internship must follow. It states that the ""intern does not displace regular employees"" and that ""the employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantages of the activities of the intern."" While meeting with him, he tells me that I will be developing websites for him and his clients. He also told me that I was the only person working under him that will handle these sort of projects.

After finding out this information, I was highly suspicious of the company. The next day, I enter the CICE office to talk with the Academic Internship Director and to ask about the concerns I had. She sends a message to him about the expectations of employers that offer academic internships. She also gave me a lot of helpful advice as well as suggested I should try to work it out with him, but also start looking for other internship opportunities. To help ease my suspicions, she also offered to look over my contract and NDA before I sign it.

So the next day (today as I'm writing this), I meet up with him to talk about the internship. I bring up how he told me it was illegal to pay me, as well as my him violating the six criteria. After doing so, he denies it and begins to raise his voice. He tells me to leave his office and never contact him again. Reactively, I raise my voice to the same volume saying ""I will,"" and promptly leave his office. (Which looking back, it probably wasn't the best way to respond.)


**TL;DR** Make sure that you know what you are getting into when applying for an internship. Also, working with lawyers is sketchy.


**Edit:** I spoke with the CICE Internship Director as well as the ECS Internship Coordinator today (Jan 30) and told them my situation. They both told me that they were glad that I didn't take the internship. Also, I found that Computer Science interns are usually paid around $18-25 an hour (with some prior experience)."

1wiuq2,3,2014-01-29,Soon to graduate school with an associates in drafting. Few questions.,QQtippy,cad,https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/1wiuq2/soon_to_graduate_school_with_an_associates_in/,"1.) What kind of things should I be expecting within the workforce, I have been lead to think that I will be a middleman that models parts/floor plans (whatever is appropriate for the given job.) between the designer and the machinists. Is this right? My professors have been out of the workforce for a long time so they are not able to give me much of an insight at the workplace right now.

2.)I currently have a firm understanding of Solidworks and AutoCAD are there any other programs that would be widely used that I should learn? I am trying to avoid working down the list of all the CAD programs trying to learn them all.

3.)Do I have much chance at a job without experience as an intern or otherwise, my family has been having money issues to put me through school and I wasn't able to afford any time outside of school or work(fast food) to try and get extra training in a factory.

If I wasn't clear on anything please tell me, I've just been a bit worried about being unprepared to start working even after spending all the money I did at school."
1wixd6,10,2014-01-29,Did you ever try to change yourself? Any success?,betterselfthrowaway,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1wixd6/did_you_ever_try_to_change_yourself_any_success/,"I'm [23/F] at my wit's end with this problem. Since the beginning of college, I've been struggling to change myself for the better but it's not going very well.


By society's standard, I'm pretty much a failure. I've no job, relationship, friends, or real hobbies. I've been completely wrapped up with depression, bulimia, and a drinking problem for 5 years. I'm recovering now, but I'm living with my (wonderful) parents with only $400 to my name. I stopped purging after seeing a number of pyschologists. Still, I've gained weight and I can't fit into ANY of my clothes, minus baggy t-shirts and pajama bottoms.


I'm reminded of this every time I go out to see relatives, and *god* do they like to rub it in. I refuse to see old high school friends because I know most of them have done a lot of work, internships, and grad school while I spent days in utter haze.


I fucking hate this. Everything I tried *not* to be in college pretty much happened. It doesn't help that the assholes I called friends back then laughed at me and told me depression doesn't even exist.


Worst of all, **I don't even feel like a woman**. I still feel like I'm some (wo)man-child, and I hate it. It's even worse that the family around me is telling me to just **""find a nice man and settle down""**, as if that's all I can aim for anymore.


**AND NO,** I'm not looking for pity. All this shit couldn't have happened by accident. I know I made bad choices. **I just want to know how to fix it**.


I tried reading books, TED talks, talking to strangers, taking time to myself, exercising, documentaries, fiction/non-fiction books, etc. I'm frustrated out of my mind.


-------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR: Unhappy. Trying to change myself for the better. How did you do it?**


Also, please don't tell me the ""just love yourself!"" bullshit that every sitcom and female-targeted corporate marketing tries to push down my throat. I love parts of myself, but the 80% rest I'd *love* to change because I'm so goddamn unhappy."

1wj6r9,4,2014-01-29,LOR question,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1wj6r9/lor_question/,"I'm really starting to panic about my application for the upcoming cycle and make a final decision when I get my MCAT score back towards the end of February. I want to be prepared for the best case though, and my school is asking that LoRs be in by March 7, so I have got to make up my mind about who to ask pretty quickly. These are my options right now:

* My faculty advisor at school. I have only met with her twice, obviously has knowledge about my strengths in classes, remembers who I am, has lots of experience writing LoRs I'm sure, I met with her last semester to discuss when I should take the MCAT and ultimately went against her advice but she said to ask someone else afterwards anyway.
* My previous research supervisor for a lab I worked in last spring. I have been in close contact with him since then as he has me a LoR already for applying to summer internships. I had little personal contact with him since I started working in his lab, as I was with his postdoc most of the time. I cannot understand a lot of what he says. He can email me fine but I don't know that the LoR would be all that well-written.
* My lab supervisor for this semester. I have not met this person yet but I am meeting with a prof that I could potentially end up working with for the first time tomorrow. I have reviewed her work pretty extensively and am confident that I will leave a good impression, and she has expressed that she would be happy to have me in her lab, though this will all be discussed more tomorrow.
* A professor at my school who assists the lead professor in my genetics class. I really like genetics so far even though we are only about a week in, and I am coming in with a lot of prior knowledge as I studied it pretty extensively during my MCAT studies. She is holding problem-solving sessions weekly and I would be able to attend five before LoRs are due. I plan to attend each one, sit in the front, do well and try to ask smart questions, as well as attend her office hours. I would say I'd be able to do three weeks before I'd really have to ask her to do the LoR, as that would give her 2.5 weeks to write it and mail it in.
* My crew chief from EMS in my hometown. I volunteered with an ambulance crew over this past summer and winter and would be a probationary member should I return for this upcoming summer. She has interviewed me and written me a LoR for volunteering at a hospital while I was home, and seems to like me. I have logged about 100 hours there.
* A doctor I have shadowed in the hospital. I have only shadowed him once so far, but will absolutely be doing so again, probably twice in a few weeks when I go back home, as well as a few times over spring break, which is after LoRs are due. He is also my family doctor, has known me since childhood, and seemed to really focus on me and my application while I was shadowing. He likely cares about my success more than anyone on the list. However I did tell him that I had a 3.4, and he expressed concern that I should probably take a gap year, which I may not do depending on my MCAT.
* My boss from a job I have back home as a cashier in a supermarket, where I worked 35-40 hours per week for the last two summers and one winter. She definitely likes me as a person, as she has kept my job open for this upcoming summer, despite my not having worked there since the beginning of last August. She is very friendly and praising and I think she'd write a good letter.
* A family friend who is a very esteemed doctor regarding infectious disease (which also happens to be the subject of my first semester of lab work at school). I only know him on a personal level, and even then not very well - he married the daughter of one of my mother's closest friends. He knows that I want to be a doctor, and probably not much else about me, but I could easily meet up with him to have a conversation and I'm sure he'd be willing to write me a LoR.

One of these has to be a professor at my school, so it would be at least one of the top four. Any feedback is greatly appreciated."

* She was my high school sweetheart and college lover. I, M/23, pined for her since I met her all those years ago, and eventually it blossomed into something I wish I'll be able to get back one day (if not with her, with someone else). She smelled like sweet flowers. Her smile made me smile. She had dreams, and she was making them happen. She supported my silly endeavors and pushed me to become more of a man.  Knowing she was happy made me happy. Eventually she went off to college, but we made it work. I transferred to another school 2 hours from her. It wouldn't matter, though; we were both steeped in work. She eventually graduated and went travelling. I stayed in school. She went abroad for months at a time, sometimes with no means of communication at all. Things were rocky, but I had my eye on the Big M eventually: marriage.
 * Then I fucked it all up by cheating on her one drunken night.
* Let's talk about this part. This wasn't a man trying to get his rocks off. This wasn't a power move. This was a depressed individual who needed contact with another person. This is NOT a plea for sympathy. I already know I'm a selfish asshole for doing what I did. In retrospect, searching for a surrogate partner whom one desperately hopes can fill in that persistent void of that special someone else is never, ever a good idea. No matter how drunk you are.
* I was horrified as soon as it was over. I knew things would be over between me and who I wanted my wife to be. So I lied about it. For months. That's the sickest, most fucked up part about this whole ordeal. I *lied* about cheating on her. I couldn't believe myself. I still can't. It sickens me. But I suppose we lie to ourselves if it makes us happy. My guilt wouldn't let me be happy, though. I had to tell her.
 * Ah, she was a saint about it all, too.. She really thought it was something *she* did, not my own horrible mistake.  It wouldn't matter in the end. My shame and depression over what I had done to us eroded what little we had left. Trust between us was annihilated. They say time heals all wounds. It's been a year, and I still can't believe I let this woman go. She is still the best thing that's happened to me. How messed up is that? What is this self destructive behavior??
* Today I found out I was turned down for an internship with the New York Times. I figured she would want to hear (she is an angel to this day... she still ""loves"" me and wants to hear about my life... she just can't be mine ever again). I told her, and she uplifted me. She gave me hope. She said it would be ok. I believed her. I always believe her. Even when I don't. 
* Then she told me how great she was doing. New boyfriend, new amazing job, new house, new friends. She was so happy, reddit, I wish you could have heard her. I smiled through my speech for the first time in months. She could tell I was sober (something I hadn't been in months). 
I hung up the phone happy. I wanted this woman to have the best life imaginable. She deserved it. Then I realized she already did. And I wasn't in it. Like a bipolar clown, I went from all smiles to sucky little-bitch-tears. She is happy, and I have nothing to do with it. Sounds narcissistic, sure, but I had always hoped she wouldn't need anything else to be happy. For a while, it had really seemed like that. 
* Now I'm just here reliving every horrible decision I've made as midterms loom ever nearer and essay/scholarship deadlines start becoming something to worry about. Karma is real, folks. Don't let a good one go, and don't cheat *before* you break up with someone. Just because you go to college doesn't make you smart, either. Take it from me.

TL;DR: I hope you learn from my mistakes.

1wjqaa,3,2014-01-30,"I'm slowly but surely getting worse, and I don't know why",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1wjqaa/im_slowly_but_surely_getting_worse_and_i_dont/,"Let me just preface this by saying that I'm not suicidal. I'm not looking to kill myself, I'm just not sure why I'm feeling the way I do, and I'm hoping that maybe someone out there can relate. 


I'm a 20 year old guy, I go to a good university, I have a few close friends, and I have plenty of time and opportunities ahead of me. Sure, I've had my share of hardship and heartbreak, but I know there are people out there who struggle every day just to live, so who am I to complain? By most objective measures, I've had a pretty fortunate life, and I realize, in the grand scheme of things, how lucky I've been. 

Despite all of that, I'm struggling. I've always had issues with anxiety and depression, but recently I feel like it's been getting worse, and I'm really not sure why. My anxiety has slowly but surely gone from some simple social awkwardness to a steady stream of negative thoughts and feelings, and it's taking its toll. In situations where I used to be fine, like speaking in front of class, I now find my mind racing. I stumble over my words and get intensely self conscious, when I used to be fine in that very same situation. It's like a constant overdrive of worry that I can't turn off. It's gotten to the point where I can physically *feel* the anxiety in my head, like a weight in the middle of my mind, pulling me down. I'm really not sure why it's been getting worse, but it has. 


Now, for as long as I can remember, I've always had this deep feeling that somehow, for some reason, *I'm not good enough*. I look around at all of my peers and see what they're doing, and I feel like I've fallen behind. For example, I see my friends and classmates getting these great internships and preparing for the future, while I still work at the same place I did in high school, cleaning bathrooms and bagging groceries for minimum wage. I still have more than two years until I graduate, but the prospect of the real world scares the ever-loving shit out of me. 

Unlike a pretty sizable majority of my peers, I'm a virgin. I've been in one relationship, and I constantly feel like a loner, even though I don't want to be. Of course, logically I know it's not a big deal at all. I'm still young and there'll be plenty of time for that, but for some reason it still bothers me to an excessive extent. My friends are bringing home different girls every night, while it takes me weeks to even work up the courage to say something, if I do at all. 

When I was younger (relatively speaking), I used to fantasize about finding that *someone* out there, who would somehow make me whole and happy. I've realized, as most of us do in time, that you need to love yourself first. That's the problem though, I don't love myself. I look in the mirror and I don't like the person who looks back. It's a quiet form of self loathing. To self medicate, I've been experimenting with drugs. I know the happiness and relief I get from them isn't *real* happiness, but I'll take what I can get, you know? 

I'm really not sure where to turn with these thoughts and feelings. While I have a few close friends, I don't feel like I have anyone who I can go to and talk to about any of these things completely openly and freely. I've considered talking to a counselor, but the stigma attached with these things, especially as a guy, is pretty tremendous. You know what I'm talking about. The ""Guys aren't supposed to feel sad or anxious; just suck it up and grow a pair"" mentality. 

It feels like I've just been bottling up all of this anxiety and negative emotion and sadness for a long as I can, and now I can slowly but surely feel myself starting to come apart at the seams. 

All I really want, more than anything, is for this black cloud that I've been feeling hover over me for so long to go away. I'm tired of being the lonely,melancholy, neurotic guy. I just wanna see the sun. "
1wjti7,39,2014-01-30,"A complete upgrade to villages. It would be its own ""Village Update""",[deleted],minecraftsuggestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1wjti7/a_complete_upgrade_to_villages_it_would_be_its/,"I've got a lot of ideas and all of it happening it a bit of a stretch or maybe even a huge stretch, but certain aspects I think are totally worth adding. If nothing else read suggestion number nine!

1. One idea I saw somewhere on this subreddit was villagers talking. Now they already do talk to each other in the sense that sometimes you'll catch two looking at each other giving the illusion of interaction. While I think actual words or even just a variety or different noises they make would be cool, the ""meow"" sound they make is just too goddamn hilarious. I would be so pissed if they took that out.

2. I think simply a bigger villages should be added. Their can be the small ones too, but a higher chance for a larger village to spawn would be nice. 

3. I would also like to see villages in more biomes. For one thing I think all biomes should be capable of naturally spawning villages, but certain biomes should have different chances. For example biomes that are harder to live in like tundra, desert, swamp, etc. would have less chance, but still the possibility of spawning a village.

4. It's really hard to not want to overcomplicate the villages or the game for that matter, but we have to realize Minecraft has to be a little more simple and leave more to the imagination. That being said I think villages in general should perhaps be a bit more rare, but intern more complex and thus more valuable. We can't give the villagers themselves too much personality or else it takes away from the game a bit I think. I think what's more important is more of a visual personality rather than them have names and being able to talk. That would't feel like Minecraft. 

5. That all being said there is a lot that can be done to the game whilst still keeping the same feel. I think what would be especially cool would be too have what I would call dynamic villages. A village in which NPC'S are smarter and say are assigned to specific house and maybe also have trading stalls they go to in the day time. This would not only make more sense, but it would be easier to find villagers to trade with. I want farmers to harvest and blacksmiths to actually make stuff. I want villagers to trade with each other and seem more alive. This could be a damper on Iron Golem farming, but I think that takes a bit away from the game anyway. I think that maybe there could even be different gendered villagers and that each house could support a man, woman, and a number of children relating to size. the kids take longer to grow up, but when they do they move out and perhaps construct their own houses or as another redditor suggested leave and start new villages. The new villages thing could get out of hand though. It would not only be hard to program, but might put more stress on the game over all having to keep more specific track of all these villagers even when you're not around. 
I'm think maybe villagers can stray away from the village, but only to a certain distance and they would do this to say hunt, fish, mine, etc. 

6. Going back to the dynamic village thing I would really like for a village to have more available and become more prosperous depending on how the player interacts with the village. Maybe if the player trades a lot and the villagers then in turn trade with each other then it could boost the villages economy and have more trade options. I think the happiness or relation toward the player should play a bigger role. If say the player has made a certain amount of villagers happier then maybe they lower their trade price or occasionally toss random items at the player. Villagers having pets is another idea I saw here which would be a nice touch. I think more villager interaction is key. After certain happiness level or if all trades are completed then maybe you can open the villagers inventory. Since they are your friend they might straight up let you have certain items or you could give them armor and weapons and they might protect the village (or more cynical, but hilarious - they would go on a killing spree). 

7. Villagers should have more occupations like guard, fisherman, king, queen, hunter, etc. They should also have more specific clothing not only regarding their job, but also biome specific clothing. 

8. More complicated and various building should be able to spawn and bigger ones. Villages should have a chance to come with farms of animals or stables of horses. More building purposes like mead hall, market, prison, knight hall, armory. Maybe the armory has very rare items but has a locked door or something. You have to gain total villager trust to gain access and if you break it down they become hostile toward you. Maybe even have the villagers be smart enough to recognize that you saved the town from zombies and become more trustworthy of you.

9. Lastly and most importantly, if nothing else please implement this suggestion!!! Recruiting villagers as followers! You could have it so where if you gained complete trust of a villager and traded all his trades and everything, he would have some sort of trade option where you give hime something and he becomes your follower. You could access his inventory to give food for health, weapons, and armor. They could with this even be a sort of pack mule giving you extra inventory space. It would be especially cool of you could go some place and tell them that's where they should stay. Not like wolves where you just click and have them sit and wait for you, but rather you point to an area, ideally your base, and within a certain block radius they'll stay. The can wander around your base and seem more alive until you're ready to have them adventure with you.

TL;DR: More complex and dynamic villages ultimately making them seem more alive. Pet's, more jobs, building, farming, economy, more complex trading, more biomes, more clothing detail, etc. Most importantly however - Recruiting villagers as followers!!!"
1wkceq,2,2014-01-30,"My friends and family assume I believe in God, should I tell them I no longer do, or would that needlessly harm them?",peace-monger,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1wkceq/my_friends_and_family_assume_i_believe_in_god/,"I know it would cause my mom great anxiety if she were to find out about my lack of faith. And I don't intend for this to sound arrogant, but I'm worried that my disbelief could shake the faith of my friends, because in my circle, I'm the one who has studied and participated in Christianity the most. I have a degree in Christian theology, have done numerous missions, was a youth leader, and a pastoral intern, did some seminary, etc. If people found out I didn't believe, I think it could cause them to doubt as well, which I wouldn’t want to happen. Plus I think it would end or severely diminish those relationships (these are conservative evangelical people, not reddit Christians who are friendly with atheists).

So it seems I should just keep my disbelief to myself and avoid God topics with believers. Yet I feel like no-one knows the real me. My wife is the only person I talk to about this kind of stuff, and over the years of talking with me, she has gone from a leader in the church to someone who has lost her faith as well. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.

1wkj55,0,2014-01-30,"Ask First, Wear Second.",Achaidas,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1wkj55/ask_first_wear_second/,"*Trust me.  Read this in full.*

Having finally found this subreddit fills me with both sadness and exultation in a whirl of emotions that confuses me.  You see, I don't hate, nor despise, my roommate, however he often crosses the line.  So much so... *no*... I have to start at the beginning.

&gt;* Be Me, Achaidas, living in flo-rida (/r/fatpeoplestories anyone?)
* Be 3 other roommates.
* One buddy from College named Cuban
* One former supervisor named Tex
* One new friend named Sports (he LOVES sports..)

Moved down to luxurious and old Flo-rida to Del Boca Vista with former college bud, Cuban, to take part in an internship.  By the Gods I ended up enjoying the area and subsequently saying, ""Hey, job me, plz."" and through luck and persistence was signed on part-time.  At this point I now have a job and friends, next I need a home.  Why not live with former supe and college buddy, sounds fun, right!?

Well.  It was fun. Sometimes.  Often enough.  We laughed.  We played.  We made funny Seinfeld references when appropriate. We gathered Ikea furniture from around the globe.  We compared recipes and like the early Church broke bread in harmony together.  All was well in our little parcel of land.

But, all good things come to an end.

Like the fruit that Cuban would leave out for far too long, spots of degradation and sickness began to grow in the Land of Del Boca Vista.  From far off, a cold and grimy wind blew in and stirred forth hunger for hate and wretchedness.  Vile pits of tar and death bubbled forth and spewed their contents of ""ick"" and ""blech"" upon our sunny land.

A light died.

And so begins our tale.

Many things had been done, many treasures lost, trips began to only end suddenly, and those stories may come if time proves well and audience proves hungry.

For now, I will regale to you the story of Cuban stealing my prized Christmas shirt.  One of many I had received.

As you know, I got a job from my internship and with that I needed new clothes to become hip and professional and what not.  Well from time to time we in our house may need a shirt for an event or what not, so merely ask and judging on the mood of the individual, we would grant ""Yay"" or ""Nay"" and so be it.  But hard and fast was the rule.  Hard. And Fast.

But this Cuban neither wanted to, nor thought to, abide by this Golden Rule of Ours.  For you see, Cuban had just received a new job and one that required the much troubling hours of just past Midday to Midnight.  This meant that most of Tex, Sports and I didn't see much of Cuban since our schedules were so topsy-turvy from one another.  A lunch here, a morning there, a shame-filled midnight snacking there.  One could have easily lived with Casper or Moaning Myrtle and known naught the difference.

One fine day after working hard and receiving accolades from myself I returned home to a humid and hot house (We have a Second Rule: Last one out, cut off the air.  We're a frugal bunch.) only to notice a stirring in the air.  As if... just slightly... something was off.  Much like a hunter, I carefully scanned the room, floor, and walls for anything amiss.  Stalking back to my room, I knew.  I just knew.

You see, I have a very particular way of hanging my garb and vestments.  Color coordinated from Red to Green to Blue (No Y...), all long sleeve shirts are unrolled (if rolled!) and clasped and all buttons are done up to the second to last button.  This ensures an economic way of hanging (no one like a loose shirt falling off the rack) and an economic way of sliding the shirt over my svelt body in order to quickly dress.  All rack hooks face the wall.  *Very. Particular.*

What should I see then but one extra rack standing out in the cold lacking a dress shirt to warm its wormy appendages.  I knew that my shirt was missing, for I had done laundry already that week, and for sure I knew that I was **not** wearing two shirts.  Therefore, someone had either stolen that precise shirt or a roommate had borrowed it.

Please refer to Hard and Fast Rule #1.  Someone had disobeyed and only one could be accused.

Quickly referring to my iPhone I punched up a quick, precise text message that went like so:

&gt;Hello Cuban,  

&gt;Are you currently wearing my prized  
Blue and White checker patterned  
Dockers brand shirt?  

&gt;If so, please quote to me my hard  
and fast rule on ""Achaidas' Items"" ...  
""Ask first and use second after permission  
is granted.""

&gt;Signed --- Achaidas  
P.S. --- STRIKE TWO!!

The dreaded sent button had been pressed, and like digital tadpoles, the letters whirred and whizzed through cyberspace until they plummeted like little drops of rain upon the surface of Cubans phone, lighting up briefly on his desk as he worked a droll day-job (Artistic liberties on the assumption of the transmission of data taken.)

I did what every grace-filled and righteous roommate would only do:  
Sent it to my two other roommates Tex and Sports!

Sports exclaimed with fury and laughter, ""I watched him walk out in that shirt!!!""

To which my suspicions were indeed confirmed and made valid.  But to naught end, because Cuban did not reply, which was a grievance easily looked over since he was indeed drolly working dutifully in preparation for his day of Marriage coming soon.  Who would expect him to betray his hourly pay-wage by taking a mere second to glance at an incoming message. Who.

Night falls and similar to a couple who has fought recently, with wounded heart I fake a steady breath as Cuban comes home, hoping beyond hope to fall asleep before my cover fails and I snort rather than snore.

But, morning comes to all men.  Quietly I dress, and using the economic motion of dressing up, quickly finish.  Buttons fastened.  Belt adjusted.  Fly up.  I sense a motion behind, a jitter.  He slumbers on, but lightly.  With humor in my voice I quip up, ""Good morning Sweet Judas.  Would you like to wear a shirt today.""

To which Cuban huskily chuckled and strained silence once again fell, only to be quickly reclaimed by him uttering, ""I didn't wear your shirt to work, I thought it was another one.  The one there at your feet.""

Little did he know that the ""one at my feet"" was lying prostrate on the bathroom floor, not our bedroom.  A ruse maybe?  Carefully placed on the bathroom floor to plan his betrayal?

What then?  I offered him to have a good day, wished him luck at work, and moved off to work with questions in mind.

Was I blatantly lied to?  
Did he wear his brown counterfeit shirt instead of my blue one and Sports just doesn't know the difference between colors?  
Did he wear the blue one out, only to stuff it crudely in his backpack and replace it with his brown?  

I may never know.  

But I do know that it causes me trepidation in mine heart of hearts.  For at this juncture what is my course of action?  I'm forced to do the one thing that can protect him and his future-to-be.  I must forgive, and then swiftly break up his future-marriage in the harshest way possible.  Because when will this end? When we are no longer roommates?  His next victim is Cuban de Fiance! Will Cuban stop at wearing billowy, womanly blouses?  Surely he wouldn't cross that line? Surely?

Only I can save their marriage now.

**TL;DR: Roommate breaks Hard and Fast Rule, I break his Marriage.**

1wkjjw,4,2014-01-30,I [20/F] am having problems in my LDR with my boyfriend [21/M]. A little over a year together. Sorry for the wall of text!,longdistanceishardx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wkjjw/i_20f_am_having_problems_in_my_ldr_with_my/,"I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year and a month now. Everything was going great, we had some disagreements like everyone but worked them out by talking and I was happier than I've ever been before.

I'm French-American and my entire family is French, so I spend my summer and winter breaks there. After having been together for about six months, my boyfriend came to visit me for 6 weeks in France during the summer, and we visited some of his family in Holland as well. This might not seem relevant now but I guess it'll kind of make sense later.

Anyway, we both attend the same university in the United States. During the fall semester I debated back and forth between studying abroad in Paris or not. We kind of discussed it together but never really in detail, and most importantly we never talked about what would happen to us. I finally made up my mind and decided to apply, and I got accepted. Since my family is in France, I was also going there for Christmas, so I left my boyfriend on December 20th. It was horrible. I had done long distance with my ex for two years (he was in France and I was in America) and I've never felt so sad leaving him than I did leaving my current boyfriend. But I didn't have a choice, I'd already applied and said I was going, so I had to.

Like I said, we never really discussed what we would do. We both didn't want to break up, and we both tried to reassure each other that if we talked enough it would be alright and we'd work through it. However, I guess I could tell from the start that he wasn't into this whole long distance thing at all.

 I'm going there for my spring break which is February 20th, so about 3 weeks from now. At that point it'll have been two months since we've seen each other.

We've argued a bit by Skype and text and it's always really shitty. Although I'm French I've never lived in Paris, much less by myself and it's all kind of new and scary to me. He doesn't really seem to care because according to him if I didn't want that to happen then I shouldn't have gone. 

He generally complained about being lonely and I always tried to reassure him saying that it was only two months, that he could hang out with either of his 4 roommates or his other friends, go to the gym, concentrate on classes and other things. We also talk every day on whatsapp and generally Skype for 30 mins to 3 hours almost every night. It kiiiind of worked I guess but not really. 

Yesterday was the worst argument we've had yet. It was by text message, so it was even worse. Essentially he told me we had to talk about the future, so I said alright. He told me he was lonely and he couldn't take it anymore so I reminded him that I would be there in three weeks to spend a week with him. He agreed but then said I'd be leaving again for even longer (my semester ends May 23rd) and then I'll be going to France for the summer so we wouldn't see each other for very long. I said that I understood and I hate that I'm hurting him and if he thinks that he could be happier some other way (like without me) then I'd accept it, even if it's not what I want, but I'd like to wait 3 more weeks so we can see each other and discuss in person to see how it goes. Then he questioned why I even went abroad (I did because it's a prestigious school and new experiences) since I already go to a good school and I say it looks good on a resume but I'm not submitting my resume anywhere or talking about my future (which I thought was unfair because I'm freaked out about my future since I don't know what I want to do and that's why I don't like to talk about it). 

Then I asked him if he really wanted me to come for spring break and his answer was really vague until I eventually got a ""whatever"" and then an explanation that he wants to see me but at the same time he doesn't because I'm just going to be leaving again. I then told him that I was looking to apply for an internship over the summer in the state that we both live in, but he said he doesn't know where he's going to be so that might be useless and we still wouldn't see each other (at this point I don't really know what to do). 

Then he told me he's been depressed and I haven't noticed. I have, but like I told him I'm trying to talk to him as much as I can without bordering on harassment and showing him that I think about him all the time and love him (I got him a xmas present in person, then ordered one online that got there a few weeks after I left and recently sent him a care package with candy and stuff from France). His response when I asked what more I could do was ""be here"" which, obviously, isn't possible. 

I don't know what to do anymore, nothing that I'm saying seems to be reassuring him and convincing him that I want this to work out. So I swallowed my pride (and my affection I guess) and asked if he thought he would be happier if we broke up, and if he did then that's what I wanted for him. He didn't even answer that up front, saying that he doesn't know but it wouldn't be empty waiting at least. Then he brought up the fact that I'm going to be in France again this summer (my sister is getting married) and he can't go with me every time I go. I reminded him of my internship search but he said he can't hold me to that because I also said I didn't want to study abroad. 

And then this lovely conversation ended with him telling me to make the wait worth it, because it wasn't right now. I asked how I could do that (since I think I'm doing everything I can) and he told me to figure it out or lose him.

This was last night. We talked about other things for a little bit after, and I went to sleep. Right now it's kind of just me asking questions about how he's doing and what's going on and just getting one liners back.

I really don't know what to do. I realize that I'm hurting him, but I don't know what he expects of me. I don't want to lose him but I'll accept a breakup if it makes him happier. At this point however I really don't know what he wants and it makes me feel so shitty that I get all this thrown in my face and then I can't even talk about how I'm lonely or stressed out because apparently if I didn't want this to happen I shouldn't have gone in the first place so I just have to suck it up.

I guess I'm just looking for advice or ideas about what I could do because I'm lost right now.

I don't know what more I can do.,aboveandbeyond8,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1wkm72/23f_i_want_to_move_on_from_my_long_distance/,"I'm asking you for advice as I do not know what to do anymore:

My boyfriend and I met at college as I was an exchange student where he was doing his senior year there. We started dating
as soon as we met. It was an instant connection. We were together for 2 months before I had to go home.
Neither of us could consider breaking up because of the separation and we started our long distance relationship.

We were supposed to not see each for 6 months yet i managed to visit him for a week around Spring.
We spent 2 months together the following summer traveling and enjoying time with our respective friends and families.

I landed my senior year internship in the US and he had thought about moving where I am for us to be together, at last.
Unfortunately he did not seem to find a lot of job openings and his parents weren't too keen on him moving either given
I will only graduate this summer and I'm on a visa.

We've been traveling back and forth, visiting each other and trying to make the best of it...

Now I am going to have to go home for a bunch of months, going through another visa process as I got a job offer.
He is yet undecided on whether he wants to start working or go to grad school around where I am.

He says he loves me, wants us to be together but I tell him that he does not show it or does not fight or try to make 
it happen as I have done all I could to get closer.
At this point there is nothing else I can do on my side and I am so tired of waiting.

We have been together over a year and we have actually physically been together for little over 4 months.
I am scared and sad not knowing how much longer I will be able to wait. At the same time I can simply not bear the 
thought of not being with him and not having him in my life.

I am terribly lost as I have made a big move in order to give us a chance, leaving my home country and family and friends behind.

At that point any input or advice would be more than absolutely welcomed."
1wkvek,18,2014-01-30,Finally 90 days!,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1wkvek/finally_90_days/,"Wow. So much as changed since I started this challenge:

1. I broke up with my girlfriend of one year. Normally this is not something to feel good about, but in my case it is. See, with my mind all brainwashed with porn, I believed that as long as im getting sex, nothing else mattered in a relationship. I was only with her because I did not think i could find any one else to have sex with. So a few days ago, I ended it. I've got more important things to focus on than just sex.

2. Health improvements:
I used to suffered from what I believed to be hemorroids. I was too ashamed to go to the doctor for something like this so i did not know if it was hemorroids but from what I read, and suffered for almost 2 years, with the last few months causing enough itching and burning to wake me up at night. 
I used to wake up with eye boogers every morning for the last 10 years at least. I used to attribute this to my contact lenses, even though I always cleaned them up properly.
These 2 things are completely gone. I know it has to do with nofap because they stopped at around the first month and havent come back since. My guess is these things were stress related.

3. Career: I've recently felt disgusted at myself for having slacked so much my whole life. I graduated from a great school with an accounting degree and a decent GPA. I have nothing to show for it. I had convinced myself that corporate or office work was ""not for me"". Now i realize that this was my wimpy lazy self making up an excuse for not being able to hold a good job with big responsibilities. In college I was already intelligent and quite interested in my field, but too lazy to find an internship. After college I was too lazy to find a good job. i thought of myself as too incompetent, i did not care about succeeding. I became ""spiritual"", and left a decent job for an easy shit job. I let my parents down. All because of porn. Even when I decided to work at home as a stock trader, i quickly failed because i would browse porn after 2 hours of trading stocks.
Now I realize all this. Now I feel like winning. I feel like going for what I want. I've been applying to jobs and reading books on job searching. I'm preparing myself to find the job I always wanted since young. I've never stayed in front of my computer for 5 hours straight without interruption of porn, just job searching. 

What have I learned so far? Every accomplishment starts with a small initial effort. When you are in a bored state of mind you're in a lazy state of mind. You will not feel like doing anything that takes effort. But if you start taking the action despite the feeling of laziness you will gain ""momentum"" and after a few moments you will be fine with doing that action and happy that u took the initial effort. 
This is why pmo is harmful, it makes you be ok with being bored and lazy.

This is actually how I got to 90 days. Initially I didnt count the days of being pmo free, I took a small initial effort of being pmo free for just 12 hours, then 24 hours, then 36 and so on. After a few days, I counted the days. Now I'm counting the months.

Also, giving yourself alternatives is bad. If you masturbate, thats your alternative to seeking a real partner. 

One last thing I want to say is this. Wake up now. Most if not all people that try nofap will fail many times before they suceed but im confident most will succeed eventually. Dont be part of the group that never succeeds and loses. Take the challenge now. Time passes quickly and before you know it you will regret that you didnt stop pmo as soon as you found out about it. If you had started New year's day, you would have already been 30 days pmo free.

We the nofappers are leaders, simply because we don't give up, we only go for winning, fuck the alternative, we don't even think about it.

1wkwsm,3,2014-01-30,Family issues - Am I the problem or is it her?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wkwsm/family_issues_am_i_the_problem_or_is_it_her/,"Hey reddit - this is my first post! And I decided to get the ball rolling through family issues that, through the eyes of a disinterested third party, might be able to see what's going on. Let's start at the beginning.

About 3 years ago, my brother (now 25, we shall call him Shawn) got accepted into Harvard's summer program for architechure. While there, he met his now-fiancée (now 24? I dunno her exact age, but around there, we shall call her Yolanda). At the end of the program, we as a family (mom, now 54, dad, now 54, younger sister, now 18, myself (F, now 23) went to go see him and this new gf, and she was nice. 

And this is when the shit storm began. Yolanda began lying about how she came to being here and where she came from. She originally told us her parents were wealthy. Her mother was a famous fashion designer in New York, her father was a heart surgeon (but he's not in the picture for unknown reasons), and that she just came off of an internship for GE in which she completed under budget and ahead of time, which she received a paid bonus and a new fancy car. 

Then it soon came to light that her parents were not wealthy. Her mother is a seamstress, her father IS a heart surgeon BUT IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, which means jackshit here. And there was never an internship with GE (with the excuse that her mother took all the money for fear my brother would take it for himself and she gave back the car because it would only be stolen in NYC). We found out about 4 months later, my brother was eating her lies up for 3 months before he found out, which I think is WAY TOO LONG to figure out.

Then come Christmas, my mom came to me saying all the things stated above, PLUS there was a STI scare because when mom was doing her bills (my mom's credit card is wired to my bro's, mine and my sis's so whatever charge we put on our credit card, she sees), she saw a charge for a clinic and a list of tests for STIs and such. So we thought this girl was a tramp and gave my brother an STI. When I personally talked to her about it, she told me she ate a hotdog off the street venders in NYC, which didn't agree with her. So they got scared and decided to test themselves and both are clean.

Then as Yolanda and I talked, we just had a grand time talking and chatting and getting to know each other. It got to the point where I was going to one of her maids of honor at her wedding. And then she gave me a ""friendship"" bracelet as a sign of it, and I was happy. I wore them every time she came to our house. We've chatted a total of three times, for at least three hours. 

My brother and Yolanda moved in together while Shawn was still getting his master's degree from Pratt. And what really irked me was Shawn had a side job while Yolanda just was in school full time, not helping out at all with the rent. They relied mostly on returns from her tuition and Shawn's side job of catering. And now my brother has a full time job and gets to travel a lot. Yolanda still has no job, decided her current college wasn't good for her future, and now wants to go to a completely different school that's only an hour from our house. She supposedly pays through loans.

And now recently, as I think about this woman who has taken my brother's heart, weaseled herself into this good family (my mom and dad both think she's crazy and wants Shawn to break it off) and now they've set their wedding date for next year in May. I've talked to my brother about my concerns with her, and he completely downplayed all my problems with her. He says she has been completely honest with him after the initial lying and they communicate about everything. Then after that conversation going no where, Yolanda sent me a letter via FB explaining she wants me out of her life permanently and just wants to go forward in her life with my brother, and accuses me of solely me having a beef with her, when it's the whole family. She apparently apologized to the right people, learned her lesson and just wants to move on. She even slapped a bible verse in my face, and, according to my ultra bible-savvy best friend, used out of context and only used it to suit her point. I think it was John 8:9, ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone"" or something like that. I'm not religious, but I am spiritual. But anyway, after that letter, I will never speak to her ever again, and I will never apologize for what I've done or said to her, nor will I ever forgive her for what she's done to my family. I desperately want her out of this family.

We (as brother and sister) don't talk anymore, and, honestly, we haven't had the greatest relationship in the world. He always policed me around. I would be at the computer and start singing and he was always in the next room playing video games yelling at me to shut up and stop singing because it was horrible (which was emotionally scarring to me, singing is my life and have never stopped singing). I used to watch my brother play video games and did a bit of backseat gaming, which resulted in my banishment from the room while he played his games for a month. And every time it was my bed time, he would not shut up until I was upstairs.

He tried to connect with me while we were in college. He went to a school about an hour away from mine, he was a senior while I was a freshman and had one car between us which we would both go home together. He even went as far as to throw me a birthday party, which I felt totally awkward at, I had no friends there.

So, am I just being paranoid and rude out of silly reasons? Or is this a legit problem and she needs to be forcefully kicked out of this family? My brother knows how I feel about her and my mother is trying to be supportive, but in her heart she knows Yolanda is no good for my brother but can't bring herself to say it outright. My dad also, but much less involved. I dunno how my sister feels about her. 

We're hoping Shawn will see Yolanda for what she really is - a leech - and dump her before they get married next year. But I dunno when that will happen. 

So advice? Your thoughts? Tips on how to deal with this is appreciated.

**TL; DR;** My brother's marrying a chick who has lied her way into our family, but the family is against the marriage 100% and waiting for the relationship to fall apart before it happens. She's avoiding talking about her past and not fixing the problems she's made and just wants to move on. 

Raise an objection or just let my brother be with this chick?"
1wkz0t,3,2014-01-30,Need advice: I have social anxiety/depression and I am having trouble graduating.,TrinnyXXX,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1wkz0t/need_advice_i_have_social_anxietydepression_and_i/,"Hi I'm a 23 year old university student with social anxiety and depression. I am studying in a computer related degree and have been able to achieve high marks during the past few years. I have one more course to complete until I can graduate but the main problem is that I also have to find an internship as it is a requirement of the degree. 

However, due to my anxiety issues I have left finding an internship till late in my degree. I have low self esteem, have no experiences outside of university to offer and I keep thinking I will not be able to pass the interview. I've had one serious attempt at one placement (passed the first few phases) but failed the interview. Now I am stuck in a bad situation because I'm starting to lose interest in computing and that makes finding an internship so much harder.. I am also depressed, socially anxious and am pretty much socially isolated (I live with my parents and have no friends).

Could anyone please give me advice on what I should do? Thank you."
1wlnvv,6,2014-01-30,Deep Explanation of my first trip from a few weeks ago (sorry for the length),OurAss,LSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/1wlnvv/deep_explanation_of_my_first_trip_from_a_few/,"Now, I see a lot of ""going to be me first time[...]tips?"" posts, and not to be a hypocrite, but I posted one myself not too long ago, and on that evening then, I did drop...but I never responded as to how my trip went in detail, so here it goes.

I am a 17 year old male from Montreal, and some of you who know where that is, it's fucking cold in January, if you don't, read. I was planning on dropping from the moment I saw my role models Matt Stone and Trey Parker story about the Oscars. So the next few months, I did some research, watched some documentaries, and was set to do it, until i bought it. The baggie that it was in had a bunch of pineapples on it which was kind of gimmicky, but none the less, I started to regret it... I got scared. The plan was to do it in my room all alone at night, with the company of my buddy on skype. As soon as i got home, I remember staring at it, not knowing what to do, I looked back at my post, read the comments thoroughly and came upon a quote someone left. ""you realize that Shakespeare’s idea that “All the world’s a stage” was excitingly true"" and ""it's not the trip you want, but the one you need"". Now I am not saying I am going through some tough shit, cause I am not, in fact, my life is pretty chill. So, on to the DROP.

It was about 8:30 pm and I decided it was the right time to do it, so as told and directed by a buddy (shout out to Dirtyhary) he told me exactly how to do it, put it under my tongue for 30 minutes then swallow, I did as told. 30 minutes go by and nothing, I was mad, felt like I got jipped, until, my buddy called me on skype. We started talking and I started to feel mush, calm and at peace with myself. I sometimes do meditation and it felt exactly like it. One of the comments I saw was to listen to music, so I put Discovery from Daft Punk, and at that moment, I felt something wierd, like as if the music was connecting straight at me. to clarify things, I wasn't high yet, my vision was a-okay and I was able to communicate freely. Until my buddy asked to play guitar for me, so I let him. This was when it kicked in, It was approximately 10:32, and I'll always remember it. I looked at a picture in my room, http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/21/article-2206050-0059AA091000044C-332_964x756.jpg , to be exact, and i noticed it waving, like in those cheap youtube videos that say ""stare at the dot for 1 minute and look around"" that was exactly when it hit me, I was high. My buddies guitar rift started to freak me the fuck out so i told him to stop, then I got off skype. I went onto Tripsit, which could of been the biggest mistake of my life, thinking I'm going to find people that are tripping on acid like me, nonono, these are people on all kinds of different drugs, popping ideas into my head, which were interesting. I came up with this one idea that the Catholic Church (i'm atheist btw) was a organization that was created for money, and due to the high demand of believers they had to go with it, lol. I listenned to 3 albums constantly, Oracular Spectacular, Discovery and Random Access Memories, it did not disappoint. From then on I will go in little detail of some high points of my trip, cause this is long enough.

-I have 2 cats, and I felt like I was able to communicate with them. I was talking to them, but by the movements they were doing, I kind of depicted as to what they were going to do next, and vice-versa odly. 
-I played League of Legends, this was dumb, but fun. With the music in the background, each game felt like a new story, and a new inner discovery of myself.


-I got this DEEP...DEEP hate for shopping. the fact that people pay for shit that they might not need or want, and going from store to store, wasting hours of precious time living, was just very discouraging.
-I played minecraft, for like 5 minutes, I just created this odd goldesque structure.
-I masturbated twice, oddly enough, the acting made more sense than T.V. acting.
-I watched a movie called the Internship, it made absolutely no sense and was not funny at all so I stopped. 
-I watched some youtube videos (queen live aid, Let's Play, RoosterTeeth)

Pretty much it...I wish it was summer, so I would of been able to go out. But either way, it was one hell of an experience. If you spend all this time reading, thank you, I understand reading long posts can be quite the bitch, but I just wanted to share it. Feel free to ask any questions.

I forgot include this, but I think it's important.
I DID NOT HALLUCINATE* I learned that many types of LSD aren't, instead, its more of a spiritual trip that cannot really be explained in a few sentences. "
1wlqp5,5,2014-01-30,[28M] Feeling really discouraged...,throw5891,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1wlqp5/28m_feeling_really_discouraged/,"I don't really know where to start. I'm trying to fix my life - I'm really trying. In the last year or so (eh, 15 months), I've lost 50 pounds, quit a job I hated, started graduate school, started going out socially for the first time, and started trying to learn how to date/maybe even get a girlfriend for my first time - hell, maybe kiss or have sex, even!

But none of it's been enough.

I still am overweight (5'8"", ~160lb) and hate my body, despite people in /r/amiugly telling me that my looks aren't a problem. The weight loss was pure calorie cutting and I just fail every time I try to start an exercise routine or stricter diet - and each time I fail, I feel worse about myself. I'm terrified to apply for internships because I barely know what I want to do and don't think I'm good enough for anybody to hire. I'm making great grades in my graduate problem (hooray, I guess) but freak out when I think about the cost and whether or not this was/is the ""right"" program for me (MBA with a focus in digital media). I never get personally invited to hang out with classmates that I consider my friends - all my social outings are group invites and even though people seem to like it that I attend, I don't understand why they don't want to do anything else with me. It really hurts me, but I don't want to invite myself to private events or seem like I'm being clingy, so I just don't say anything.

Zero luck with the dating, too. I'm trying online since I don't know how else to meet people, though I was hoping that becoming friends with my classmates would lead to me meeting somebody - which isn't working out for the reasons I explained above. Anyway, despite having messaged dozens and dozens of women, have only gotten a few replies back - and even they stop replying after a while, and I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. The few small victories I've had (kiss on the cheek from a cute drunk girl when posing for a picture) have been immediately undermined by people telling me that it was only because they were drunk - which is true, obviously, but still, I kind of wanted to pretend that someone I found attractive was actually maybe, possibly, just a tiny bit interested in me for once. :(

I dunno. I find it somewhat hilarious that I've tried using this account to encourage people in /r/foreveralone when really it's me that needs most of the help. I posted this in /r/offmychest a little while ago but didn't get any responses and, I dunno, I guess I'm hoping someone might have some magical words of encouragement to keep me going. It feels wrong to admit this, but I've had suicidal thoughts for probably a decade now and even though I don't feel I'm in any imminent risk of following through, it does get exhausting being stuck with a voice in my head telling me to harm myself, that I'm worthless, that things won't get better - because the older I get, the more validity the voice is getting as things remain the same. :("

What did you do to change that?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1wlxyv/does_anyone_else_feel_like_they_are_an_unlikable/,"I feel like I am just an unlikable person.  I think that part of this issue is that I have what's been called [chronic bitchface](http://www.buzzfeed.com/donnad/living-with-chronic-bitchface).  I don't typically display emotion on my face naturally, and when I don't have an expression it looks like I am angry.  I really have to work to show emotion, and as an introvert it can be exhausting for me.

In college I had an internship at a consulting company.  When I wasn't hired on full time I was told that I did my work very well, but I didn't take criticism well.  After talking to my manager for a long time, it came out that I just didn't have a great rapport with the other workers, and they were concerned it would translate to clients.  I always got great reviews on my work, so I know that wasn't the real cause.

I just started working at a new job a few months ago and there were many other young people hired around the same time.  I hear them making plans to go out without me and I am concerned that I am going to repeat history.  I want to change the way other people perceive me, but I just don't know what to do.

I've created one using Revit, but I'm sure there are better options that are easier to use for topography sake and detail.

Well I'll be 20 weeks on the training day and I said I totally wanted in!

So the tech in charge called me and got it all set up, I get to spend a Saturday morning looking at ultrasounds of my baby, and she said if we hadn't found out the sex by then they could tell me, and they're going to give me a bunch of pictures and a disc of videos :) All it costs me is my time.

1wm83q,2,2014-01-30,Leg Lengthening.,[deleted],short,https://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1wm83q/leg_lengthening/,"Well, I never thought I'd be making a thread like this. I'm almost 21 and I'm only 5'8"". To salt the wound even further, my brother is 6'2"". 

I honestly never cared about this before until I stumbled across pages about height on the internet, which kind of kick started this unhealthy obsession. I'd like to have my legs lengthened two inches, leaving me at the average height for guys my age. Obviously this isn't happening ANY time soon (I'm talking years down the road) as I'm just a kid and am not financially stable, however, I'm seriously thinking about doing it when I'm older. 

Taller people are more respected and are perceived as far more professional and competent. I'm currently studying for a degree while doing an internship and have noticed height is a huge factor in the work force. Taller guys are more ""alpha"", and height seems to be the most respected/important masculine trait. Having to literally look up to people to make eye contact is such a fucking emasculating and submissive feeling and I feel like a child. 

The vast majority of women simply aren't attracted to shorter men. ""But it's just a preference!"", yeah, in the same way choosing between cordial and cognac is also ""just a preference"", but let's face it; nobody in their right mind is going to choose the fucking cordial. Around half of women in heels are taller than me, and dating short women isn't a feasible option either, as (for some mind boggling reason) they're even MORE demanding that the guy has to be tall. 

What the fuck do I do? I can't win. If I work out build muscle, then I'll be ""overcompensating"" and if I act confident and assertive then I ""suffer from napolean complex"". Height discrimination simply isn't frowned upon. What's the fucking point? I even if I do run with it, eat healthy, exercise and all that shit, at the end of the day I'll always be the height of a fucking 16 year old. 

I've recently been on the make me taller forums and have been extensively reading up on the risks and possible complications of such a serious procedure. What do you all think?

Relationship story in the text...,tokeephimornot,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1wmgs5/i_love_my_boyfriend_and_i_am_about_to_graduate/,"I have been with my boyfriend just shy of 9 months now. We met at work. He is 31 I am 25. We work together. We see each other outside of work about 1 night a week. I am going on about 2 weeks now without hanging out with him. 

So I told him I loved him about 2 months ago. He hasn't said it back (which is fine we are still only about 9 months in). I am graduating college in May and I have the opportunity to go and move closer to family and my best friend. But I am debating finding a job out here where he is because I love him and want to be with him. I just landed the best internship and so now I will be working full time with a 25 hour a week internship on top of 17 credits with school. So I really don't have any time to do anything. We scheduled a date for Sunday, but he was invited to a superbowl party, which is totally fine with me. He never goes out and I want him to go out and have friends. But that night is really the only time I have to spend with him. I don't want him to think that I am not making time for him or that I don't want to see him. We live a town apart and he won't stay at my house so I always go to his house and it gets expensive driving everywhere especially since I have my internship now. 

Here is where I am having my problem. I just logged into my facebook and he has some old pictures from him and his ex that have made an appearance. I decided to click on her profile (I know dumb idea) and she has posted a status that she feels homesick and is feeling nostalgic about her past. He went and liked it. He told me that they were over and at the beginning of our relationship he didn't talk to her, and then after 6 months he says he talks to her occasionally and now this has popped up. He must feel some sort of nostalgia if he liked her status. I am not sure what to think. I love this guy and I have been cheated on before and I just feel like it will happen again. Or the day is coming that he wants to get back with her. I know I am busy and don't have a lot of time, but the time I make seems to go wasted and the fact that he has not said anything about how he feels about me scares me a little bit. I am feeling vulnerable. With that being said please don't be too harsh with the comments. 

I have to make a decision after I graduate to stay in the state I am in and try to make things work with him or I can move back to my home state where the pay is higher and where I will be closer to my family and friends. Has anyone had to make that kind of decision before? Or something similar? How do I have this conversation with him? I am trying to let the facebook thing blow over because I do want to have ""the talk"" with him (about where he see's our relationship going). I am just not sure I know what questions to ask or how to ask them. Some advice would be nice. "

I've been in a relationship before, had a FWB of sorts, but have never gotten a BJ before. Is that hard to believe? I think so, but maybe it isn't that unheard of. But regardless here's some background.


I was in a relationship with a wonderful young lady. We had meet through a friend of a friend. We hit it off automatically, so much in fact, we dared to do a long distance relationship. And it was one of the best experiences I've ever had. We were each others many firsts, including first love and first sexual experience. But the sex-stuff was very slow progress. She pretty much had no knowledge of anything past making out (I had studied and watched up in my formative years) so it just started with me fingering her. She couldn't reciprocate because she had a semi-traumatic experience when she was younger so she thought penises gross and ugly (she wasn't a lesbian, trust me) we worked on that and eventually got over that hurdle. But the HJ's were naturally terrible. But hey, I was young and in love, and just happy to be be naked with a chick and playing her boobs. It's pretty awesome.


Skip some time and she's ready for sex. Great! So we go for it but the first couple times were weird. I couldn't fit in all the way, and when I came close to, couldn't really stay in for that long on account of it hurting her too much. I search up her symptoms and find out she has vaginusmus... So that ruled sex out of the question. But she finally warmed up to the idea of me going down on her so that happened. Many times. And during this period is where I got my minor in cunnilingus ladies and gents. I don't mean to brag but I got pretty good at it, partly done out of love, out of being a horny 19/20 year old, and also to keep our bedroom excitement from ending up on the same level as game of checkers. Not to downplay the possible excitement out of a stimulating round of checkers that is.


And me thinking we'll last forever (again, young and in love), it would only be a matter of time till everything fell into place considering how far we've come. Plus she was warming up to the ideas of BJ's and was thinking of doing one soon, so all seemed it would turn out all right...


But as long distance college relationships go, they become too much to handle and we ended up breaking up much faster than it progressed. Our stars hadn't aligned. So no BJ.


So I do my own thing for awhile, not wanting anything to do with relationships being all jaded and stuff. After that period, we start getting closer, hitting it off more and more. But still taking it slowish being friends first and not wanting to mess that up. But we eventually do the no-pants dance closer to the end of the semester. And me being a gentleman (or at least try to be) do my duty and go down, knowing it would've been reciprocated at a later liaison (we had talked about it). But it happened at an awkward time since I went to study abroad shortly after for the summer. And agreed to drop it when I returned considering the old adage of ""don't shit where you eat"" started to show its very inconvenient head. So no BJ again.


And this is where I come to RAOBJ and the cool, confident, calm and collected ladies of NYC. I don't have as much time as I would like to the whole song and dance dating scene. I'm graduating soon, so I'm taking the last of my advanced classes including doing overtime on my internship to hopefully get some good job prospects when I do graduate. So I barely have time for myself, let alone to date. This isn't some pity PSA, I sleep just fine at night, trust me. (thinking of that other pity thread with all the loans and sob stories and what not)


So if any of you are interested in aiding me in receiving this elusive act that has eluded me just so, PM me! We could hang, get tea, or coffee, get to know one another, see what comes, and if nothing, a cool new friend :)


**TL:DR - Never got BJ, although have come very close multiple times, busy with school and work so don't have time to date, if you're interested in hanging out with a gentleman, message me.**"

This will be my second MBP (my last I got in 2007 and was stolen in 2010) I'm thinking of getting a 13'' retina display unless you nice folks convince me to get the 15''

Some questions I have are:


- Can I write it off on my taxes if It's for school/work?
- Any special deals for students or time of year?
- Any software that you'd suggest is a must buy?
- Should I buy it online or in a store? I need it pretty quickly
- What else might be good to know!?


Thanks!! :D

I'm also working full-time, Mon-Fri, 9-5 in the Fire/EMS scene.  I know it seems like a weird combo, but I'm planning to merge the public safety with the IT in a law enforcement role somewhere down the line.

Anyway, all of my research into the InfoSec world has shown me that the best way to break into the scene is to do an internship during your studies.  Unfortunately, most companies operate during the same hours that I work, making my situation a rather difficult one.

I've done some freelance web design in the past with some friends on some quick projects and I'm seriously considering sacrificing what little free time I have left in order to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript effectively enough to leave my day job and start sustaining myself with a more flexible schedule.

For those of you who are self-employed, what were your big sticking points while starting out?  How long did it take you to start sustaining yourself?  What tips can you offer in order to discover clients and encourage repeat business?"
1wo22o,12,2014-01-31,I've been accidentally been claiming 3 personal allowances (instead of 2) on my W-4 since I started my job. I owe about $1200 this year. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.,xander-7-89,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1wo22o/ive_been_accidentally_been_claiming_3_personal/,"Long story short, I started my job in May of 2012, filled out my W4 how I thought it needed to be filled out and that was that.

I ended up owing about $400 in taxes last year, but I figured that it was because I had been a paid intern for 5 months at a company where my check was untaxed.

I got my W2 this year and started doing my taxes on TurboTax and it estimated so far that I'm going to owe about $1200 in tax. Having no clue why this was, I had a feeling it was simply that I wasn't having enough tax taken out of my check at work. I talked to our HR lady, told her the story and asked to see my W4 that I filled out when I started. Turns out that I had been claiming ""head of household"" for a total of 3 personal allowances when really I should only have had 2—I'm single, unmarried with no dependents.

$1200 is a lot to pay right now in taxes, and I'm claiming as many deductions as I can think of, including student loan interest paid, making sure I count the roughly $300 worth of clothes I donated last year, etc. But is there anything else I could do or deduct to reduce the amount of tax I owe for last year?

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Please let me know if I could include any other information that is pertinent to the situation.

Thank you, PF!"
1wo2yx,5,2014-01-31,"I'm a selfish, narcissistic, attention-seeking, anxious mess of a man.",MingeTeasingBastard,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1wo2yx/im_a_selfish_narcissistic_attentionseeking/,"I've been pacing back and forth my room all day, alone, talking to myself. Being honest with myself. This is what I've uncovered.

I'm a massive narcissist, and that isn't an exaggeration. I believe I'm destined for something great. I think like I'm the protagonist in the movie which is my life. I'm figuring things will end up like in a movie, where at the start I'm the weird, outcast kid (who is secretly a genius, a prodigy) who is rejected and bullied by everyone. But then I grow up and I rise above it all, become famous, successful and confident and all those people that made fun of me will feel the same inadequacy as I did.

But of course, I'm not a protagonist. I'm actually a horrible person. I don't work for anything. I'm constantly judging people, demeaning people in my head, finding reasons why I'm better than them. 

Oh, and I bullied people and made them cry in school. Yeah. Because it made me feel big and strong. Because I liked not feeling like the shittest person there for once. 

I hate being alone. The sole reason being, nobody can see me if I'm alone. Nobody can pay attention to me. I'm not being guided anywhere. I've got no reason to do anything. I only do things to impress people, to look good. I'm obsessed with my self image. I just want people to like me and think I'm cool.

But they don't. And I'm not becoming this great fantastic person I want to be. So instead I just daydream that I am. I stick my headphones in and I mime in front of the mirror for hours on end, pretending that I'm a rockstar. And I'm at a house party, and I'm playing in my band and I'm the front man. And all my old school mates are there, the ones I used to feel so inadequate next to. And there is my ex. And I'm fucking rocking it. I've not go acne anymore. My dress sense is awesome. I've got a great body. And I'm confident and I'm fucking rocking and everyone is thinking how great I am now. Obviously none of this is happening. I'm just fantasising. But it makes me feel good. I feel happy being there. Too bad whenever I leave the house I can't even open up my mouth because I'm so socially anxious and afraid of everyone. 

I want constant attention. I used to fantasise about getting a disease like cancer so that people would come and visit me and all want to see me. Or I'd fantasise that I'd died and imagine all the things people would say, and how they'd make a Facebook group about me and say all these wonderful things. But that's not even the worst... Because I used to fantasise about someone in my family dying. Just so that people would pay me attention. Yeah, I actually used to daydream about someone I supposedly love DYING just so that people pay attention to me. I know that's wrong...but I don't feel that its wrong. But I know it makes me a pathetic excuse for a human being.

I've stayed in my apartment for the past few days. I've been oversleeping, getting up, watching TV, listening to music. All because I'm afraid of doing anything else. Its a distraction. I could be doing something for me, for my future, but I don't have the heart. Because I can't stand being alone. I don't do things for myself. I only ever do things because I think it makes me look cool, and I want people to like me. I want to impress people. I hate being alone, and watching tv makes me feel like I'm not so alone.

I'm fucked up. I'm an anxious mess. And I'm on a study placement in a foreign country. I don't do much. I don't study. I don't really see anyone. The sad thing is, when I first applied to do this, I fantasised about how good it would be. I'd find a nice foreign girlfriend, lots of friends, partying all the time. And the best thing about it? I'd be able to put it on Facebook for all my friends to see and be impressed at.

I want to be at home so I can get therapy. I need therapy. I can't go on like this. I'm not happy. 

But I've applied for an internship in a bigger city. I'm excited for it. Because I'm fantasising about me doing well. Getting along fine. And if I get accepted I'll be able to post about it on Facebook and seem all impressive. 

I feel fucking shit. I can't get out of my head. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Will I be like this forever? Seriously, I am a massive attention seeker. I hate to admit it. I've never admitted it before, but its true. I need people's approval. I need to be validated. I want to impress you. I want you to like me. I want you to notice me. I want to be wanted. 

I am pathetic. I'm a twenty year old man. "
1woa7c,5,2014-01-31,[CA] New to managing my money and not sure where or how to start,NickelBomber,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1woa7c/ca_new_to_managing_my_money_and_not_sure_where_or/,"I recently got a job and a regular paycheck and I’m interested in planning and tracking my money but I have never had a source of income before and I didn’t really spend much money so I’m not sure where to start or how to start. I am 19 years old, live with my parents, and I’m attending Algonquin College in Ottawa to become a Computer Programmer. Since I never have had a job before I figured it would be a good idea to take the opportunity of a co-operative education placement (paid internship) with the Canadian government to make for a better resume when I graduate and look for a job. 



At the moment the Canadian government pays $14.38/hr for co-op students and after taxes I earn roughly $950 CAD biweekly. I estimate that the final sum of money I will be taking home for my 8 month placement is approximately $13k to $15k. Since I started getting paid I am now also responsible for paying my bills and transportation costs every month. Here is a rough break down of known expected costs:



* $14/mo - Transportation 
* $35/mo - Cell Phone
* $50/mo - Food 
* $45/mo - Clothes 
* $80/mo - Social Activities 
* $2000 - 1 Semester of Tuition  
* ~$1000 -New PC Parts 


Together these add up to a known total cost of approximately $340 every month. I only pay for the occasional lunch as my family makes dinner every night which I don’t have to help pay for, if you were wondering why the food bill is so low. I will have to keep paying these bills when I go back to college for my last semester starting in September to December, and hopefully I will have a job within a month or two after I graduate.
 	


I’m not sure what goals I have or should set for myself, but I do know that I want at least $2000 on hand until I get a new job in case of an emergency (cat gets sick, I get sick, lightning destroys my pc, etc…). I also am planning to try and move out of the house approximately 6 months after landing a new job, which I suspect will probably cost quite a bit of cash to get everything needed. I also have no idea at all how taxes work, and would like to try to file taxes this year which I think is coming up soon?


Knowing all of this, what do you guys recommend I do next?

1woh4m,3,2014-01-31,Is it normal to continue having mild pains after most of the air is removed?,henbruas,pneumothorax,https://www.reddit.com/r/pneumothorax/comments/1woh4m/is_it_normal_to_continue_having_mild_pains_after/,"First I would just say that it's very nice to have a subreddit dedicated to this problem. It hasn't exactly blown up, but it's here as a resource for people who suffer from this, and that's all that matters. Now, to my story and question (sorry if it's kinda lengthy, you can skip to the end for the question if you want):

Background info: I'm a slim 20 year old male, surprisingly pretty short (almost feel cheated getting this when I'm just 174 cm)

Last Sunday I suddenly started having pains in my right chest and a particularly sharp pain when breathing. They increased in intensity for maybe an hour and then slowly started subsiding. At that point I thought maybe it was some kind of muscle cramp and didn't go to the doctor. The next day while out walking I discovered that the pains would return if I did any kind of strenuous physical activity, like walk up a hill. Later when going to bed I discovered that laying on my right side would cause pain and trouble breathing. At this point you might be thinking that I'm an idiot to not go to the doctor. You're probably correct. I'm just the kind of person who tends to wait pains and illnesses out to see if they get better. 

Anyway, the next day I tried going to school. I got around 200 meters from my house before the chest pains were so great I had to turn around. My mom decided that that's it and basically told me that I was going to the doctor no matter what. So we called and got an appointment with my GP a couple of hours later (apparently they take chest pains serious, who would have figured). 

Now, my GP definitely seemed to expect this to be some kind of muscle issue and didn't seem very worried at first. But that changed when took out her stethoscope and listened to my breathing. She discovered that the respiration sounds on the right sides were significantly different from what they should be. She then told me that she didn't know what was causing this, but that I needed to get it checked out in a hospital ASAP. She suspected a pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax among other things. 

So I get to the ER, talk to the doctors, they ask me a bunch of questions and do tests, yadda yadda you know the drill. Their suspicion of pneumothorax increases for every doctor that listens to my respiration and they hurriedly send me to get an X-ray. This immediately confirms their suspicion. I have a large amount of 
in the pleural cavity and a partial lung collapse (unfortunately I don't know how large the collapse was, I never asked). 

Now this air had to be removed of course, but the hospital I'm on didn't have a doctor specializing in lungs on duty. They decide to get an ambulance and ship me to another hospital that does. Fortunately this hospital is only a very short ride away, the perks of living in a relatively large city. I'm received at the ER there and pretty quickly I'm surrounded by the lung specialist and a bunch of interns discussing how they should proceed. They decide that since it's been 3 days and the x-rays didn't show anything the hole probably sealed itself up by now. Therefor there isn't a need to put in a chest drain, instead they would do a procedure that I'm not exactly sure what's called in English, aspiration or exsufflation maybe? The gist of it is to use a syringe filled with local anesthetics to slowly penetrate the chest, injecting the anesthetics as you go. When you penetrate the chest wall you pull out the syringe, enter a small tube connected to a syringe with a valve and then use this to pull the air out. When you're done they remove everything and there's just a small hole left. It's quick and painless and apparently very preferable to having a chest tube installed, because that seems to be a giant pain in the ass. 

Anyway, they removed 1200 mL of air and sent me off to get a new X-ray. This showed that they got out almost all of the air. There was about 2 cm of air left in the top (not sure what that translates to in volume). They kept me overnight on observation just in case and put me on 3 L/min of oxygen. (Random rant: Oxygen is terribly annoying, it dries out your nose and mouth completely. Also venous catheters fucking suck. Except for that being in the hospital wasn't too bad). The next day they did another x-ray that showed the same as the one the night before, which confirmed that the hole was indeed sealed. After this they sent me home. I have a new appointment in about 10 days where they are going to do a new x-ray, presumably to check out if the air that was left is gone?

Anyway, to the original point of the post! I've been getting some mild chest pains when out walking the past two days. My question is basically just if this is normal. I'm thinking that this could be caused by the air that is left in the pleural cavity and should go away as my body absorbs that air. Maybe some of the pain is caused by the hole through the chest from the procedure as well. Does anyone know if these assumptions are correct and/or has experienced the same thing?

Thanks for any answers, especially if you had the patience to read it all! 

(Please be aware that English isn't my first language, so if anything seems a bit weird about the writing style or grammar that's probably why.)

Edit: I forgot to mention that this was a spontaneous primary pneumothorax, ie. with no underlying cause."
