dzek4,4,2010-11-01,"Reddit, I've fluctuated with my weight and eating habits all my life. Can you help?",tazzgonzo,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dzek4/reddit_ive_fluctuated_with_my_weight_and_eating/,"First of all, hi! I’ve read up on the FAQ so I think I’m ready to post here for the first time.

I’m currently a 26 yr old male, 6’1”, and weigh about 235 lbs. 

Growing up, I was always on the bigger side of things. My parents basically let us eat whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted. When I was 17, I was 6’1” and weighed 255 lbs. But because of the clothes I wore and my general body frame, it never looked like I was that big. 

The year before I went to college, I decided to do something about it. My parents had bought a treadmill so I ran an hour per day (burning through complete seasons of Buffy and Angel) for about 6 months. I ate less and was able to bring my weight all the way down to about 180. 

I entered my freshman year of college at a healthy weight with semi-healthy eating habits. However, that’s when I started binge eating. I didn’t make many friends my freshman year so I stayed a lot in my dorm room playing video games and studying. I joined the campus gym, but was never really consistent about it. I always had a “new” workout to try out, which I’d quickly get bored of. Whenever I felt sad or just bored, I’d binge on fast food or whatever was available. I’d feel guilty about it the next stay, but then I’d just binge again. 

I guess my mental state was “f*ck it, I already lost, I’ll start fresh next Sunday” but we all know how that goes. I was either on full on eating like crap mode or hardly eating/ exercising a ton mode. 

This, obviously, caused my weight to fluctuate all throughout my freshman year. 

Ever since then I’ve been stuck in this all or nothing approach to healthy eating and exercising. Most recently, last year, I joined a Gold’s Gym near my work and ended up paying a personal trainer (it was the only way I remained consistent…knowing that I PAID for someone to hold me accountable) for 3x a week gym sessions. I lost a good amount of weight and looked and felt better for about 5 months. 

I had to stop the personal training due to, well, it being expensive, so I cut down to once a week sessions, which failed miserably. 

Around this time, I started to make a lot of unhealthy eating choices. I always put off exercising and eating right to “next week” or “next month” and gained back the weight I had lost and then some. 

Back in June of this year, I got fed up with being so unhealthy (this is a re-occurring theme, btw) and joined an all Paleo, all Crossfit gym. I thought that I had found a perfect fit for diet and exercise. I kept up with them for about 3 months. 

My job currently has me traveling a lot (you can see where this is going) so I would be out of the gym for maybe a week or two before I went back. During these trips, I would somehow justify that eating unhealthy was fine because I would make up for it when I got back. I even packed gym clothes that went ignored. 

When I got back to the gym after these trips, I’d feel ashamed and didn’t want to return the next session because I felt that everyone was judging me, or that my performance had slipped. I stopped going because I, for some reason, thought that I needed to eat healthy and get back into my normal habit before I went back to the gym. This didn’t happen, and I kept making unhealthy choices. 

During this time, my significant other’s sister had just returned after a summer internship in New York (she lives with us). When she returned, she was almost unrecognizable as she had dropped from 250 lbs to 195 within 10 weeks. She had taken up running every day (1 hr) in the streets of New York and stopped eating so much food. 

Inspired by this, I took to running the streets of San Francisco on a daily basis. I started on September 19th and ran almost every day until October 16th. During that period, I ran a total of 96 miles and lost some weight. I also threw in 100 daily crunches and a minimum of 20 push ups. I canceled the Crossfit gym membership, because I wanted to lose weight before going back. I realize that's a stupid excuse, but I'm incredibly self-conscious about how I look in a group fitness setting. 

Even with a week business trip, I managed to keep up the workouts (though I did slip on the healthy eating). 

Now I did mention the cyclical nature of my eating/working out and this is where I’m currently at. My brother and his family recently flew down to visit for two weeks. They stayed at my parents’s house in San Jose (I live and work near San Francisco). Almost every day and every weekend I spent going to go visit them and driving back to San Francisco to spend the night. 

In my head I thought, “ah well, their visiting, so I’m going to give up my workouts and eating healthy and make up for them when they leave”. So during those two weeks I ate. I ate a lot. I think I’ve gained all the weight I lost from running already.

Today I said goodbye to them (they leave tomorrow). Know what I did to celebrate this? Ate tons of Halloween candy because “tomorrow I’ll start the running and eating healthy again.”

Here’s where I come to all of you. 

When I get back “on the wagon” tomorrow, I want to be able to make it a permanent thing. I’ve never had a healthy relationship with food and dieting for a period of time longer than 6 months. I don’t want to stumble and fall into this cycle again, and I definitely don’t want to weigh 235 lbs. 

Any advice or tips? 
Also, should I focus on running, as I have been, and lose all the weight first and then look at getting back into crossfit?

Sorry for the length, but I just wanted to paint a better picture of my situation. Thanks in advance.

**TL; DR version:** I’ve fluctuated a lot in weight/eating habits throughout my entire life. I want to make a permanent healthy lifestyle choice. What is your advice?

e1e9q,10,2010-11-04,Hey Frugal - Will closing a credit card account hurt my credit?,hawt,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/e1e9q/hey_frugal_will_closing_a_credit_card_account/,"Hey Frugal!

I'm 23 and I just graduated college last May. 

My spending got a little out of control when I was working a full-time unpaid internship my last year of college, and I currently have $2000 in CC debt (Card Limit is $5000). 

I figure Frugal knows best when it comes to paying off debt and living a simpler, more frugal lifestyle so I come to you for advice.

However, I recently started a full time job and should have that debt paid off in about three months.

I checked my credit report today because I want to buy a new car after the holidays, and I wanted to make sure everything was in order.

I noticed that I had an old Discover Card account open that was completely paid off. I thought that I closed it after I paid it off, but I guess I forgot.

I called today to cancel it and Discover told me that doing so could hurt my credit (since it had been open for about a year and 3 months with no balance).

I decided to hold off on closing it until I found out for sure. 

For the sake of simplicity, I'd like to only have one credit card, but not at the expense of a huge hit (Discover said ""like 50 points"") to my credit.

I don't mind if my score drops a bit because my score is already in the mid-700 range, and I figure it will go up a bit once I pay the $2000 off my main card.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I'd appreciate some advice.

Edit: Thanks for the advice guys, I plan on have all of my debt paid off by the time I start looking for a car loan, so I am just going to close it since my debt-to-credit ratio would be 0% anyways"

Not that those particularities materially change the discussion.

So here's my story in a nutshell.

I fell hard for a girl in high school. While it took a long time for our feelings to synchronize, reminiscing about how it finally happened instantly brings a smile to my face. We got together senior year, and had a summer where I was convinced that the universe was composed of nothing more than warm smiles, fluttery embraces, and love. I wish such an experience on everyone.

Though we were accepted into the same universities, over several teary-eyed sessions, we responsibly chose to go to the ones we believed suited us best despite their geographic separation. That was smart of us. We also responsibly chose to take a break our first semester to not miss the college experience. That was mature of us. As evidence of our feelings, we got back together immediately afterwards.

Unfortunately, between our junior and senior year, the relationship began showing signs of the damage long-term long-distance can do. We both had academics as a top priority, and little money to spend on flights, so we were separated even during summers as we pursued internships and research positions elsewhere. Our relationship was constrained to the phone, a medium I've never liked, but did because it meant I could talk to her. It became clear that we were drifting apart. Our hearts spoke intimately, but our minds were drowning in the superficial, grasping for something new and concrete to relate by.

Nothing ever went to shit. We loved each other too much to do that. The stress of gradually losing someone I love, the resulting distraction from my workaholism, and most importantly, the impossibility of being geographically close in the future, rationally led me to suggest we take a break. Not long after, she told me we shouldn't get back together. It hurt. That marks the end of being an insider with her thoughts, but I do know from my end that the overriding feeling was futility.

We finished off our senior year, she went to a top graduate school in her field that’s even further away, and I have also done well for myself. We’ve spoken no more than the number of fingers and toes I have, which I don’t have too much trouble with; we’re both terrible at keeping up with people in general. Moreover, we’ve both been with others in long-term relationships since.

I’m writing you all to share and listen. What are your thoughts about feeling a deep connection to a love long lost? In hindsight, I haven’t been in love to the same degree as when I was with her. Are the thoughts that she’s a part of who I am forever, and probably the foremost expert on what makes me tick, out of line? The subsequent relationships I’ve had have had their strengths, but I haven’t felt that they holistically were as strong as my connection with her. For those that had amazing high school relationships, have you been able to get fully over them? I’m not looking for a cure, I’m quite comfortable the way things are, I just want to hear other experiences.

All in all, the process of writing and, therefore, confronting these thoughts has been unbelievably cathartic. If you’re a lurker who has itching thoughts, try writing a post—this is my first, and it surprised me."

Here's an excerpt; completely unedited.


Knock knock. 
“Who’s there?”
“Lance, uh, I’m an intern.”
“Lance who -- I mean. Come in.”

Lance enters the office, dressed internly, (white button-shirt, black tie, suit jacket that just looks off for no apparent reason, [way too khaki] slacks, [also, for no apparent reason]  and, of course, the kind of loafers that only twenty-somethings wear.)

“Hey, sir, I was just coming to uh, make sure I didn’t like…I mean, the coffee -- it’s your kind right, like, your favorite, kind?”

“Sure is. Thanks for the gesture.”

“Oh yeah, sure, no problem. Anything else I can (holy shit this kid is a kiss-ass. He’s going to be promoted) do for you? (in no time.)

“No, no, thanks, I’m good. But uh, what’s your last name again?”

“Tarkington.”

“…”

“…”

“Oh, okay. I’ll uh. I’ll remember that one.”

“Oh….Thanks! I should, uh, get…back to work….”

“Right right. Thanks for the coffee.”

Slam.
 (Well, it sounded like a slam, I mean, every door in this office sounds like it has been slammed [don’t know why, maybe because we’re 4 floors up,] when it’s closed, but, no way he actually meant to slam the door, right, [but wouldn’t less air pressure make the doors harder to close? No, wait, that doesn’t make any sense. Whatever.] of course, wouldn’t make sense. Surprised he hasn’t actually come back in, to apologize, for the [non] slamming, I --)

“Oh, sorry there Mr. Greenwood, (oh holy hell, this kid.) I just, didn’t mean to slam it, I mean.”

“You’re fine.”

“Oh, ohhkay.”

Slam.

I turn back to the window. The snow I browned/dirtied up with my tires this morning still sits, meltingly, outside the firm’s lot, outside the black iron gate, with the Volvos and Camaros, (and was it snowing that day, too? I don’t remember being cold, at all, I mean,) and Oldsmobiles and whatever else and whoever else and everything else and everyone else. Who cares. It’s outside the lot. Outside of the fence.
Inside the fence, the snow is unbelievably white. Not a single tire has besmirched the sugary purity that rests in the medians and front gardens. Not a single shoe or boot or intern’s loafer has dared make imprint mark 1. How nice.
This coffee is really doing the trick, I swear. (I do remember, though, specifically, something burningly white. Awfully. Could have been anything, anything would have been too bright, that day, with how hungover I was.) I boot up the computer, that sits, toweringly, black and ominous and classy and flat,  perched atop the faux/quasi wood desk, (but still, I think it really might have been snow, I remember I was actually in it, whatever it was,) with the keyboard oh-so stealthily and classily and modernly stashed beneath, in a lap drawer. (tossing in it, trying to figure out what the hell was going on, way too bright, even with my eyelids shut, achingly bright,) What’s on the agenda for today….Two new messages….(and someone was laughing, that I remember, that I know. I think. That I think.) Nothing major. I could probably leave, for today, and suffer no ill consequences. Maybe. Probably. Whatever. I don’t want to be home today, anyways. Outside the lot. 

(There was, most definitely, a Ronald McDonald blow up statue, waving, in the breeze, inviting me to stuff my organs with non-processed fat and whatnot, which, of course, I did, because there was/is nowhere else to eat, on the Interstate, and Jack, somehow, liked/[likes? I haven’t talked to Jack in ages,] Big Macs, so, there we were, under the waving Ronald, [didn’t I get a Christmas card from him once? Or something? Wedding invitation?] with myself practically being carried by Jack and Green, soldier-style, with one of my arm’s behind each of their necks,  [Of course he’s married {I was at his wedding, duh} but, to maybe his kid’s wedding? Why would that/{I even be invited} even happen?] being carried off the field of battle, but of course, they wouldn’t be my comrades,) Not with her, at home, with The Issue, The Elephant standing in our living room (literally.) (not if I had a choice, which I didn’t, I mean, I wouldn’t have even wanted to be a soldier -- but, extended metaphors aside,) Though she probably will have to forget about the whole ordeal by Christmas, which is how many days from now? I’ve forgotten, (I remember being deposited into an empty plasticized booth, while Jack and Green got Big Macs for the three of us, [where were Alexis and Sovereign? Wait, weren’t they at] which, I mean, again, no choice, but I probably would have eaten yellow snow at this point,)  and according to the calendar, it is exactly 17 days until Santy Klaus comes a’knockin and, [the McDonald’s? Oh, that’s right, Sovereign just had to try and slide down the big slide with a plastic tray, and Alexis was probably trying to subvert/egg on such efforts,] (so a greasy burger probably wasn’t such a stretch, thinking about it, even a Big Mac) hopefully, everyone will get what they want and shut up about it, but, honestly, I doubt that She will ever shut up about this Fagscot thing, which come on, honestly. (so I sat in the booth, faithfully awaiting the promised bounty of greasy nonmeat, [and then, yes, that had to be it, because then Alexis came in, covered in snow, half-laughing, half-worried, and Sovereign had a broken nose, but was almost laughing as well, because apparently it was just So Goddamn Funny.] (it’s not that big of a deal, honestly, he’ll grow up, he’ll be fine, if anything I feel sorry for the kid. Telling him he’s going to hell is probably not the best course of action, (as I remember Jack saying to Sovereign, but I was way too busy to give a shit, considering my level of hunger, and such. But then I realize; I‘m supposed to be somewhere.) Not to mention; I know for a fact she “experimented” with her roommate in college, and no, it’s clear, she does not just care about his mental/sexual/developmental health or whatever she says, it’s a personal projection issue, gotta be, ([ and before I could tell Jack and Co. that I had to be back at campus pronto, I have a final, a very important final, Alexis sits down, opposite me, and unwraps his Big Mac, calmly.]) because otherwise, if this issue were based around anything else, she would be all pity (for Him) and anger (for Everyone Else), so, she has to be afraid for him, afraid that he will end up like herself, ([ and I frenetically ask Where is Jack and Alexis just looks up at me, slowly, and says “He just left to take Sovereign to the Hospital, weren’t you listening?” And, clearly, “No I wasn’t, why didn’t we go too?” Which, why didn’t we? Can’t remember.) which, I don’t know, why would that be so bad, to her, unless she is hiding something I don’t know, from me, away, out. {Like what?} (But Alexis just stares at me, for a moment, before I blurt out, “Dude, I, I have to be back at campus ASAP, I’m supposed to be taking a final right now,” and shatter his look of pity/complacency and re-assemble it into one of empathy/panic, [that was actually pretty comical, in retrospect, like the way a sitcom actor’s face looks when something goes awfully wrong within the three walls] and I know, before he says it, that we have no car, and so, of course, as the legendary story goes, we end up calling a taxi, and pay the guy like 100$ to get to the university, and step on it, and so he does, and I make it back with 20 minutes to take a 60 minute final, and, of course, answer every question, and get an A-. [according to legend.]) She has to be legitimately bisexual.

Knock knock.

I realize I am sitting Indian style at my desk, and have spilled a little coffee onto my tie. I have no choice.

“Come in.”

Wendy opens the door, her black, slick, smooth hair obscuring her face, because, as I realize, her neck is craned down, and she’s staring at a stack of papers, and she talks into them, knowing I don’t care.
“Hey, did you get that memo, from Anderson?” She produces a white sheet from the top of the stack, without looking at it much. She holds it out for me. It’s a copy. (I don’t even have to ask/check.) She knows I don’t check the memos, but she wishes I did. (for some reason.) So she makes copies.

“Oh, no, must have missed it.”

“Oh, too bad. It’s semi-important.”

“Semi?”

“Yeah. Apparently we are having our first ever casual dress day.”

“Wow. That’s something.”

“It is. It’s on the day before Christmas Eve.”

“Oh. Makes sense. The interns will be overjoyed, I’m sure. (and I imagine Lance standing, coffeepot in hand, wearing an American Eagle t-shirt, with whiskered jeans and flip-flops,)

“So yeah. Just thought you might care.” (but of course that doesn’t make sense; it’s winter.) She lifts her head up, flashing a curt smile, politely ignoring the stain on my tie, not even glancing twice before stepping out of the office. I sip my coffee and slip off my tie.

He said that, while they get hundreds of phone calls a day with a clear message about the Bush tax cuts or food safety legislation, the TSA calls have an incoherent message.

So: We need to set up scripts to guarantee that the congresspeople (that is, their interns) are getting the most important pieces of the message, to ensure that all the congresscritters are getting called, and to make sure that Congress knows that a lot of people care about this issue and are, basically, a force to be reckoned with.

What is the quick soundbyte to give to the person on the phone? What you say beyond that doesn't really matter -- you just get one more checkbox for ""complained about TSA."" 

How about this? ""I'm calling to ask that Senator/Rep. (Name) stop the TSA from its invasive, ineffective and expensive practices, which force people to choose between being photographed naked and being groped by TSA agents."" After you say this (or whatever we come with), the intern will just say ""Thank you, I'll pass your message on to the congressman""

e9fgx,2,2010-11-21,We are really good at feeling powerless and frustrated. We should change this.,ationsong,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e9fgx/we_are_really_good_at_feeling_powerless_and/,"In my time browsing the more topical Reddits, I've seen a trend emerge. Redditors are really good at finding injustices, both glaring and obscure, and bringing attention to them. If you browse Reddit frequently, this can actually get rather depressing; In the past few months, we've learned that America's school teachers can't afford things like paper, soap, or even books for their classrooms. Just today we saw a video of a kid being strip searched at an airport. I don't care where you stand on any political spectrum—all citizens of this country can agree that things like this are simply unacceptable.


But Redditors do what they're good at—upvoting. Now don't get me wrong, Reddit can obviously do amazing things; as per above, just look for the section in future Reddit history books reading “Donor's Choice” or “Kathleen's Big Day”. The amazing thing about Reddit is that, when there's something that Redditors have the power to do, they usually do it.


Which brings me to these large, messy political issues that Redditors themselves don't really have any control over. Sure, occasionally an issue will get to the point that a submission such as “Angry about ___? Call your congressman” will boil up. But, having several friends who've interned for congressmen, calls and letters that they receive almost always get read or heard by an intern, never the representative.


Being an intelligent person, you've probably smelled where this post is going, and you're probably right. And you're also probably thinking about this: Around a year ago, a brave group of Redditors, partially in response to the Tea Party which was so vocal at the time, attempted to form a political party based on the views assumed to be held by most tech-savvy youth (end to corporate personhood, Public Option healthcare, etc.). Yes, they were the now infamous American Pirate Party, a concept that was so exciting when first hatched that it received over +4000 karma, and...now? The APP Reddit is averaging about a post a week at best, with only a handful of remaining survivors.


So, does it seem like a hopeless venture for me to propose another attempt to “galvanize” Redditors? Short answer: yes. Long answer: yesssssssssssssssss. (Paraphrased from Strong Bad). But I'm going to take my beliefs and throw them out there, anyway.

Why? Because I'm tired of feeling powerless (cliché alert). I'm tired of feeling like I have to choose between the lesser of two evils in politics. Quite frankly, I'm tired of how politics has become entirely about politicking.


I think (and hope) that these are feelings that a lot of Redditors share. And so, it must be asked, why did the American Pirate Party fail, if the desire for something like it was so great? Redditors were finally given an opportunity where they could have gotten a path to power. As crazy as the idea sounded, people were setting up websites, wikis, forums, and everything else you could imagine left and right. Where did all of that enthusiasm go?


One could say that whenever an exciting idea such as that is proposed, enthusiasm will peak briefly, and then slowly dip off to nothingness afterwards. But that's easily contradicted by the continued and even growing enthusiasm for the Rallies that we just experienced. I believe that this loss of enthusiasm for the APP was instead caused by two things: First, growth was made, but in the wrong dimension. Second, progress was made, but only linearly.


Of course, now I must explain what these arcane phrasings mean. In terms of growth, consider how the discussion regarding the Rally grew. First, it was simply an idea: wouldn't it be great if Stephen Colbert held a rally in Washington? Then its scope grew, and added a new dimension: How do we get his attention? And thus, a whole new crop of enthusiasm was born around Donors Choice. Then, as the Rally approached, more and more dimensions were added to it: We need to organize meet-ups! Now it's a game to find other Redditors! Check out this great sign I made! Etc. 


The American Pirate Party, on the other hand, started out with already a fairly confined proposal: Start a political party with some decided tenets. Then, instead of adding on new dimensions, I believe the focus on tightening and refining what already existed (deciding on more tenets, a constitution, and a million revotes on the name) stifled the enthusiasm, instead of finding more and more things to get excited about. Thus, the enthusiasm got caught in that one dimension, and slowly withered away. This also relates to the progress: Sure, things happened, websites got made, but it never got to the next level, so to speak. It was only discussions on a subreddit, never able to breakout and be anything more.


And so now, I have set this up for my [seemingly doomed] proposal. Hopefully, you can now understand where I am about to come from, and the mistakes that I think have been learned from the past, similar attempt to do this (being an avid fan of Braid, I firmly believe in the power of learning from mistakes to do things better the second time around).


As I collected my thoughts to write this, the first thing that came into my mind was this: as a community, we just came off of a tremendous success with our contributions to the Stewart/Colbert Rallies. Now is the time for us to catalyze this success and enthusiasm into something of lasting benefit. I know that the focus of Stewart's message at the end was largely about the lack of reason in the news, but I think it's not that far a leap to also be decrying the lack of reason in politics.


And so to make a long post continue to be endless, I now propose to you:

**The Stewards of Reason**

A political movement, or party, or what have you, for Redditors, or whoever else, who are frustrated and angered with what's happening in politics, and feel powerless to do anything about it.


How this is not the American Pirate Party:


The Stewards of Reason is not based on a constitution of positions on issues, or political goals, or any such restrictive documents. Instead, it is based off of a Pledge of Reason.


Simple put, the Stewards of Reason stand for nothing but the following:

**Politics should be grounded in fact, logic, and reason, and should be about the people, not the politicians.**


Do you remember two years ago how the word on Obama's and McCain's lips was “change?” Yep, that didn't seem to happen. You can blame whoever you want for this, but I think we need to stop deluding ourselves, **the issue with politics is that we're leaving it up to the politicians.** Democracy is supposed to be about the people (hence demos), but I think that most of us really feel powerless. I don't know what I want this to be exactly or why I'm writing this (and learning form the APP, I don't want to define it too narrowly), besides a way to try to get back some sort of power (and not in a Tea-Party-take-back-our-government-way, either). All I really want to know right now is if anybody else has feelings similar to me, and wishes they could do something about it.


This has been an exhausting post to write, and there's so much more I want to say, but I just don't have it in me right now, except for a tl;dr


**TL;DR**

1) Reddit is really good at finding things that should be better in government, politics, and society.

2) Reddit was really bad at organizing a political movement.

3) BUT Reddit was really good at organizing all kinds of activities related to the Rally.

4) I think Reddit could totally use the enthusiasm from the Rally to catalyze the start of a political movement, or something like that, solely grounded in bringing reason back to politics.


**TLDRwasTL;DR:** Does anybody else wish we could take the politics out of politics and replace it with reason?

ec05e,14,2010-11-26,I've made a huge mistake... ,mindfield,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ec05e/ive_made_a_huge_mistake/,"About 6 months ago, I broke up with my live-in girlfriend (let's call her Maria), ending an almost 5 year old relationship. We were each other's first love. We had been there for each other's high and low moments, gone together for a great trip in Europe, and gave each other a shoulder to lean on when things were rough. And things did occasionally get difficult for both of us, as we were both studying; I was studying for an English major (groan), and she was studying to become a physician. Obviously I had to make some sacrifices for her, as she did not always have time to spend on couple's stuff (read: intimacy). As some of you might know, studying becomes a huge part of your life when you want to be a doctor, and as exams came closer, some things had to be increasingly de-prioritized. Intimacy didn't use to be a problem, but it definitely became one for me in the last year of her doctorate.

Where things changed was around last October, where I met a younger girl (I'm 26, Maria is 23, and ""Evelyn"" is 21) at the call center where I work. Evelyn, who also had a boyfriend at the time, stirred something in me that had gone dormant for a while; call it passion, lust or whatever (mid-life crisis?). Something clicked between us, and we went from just friends to... well, I did some things with Evelyn that I'm not proud of today. Yes, I cheated on Maria. I rationalized it by telling myself I was getting something from Evelyn that I couldn't get from Maria, namely an escape from the tediousness of getting home from work and doing house chores while Maria studied intently. I kept all of this safely hidden from Maria, justifying everything by convincing myself Maria had enough stress to deal with (Trichotillomania, exam stress, psoriasis) without my needs getting in the way. And while I'm typing this, I fully realize how selfish, uncommunicative and twisted I must sound. If I could go back, I would have done things differently... but there's more.

Evelyn wanted to give her own relationship a shot, even after what we'd done, and left out of state to live with her boyfriend last December. We lost contact for several months, and during this time, I struggled with the decision to break up or not with Maria. On the one hand, Maria had motivation, intelligence, great chemistry with me and a long-established comfort level. On the other hand, I had cheated on her. Maria could feel me slowly withdrawing away from her, and when she had to make the decision of choosing where she would do her internship, I admitted I wouldn't come with her for the ride. This broke her heart, and I felt like shit, which is obviously fully justified. We both moved out when the lease ended, and kept in touch (first once a week, then once every two weeks, and now it's been more than a month since we spoke).

Fast forward to July. Evelyn came back to town, and after we became friends again, she broke up with her boyfriend. Now that we were both single, we decided to try dating seriously. However, I had the feeling from the very start of the relationship that it just wasn't going to work. Thoughts of regret returned again and again, while I was doing the dishes, taking a shower, walking to work... I wasn't happy. About two weeks ago, while surfing on Facebook, I glanced at Maria's photo. She had told me previously over the phone that she was dating someone, but it didn't really sink in until I saw her Facebook status updated (silly, I know). Coupled with seeing her beautiful smile in her Halloween costume, everything I felt bubbled to the surface and I sobbed for a while... that night, I squabbled with Evelyn over some petty crap, and broke up with her a few days later.

Now, I can't get Maria out of my head. We were great together, and I would *never* have imagined me doing anything like cheating on her before the last year of our relationship. I loved her, and I'm sure I still do, despite the fact that I betrayed her trust. I obviously don't deserve her (she's a **doctor**, I'm a *""/$%""?* supervisor in a call center with no clear career path), and I've taken her for granted. I've even considered writing a letter to gauge how well she would take the suggestion of trying to renew our relationship.

Be honest with me: am I a sick and twisted individual? And what the hell do I do now?

tl;dr: I thought the grass was greener on the other side, cheated and broke up with my first long-term girlfriend. 6 months later, I realize I fucked up the only **real** thing I had going in my entire life.

EDIT:  Thanks for your feedback everyone. I'll give it a single shot in person; we've been talking about me going to see her new place a few months ago, so I may take her up on that offer. At least I'll have closure if she doesn't want me back.

My dad is dieing of leukemia, my parents are devoiced, and me and my friend are both employed as interns by my dad. My family has blue cross blue shield health insurance but my dad hasn't worked for about 1 or 2 years. He has been in and out of the hospital and can't work regularly. I'm not entirely sure how much my family is in debt right now. My mom, my brother and sister and me moved out of the house we owned since 2000 or so. We currently live in an apartment about 1/4 the size of our old house. My dad lives in his house about 2 miles away with his mom and new wife. My dad lends money to his brother and went to Disneyland last month but he does regularly send alimony and occasionally a little extra due to guilt (maybe). I don't have a girlfriend. My pay that comes from working for my dad is most likely borrowed and I don't take it because then less would go to my mom, my dad is pay my me and my friend out of his own pocket. Our internship is a sponsored (by him) FOSS project written entirely in Java which besides Python is the only language I know. The internship is good job experience but we aren't really working on it much due to classes. I feel trapped, in order to get a job that can support me it would be best to *at least* finish my associate's degree, but at the same time, I feel i need to get out of my mom's house and stop relying on her.

in short, my life sucks, be grateful you aren't in my situation.

ecmgt,8,2010-11-27,In NYC and I could really use a little bit of help.,velociraptorofdoom,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ecmgt/in_nyc_and_i_could_really_use_a_little_bit_of_help/,"I moved up to NYC to attend culinary school in July and am currently living in the school housing on Roosevelt Island. My parents are covering the housing and transportation, but other than that I am on my own. I had a little bit of money saved up, but as this is NYC that went out the window pretty quickly. With the help of my roommates I survived on ten dollars last month. And I'm fine with that. I don't need spending money.
The problem is my parents recently had a little bit of financial trouble, and this months check is running a week late. The housing is payed off but yesterday was the last day on my metrocard. I really don't know what to do. I've asked so much from my roommates I really can't bring myself to ask this too. I have school on monday, and they take points off my grade for every day that I miss. I just managed to land an internship at a restaurant that could make my career, and I have to be there on Tuesday. 
I hate asking for favors. I really do. But I feel that there is too much on the line to risk not asking. I really need a one week metrocard. That's it. It's 27 dollars that I don't have. If any New Yorkers have an extra one that they don't need it would really help me out. I can show you school id. I would let you keep my drivers license or virtually anything else that I own until I pay you back. I just need to get through this week. I can provide any proof that you want.

She moved to another city for an internship and was very stressed about her work. I have had the roughest semester of my life. She would often try to talk to me about her emotions and stuff but it would really stress me out and I was stressed out as it was. Needless to say she felt neglected and decided we would be better off as friends. I can't blame her there.

Anyway, I am really broken up about it. I know that in the end it is for the best, she wasn't happy, and really in the midst of it all I wasn't very happy either, but we were inseparable for 2 years and getting used to the fact that she is no longer with me has been very difficult. I have had serious relationships before but this one was the most serious of my life, we lived together last semester. I don't know, you guys probably get a lot of these posts but I just don't know what to do with myself. Give me some advice please."

 I'm a college student on my last year and something has been bothering me. I've been working at my current job for about 2 years and 3 months now and now that I'm updating my resume, I believe my title doesn't accurately reflect what my job actually entails. My title is IT Support Intern, but I'm told to call myself an IT Specialist (because who listens to interns).

I am the only IT person at this local branch of the company so almost all IT related tasks fall to me. I do basic computer work like troubleshooting hardware, software, and networking problems. I am in charge of all the purchasing and set up of new equipment. We have 3 local servers, used mostly as file servers that I built and maintain. We also have a physical firewall which I update, and configure. We also make use of about 12 different machines with embedded windows xp computers in them which I am in charge of maintaining. The kicker is that I'm very loosely managed. I am submitted a list of problems and their perceived severity levels and I'm let loose to fix them in any way I deem pragmatic.

Does this all apply as Support or do my duties go beyond that? I'm trying to create the best resume I can for future jobs when I graduate and I would greatly appreciate any help on how to best represent the job I currently do in this format. Thank you for your time."
