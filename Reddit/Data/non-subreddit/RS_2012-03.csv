I need your advice / help for resources, tips and tricks of people who might have used SQN portable mixers for film and movie production.  

Tomorrow I am going to operate a SQN 4,2 (I guess it's a series II or SQN 4S series, not sure...) that I have never used before, just got the intel today of what field recorder I would be using. 


I will be the sound tech for this low budget short film in cooporation with one of Denmark's biggest films studios ""Zentropa"" - They deliver the gear for one of their intern/ students for own projects.
I know there are really not any expetations of me knowing all this equipment from their side but I would really like to know a little bit about this piece of equipment anyway.. to prepare.
 

Any ideas of where I can get some info / guides on operating this mixer. Maybe some of you already have had some hands on experience. 

 


Help much appreciated. :)"

**Question 1:**  Are there jobs in industry for a PChemist? I know some people do spectroscopy, and some companies hire a couple of computational chemists for modeling. But that's seems very limiting. So I just want to get some opinion from the experts. 


**Question 2:**  As an undergraduate, are there any summer internship? 

Thanks!

I guess I just don't want to not have a job and end up doing modeling for wall street or something. 


(I know there are a lot of internship posts recently, so I apologize for another one. But there are none about PChem specifically.)"

All my life I've been told that I should do something with my art and my ideas. The astonished statements, the furtive questions-- ""What are you doing working at Walmart when you can draw like that?"" ""I had no idea you could draw so good! Why don't you go to art school?!""

I've never had any idea what to do with my creativity and talent until recently, however. I didn't really see any money in comic books. I definitely didn't want to be a tattoo artist. I'm not quite good enough at math to be an architect. And outside of my own scope on the matter, I had always heard the stereotypes: people complaining that their art degrees were useless, that there were all kinds of homeless people on the streets with the paper and the creds, that there were art school graduates with loan debt and no art job to pay it off with.

Add to that the environment that I was raised in; my whole family has been up to its eyebrows in general labor. Factories, namely. Textile manufacturing, power plants, automobile assembly... you name it. ""Hard work"" belonged on my family's coat of arms, if we'd had one. If you didn't have a job putting something together in a dim and dirty roomful of shuddering, slamming, booming machines, twelve hours a day, six days a week, you were a slacker, lazy, good-for-nothing.

I ended up with a pretty heavy case of depression in high school. What good was this supposedly prodigious talent with no one to share it with and nowhere to apply it? I went to art class every day, where I made straight As of course, and every day stared down our sad sack of an art teacher, who spent nearly every class hiding behind his desk, drawing Time Magazine cover arts that would never see the light of day. I didn't want to be that man.

One day I received a certificate from the National Creative Society deeming me a ""Mentor of Poetry, Prose, Art, and Performance"". I was proud of it--still am, to a degree, but when I saw how envious that art teacher was of it--practically threw it at me when he gave it to me that afternoon in art class--I couldn't help but want to avoid seeing myself in that same chair, hiding behind that same desk.

I tried to write a fantasy novel, but I knew it would be an uphill battle trying to get it published, and the rewards would be slim, if any. So after a couple years of trying to hold down a flighty retail job, a handful of creative false starts, and a failed marriage, I decided to join the Army. What better way to get out of the doldrums of the backwoods and away from a destiny under a carpet-weaving machine than jump into a life of excitement, experience, and travel feetfirst?

Several years passed. I had met and married again, changed jobs from my original MOS as Military Policeman to 'Transportation Coordinator', and deployed to Afghanistan with a new unit in a logistical job moving and tracking enemy movements, ambush incidents, and shipment convoys all over west Afghanistan. It was a hell of a time, and I'd gladly do it again in a heartbeat--but it turned out that while I was on the other side of the planet, my new wife had grown used to my absence and developed a seven-year-itch in three months. And up until I walked in the front door of our house, I thought we could still work things out...we had been talking online, talking about the future, talking about promises and compromises, about how we'd each changed for the better, and how we were going to start over and do things right.

I walked in the front door of our house at the end of my deployment and all of her stuff was gone. But it didn't really hit me until I walked into the living room and saw the blinds I had put up while I was home on leave back in April. The big picture windows in the living room were so big and empty, and there was no shade and she couldn't put them up herself, and I felt so helpless--I had been gone so long and left so much of the stateside business to her, that I had to put up all the blinds. I needed to do something for her, to do something stateside, even if I couldn't be here to protect her at night in that creepy old house when she was there all by herself, or take care of her when she was sick, or take her out to eat for her birthday, two of which I had missed. I could put up the blinds. That, at least, I could do.

I walked into the living room and saw the blinds I had put up just for her, and she wasn't even here to use them, and I withered inside. After she fled to North Dakota with her new boyfriend, I stayed in the house a few weeks while I job-hunted, completely confused as to what to do until my mother offered to let me stay back home for a little while again.

I'll never forget how hard I cried driving back to Georgia with everything I owned crammed into the truck that my new ex-wife had abandoned. She had completely dropped every thread of the life we'd shared for the last several years, and left me up to my eyeballs in debt: the truck I was driving, she'd purchased while I was overseas. A car she tried to purchase after I told her to leave the truck with me instead of somewhere I couldn't find it. We hadn't even taken possession of the car.

When I got to Georgia, the job search didn't go any better. Literally thousands of resumes emailed, dozens of job websites trawled every day: a few interviews, but nothing promising. And I'd had such high hopes for landing a job in logistics. It had seemed such an important field when I did it in Afghanistan. Everybody needs something shipped, right? I had my nose in everybody's business over there; I could find a needle in a haystack from space, and tell you where it would be in twelve hours. My nickname was ""The Eye of Sauron"" because if something happened in my Area of Responsibility, I knew about it.

Three weeks after I returned to Georgia, I was at work, third shift, running a industrial carpet-weaving machine for minimum wage, twelve hours a night, seven days a week, when I had an epiphany.

Talent doesn't just ""go away"" just because you have been convinced that it is worthless. You are born with it. You are born TO it. You can run from it, but you can't hide from it. Stories still came to me, even though I hardly ever wrote anymore. I still got the mental movies you get when you daydream about the stories that come to you. I still got the faces, the clothes, the things they did, the things they said, my ideas. Everybody said I was better off now that she was gone; up until it hit me, I hadn't thought so. I had lost the most important person in the world to me. My whole purpose was gone, leaving yet another gaping hole. But maybe now it was time to let go and commit to what had been inside me the entire time, and use the unfortunate freedom I'd been pushed into to return to creative pursuits.

Games. I have always loved video games, and the best ones are the ones that you can lose yourself in. Slough off the stress of the day with a journey into the woodland heart of ""The Elder Scrolls""' land of Cyrodiil, or burn off some frustration fighting the mob in some crime caper game or some nameless aliens on a cloud-dappled plain. I decided that was where I wanted to tell my stories.

I need this. Funded or not, school or not, all I have left are my talents and my hard work. If I can't go to school and get the degree I need, I'll pour all my ideas into my portfolio and start looking for an internship or something. My pictures and my words, they tell stories, and the best place I can see to accomplish that is with a game developer. I want people to meet the quirky characters that appear to me as I'm standing there gazing into the shivering eighty-three needles of a deafening carpet machine. I want people to get lost in the exotic environments that appear to me as I'm trying to fall asleep at nine in the morning after work. I want people to see the worlds that I've been seeing for the last twenty years, and I need help to make that happen right. I need help being the creator I should have always been.

Thank you for reading."

I decided that was where I wanted to tell my stories.

I need this. Funded or not, school or not, all I have left are my talents and my hard work. If I can't go to school and get the degree I need, I'll pour all my ideas into my portfolio and start looking for an internship or something. My pictures and my words, they tell stories, and the best place I can see to accomplish that is with a game developer. I want people to meet the quirky characters that appear to me as I'm standing there gazing into the shivering eighty-three needles of a deafening carpet machine. I want people to get lost in the exotic environments that appear to me as I'm trying to fall asleep at nine in the morning after work. I want people to see the worlds that I've been seeing for the last twenty years, and I need help to make that happen right. I need help being the creator I should have always been.

Thank you for reading."
qf3al,6,2012-03-02,Could someone guide me a bit and answer some questions I have? (not technical questions),takk___,ASPNET,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASPNET/comments/qf3al/could_someone_guide_me_a_bit_and_answer_some/,"Okay so forgive me if this isn't the specific place I should be posting this.  I have seen other subreddits like /r/cscareerquestions but I thought this would be better.

I have a few questions regarding what I should learn and in what order, also if this is the right path for me.  Before that I will give you a bit of a background on me...

I am 24 and recently became laid off from my first Web Developer position out of college.  I graduated in 2010 with a bachelors degree in Information Sciences and Technology from Penn State.  In a nutshell the major exposed us to everything imaginable in IT, programming, project management, networking, UI Design, etc.  That was the good part.  The bad part is that none of these classes were much about ""the basics.""

I took an internship with a web development company and was eventually hired by them full-time after college.  I mostly took care of HTML/CSS emails, but I delved into the world of ASP.NET/C# and also Javascript for the first time here.

Long story short... one of the major clients we worked with got sold and all my work was gone.

Here I am unemployed, seriously attempting to learn skills to better myself in finding a job that I actually LIKE.  I have been interested in web development since I was in middle school and I will always be.  I just have some questions regarding if this is the right path for me etc.

1) I recently started reading a C# book to better understand it, but I hit a wall.  I get all the basics for the most part... mathematical statements, loops, if/else, and things specific to the world of ASP.NET in setting labels text, and on occasion I used table adapters with stored procedures to retrieve data.  However, I am to the point in this book (which is based around Windows Form Applications, not the world of web) where it is beginning to run away with the concept of objects.  I seem to understand the theories behind objects (inheritance etc), but I have trouble actually picturing a potential project in terms of objects.  How far into the C# world does one have to go in order to be proficient enough in the ASP.NET world?  I would like to think I don't need to know EVERYTHING, but I am probably wrong...

2) Because I generally hit these walls, the idea comes to mind that maybe this isn't for me and maybe I am not intelligent enough to be a Web Developer.  I had plenty of classes with CS majors that just seemed so far beyond my comprehension level, yet at the same time, none of them seemed interested in projects they were given.  Is this normal or do most people quickly move through C# books?  This sounds like a dumb question...

3) Now that I have been looking for a job, I am torn between front-end development and back-end.  Most jobs listed are one or the other and working for a small company, I had to do both.  I keep coming to the conclusion that maybe back-end isn't for me, but then I really find it rewarding when I figure something out.  On the same side, front-end development seems easier, but it is a major headache having to deal with different browsers etc...

4) Now that I have all the time in the world until I find something (hopefully soon), what do you suggest I do?  I have taken to the ""Head First"" books by O'Reilly that I really enjoy.  So far I just finished SQL since it was a really easy read.  I am about 1/3 the way through Head first C# and I hit a wall.  I am also about 1/5 through Javascript and have purchased ""Design Patterns"" and ""Object Oriented Analysis and Design"".

I primarily used Web Forms at my previous job but would like to head into the world of MVC3 and Razor although I have very little knowledge of either...

Any help would be appreciated, sorry for the long post!

I landed a killer internship, and while I'm waiting on that starting I still need some money. 


My school contacted me with anther opportunity (again the killer internship is taking forever due to vacations and a few other things). 

For a bit of background:

Now, I am/was a freelance programmer for a while and am pretty familiar with it. It's just not for me, and while I do love it- it's not something I want to do forever. But, it's a job. The school is well aware it's what I do at present for work at the moment and got in touch over a few companies looking for somebody with coding knowledge looking for work.


My interview for one of them is coming up, and going by what both the school itself and the guy had said- he's only looking for 'female programmers' and employees. He claims (and again the school had also said) that 'women have a better eye for detail'.


I have some MASSIVE issues with this. Sure, it's work BUT I'm not about to encourage this kind of sexism. It would be an issue if it were stated that he was only looking for men, and the same holds true in this case.

Hell, at the very least- it's a chance to make a stand on something I believe in. 

So, there's that. 

So, tell me TwoX: 

What can I say or do to make a point (professionally)? "
qelfv,13,2012-03-02,Personal Success Story Here,Tale16,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/qelfv/personal_success_story_here/,"Hey guys, just had to get this out there to people who truly understand where I am coming from.  I have and always will be addicted to substances because they induce mania, which is what I'm really addicted to.  Starting with this spring semester at college, I decided to go cold turkey on all substances and become a straightedge.  This is the best thing I've done with my life probably in the past few years and I'm still astonished with the positive repercussions.  Last semester and pretty much all through college I struggled socially, academically, and with managing my illness.  Now, I am a double Psychology and Business administration major taking 19 credits as well as involved in 5 clubs/organizations on campus.  I have gotten an 85 or above on every test or assignment thus far and developed strong relationships with a few of my professors.  I have met at least a hundred new people through different social networks and have some girls interested in me again.  In addition, I rekindled relationships with close friends of whom I pulled away from.  I also no longer have a place to call home for complicated reasons, but that pushed me to find a paying job and I ended up (very likely) landing a paid internship in Industrial Organizational Psychology; Most of all, I feel like I have control back in my life.  I am no longer letting manic depression define my life so much as I am defining my life as a person who suffers from it.  With this amount of positive reinforcement, I could NEVER imagine going back to using and I hope this helps people who might be struggling with the issue because a few of my friends told me it helped them with theirs.  I've only posted a few other times, but this is an awesome community and I'm glad to be a part of it.  And remember, it's not mental illness, it's mental skillness 0.o"

qg768,1,2012-03-03,My 21st birthday.,[deleted],LastNight,https://www.reddit.com/r/LastNight/comments/qg768/my_21st_birthday/,"This was the night of my 21st birthday, during my summer internship in Chicago. I had been out with some friends from work, and at the end of the night around 2 the bars started closing and most of them decided to go home. The only two people left with me were Dave (who I actually knew from high school, a heavyset black guy with dreads, and yes he loves the herb) and his friend from class, Rob (who looks a bit like Jack Black, could maybe pass as his brother). Dave and Rob didn’t show up until around midnight, so they wanted to keep going and hit up a late night bar. We didn’t know of any places, so Dave calls up some random guy that he met last weekend who supposedly knows his way around.

The guy rolls up a little bit later, and he introduces himself as Micky. As soon as I saw this guy, I instantly got a weird vibe about him. He was this short stocky Mexican guy who had a slicked back haircut that made him look like a pedophile. We get into his car anyway, and end up going about just 3 blocks down from where we already were (felt stupid). There was hardly anyone in there, but we didn’t want to leave cause there was no other place open nearby, so we just went straight to the bar and started doing shots between us 4. We stayed for about a half hour, doing shot after shot, when Micky suddenly tells us that we should “go on an adventure”. I had no idea what this meant, but of course being drunk out my mind we were just like “YEA LET’S DO IT!!”

So we get back in Micky’s car, and this where things started getting fucked up. I passed out like 2 minutes after I got into his car, and when I wake back up I ask Micky where we’re going. He calmly tells us we’re going to get ourselves some COCAINE. At this time I was too fucked up to have that statement completely register in my mind, but I looked out the window and realize that we’re literally driving through skid row. It was seriously the shadiest, jankiest urban area I’d ever seen in my life. I look up at Rob in the front seat and I see him just slouched down at an awkward angle, basically as if he expected a drive-by shooting to happen at any second. I started slouching in my seat too.

The next thing I know, I wake up and we’re parked in front of Micky’s apartment. Now at this point I wasn’t sure what was going on. I was still fucked up and I didn’t remember actually seeing the dealer and going through with the transaction, so I thought maybe Micky was just joking about it the entire time. We go inside his apartment, which turned out to be much nicer than I expected. It was actually a really fancy, really huge place, and he told us how he lives there with his wife and kids who were out of town for the week. At that point I concluded he must’ve been just fucking with us; there’s no way he can carry on a coke habit with a family and still live in such a nice place. 

We all sit down on his couch, and Dave pulls out his bowl and his weed and he starts packing it. Right as he’s about to light it, Micky suddenly stands up, reaches into his jacket, and pulls out a bigass bag of coke, grabs Rob, and they just start doing line after line on the kitchen counter. Dave and I just kinda sit there staring at them, we look at each other, and we’re just like “No, we’re not about to do that.” We smoke the bowl ourselves, and go off to a corner to crash for the night, while Micky and Rob are still going at it. As I was trying to sleep I heard Micky yelling that he’ll make us breakfast. I’m worried that he’ll add extra ingredients.

The next morning we wake up, and I see Micky cooking breakfast with a huge smile on his face. Rob is just sitting there on the couch, and I notice he looks really nervous. We ask him what’s wrong, and he whispers to us “We really need to get out of here”. So we make up some excuse for Micky, telling him we gotta go and can’t stay for breakfast. Micky looks disappointed. 

Back outside, Rob starts explaining what happened. Apparently after Dave and I were passed out, Rob was coming down from his buzz so he sat down on the couch watching TV. Micky comes up and starts giving him a shoulder massage. Rob was fine with this at first, but then Micky started to breathe heavily into his ear.. All of the sudden he tells Rob to WHIP IT OUT. 

“…Wait, what?”

“He told me to whip out my dick.”

….. 

Dave and I comprehend this for a second, then we burst out laughing. Dave goes, “What the FUCK??? Why didn’t you knock his ass out on the spot, grab us, and then get us the fuck out of there immediately???” 

Rob stutters and says, “well I felt kinda bad for him cause his wife and kid don’t know that he’s gay, plus I only whipped it out for like 3 seconds and I didn’t let him touch it, that doesn’t make me gay does it?” 

“WWWHHHHAAATTT???” 

Rob: ""Please don’t tell anyone this happened.. I actually feel kinda sick to my stomach right now.""

And of course Dave and I made fun of him the entire way back home, and soon after told his cousin, who laughed his ass off.

The moral of the story: Don’t do coke, it’ll make you gay.

qg2kx,0,2012-03-03,In the Mind of Rush Limbaugh When Reading Sandra Fluke's Congressional Testimony,dichloroethane,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/qg2kx/in_the_mind_of_rush_limbaugh_when_reading_sandra/,"Alright Rush, you've got 15 million real American Americans working hard to build a better America listening to your every word with baited ears. Truly a great responsibility, no burden, rests on your shoulders to make this country great again. Let's see what we have here, ah, a congressional testimony from a one Sandra Fluke. That's kind of a silly name-- Damnit Rush, focus! For the future of America for our Lord and Savior's sake!

 

Well let's see, she's a Georgetown law student. Hmmm, if I remember correctly, students are exempt from the provisions in the Obama policy on employer-provided health plans and Georgetown currently includes contraception in its health plan[1]. She did her bachelors in feminism studies and is now looking to practice law in domestic violence. So Rush, you're dealing with a heavily biased feminist fighting legislation for which she is not technically a stakeholder. Awww, Limbaugh you're going to come out looking great on this one. 

 

http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/statement-Congress-letterhead-2nd%20hearing.pdf

 

Alright, so she makes a claim that contraception will cost a woman over $3000 dollars throughout all of law school, which is almost as much as one makes in a summer internship if they are doing a community service based law program. Well, Rush, it would seem your initial impulses that lawyers at top tier institutions make way more than $3000 in a summer is negated by the fact that she is on a public interest scholarship. Think, Rush, think, why is this statistic so unsettling? Come on Limbaugh, you didn't do that thorough literature review on the economics of birth control just to see how easily you can feel emasculated now did you? 

 

Ah, ha. She is using a cost time scale of 3 years and comparing it to a wage timescale of 3 months. Dear my lord and savior Jesus Christ, such statistical manipulation to fit your worldview is essentially a blatant lie. Now, if we assume that an insurance plan would cover birth control pills, which have a median cost of $35 a month but with insurance would be reduced to a $10 copay, it is safe to assume that uninsured birth control would cost about $1260 over three years[2]. She is crying doom and gloom over $25 dollars a month. Well either that number is wrong or her idea of birth control is popping copious amounts of morning after pills at $50 a pop. In that case, she would literally be having so much sex that she can't afford the contraception. Yeah Limbaugh, that line drives your point home. Make sure to include that one when this gets to your mouth. 

 

Alright, reading on, it seems she's going to try and bring up specific sad stories about women who need birth control. The first one is about a girl with ovarian cysts but she states that this is already covered because the treatment has nothing to do with preventing pregnancy. Then she uses a fear tactic to say what if this wasn't covered if the new legislation passes. Wow, that is literally not a point so I'm not going to address it. Okay, so her friend was sick but was denied coverage because the insurance company did not think she had proper symptoms. Again, this is a straw man argument. It does nothing to address the right of a religous institution to deny subsidizing a product that perpetuates a lifestyle under medical pretext that is against its beliefs while not fighting or preventing disease. Rush, your nation is too intelligent for you to be wasting your time addressing every straw man that your opponents throw at you. Skip this one too.

 

Alright, her last point is about a girl who got raped and thought that since the University didn't cover birth control, they wouldn't cover her going to a doctor to check for STD's. Well it turns out the University does do that and this feels like a fairly large stretch in order to invoke the emotional response from hearing of a rape victim in order to further this girl's political agenda. 

 

So basically, she just wasted two pages of paper trying to stir up emotion without ever really addressing the issue. Though she is not like any of the people in the examples she cited, she is looking to have government subsidized birth control to prevent her own pregnancy. This is a clear case of conflict of interest to use a group that genuinely suffers from a disease, ovarian cysts, for the purpose of controlling legislation that will offer you a direct personal gain at the expense of the taxpayer. Dear, son of Jehovah, the taxpayer is literally funding this girl's lifestyle. Bingo Limbaugh, you have yourself an air tight argument. Let's count those culture war chickens and send this argument straight to your mouth. It'll literally be a no brainer to articulate.

I'm back. I posted a few weeks ago looking for mid-level developers. Alas, my search has been fruitless. I've been given the go-ahead to look for 4 more students for part-time hourly internships. Here's what I'm looking for:

1) A serious love of coding. The more you enjoy writing software, the more I want to hire you.

2) You need to be graduating this year (May, Aug, Dec).. the reason for this is...

3) This is basically a trial run to a full-time hired position with salary/benefits. Basically, we'll try you out for a while, and if we like you and you do good work and show promise, when you graduate, we'll convert you. 

4) For part-time, we're looking for a minimum of 20 hours a week, but you can work up to 40 if you can manage it. This is great for spring break and/or all summer. 

5) We have huge office-wide bonuses and incentives for meeting office-wide goals on code drops. For example, in 6 weeks, we have our first big goal, for which the prize if we hit our code drop with the requirements needed is a $3000 bonus for everyone (of which part timer get a minimum of $1500, plus any more at my discretion if you've been kicking ass)

6) I'm the hiring manager. You'd be reporting to me. I have 13 developers working for me (Junior and Mid), of which 6 already are students. From the feedback I've gotten, they all love it. You might know some of them.

Here's the snippet about our company that I put in my last posting:

*A bit of background about us.. We're a company of about 500 people, and we do government contract work, but this particular office (about 55 people currently, ramping up to about 65) is all fixed-bid, so little government oversight (no security clearance or anything) and we're really well funded, so we have autonomy to solve the problems the way we want to solve them, which means top of the line hardware and software. This translates into a really hardcore dev shop (we have a lot of talent up here).*

If you're interested, shoot me a message on here, and I'll give you my work email address to send your resume to, and we'll go from there.

(Location-wise, we're roughly at Prospect and Sharp Point, about 5-7 mins east of campus)

Thanks!


EDIT: You'd mostly be doing C#, but if you don't know it, that's fine, we can teach it.

I work for a Big corporation, a telecom giant (fortune 50) as an Electrical Engineer as a contractor. I was once an intern to this corporation for 1 yr when I was still doing Grad school (my MS), and I later quit my job to finish school. I am now back as a contract engineer to one of the 10000+ engineering teams. I program for this team. I do mostly scripting. I write mostly in C, Perl and Python. I have close to 3 yrs experience now. I am the only programmer in this team. I program for test automation mostly in Perl and Python.

Recently my manager has indicated that he would like to hire me as a staff engineer to the team from the contracting company. I am pretty sure that I will get a call from the HR any time, and I would like to be prepared.

When I graduated from grad school 2 yrs ago during a tough economy it took a while to find a job and when I got this contractor offer, I took it as a foot in the door. Naturally, my compensation is very less compared to the other engineers in this company whom I work with. I am offered 68k a yr. No more, no less. No matter how long or hard I work (I put 65+hrs/wk). I have been a contractor for ~5 months now.

This corporation went to extra-ordinary lengths to first source me, interview me, and then put me on another third party company's payroll and then hire me as a contractor. The other company from whom I receive my paychecks from, hardly have ever seen me, or even met me. I don't get half the benefits what the employees of the company I work for get, but I am required to work twice as hard, and I am always expected to exceed the expectations in hopes that I get hired as a staff.

How should I proceed? They do offer healthcare, complete medical insurance, a sign-on bonus, stock options etc. But I would like to know specifically when in comes to paycheck, how much should I ask for my remuneration per hour? when they offer me. (I already know they undervalue everyone). By now, you'd think this is a shitty company to work for, though it is, the science and research I am presently doing, is not done anywhere else, and as far as compared to what I learn, get to do, this is the best place I can be.

Sorry for the long explanation, though I felt I should explain completely. Thanks!"

As a divinity school student, I had just started working as a student chaplain at a cancer hospital when my professor asked me about my work.  I was 26 years old and still learning what a chaplain did.

""I talk to the patients,"" I told him.

""You talk to patients?  And tell me, what do people who are sick and dying talk to the student chaplain about?"" he asked.

I had never considered the question before.  “Well,” I responded slowly, “Mostly we talk about their families.”

“Do you talk about God?

“Umm, not usually.”

“Or their religion?”

“Not so much.”

“The meaning of their lives?”

“Sometimes.”

“And prayer?  Do you lead them in prayer?  Or ritual?”

“Well,” I hesitated.  “Sometimes.  But not usually, not really.”

I felt derision creeping into the professor's voice.  “So you just visit people and talk about their families?”

“Well, they talk.  I mostly listen.”

“Huh.”  He leaned back in his chair.

A week later, in the middle of a lecture in this professor's packed class, he started to tell a story about a student he once met who was a chaplain intern at a hospital.

“And I asked her, 'What exactly do you do as a chaplain?'  And she replied, 'Well, I talk to people about their families.'” He paused for effect. “And that was this student's understanding of  faith!  That was as deep as this person's spiritual life went!  Talking about other people's families!”

The students laughed at the shallowness of the silly student.  The professor was on a roll.

“And I thought to myself,” he continued, “that if I was ever sick in the hospital, if I was ever dying, that the last person I would ever want to see is some Harvard Divinity School student chaplain wanting to talk to me about my family.”

My body went numb with shame.  At the time I thought that maybe, if I was a better chaplain, I would know how to talk to people about big spiritual questions.  Maybe if dying people met with a good, experienced chaplain they would talk about God, I thought.

Today, 13 years later, I am a hospice chaplain.  I visit people who are dying – in their homes, in hospitals, in nursing homes.   And if you were to ask me the same question - What do people who are sick and dying talk about with the chaplain?  – I, without hesitation or uncertainty, would give you the same answer. Mostly, they talk about their families: about their mothers and fathers, their sons and daughters.

They talk about the love they felt, and the love they gave.  Often they talk about love they did not receive, or the love they did not know how to offer, the love they withheld, or maybe never felt for the ones they should have loved unconditionally.

They talk about how they learned what love is, and what it is not.    And sometimes, when they are actively dying, fluid gurgling in their throats, they reach their hands out to things I cannot see and they call out to their parents:  Mama, Daddy, Mother.

What I did not understand when I was a student then, and what I would explain to that professor now, is that people talk to the chaplain about their families because that is how we talk about God.  That is how we talk about the meaning of our lives.  That is how we talk about the big spiritual questions of human existence.

We don't live our lives in our heads, in theology and theories.  We live our lives in our families:  the families we are born into, the families we create, the families we make through the people we choose as friends.

This is where we create our lives, this is where we find meaning, this is where our purpose becomes clear.

Family is where we first experience love and where we first give it.  It's probably the first place we've been hurt by someone we love, and hopefully the place we learn that love can overcome even the most painful rejection.

This crucible of love is where we start to ask those big spiritual questions, and ultimately where they end.

I have seen such expressions of love:  A husband gently washing his wife's face with a cool washcloth, cupping the back of her bald head in his hand to get to the nape of her neck, because she is too weak to lift it from the pillow. A daughter spooning pudding into the mouth of her mother, a woman who has not recognized her for years.

A wife arranging the pillow under the head of her husband's no-longer-breathing body as she helps the undertaker lift him onto the waiting stretcher.

We don't learn the meaning of our lives by discussing it.  It's not to be found in books or lecture halls or even churches or synagogues or mosques.  It's discovered through these actions of love.

If God is love, and we believe that to be true, then we learn about God when we learn about love. The first, and usually the last, classroom of love is the family.

Sometimes that love is not only imperfect, it seems to be missing entirely.  Monstrous things can happen in families.  Too often, more often than I want to believe possible, patients tell me what it feels like when the person you love beats you or rapes you.  They tell me what it feels like to know that you are utterly unwanted by your parents.  They tell me what it feels like to be the target of someone's rage.   They tell me what it feels like to know that you abandoned your children, or that your drinking destroyed your family, or that you failed to care for those who needed you.

Even in these cases, I am amazed at the strength of the human soul.  People who did not know love in their families know that they should have been loved.  They somehow know what was missing, and what they deserved as children and adults.

When the love is imperfect, or a family is destructive, something else can be learned:  forgiveness.  The spiritual work of being human is learning how to love and how to forgive.

We don’t have to use words of theology to talk about God; people who are close to death almost never do. We should learn from those who are dying that the best way to teach our children about God is by loving each other wholly and forgiving each other fully - just as each of us longs to be loved and forgiven by our mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.

I'm a soon-to-be new grad and I would like to get some advice from any software developers working in HK. 

I was raised in Hong Kong. Currently studying an undergrad degree in computer science / finance in Toronto and will be graduating in May. I do have some work experience (1.75 years of internships) in the software development field here in Toronto.

I already got a very reasonable offer from one of the respectable tech firms here (hint: the one that the media hates). The salary, work environment and the experience I will gain there are definitely above average and I will take it in a heartbeat if my family (and girlfriend) are here.

But they are not. They are in HK and that's the only reason why I'm considering moving back and starting my career there. 

What is the IT industry like in Hong Kong? And more importantly, how does the career path look for IT new grads?

I have turned down all other job offers, and I am really depending on working this job.  So my question is, will my background kill my job offer.

-I have been caught with a small amount of pot and a pot pipe.  I have like 4-5 underage consumptions and minor in possessions of alcohol, a hit and run, a disorderly conduct.  I may even have a resisting/evading arrest.  I also have had several tickets in my past.  I also was convicted of violation of probation once, and served 30 days in the county jail.

I feel as if it is a fairly reasonable goal. It would mean losing about 40 pounds. Do you think this is practical? I have been trying a number of things. I started out on a calorie restricted diet and that wasn't really working (even paired with daily exercise) and then I tried keto for a while. The keto went great for a little while but I have my suspicions that it was mostly because I was starving myself because all the food I had at the time had too many carbs. I can't keep up with keto however because it just wasn't practical for my current lifestyle. So now I'm going to try a strict calorie with lower carb type diet. What do you think about this? I could really use some more advice. 

Also are there any little pointers any of you may have? I have a really hard time losing weight. I'm a pretty active person. I was working out every day of the week last semester and only lost about five pounds. I'm going to get my thyroid retested when I get home from my current internship. Is there perhaps another reason I'm not losing weight? Is there anything else that I should ask my doctor about? Thanks guys.

qkofn,2,2012-03-06,How do you professionally apologize for being a crummy employee?,lionline,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/qkofn/how_do_you_professionally_apologize_for_being_a/,"I interned at a nonprofit during one summer in college, and I feel kind of ashamed of the way I acted during the internship.  I wasn't horrible, but I didn't really take any initiative or show much specific interest, in what could have been a great self-directed internship.  I ended up basically phoning it in and organizing files for the summer, which I didn't mind at the time, because I wasn't very motivated.  Now I am older and wiser, and I realize what a bum I was.  My boss at the organization was really nice and could have been a great contact for me (I have actually used her as a reference) but at this point thinking about the internship just makes me feel embarrassed.  

I have a job in the private sector now, but I am considering applying for jobs at a non-profit.  I would probably use her as a reference still (I am guessing she would say something non-specific to potential employers) since I don't have too many other contacts in the field.  I am always tempted to send her a message to sort of apologize though, so she knows that I realize how lame I was and that I'm at least somewhat better now.  

Does anyone have any advice on how to do that professionally and tactfully, without being too specific or disparaging?  Do you guys have any stories of times when you didn't live up to your best, and how you dealt with it later?  "

I would like to thank each of you for your interest in the post, firstly.  I understand that all the postings in response to this are merely the opinions of the poster, regardless of that individual’s accreditation, and I will not consider it legal advice or counsel; instead, solely as friendly opinions and points of discussion. I would prefer that opinions be supported with accredited sources when applicable. Again, thank you all for your incite and perspectives, trust that all information you can provide will be taken to heart. 

**Background:**

I am a senior undergraduate accounting major at a small, private, not-for-profit university. Because of the nature of the underlying questions involved in this posting and the confidentiality involved I will not disclose the name of the university. I am currently employed as the Intern to the Finance Department of that university, in which I work directly under the CFO/Treasurer/EVP of Finance, the Director of Risk Management/Assistant VP of Finance, and the Director of Compliance and Tax Issues. Additionally, I am currently wrapping up my 150 with plans to sit for all four sections of the CPA during the summer, after I graduate in May. Following my graduation, I have an offer to begin in the fall with a CPA firm as an auditor; I previously worked as a tax/audit intern with the firm. That firm currently audits the financial statement of the university of which I am employed and attend, however, though a different office than that which I would be employed and with a different partner than that I would work under.

**Situation:** 

Within the past week I became aware that a number of professors at my university, including one in the accounting department who informed me, believe that there may be a number of material misrepresentations in the university’s Form 990 (the not-for-profit tax return, issued to the IRS and disclosed to the public) and the possibility of a number of illegal accounting activities, as a result of management fraud. Specifically, to the best of my knowledge, the group of professors believes that three identifiable frauds may be occurring: misstatements in the 990 compensation disclosures, misrepresentations in the 990 treatment of our art collection, and the unlawful and fraudulent use of proceeds from the sale of assets included in that art collection. 

Firstly, this group of professors believes that the 990 form misrepresents the university it its disclosures related to the compensation; however, not the specific dollar values, but rather the related yes or no questions. I have no knowledge to suggest this accusation has any merit and have very limited knowledge as to the evidence or knowledge being used by the group of professors unofficially investigating the issue. 

However, I am more aware of the circumstances of possible fraud relating to the art collection and the use of its proceeds and its treatment on the 990. Our university has long held an art collection valued at roughly 1.5 million dollars which was reflected on both the audited financial statements and the 990 form until 3 years ago. At that time our university came under new management, including a new President and a new CFO/Treasurer/EVP of Finance. Apparently, under that new management the university decided that the art collection should be liquidated and assigned the accounting professor mentioned previously, along with others, to investigate how to go about the liquidation process. He informed me that he recommended that the university’s only options were to either reinvest the proceeds back into the art collection or donate the collection to a not-for-profit which could be better suited for the collection. He also informed me that the following year the art collection was no longer shown on the 990.

Since the conversation, I have started looking into the issue myself. I came to a similar conclusion regarding the proper treatment of art collections and the required reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of art collections, as is outlined in SFAS 116 and FASB ASC 958. Also, I have compared the audited financial statements against the 990 to confirm that the art collection still exists, and is shown as “Art Collection” on the audited financials, but shown as “Other” under the Part VI disclosure of the Schedule D attached the 990. Additionally, the 990 has a series of questions and additional disclosures related to art collections, these are either unanswered or answered in contrary to the existence of an art collection on the 990. My understanding of the instructions regarding the 990 would require alternative answers to those provided by management in the case of our art collections, and the purpose with which they were donated and had been capitalized and recognized. 

Today I was informed by one of my direct supervisors that I would be involved in the liquidation of some of the university’s art. I asked him what purpose the university was planning on using the proceeds of the sale of the pieces for and he informed me that the funds would be uses as general revenue and would go into our general fund without restrictions. Also, I asked what percentage of the collection we were planning on liquidating and he informed me that the pieces we were planning on liquidating where not included in our collection according to the financial statements, the collection is stored at a local art museum. These pieces were assorted items with which we had been unable to valuate and properly keep track of. He said there are inadequate records regarding these pieces and that updating and compiling those records would be the majority of my duties related to the liquidation. 

**Request for Advice:**

I would appreciate any additional understanding you could pass onto me regarding the proper treatment of these items and please correct any misunderstanding I may have regarding the regulations and laws related. 

I am looking for advice regarding how best to handle the situation in general. It is important to me that I uphold the code of conduct of the AICPA and avoid any unlawful and unethical actions during the remainder of my employment at the university. 

My university does have a whistleblower policy which I will be forced to utilize if I find any substantive evidence of fraud; I would appreciate any incite as to when/if you think I should use this. 

What disclosures am I required, permitted, discouraged, or prohibited from making to my department, the professors, and my CPA firm which audits the university?

What would you do in my situation?

Any other advise you think would be useful. 

**Current Opinion:**

I am currently leaning toward a course of action which will try and avoid involvement in the situation. I believe that I should make my supervisors aware of the restrictions and regulations related to art collections and inform them of my opinions regarding 990 disclosures related to art collections. Also, I believe I should inform them that “I have become aware of concerns related to the answers provided in the 990 form” and leave it at that. I may also have to request not to be involved in the art liquidation process. Additionally, I thought I would inform the professor I spoke to (and am currently taking an accounting ethics course with) that I was going to make this disclosure to my supervisors. Also, I do not believe I can inform the CPA firm of any of this because it is confidential information I acquired outside of my employment with them. 

**Conclusion:**

Thank you again for your input and concern. I truly appreciate any insight you all can offer and will consider it thoroughly. As I am sure you all can see, I really feel as though I have no other good source to seek counsel from, with my future firm, supervisors, and professors all intimately involved. As stated above I would prefer any references to creditable sources when available just because of the nature of reddit and the fact that I may have to support my positions in the future if an investigation ensues.

It is my motivation for everything in my life.",Cat_Fish,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/qjo1v/hi_getmotivated_im_new_here_but_i_have_a_story_i/,"Hello everyone. I'm Cat_Fish, I'm a 19-year old college student and I have a story I want to share with you. It will be pretty lengthy, but its something that I really think will help anyone who wants to get motivated for the gym, and possibly life in general.

When I was 18 in my senior year of high school, I was 5'4"" and 175 lbs. of out-of-shape-ness. That January, I came to the conclusion that it was time to make a difference in my physique and life mind-set. I decided to get the jump start on my fitness goals through our school's ski trip, which ran from January 21st to January 24th. The plan was to take a bus to Vermont from New Jersey and snowboard all weekend on various mountains. It was my last time on the trip and I was excited to beat the hell out of myself on a mountain.

Now I ask: Do you remember where you were January 21st, 2010? I do. 

I was coming up to a bend, where out of nowhere another skier cut me off. I had no choice but to avoid collision. However, my stop wasn't clean and shot me down the slope *horizontally*. I went off the trail, and hit my right leg on a fallen, dead tree. Instead of hitting my boot, it hit *right above* it, shattering my right leg. After an hour of screaming for help, a respiratory therapist found a scared, raspy-voiced boy. After being rushed to the hospital, and getting these [gnarly X-rays](http://imgur.com/a/8hadQ), and going straight into surgery, I woke up about 17 hours later to find that my leg had 4 screws and a metal rod in it. Now conscious, my surgeon came in to check on me and asked me to wiggle my toes. I wiggled them down successfully, but coming up didn't happen. My surgeon got nervous and, after checking over and over again, I had developed [Compartment Syndrome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002204/). Basically, there is a compartment in our right shin just off to the right that filled with so much fluid, it choked my nerve and killing off a chunk of muscle in my leg (NOTE: I tried taking a picture of this, but couldn't get a clear one at the moment.). To counter the compartment syndrome, they made a six-inch incision on the compartment, releasing the pressure that was destroying my leg. This was my 2nd surgery in 3 days. I do not remember anything of day 4 unfortunately, but on day 5, I figured out why my leg was in so much pain still.

On day 5, my surgeon came in and notified me they had to ""clean my wound"". I was completely baffled,""What the hell do you mean you have to *clean* it?"" And then, I saw it: underneath my splint was a completely open wound that had been sitting there. I saw the muscle and everything. I was in so much pain because the swelling had not settled yet and the incision that was made was unable to be closed in the surgery. 

Fuck my life.

2 more surgeries occured in the following 4 days, but nothing was like the hell I wasn't prepared for on my last night. You see: The doctors were basically feeding me Percoset. I was dependent on them to sleep somewhat soundly, but I hadn't eaten in 4 days and it was making me sick to my stomach. I quit all my narcotic pain meds cold turkey my last night. Welcome to hell night. I endured cold sweats, 4 vomiting fits, 2 panic attacks and 0 hours of sleep. Oh, did I mention I was going into surgery the next day? So no food or water. After vomitting up nothing, being dehydrated, anxiety attacks, cold sweats, and exhaustion for an entire night, I was wheeled into my 5th and final surgery to close that open wound on my leg. 

Thankfully, it was successful.

I woke up from the surgery happy, clean, free of pain and pain meds and eating my first meal in 6 days: spaghetti and meatballs. Absolutely delicious. Afterwards, my mom and I drove back straight from Vermont to New Jersey in one shot, where I had the most delicious burrito of my entire life.

But wait, the story continues. 3 Months later...

I'm finally back in New Jersey, on crutches, with a cast.

After being in a massive, bulky, heavy cast for so long, it was opened to reveal that my right leg was at a 45 degree angle. My surgeons had not rotated my leg back when they put in the metal rod, causing a HUGE problem. If I did not fix it, I would never be able to run again, and a 95% chance of getting arthritis in my knee and hip, as soon as the age of 30. What could I do to fix something like this? 

I had to give consent to another surgeon to re-break my leg, twist it back, and insert a new metal rod into it.

Great. Another surgery. This one, however, was successful after one surgery. It was a clean, one night stay at the hospital and I was on my way.

Fast forward 8 months of physical therapy 4 times a week, and I was able to finally support my own weight successfully without limping, just in time for college!

On my first day of college in september of 2010, I met a kid named Dan. Dan was a well-built kid with beaming confidence and a unique ability to rally everyone to have fun. Perfect best-friend material. He pushed me to start going to the gym with him as soon as I had felt ready. I took the last 3 months of 2010 to get my legs back to where I felt comfortable to lift. 

On January 3rd, 2011, I performed my first squat. It was 60 lbs. I was sore for 3 straight days. Dan, however, performed a 175 lbs. squat. I told him that, one day, he will see me rep that much weight as well.

He held me to it.

I went to the gym with Dan 3 days a week and hung out with him 7 days a week. We went from total strangers to best friends in a matter of months. He was there for a lot of firsts in my life: such as my first time lifting seriously at the gym and including my first time smoking marijuana. We went to tons of concerts and generally just chilled all the time.

After 4 months of lifting, it became a lifestyle change for me. I had lost weight, gained substantial muscle, and gained more confidence than I ever had. The only person I had to thank was Dan.

My squat weight was up to 135 lbs.

At the end of the year, I was excited to be able to hang out with my friend over the summer, but it was postponed. Dan had suffered a seizure back at his home in Pennsylvania which side-lined any driving for him for a while. So in the mean time, I went to the gym rather casually (due to distance and work) and enjoyed some time at home with my friends and family.

No problem though. He recovered over the summer and we hung out again once school started up.

Back at college in September of 2011, me and Dan went right back to our usual way of hanging out all the time. We continued going to the gym and hanging out with all of our old floor mates and friends. 

Everything was completely normal, although my squat had totally plateaued at 150 lbs.

Fast forward. On November 18th, 2011, Do you remember where you were? Because I do.

I had started my internship and I was leaving work at 2:30 P.M. on a rather chilly November afternoon. I had made plans to go to another concert with Dan and mosh all night. But it was interrupted. I received a call from an old floor mate of mine asking if I had heard what happened to Dan. Confused and concerned I asked what happened to him. 

I was informed that he had attended a concert and suffered another seizure afterwards. Complications from the seizure took my friend's life that pervious night.

I honestly cannot put into words how I felt at that moment, nor the weeks and months that followed. It destroyed me from the inside out.

I had entered a serious state of depression. I felt convinced that there was nothing in this life worthwhile. I felt almost suicidal. I sat in my apartment, lethargic, feeling like I'm just waiting for death. I was completely miserable. Days felt like blurs and I was a void of motivation and happiness.

But I couldn't live like this. I knew that this was an insult to Dan's memory and lifestyle. He lived life to the fullest and made sure that he, and everyone around him, was happy. I realized I couldn't just sit here on my couch and feel like I'm just waiting to die.

I got up and started hitting the gym again, harder than I ever did before.

What this comes down to is that on December 18th, 2011, I squated 175 lbs. I had fulfilled the promise I had made to Dan. I was nearly in tears at the gym, by myself, at the squat rack. 

It is the memory and life of my lost friend that I do anything anymore. I knew I had to get up and start living because, at any moment, you could have your life taken from you. He embraced life and ran with it. I cannot tell you how much I miss the kid. It still bothers me months later, but I am stronger because of it. 

I can honestly say I am happy and healthy again. I changed my routine and I go 5 days a week now. My legs are actually MUCH stronger now than they were before my snowboarding accident. I made a promise to myself to live the absolute fullest life I could, because I know that was what Dan would have done.

R.I.P. Dan, you were the best of us.

**TL;DR- I broke my leg snowboarding after wanting to get in shape, took about a year to rebuild the strength back, met my new best friend, and started lifting and getting into the best shape of my life. In November, my friend passed away. His death taught me I could not sit around and just wait for death. I needed to start living. I promised him I would rep 175 lbs. on my squat, and about a month after he passed, I did it.**

Sorry for such a massive text wall, I tried to make it as easy to follow as possible.

EDIT: If anyone has any questions about anything, or holes in detail, I will be more than happy to answer them. However, I am going to sleep soon. But nonetheless, I will answer anything unanswered tomorrow."
qjlx9,5,2012-03-05,A friend's letter to a College Professor..,Vulgotha,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/qjlx9/a_friends_letter_to_a_college_professor/,"I'm new here, but this struck me as the sort of thing Reddit would appreciate. I've been lurking here for a bit, however. 

This is from a very close friend of mine (who I would aptly describe as being a superior specimen of humanity)  to an English Professor at a particular large college in Nebraska. 

I simply had to post this:

""You've made good points and I appreciate your honesty. I try not to be a selfish, egoistic or a merciless person, if I have erred then I have erred. The fact that your willing to tell me how, more or less resolves the issue. Had you not been as definite with me, I would have pushed this further.

The reason for absence to your class specifically was the I worked from 10pm to 6am then would try to sleep as short as possible in order to see a girl between waking and going to your class. I could only see her at that time, because her Parents are fanatic evangelicals and since she contracted a heart illness about 9 months back, they put a prohibition on her seeing me because they are afraid she is going to die and go to hell or something for being with a 'non-believer'. So I had to sneak in during the two days when her Mom wasn't home. Unfortunately I would sometimes fall asleep there, or often she would beg me to stay as we hardly got to see each other. At the end of the day, I had far more passion for being with her, than being in your class. That put the strain on my attendance in your class, so I hope you don't take it personally that I wasn't there, nor that I told you I was 'sick', as I don't really think telling you I was sneaking into an evangelical home to see a fatefully ill ex-girlfriend with religious extremist parents would have been appropriate or believable at the time. So I'm glad you cut me slack on the attendance policy because it was a bit complicated. Even without that aspect however, my attendance would have been lacking. 

The problem is I hate University but I love learning. I hate University exactly for some of the reasons you have stated why my grade was a confusing choice. University favors bureaucracy not industry, it seems more often than not that Professors desire obedience rather than merit, or rather that obedience is confused for merit.  In many classes there are those who work very hard but lack talent, and often they are favored in grading because they have put in so much effort over someone whose raw ability is better, even though their outcome is lesser. The objective always seems muddled to me, is the purpose of a class to improve your basic skill set or to execute the highest degree of dominance over a skill-set regardless of improvement? Is the purpose to 'try hardest' or to 'execute most successfully'?

I have faced this conundrum several times, and luckily I have gotten better at playing the game, but I've never respected it. Perhaps the worst example, was a 3000 level Spanish class I leap-frogged into at my last University, mind you I am a native speaker of Spanish. I recall reading the papers of my 'editing partner' and being unable to understand this caveman imitation of Iberia's most important language. At the end of it however, she got an A and I got a C, despite the vast disparity in the quality of our work. Upon asking the Teacher why, the reasons stated were attendance and that I would just 'turn in assignments' without submitting prior 'outlines' and 'vocabulary search' along with them. At that time I was more detached and cared less, I simply stated to her 'why do I need such things if the point of the class writing papers not doing vocabulary crosswords.' This obviously didn't go well.

I've seen some justice though, I had a Biology professor that refused to accept a research paper from me because the binder was 'unaesthetic' and according to him ""It was clearly stated that an aesthetic cover was part of the assignment.""  I told him plainly that I'm not a 13 year old girl with glue stick and glitter, the point of this class is Biology not getting an art badge in Brownie Scouts. The Teacher disliked me from long before, he confused my dispassion for arrogance and my detachment as an insult. I took it to the Dean, and he found that the Teacher's actions bordered on harassment. In the end, my grade was reversed from a D to an A, mostly because I got the highest grade in the class on the Final.  Ironically, at UNO they didn't accept this Biology credit transfer.

Some might say these 'details' are well founded in industry and that doing an outline has an equivalent in industry. Perhaps, just as when you write a program you need to have supporting documentation. It's not entirely the same thing though, an outline is a supplement to aid in a result but it is a supplement no less, not the core of a project, while documentation is necessary for successful management of a program. If the capricious frivolities in academia do mimic any type of industry, they mimic corporations in over-regulated vertically-oppressed quixotic nations such as the one I am in right now. Here you have to get the social security number of every person you make a sale to,  taxes start a 37% and there is a permit for anything you want to do. Otherwise the police come and throw you in jail for the societal equivalent of academic insubordination. However, these laws only apply to those who are successful enough to launch an enterprise by the book, for the rest of the 80% of the population who try 'really hard', the Government turns a blind eye to their black-market and gives them hand-outs taken from the taxes of the more successful. The reflects quite aptly the situation of intention over result present in academia at large, most commonly found in the Humanities, where the 'details' are largely capriciously invented by Teachers, while in the Sciences they are axioms determined by nature herself.

It's exactly for these reasons, I'm about a hair strand from just quitting college and focusing 150% on getting a job in my field and launching an enterprise. Why should I pay money for a bureaucratic beating? Why should I be chastised for not wanting to participate in class discussions with people who I otherwise wouldn't even speak to otherwise? Do I really gain anything of value from listening to a person so bereft of critical thinking that they give a presentation on why it is 'Christian' to support the 'death penalty' or when I'm forced to write papers supporting social agendas which I thoroughly oppose?  I get nothing from it, just debt, frustration and lost time.

You state that my grade fell to a B due not to attendance but to mere lack of achievement in the 'details' of assignments in which I got A's in. I see reason in that, and I have no reason to believe you docked me points on those assignments simply for absences. I respect that I did not get the points on those assignments and had I not been at Carnaval and then my internship here in Bolivia, I would have conferenced with you before the end of class to have dealt with it. That was my responsibility.

The question however, is do those missed assignments reflect didactism, or are they simply the defects of the sub-conscious impulse to control?  Does the fact that an annotated bibliography lacks 'similarity' clauses change the fact that the paper it was meant to support was well-researched enough to get an A? Does the fact that there was no idea outline drawing, change the fact that a well-organized nebula of ideas did exist in the paper? Was the purpose was to use the crutches that aid in writing in a good paper, or actually write a solid paper? Was the purpose consequence or intention? As far as I can see, you gave me points for 'doing' but docked me points for 'not trying'...to me that is the definition of cognitive dissonance. 

Ultimately, only you know the answer to these questions. At large, it is this sort of introspection that will have to take place before the academic system can cease to decay in the way it has been. In the way that has made me so estranged to it."""

I am going shopping tomorrow and found some stuff I liked but I was hoping a European redditor could look over my choices and let me know if I made good choices or if I am completely off base.  

**Professional:**

I was going to pick up several of [these shirts](http://www.express.com/1mx-fitted-stretch-cotton-shirt-24726-800/control/page/4/show/3/index.pro#jsLink) in some different colors.

I was also planning on picking up a couple of Express's [narrow ties](http://www.express.com/narrow-ties-931/control/show/12/index.cat).

**Casual:**

I was looking at getting a couple pairs of the [Levi's 514 Raw Headbanger Rigid](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=10947235&amp;f=SizeGeneral%2FSQ000002920QS29W+X+30L&amp;fbc=1&amp;lmdn=Size&amp;fbn=null%7C29W+X+30L&amp;).

As for other casual clothes, I am not really sure.  

Thanks a lot for your input!

qmb7o,3,2012-03-07,Life and the unexpected turns of its wheel,YourDirtySlut,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/qmb7o/life_and_the_unexpected_turns_of_its_wheel/,"Before 2010, life for me was the usual suck of someone in their early 20's.  Crappy job, still in school, struggling constantly to make the bills.  Single, horny, and trying to make the best of things.  Every day had been a struggle since I was 15 and first diagnosed with depression and anxiety- like a never ending case of pessimism that I couldn't win again.

Then Aug 2010, I was nearly killed in a head on collision.  Lets just say it COMPLETELY fucked up my life for a whole year.  And not the good way.  My leg and arm were fucked up, so I was in a wheelchair for 2 months.  i couldn't wash myself, cut my own meat, or hell, make a quick run to the bathroom, it took me 15min to finally get up and go take a piss!  I lost my awesome place living with my best friend for cheap rent because I lived in the upstairs.  After 2 months in the wheelchair, I graduated to 2 months on a granny walker with an arm rest.  Fuck going into public with THAT, so i continued with the wheelchair.  Oh yes, I forgot to mention that the car crash happened 2 weeks before the new semester began, and I had surgery a week before.  So I had to deal with tests, homework, physical therapy, occupational therapy, lawyers, and learning how to get around on my own.  I fell once in the parking lot trying to get the wheelchair in my car by myself.  People waited until I fell to help me.

Also during this time, I became very depressed, no matter how stoned I was on pain pills.  You realize who your true friends are in situations like this.  I basically realized I only had 2 good friends and a loyal boyfriend.  It devastated me.  People were willing to say ""get well soon!"" but not come visit me during the 4 months I was pretty much trapped in my parents' basement.

Following my physical recovery, I developed even worse anxiety and depression.  I became the psycho needy girlfriend who NO ONE likes.  And after 3 years, I had to be put back on medication just to be able to deal with the crap that was my life.  Once my medication got stabilized, and I felt normal, I realized I was in an abusive relationship.  My (now ex) boyfriend made regular comments about my weight and even told me I was fat a few days before valentines day.  I had put 10lb on while I was in the wheelchair.  And as soon as I started walking again, he expected me to go out and lose weight on my own while he stayed in doors and watched video games.

Then things began to change.  I finally left my boyfriend after he fucked me over yet another time, and ended up with this GORGEOUS guy (like way out of my league gorgeous) who thought I was just stunning and perfect the way I was.  So I started working out, because it was a different sort of motivation.

Shortly after I met him, I FINALLY got the settlement I had waited a year and a half for.  During the wait I had planned, planned, planned, and been stuck with the frustrating hope.  Now I got to make all my dreams come true :)

My folks finally caved and let me finally get a dog, so I got a $3,000 puppy (blue and white olde english bulldogge) on Christmas and she has been the light of my life.  This Saturday my parents, best friend (one of the 2 who was actually there for me after the crash), and I are leaving for a cruise.  I paid for their plane tickets and rooms on the ship for a week long cruise in the western carribean as a thank you for being there for me.  I got a new car- until now i had always driven pieces of shit that required constant monitoring so I didn't blow up.  I redid my bedroom at my parents' so I could stop sleeping in a bunkbed, lol.  I got a new wardrobe so i didn't have to keep wearing clothes from middle school (I'm 25).  And this summer I am taking an adventure of a lifetime!  

Before the crash I would have never even considered it, but this late May I am leaving for California to do a 3 month internship.  And me and the pooch are driving (from Minnesota).  I've never been past the dakotas western wise, so I am going to make as many stops as possible.  I get to finally see the grand canyon :)  It will just be me and the dog, doing whatever the hell we want, and capturing it all with my camera.

So, I guess, just remember.  No matter how shitty things can get, and they can get really fucking shitty, they always get better.  My arm and ankle will never be the same, I'll never play softball or run a marathon, but there are other things I CAN say I got to do :)

TL;DR- Almost died in car wreck, life really hit rock bottom, now it's at its peak a year and a half later."

Since it is marketing, I was going to try and make some sample ads. Except I don't have a camera, models, a studio, etc, so any ads I whip up will have to be drawn on the computer.

I have a Macbook Pro that runs Lion and Windows 7. I think I need some vector drawing software? Which one's the best? Is it possible to take stock photos and edit them to fit my design, so it looks photographic and realistic, and not something I drew?

Basically I'd like my samples to turn out something like this: http://media02.hongkiat.com/creative-ads/glassex-cleaner.jpg

Simple, creative, and gets the point across. One idea I have in mind involves the smoke from a cigarette writing a word in a beautiful, smokey font. How could I go about doing that?

Yeah, I'm completely clueless, but I'm going to give it a try."
ql5iw,1,2012-03-06,WTF New York??,[deleted],nyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/ql5iw/wtf_new_york/,"I just want to rant for a moment:

I decided to enlist in the Marine Corps in 2006, and I loved every minute of it. It literally turned my life around... I used to do absolutely nothing, most of every day. I really hated myself, and I tried to make sure everyone around me suffered as well. 
I enlisted out of a last-ditch effort to change things in my life... and I'm the first one to admit I enlisted at the right time. It was 2006, so the housing boom created great incentives for anyone joining the military, so I got a 10k Bonus once I completed RIP. But I got out in 2010, and decided to use the new GI Bill to go back to school. I'm at NYU, and I literally CANNOT GIVE MY WORK AWAY. I will interview with companies, and tell them straightforward that because of the GI Bill and all that it's given me, I am willing to work for them for free, just to gain civilian work experience, I can be classified as an 'unpaid intern'. I am 27. This isn't a pride issue, because I am literally trying to give my labor away for FREE. But most companies tell me I am either a)too old, or b)not a 'cultural fit' for their junior member employment pool. I understand that it's difficult to imagine someone who wants to work full time while they are going to school, but you have to imagine what kind of environment I am coming from. I am used to working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for months at a time. I have spent my life identifying who I am as what I do. When I don't have a purpose, I feel like I'm worthless. I try and keep this desperation from my interviews, but it is difficult to play hard to get when I so desperately want to work, and validate my identity. I understand that the job market in NYC is oversaturated with qualified graduates, and degrees that go unused. But To tell me that I can't shovel dirt at a construction site for minimum wage because I have too much experience fucking kills me. Combat Vets aren't the poisoned candy that the media leads you to believe we are. We are, and I believe I can generalize here, hard working, loyal, and above all we fucking love to accomplish things.

no offense meant to all those who support us, I fucking love you, and I know you are out there. IAVA.org is an amazing organization who deserves more great publicity than they get."

qnppg,1,2012-03-08,"Trying to get over past events, but difficult when they link to present ones with a side of depression",Hirosakamoto,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qnppg/trying_to_get_over_past_events_but_difficult_when/,"Hey there everyone. I have been in a relationship with my fiancee for about 4 and a half years, and she is a really outgoing person and is a theater member. 

Note whenever I am saying party, she doesnt get drunk (maybe 1 time a year). 

Currently I am trying to not get upset over something, but is coming to be near impossible.
Back story:

We go to 2 different colleges, and during one of the nights she was at a friends party she offered to show 2 of the guests where they would be staying (walking them just to the building). One of them decided that he would grab her, kiss her and ask if she wanted to go upstairs with him. As I stated, she is outgoing and pretty oblivious. She was giving him mixed signals due to being just nice, such as hugging both of them goodbye. She told me the night after it happened, but I was still upset that she put herself in the situation. Told her to be more careful.

Fast forward a year later, I was up at her school and met some of her guy friends she parties with. One of these guys a week later runs into her in the stairwell after they both had drank and she hugged him goodbye (once again...) and he kissed her..she didnt say anything and just walked away. She did not tell me for a week, when i came up to see her. She thought hugging him was fine because he was a friend and knew she was engaged (met me already). I have huge trust issues with her guy friends, but i just ""deal with it"" in order for her to be happy and hang out with her friends. She told me and cried for hours right after I just told her I would try and be more trusting with her guy friends...as in 10 seconds after I said it. I went over to his room, punched him in the gut, told him to stay the fuck away from her and not talk to her again, and told her she really needs to stop being so familiar with other guys. 

This last month I had a 2fer. I found out her normal room she drinks with her friends happens to be his room, but I can confirm that he does not talk to her and vice-versa. It was just she didnt think to tell me for 7 months that he lived in the room, seeing as how they dont talk she didnt think it was a big deal. ALSO she got the lead role in a play, in which she has to kiss the male lead, and not just on stage, during every practice for 2 months as well, once every time they go through that scene, 3-4 rehearsals a week. She did not know about this when she auditioned.

My blood still boils every time I think of these events. I am trying to get over them, but by the time I am about to another related problem pops up. It has helped that she seems immensely remorseful and sorry every time something has happened and she said the last thing she wants to do is hurt me in any way. She was going to turn down her part in the play but I told her not to otherwise I knew she would resent me for it, even though I do resent the fact she kisses another guy for her part, I just....deal with it.

I feel as if something special is being taken away from me. It is something that only me and her do. We talk a lot how ""you are mine! and I am yours!"" Jokingly and cute-like. She has been my 1 and only gf, she took my first everything. Other guys kissing her just drains me whenever I think about it, and this roll she got is just the last push I needed before I started getting really upset over it and realized it. I don't know of any method other than just bottling it up and ""dealing with it"", as it is the main way I got through my school years. 

We did discuss it, and I told her pretty much what I posted here about having it feel like it was taking away part of what was ours. I am not a confident man by any means anymore. I got diagnosed with T1 diabetes my freshman semester in college, and I lost all of my muscle mass in the hospital. I have had issues working out sense, and I still live with my parents since I work a no-pay internship for my last semester. I also do not get to see her but like once MAYBE twice every month since we both lack cars. The things we do together that are ours, was pretty much my last salvation when it came to my confidence.....

Any advice guys? I am getting pretty damn depressed with this coupled with other things. I figure things will be better once I am able to move out and start a career and she moves in with me so we can actually see each other. I have complete trust in her, I know she hasnt cheated on me...I have too many eyes and ears on her campus to know otherwise. I just fear I will hit in the face with a big ol' blob of depression. "

I would love to work in Chicago, for a paid internship, this upcoming summer. I hail from Ann Arbor, MI (booo, pun, for those into college football); I just created [a rather wordy post, complete with a little tl;dr](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagojobs/comments/qn2u0/for_hireexperienced_computer_scientistengineer/) on [/r/chicagojobs](/r/chicagojobs) in the hopes of finding something.

While that goes on, I figure I'll talk to people in the community, see if I can get something started. My last internship took place in Austin, Texas, and in the interest of full disclosure, I would never have gotten that job had startups not passed my resume between each other until one finally jumped on me. I'd love for something similar: to network myself into Chicago and get an opportunity.

Any tips? Tricks? Advice? People you think I should know? People you know I should know? I'd welcome whatever you can give me."

----------

Currently a junior in the University of Michigan's College of Engineering. Currently double-majoring in CS/CE, because I enjoy both and at this point, I feel two degrees might help me stand out more in the post-college job market. Have covered lots of core classes in both degrees. Looking for a summer internship, potentially at a startup, as I really enjoyed my previous experience and how casual it was. I also actually enjoy dressing formal (part of why Chicago attracts me is it's fashion-style from the Mile and the financial district), so I can go either way.

I've got quite some experience under my belt -- my first computing job was working for the University of Michigan under their EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) department, on developing a C-based Windows driver (NDIS, involving network transmissions and the OSI model -- I completed two semesters of Cisco's Networking Academy) for a software-defined radio, developed by Microsoft Research. That was two summers ago.

My second (last summer) was working for a large startup in Austin, Texas, doing front/back-end web development. I became fairly proficient in C# ASP.NET MVC dev; and learned how to incorporate multiple API's, and existing in-house systems and the like. I learned how to do revision control (for the previous job, I created my own style of revision control involving Dropbox, and it was sloppy compared to, say, Git -- something which, by the way, I use in my programming projects for college all the time, now). Also learned how to participate in the Agile style of code/management. Would love to discuss this in detail with potential employers.

In my spare time, I've written scripts to make my Macbook embed music information from nearly any client on the desktop, little plugins for Adium (an AIM/everything else client), and things like that. I've also written short programs to help my workload. More notably, for college, I have written sorting algorithms/breadth &amp; depth searches, started to learn how to properly hash, and, for the extra push to get a good grade in a prior class, taught myself basic Android development and wrote my own app.

To tell it to you straight: I don't particularly like doing front-end development, and I LOVE back-end dev. Javascript is cool and all, and learning good object-oriented programming was really beneficial overall, but writing raw HTML was...annoying at best. The company I worked for admitted willfully that my distaste stemmed from the fact that the site I was assigned was created rather sloppily from another company, and I had to work around what I was given, but regardless. If I am paid well enough, I'll happily do front-end work, but for the record, I prefer things that are C#/C++/C based. I just enjoy that language set; it makes sense to me.

**Code samples and a resume happily available upon request, as are more details. I'd love to talk about this all at-length. Whatever opportunities Reddit can find for me, I will pursue.**

**Thank you for your time, I hope to hear from you all sometime soon.**"

Last year, I want to say around this time, my boyfriend and I met a girl at a party. We decided to try a threesome. I don't consider myself bisexual, I am just willing to do anything he asks me to. The experience went as well as one could hope for and we even meet again. Fast forward a few weeks later. My boyfriend and I break up. Now I'm not sure what exactly happened after we broke up, but a month later I (this is shameful to admit) pretty much begged for him back. He just meant too much to me. In the month we had broken up, he hooked back up with the girl from our threesome at least once. I don't want to ask him about any more nights, I just can't think about it. I do trust that he would tell me the truth. We got back together, everything was sorted out and it's been great since. Recently we've started discussing the possibility of a ring.

**This is where I need help**

The past month or so, he has begun texting/im'ing this girl quite a lot. I've been very stressed out from work and he's noticed this. It's been tense. It's gotten to the point where it's almost constant contact between him and this girl. I've only gotten to peek at what they've been saying once or twice and it was all pretty dry stuff. Just talking about school/work/what they're eating. I am usual very level-headed but there's just something about this girl that gives me pangs (yes! PANGS!) of jealousy everytime I hear his phone buzz. This is made even worse by the fact my boyfriend is going to be leaving for an internship 250 miles away. There won't be much time for visits because we both work full-time. It is very apparent that I'm going to miss him more than he misses me.

I want to know, is it time to move on? I have never felt so strongly about someone, and because of this I am trepidatious. I want to trust him, and I know it probably is idle chatter. However, It's a constant stream. It only stops at night. I know it's going to get worse when he leaves, and I worry that he's going to drop me all together. Should I leave now before I get hurt?"

Cold science. Hannah had the results from the failed experiment in her hands. Small consolation this black and white document would further her quest: the grail of the human cognitive sciences. She wanted to finally know, in concrete form, what motivated people. 

She approved David's application for the new trials because he had agreed to secrecy. And because he was probably the only man she would ever have sex with. She liked him. He destroyed the muggers that attacked her in the city. Healed now, his scar from one of the attackers left a faint line from his left eye to the corner of his tanned mouth. *Blue sky to sand*. Her vision glazed over and she remembered his scent of salt and cedar.

She read her notes. *People can save others' lives through self sacrifice. People can kill millions of other people in a blink. Human existence itself relies on the actions of every person on this planet, to whatever end...*

In her spare time she wrote reports, researched the latest breakthroughs in medicine, and purchased bits of history. The time flew by as the brown packages arrived at her door. She was closer to realizing her dreams. The results were going to be fantastic. 

She was going to be rich. The new drug that was privately funded was hers only if she had agreed to the strict confidential agreement. Hannah had to make the best of it. She had the finest bio-metric measuring devices, cameras, and computer systems. *This was going to be easy* she reassured herself.

She had sway and tenure, and could always count on getting the full attention of the faculty. It had been no problem setting her experiment in motion. Her beauty had the right flaw that taunted perfection, and it made her approachable to a fault. Even the blind followed her everywhere. Everywhere except where she was going next. With David.



                                          David

David was on time for the first time in his life. He loved Hannah. He forgot things with her. 

Things he didn't want to remember. 

He blackmailed doctors tied up with black market medicine. Their kickback money came in handy for college but he never forgot how he achieved his vaulted credentials. There was a time during internship he was going to open a clinic in some great city. As a healer, he would 
improve the lives of all who came to him. Then he realized the dark part of himself that learned pharma traffic routes, fronts, and contacts had always been there, and was just waiting for the right opportunity. 

This trial with Hannah was a means to an end. A way to satisfy, and channel, his less than desirable urges toward something good. He wanted Hannah on her terms. 

David felt strong again. He finished his final set of body weight exercises two nights ago. Well before he would see her. He was happy to taper off before *this* event.


                                       The Trial


The wing harboring Hannah's experiment room hadn't been used before. *Neither have I* she 

mused, *Odd*. Her eyes dotted purple, the blue mixing with the last red light of day through her lace office curtain. She raised from her desk and looked out of her open window. A breeze delivered David's aroma to her nose. Everything was in place and she was ready to begin.

She strolled down the hall to the control room. Unlocking the door to the room she was going to use for her experiments, she paused. Everything was new and gleamed, having been set up as a clean room. It was a completely controlled environment: optimum regulated oxygen supply, humidity, temperature, and light. She lay on the bed. The sheets were handmade Chinese silk, unused from some royal family in China's opulent past. She walked back out to the hall - didn't want to seem *too* eager today. She locked the door back, and returned to her office.



David arrived at the agreed time.
""Did you take the pill?"" she queried.
""Yes.""
""Well then, you first."" She unlocked the door, and he walked in before her. Closing the door caused an echo throughout the complex.
David's eyes widened. 
""It's quiet.""
""Is that okay?"" She attempted a frown but nothing could hide her smile. It was wide and full. 

She closed her lips around her nervous expression, straightening her shoulders. She was 5'8"" tall, but appeared much taller. Her body filled the artists' proportion and her legs were long.
""How are you? Does the sensory perception throw you off at all?"" She quizzed. 
He reached out and touched her shoulder with his right hand, then her other shoulder with his left. He looked into her eyes, and tilted his head slightly to match her hug indicating posture.  

Pulling her close, David glanced at her mouth, lowered his head and pressed his lips into hers. She breathed in sharply, waited for a drifting second, then slowly exhaled. Her perfume, some Hawaiian flower, filled his mind. She led him to the bed. 

Undressing in the dim golden light the curved and lined shadows danced on their bodies. It looked like a fire was burning somewhere in the room, and the glow basked them in radiance. 

Laying down he reached out and touched her before she was completely on the bed. She responded by shifting under him. He pushed up, his arms bending then straightening over her. 

He put each hand flat on the bed beside her elbows. He lowered himself on her, feeling himself part her. He was aware of the lack of sensation the pill was supposed to cause. It was working. He only felt the slightest presence of something there, around him.

She watched David and slid her hands down his sides. He put some of his weight on her, testing her, and she felt the ridges of his muscles against her thighs. He moved slowly around, and up and down as he kissed her. His stomach touched hers which set off an electric sensation, like a butterfly on the back of her hand. Then she felt pressure.  

He felt minimal pressure, but no warmth and no tingling or pleasure. Well, at least nothing physical. He wondered at that revelation. The pill was designed to remove all but the barest of sensations. He could believe he was going to the bathroom if he didn't see her and know what he was doing. If he wasn't lost in her somehow.

""What is it like?"" She said between deep breaths. 
""It is nice. *You* are nice. The physical effects are...not really there, though.""
He felt completely solid to her. Everything she was feeling promised to push her over some edge of pleasure she had never felt before. Every move he made she met with enthusiasm, pushing against him harder and faster with his penetrations. Somehow it seemed he managed 
to open her wider and deeper with each gentle push. And with every pull, her muscle constrictions tried to keep him in her. He moved so fast now that she was having one continuous sensation of pressure and motion and warmth. The sensation increased making her quiver. She grabbed him and pulled him in, their bodies finding their own rhythm. She let it take her over. She was completely filled with him at every thrust. 

It was what she desired now. In one surprising, soft motion, her legs tensed. She was consumed with contractions and pleasure. She opened her legs wider and grabbed the back of his legs to pull him in, again and again. Waves of pleasure rose to wash over her, tickling warmth caressed her body. She felt him continue and she wanted more. 
""I don't feel tired."" he pleaded with his topaz eyes. ""I can't feel anything, but I don't want to stop. You are amazing!""
She slowed him down and wrapped her legs around his back, resting on the lines of his hips. 
""I.. love you."" he said.
She raised her hands to her chest sliding them over her firm nipples, then wrapped her fingers in his hair. His mouth was willingly lead to her breasts, where he kissed her softly. Her prim points became firmer with every touch. He put one after the other into his mouth and she pleasantly realized his tongue was much hotter than his lips. 
""Can you feel it?"" she begged. 
""No. I can't stop though. I won't stop. I will have more of you. I am letting you go wherever you want with me, and I will know you completely."" 
She felt the blood rush to her head and was taken to a place she had never been before: a valley, a rushing sensation, rising to a peak of clear euphoria. Her body was still. There was an unending feeling of release mixed with the deepest relaxation.
Looking into her eyes, parting his lips, he spoke softly,
""I have you. I could not feel anything familiar I felt in the past, yet there was something there. Something with you that I couldn't pull away from. I felt driven."" 
Hannah moved her lips slowly and eased his mind.
""I'm not worried about the results right now. I know the computers have the numbers and will corroborate my research. How about you?""
""I'm free tomorrow."" He bared his teeth that glowed in the dim light. 

Hannah took one last, lingering look at him laying next to her before she would get up to leave. 
""Sex sells. Tomorrow, no pill, Mr. bittersweet."""
qq960,1,2012-03-10,I told her I couldn't do it anymore...,JSlasha88,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/qq960/i_told_her_i_couldnt_do_it_anymore/,"So, long story short, I met a girl back home in Upstate NY last November, and we fell for each other pretty fast despite being from pretty different backgrounds and viewpoints on a lot of things. Around mid-December I got offered an amazing nine-month internship with a professional sports team in FL, something that I knew I couldn't pass up, because it could give me an actual real job and career sometime down the road.

So basically we tried the long-distance thing, but after two months, I couldn't take it anymore. The problem? She pretty much smothered me. We did everything you'd think would help - FaceTiming pretty much every night, texting/emailing during the day. The issue was that she doesn't have a lot going on in her life outside of a boring job, so she wanted to text and email me ALL day long. I was pretty much giving her the play-by-play of my life from 1300 miles away, and I got tired of it. She would get antsy if she didn't hear back immediately from me, and would usually jump to horrible conclusions and assume the worst. For example, if we were texting and all of a sudden my parents called and I didn't get back to her for 30 minutes, she would send me like 3 more texts asking what I was doing and if I didn't want to talk anymore.

I guess the bottom line was that this whole thing down here is like a big new adventure for me, and I'm working like 60-70 hours per week, which gives a very tiny amount of free time at the end of the day. And I just got to a point where I couldn't justify spending all that free time in constant communication with her. I felt like I was constantly answering to her.

Of course, I tried to explain this to her and logically spell out why we needed to slow it down, but she was like...1000mph running on emotions, and of course was unable to process my very well-explained, rational opinion.

Has anyone else ever felt like this? I feel really bad for ending it, but my heart just wasn't in it anymore.

TL/DR: My long-distance girl, who I had casually dated for two months prior to moving, smothered me by being extremely insecure and needy.

Patrick is upset about people who pretend to want to help. We talk about upcoming Texas and New York City meetups and shows. Creepy Bill from MN proves why he will never be an intern for the show, despite his undying dedication.

Many of them require such intricate machinations that I don't think they could be covered up for so long, or would require more competence from more people than I'm willing to credit the human race with.

That said, the past day or so, it's like I've been pulled into a rabbit hole, and little bits and pieces of things I've seen lately are starting to create an ominous picture. And the scariest part (to me) is that it doesn't require that complex of a scheme... at all...

Alright, I really have a strong intuition that this Kony 2012 thing is a distraction for some bigger story.

But I really feel like there's a major cover-up going on with this ""campaign."" At first, I felt like it might be a political candidate trying to draw attention away from Super-Tuesday or something moderately tame like that.

Unfortunately, I'm starting to feel like that would be... er... simpler than the real story. Although the political aspect of calling it ""Kony 2012"" and releasing it on Super-Tuesday (technically it was released Monday) have a strong psychological effect (it's essentially using very basic priming to get it stuck in their heads), I now truly think that that timing is ONLY to use that priming.

Without going into all of the criticism of Invisible Children (which are numerous and mostly valid... though I will maintain that there's at least an argument that the ""filmmaking budget,"" while separate from the program budgets, could be considered a ""program"" because it's raising awareness... I'm not sure that that argument is strictly ethically *correct*, but nonetheless...), I'm very interested in one person in particular.

**Ben Keesey**

Keesey is the Executive Director and CEO of IC. What first drew me to start looking into him was that he IS the top of the company, yet I haven't seen his name in ANY of the media rebuttals. So, I started poking around publicly available records on the internet.

At first, I had no idea what I was looking for. I tried to find any tie between the FBI and Keesey or IC. I couldn't turn up a direct connection, but then I found something rather startling on [Keesey's Link'dIn page](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-keesey/4/b19/24a). He leap frogs from an investment banking company, to a management consultant firm, straight to IC. It's not an entirely unexpected career path, but it's a bit unusual to move into a high-capital non-profit after a couple internships and to build it up in less than five years.

My working theory is that Keesey made some connection at [Brentwood](http://www.brentwood.com/) that took him to [Deloitte](http://www.deloitte.com/) (which does some high up business in Africa... a brief search turned up [this](http://www.techzim.co.zw/tag/deloitte/)... granted it's Zimbabwe and not Uganda, and that they're not really even that close... but I don't remember if I heard that the LRA had been in Zimbabwe or something...) which set up IC as a media front for some of their less scrupulous actions. Granted, it's only intuition and a working theory.

Here's where I need /r/Conspiracy. I need help to sort out all this information, to follow the thread and see if it leads somewhere. I keep coming back to the word ""Evangelical"" too... If Keesey has a connection, I strongly feel it will be church/evangelical related. I'm not so good at all this, but it's your bread and butter. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but better to be proven wrong than to have never said anything at all."
qrzt0,1,2012-03-11,Am I cray cray?  Need moral support.,magenta_panda,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qrzt0/am_i_cray_cray_need_moral_support/,"Warning: wall of text.

I am currently depressed.  Let me explain how I fell into the underbelly of darkness.  

In May 2008, I moved back into my parent's house from college.  I decided that it was for the best to save money, and I had an internship.  I had recently gained a bit of weight because I was unhappy in a relationship.  Eventually we broke up, and this coincided with me moving back into my parent's house.  I decided to diet to lose the weight.  My mother was more than thrilled to help me.  We cooked together, and I started going to the gym more often.  I asked her to help me.  But it started becoming demeaning when she would walk into the living room, and ask why I wasn't at the gym.  I felt worse when one day, she became angry when I ate too many frozen raspberries after dinner.  I continued seeing my friends at this point, which meant that I ate with them.  I remember becoming upset why I wasn't losing weight at a quicker pace, when my mom pointed out that my friends were not exactly the healthiest eaters.  She recommended that I stop seeing them because I would continue my old habits with them.

After a few months, I lost a dramatic amount of weight.  I went to the gym more frequently.  My diet became much more restricted and then I decided it was time to cut down my portions.  My mom laughed at me when I cut my food portions in half, and called me her little rabbit.  In response, I said ""Don't fuck with me.  Whenever I am in the kitchen, no one can enter"".  Then on, my parents obeyed this rule.  

The last time I hung out with one of my friends from high school, she called me ""skinny bitch"" the whole time.  Some of my friends did not accept me for being thinner.  I did what my Mom suggested.  Goodbye socialization! 

In the meanwhile, I was losing more and more weight.  In November, I reached 105 lbs.  I am 5' 7.5"".  I am female, and this was not my lowest adult weight.  

From 2008 to September 2011, I was anorexic.  I learned all of the tricks to not let anyone know.  I did not spend more than a few hours at a time with anyone.  I did not like eating with people, and tried to avoid it as much as possible.  I went to the gym for 2 hours everyday.  

One of the worst points came in 2010 when my sister's family came to visit.  I was reclusive.  I had locks installed on my office and bedroom doors so I could hide food in the trash.  I told everyone I was vegetarian so I couldn't eat with them.  

During 2008-2011, my Mom talked to me a few times saying that I was a little underweight, and it would be okay if I gained a bit of weight.  But at the same time, she told me that ""while you can always get a job, you have one body and you take care of it.  Men only like women who take care of themselves.  Look at how may fat girls there are.  Men don't want them.""  She added fuel to my fire.  I also remember Christmas 2008 when I was supposed to go to my family dinner.  I protested that the dinner food did not agreed with my diet, and my Mom's response was ""act like model.  Push around your peas, and talk a lot"".  I did not go, and neither did my parents.  The last time I ate a family meal was 2008.  During my anorexia, my Mom bought my food.  I gave her shopping lists and demanded that she buy crazy amounts for fruits and vegetables (the majority of my diet) so I would always have extras stocked in the house.  And she did.  She was so proud that I was skinny and told me that I was special because there are many girls like me.  She said I should consider modelling.

I feel angry at myself more than anything for spiraling into crazzzzziness.  I feel angry at my Mom. My Dad was not any better... during the summer of 2011 he used to torment me.  He would always yell at me ""did you remember to eat up?"" or ""did you eat?"" or ""are you anorexic?"" when I left for the gym.

In spring 2011, I went to the extreme.  I estimate my lowest weight at around 85 lbs.  I had a person in the street yell at me ""eat something girl!"".  My gym demanded that I retrieve a doctor's note.  I did and the note said I was okay for moderate exercise.  My gym demanded that I get another doctor's note saying that I could do regular intense exercise.  I got another note.  My manager at work called a meeting with HR and me to discuss my weight loss.  He wanted me to get help.  However it was a contract job that ended 1 month after that meeting.  Afterwards, I decided I wanted my life back.  I stopped doing activities which I loved.  I decided to move away, and I did.  

Fast forward about 6 months to now, when I tried to recover I got a new eating disorder: binge eating!  I am now overweight.  At times, I am suicidal.  I want a normal fulfilling life but I do not know if it's in the cards for me.  When I started eating again, a flood of emotions came over me.  I realized that no one really gives a fuck about me.  As long as I do a good job at work, no one knows my secret.  They think I am normal.  I used to be a great person.  Now, I'm nada.  No one will ever love me for who I am.  Because there is nothing left.  My parents and my sister, the closest people to me, I do not respect anymore.  I am afraid that I am going to become old, and even with all of my freedom and financial independence, I will never be happy.  I don't how I will ever have a boyfriend again.  I haven't worn a tank top in public since 2008.  (The last time I did I remember the disgusted faces in the gym).  My body issues are so bad that I can't stand it when people touch me.  When I was skinny, my guy friend rated me a 9.5.  Now, I'm probably a 5.  I like to say that looks do not matter, and I want to believe it so badly but I can't.  People treated me so differently when I was skinny.       

I want to believe that I can get better, but it's hard when I feel so unloved.  And I live on my own, and I need some help installing a few things in my apartment but I hate being in private places with others so I haven't received the help that I need.

Like I said earlier, I am pretty depressed.  The only high point in my life is my career.  I am amazed at how I compartmentalize my successful work life with my shitty personal life.  I am seeing a therapist once a week after work.  I am trying, but deep down I feel that I do not deserve love.  That I am invalid because I am fat (which I have never been in my life up until now).

And why I am posting this online?  Because it feels good to tell the story as a cautionary tale.  Because I am desperately seeking hope. Because the only other person that knows this story is my therapist.  

One day, I want to be honest. I want a close friend.  I want to trust them with the truth.    

Has anyone reading this experienced something similar? "

Over the pat year I've become so fucking unmotivated I just hate myself. I've started smoking a lot of weed which I feel gets in the way of my academic success. I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me, I used to be disciplined and used to get whatever shit to be done, done. Now I just procrastinate like a bitch and it's really screwing me over. To be clear, my college is about 25 minutes away so I commute. I have no friends few friends at college that I never hand out with so I'm at home most of the time and I've filled that void with pot. 

I'm taking the hardest accounting class of my life and I've not started studying for my huge midterm on wednesday. The class is comprised of 2 midterms and a paper and I'm probably going to get a D or an F on the test this wednesday which will probably cause me to fail the class. Something is wrong with me.

I feel like he is being selfish and not being considerate of how I feel and how much I miss him. He says he misses me too, but it seems like he just wants to be away from me. It seems like he just wants to do what he wants and I have to wait around to spend time with him when he feels like it. Am I being crazy reddit?"

Background 
--

---

I started college with no real goals or knowledge as to what I wanted to do. I love computer science and programming, so I started a degree at Lawrence Technological University in Michigan for Computer Science and Mathematics, but a life tragedy happened at the end of my first semester in college and I never really picked myself up.

Now after 3 years of basically sitting in the back of the classroom listening and not really participating I've decided that my programming hobby isn't going to make a very enjoyable career and I want to take what I've learned so far and steer that down the path to become an actuary.

My friend recommended this profession based on the fact that he had come down a similar path and even completed a degree in Mathematics at LTU. The degree itself is essentially worthless which has me gritting my teeth at how stupid I was as a youth to just blindly follow a high school friend to this expensive shill.

Foreground
--

---

Being a third year I have most of my mathematics done. I stopped at partial differential equations because at that point I didn't even know why I was getting out of bed in the morning.

What I really want to do is find a university that I can study to get into this summer or fall, but my GPA is a miserable 2.4 (I think) and no university will probably accept that. I can probably go to a community college to start some college level financial classes, but I don't really know what I'll need to complete a degree with my accumulated 52 credit hours as it stands.

I've disowned the university, but I'm open to completing the degree there if that is my only choice. It is very expensive and I really cannot afford to go there anymore (10k per semester).

I don't know of any universities with actuary programs near me, but I'm willing to relocate to finish school. I have a job and I'm sure I can find another one if I need to relocate.

So any advice?

---

I want to thank everyone for giving me their opinions.

So now I have compiled a list of what I will try to do:

* Finish major in comp sci and started on exams.
* Market myself for IT work and do some data mining.
* Figure out how internships and scholarships work."

One is getting married and moving to be near her fiance's children and my other friend got an incredible internship that is near her hometown. 

After my sister moved out in '96, my two brothers have both moved away, and then all of my best friends have moved away for educational or job opportunities and put down roots and haven't returned. I have friends in Alaska, Nashville, Eastern Washington, Chicago and two are in Europe. Now I can add Salt Lake City and Phoenix to that list. None of them are likely to come back, most have put down roots.  

The only support I have is my parents, but they are very negative and toxic people. My parents love my daughter a lot, but my mother is morbidly obese and a borderline hoarder. My dad is...unreliable. My husband and I have been separated since July, and while we are friendly we are not friends. 

Mostly I'm worried for my daughter. My parents moved up to the Seattle area when my siblings were little, and they never could quite break into any sort of social community/group. I was a very lonely child, my siblings were very dear to me. I followed their example and moved away to chicago for my freshman year of college but my experience was awful.  I would've moved home immediately but my parents refused to let me come home. When I did come home, I married pretty quickly to the first guy I met back home. I never made many new friends after moving home, and now the two girls who I've been abke to befriend are leaving. They are both people I wanted to be in my daughter's life as role models and women she could rely on. I have multiple sclerosis, so I want to have people who love my daughter and that she could turn to if I were ever to be incapacitated.  

I've toyed with the idea of finding co-housing or an eco-village to move into. It seems kinda risky, and most co-housing communities would be way too expensive for me to afford. 

I don't really have a question, or anything to say, I'm just tired of being left behind by everyone on their way to bigger and better things. I'm not the greatest at meeting people, and I'm naturally more introverted. Socially I am very normal, but I've always been better with fewer, more intimate friendships. I don't want my daughter to be lonely like I was growing up. I want her to feel secure and confident and to have some sort of community that is static and reliable. I am helpless to provide that for her, and it makes me so sad. "
qsncq,1,2012-03-12,Collapse of an abusive 8-year friendship,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/qsncq/collapse_of_an_abusive_8year_friendship/,"(This is a bit of a novel -- sorry.)
This is too long to fit in one post, so I’m putting the TL;DR at the top.  The rest of the story is in comments:
**TL;DR** I went to undergrand and then grad school with a guy who I didn't know before college.  He was an opiate addict.  I went along with this friendship for years and years as he gradually, but then quickly, entered a downward spiral.  Shit hit the fan this year when he stole thousands of dollars from me.  I saw this coming for years and yet continued to trust him.  Finally, last week I contacted his sibling and his family intervened, yanked him out of grad school and sent him to rehab.  

Story (Part 1):
I met him the very first day I moved into my freshman dorm at our non-prestigious public university.  I was 18, had just moved over 1000 miles away from my small bedroom community hometown, and I was looking to make new friends.  About half of the residents on this floor had the same prestigious scholarship that I had, so I was sure I'd make some great new friends who were also really smart.  He was the first.  At that time, I was a closeted gay kid and he was an attractive, outgoing, and athletic guy who had also just moved in from across the country.  Of course I was naturally drawn to his looks and personality, although he has always been 100% straight and I knew I'd never get with him -- he would always just be a friend, and I was fine with this.  But throughout the eight years we were friends, I allowed my feelings for him to override every instinct I would otherwise have about a person, and allowed him to gradually become more and more of an abusive, troubled person, a person who has been nothing but a bad influence on my life.  

As undergrad progressed, he was one of my very tight, six-guy group of close friends, all of whom lived on this same dorm floor when we were freshmen.  Freshman year was a blast -- we had many nights of quiet drinking in dorm rooms to not draw RA attention, went to many house parties, smoked a few trees, and yet everyone still went to most of their classes and got good grades.  He found a local girlfriend (another freshman who got us access to many off-campus parties) during the first week of classes.  They dated for two years, and she bore the brunt of most of his rather erratic mood swings and semi-irresponsible behavior.  

At first, his irresponsibility was minor -- things like bad driving, never cleaning his room, and lots of underage drinking, but these habits were not unusual for a freshman guy and generally not a concern.  He also took a serving job at some chain restaurant in town, made good tips, and held that job down for the duration of freshman year.  From outward appearances, he was a successful person who was just enjoying college.  He even played some college sports, mostly as a walk-on player, or as a practice squad member or something like that.  

See, he had been a big athlete in high school and had got injured at one point and evidently once got prescribed vicodin or percocet.  By the day we first met, he was already a small-time opiate abuser.  He kept this a secret, but may have mentioned at a party or two that he had ""taken them before,"" but always in the past tense.

Freshman year was a blast, and he and I and two of our other very best friends moved in to a house together for sophomore year, and we lived there for three years until we all graduated on time.  The entire house was generally irresponsible, mostly by completely trashing the place through constant beer pong games, messes, and several house parties.  But everyone was still responsible with school and work, and things seemed fine.  He was still dating his girlfriend, and he adopted a puppy that he took very good care of.  Sophomore year was fine, although he and his girlfriend were constantly arguing.  Finally, at the beginning of junior year, they broke up.  This event led to his increased opiate use.  A year later, the dog escaped through a faulty fence and got hit by a car and died.  This further depressed him.  He spent most of his time in his room or working.  At this point, he was still good with money and was responsible at work, but he did this so he could use his tip money for pills.  None of us needed outside employment -- we had full scholarships that covered living expenses -- so extra income could be spent on anything, and he used it on pills.  None of us knew this was going on, but there were red flags.  He was spending less time with the rest of the roommates, and he'd have erratic mood swings and would constantly be scratching himself.  But he went to enough classes to still graduate with average grades, but he definitely had the lowest GPA of our group of friends.  When we moved out, we faced a steep repair bill.  He somehow didn't expect this or have any spare money.  That was the first time he borrowed money from me.  I lent him something like $1000.

When we graduated, we all went our separate ways.  None of us was from the city we went to school in and we were all from different cities.  I didn't hear from him for a few months.  He apparently spent the time waiting tables back home as we was taking a year off before grad school, which gave him plenty of tip money and access to opiates (which are big in the restaurant industry).  I worked in an office back home during this time.  Around Christmas, I finally got my money back from him, which I thought was gone forever, and he included a good amount of interest as well.  I also found out that we were both applying to grad school and were applying to some of the same schools.  Ultimately we both wound up enrolling at the same somewhat prestigious university.  I had gotten admitted a month or two before him and had already committed to living on-campus, and he wanted to live off-campus.

So, during our first year, we were not roommates but we hung out a lot at his off-campus house, which he shared with others who were in school with us.  He did not work outside of school until the middle of the spring semester, because his student budget ran out early.  (By the fall semester of our first year, he'd already developed a reputation of almost never attending classes, even though we're in a professional program.)  During the spring, I was irresponsible as well.  I didn't focus much on my classes because I'd drink with him.  Sometimes I'd take drugs with him, but never painkillers.  We did ecstasy a couple of times and took shrooms over spring break with one of his roommates.  During this year, he apparently borrowed rent money from multiple roommates of his because he was spending money on drugs.  I knew he borrowed money, but I didn't know how much, and it wasn't my business.  He didn't ask me for money that year.  I agreed to live with him the following school year, which is this year.

My grades sucked, but I got a good summer internship and everything was going great.  I didn't really keep in touch with him over the summer, but he was back at home so he didn't have to deal with rent problems that summer.

This school year, where we've been living in the same house (with some other students -- not the same ones as the ones he lived with last year), things have gone downhill quickly.  The pace accelerated in the fall semester, and then collapsed between December and now.  Right after we moved in, we were fighting frequently over frivolous things.  Knowing my reluctance to lend him money due to his delay in repaying me for his share of the housing damages after undergrad, he discovered a new way to get at my money -- by getting me on the habit with him.  The first time I took vicodin or percocet (I don't remember which; the drug of choice would change frequently depending on whichever was available) was probably in October.  He gave me some for free and explained what they did.  For some reason I decided to try them out (I was probably really hungover and wanted to kill the hangover).  I loved them.  I'm normally an introverted, socially awkward penguin.  When I took pills, I'd have a major personality improvement, I'd be smiling and engaging.  Soon, of course, he'd ask for me to pay for my share of the pills.  He'd buy about 120mg at a time ($1 per mg), and I'd get about 20 or 30 and he'd get the rest.  He'd get me to go to the ATM and give him $120 at a time and he'd promise to repay his share.  His failure to do so in short order didn't concern me because I was on these new awesome pills.  (He had worked at a restaurant for the first half of the semester, which is where he got referred to the local drug dealer, but he got fired halfway through the semester.  After this, he was constantly assuring me that he was looking for new jobs.)  I even secretly took some home for thanksgiving and had them in the bathroom at the beginning of a big family gathering, so that I could be more outgoing and have more fun chatting with lots of people.

qsg64,0,2012-03-12,Jobs for new CS grad?,Wrightboy,Boise,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boise/comments/qsg64/jobs_for_new_cs_grad/,"Greetings people of Boise!

I will be graduating next week with a bs in computer science and have decided to take some family up on a cheap offer to come and live with them in the beautiful Boise. My hometown is Aberdeen (pop: 16k) so it seemed like a fairly smart move to start my life post grad. However, not so smart, was my tardiness in doing any sort of job-hunting prior to my graduation. I am pretty much starting from square one here.

Are there any companies that you can recommend I look into for either an internship or entry-level position in software engineering or other computer science field? The family has friends who work at HP and said it might be worth a shot there, but I did not know if there were any other prime choices I should be aware of.

Many thanks!

I want to wake up, get ready for the day, and be entertained all day. I don't want to just ""work"" all day. I've done that and it's not getting me any where. Repairing computers is not ""working"" for me, it's a way of life for me. I'm like Dr. House when it comes to computers, (except that I an not an ass and I help every one): It excites me when an issue comes up that some one can resolve. I LIKE finding out how to do what people want with their computers. Every time I fix a computer, I don't just get the job done. I go above and beyond to TEACH them new things, while at the same time achieving the perfection they weren't even sure they wanted until I showed them how to fully utilize their system and get the most out of it. I just really enjoy working with and on computers and helping people.

Reddit is a huge community and I have seen wonders come out of it. So I am posting my certificate here in hopes that I can get hired. I suck at writing resumes and cover letters, but I'm one heck of a test taker, a demonstrator, personable, committed, social, punctual, reliable, produce results, motivated, educated, willing to learn more, and am able to provide the best of customer service to any one requesting help from me.

Let me know if you need any other information. I am able to start ASAP. Finding jobs down here in Hayward is not cutting it. I'd rather shoot for a career. I've checked out all of those ""Online Courses"" and they are way to expensive and would take years to get what I just got in 3 months time.

So I have a few questions... I will just write them here in disorder :)

* So first, will anyone have a beer with me?

* As I said I'm going to study in UCD. Where should I live? (I'm looking for very precise advice as I'm at a total loss here)

* Finding an appartment: how does it work in Dublin? I start school on September the 3rd: when should I start looking for a flat?

* Is there a link to a 'bus map'? It nowhere to be found...

* Phone: what should I do? What is the best deal?

* Internet: what should I do? What is the best deal?

* Job: my SO is going with me (already graduate). He is a computer / software engineer. Where could he look for work?

* By the way, how is the labour market in Ireland / Dublin? Is it very difficult to find a job?

* What should I be aware of before coming? Anything else I should know?

Well, that's all I can think of for the moment. Thanks in advance and ""see you soon""!"

I started as an intern/assistant in a very busy major north eastern city after applying for a saute position, the chef noticed i walked into something completely over my head but offered me a internship. 


I got my first real kitchen job shortly thereafter working as a garde manger(cold entrees,salads,desserts) the whole situation was very overwhelming. It was awful im naturally disorganized and not that fast, mostly very chilled out so it was a terrible match. I told my girlfriend of the time how miserable it made me, she threatened to kick me out if i quit. Having no where else to go at the time, i bit my tongue and complied until i got fired. Even thought I hated it, it broke my heart.
 My next gig was at a eastern European place in another north eastern destination but known for its agriculture. The place was new and it would just be me working with the owner, Everything was great for the few months. But then I started messing up much more than I did in the past. Breaking things on accident, messing up orders, getting frazzled and stressed until again I was ""let go"" via email.



 After a stint of unemployment I was back in the kitchen but this time at a ski resort out west. It was a glorified FRIDAYS type place, with burgers and some nice fish and steak entrees. I started out on the grill doing really well and then again slowly started to commit more erroneous acts, eventually being demoted to the cold station. I always tried and worked very very hard, but certain practices never really clicked. I lived alone in a one room apartment at the base of a mountain. I never really went out since the only things to do there were to ski or get hammered. I liked to stay home or go out alone to different towns, smoke pot and enjoy myself on down time, its how i relax. After a few months I left because the pay after rent was rather skimpy and again was just not feeling the whole situation. I still kept at it thinking that the whole ""Dont give up"" quotes were working hard at things that make you completely miserable. 

Shortly after I worked at a very small but very high class gastro pub, the kitchen was microscopic. 11 hours a day I prepped right in front of the hot flaming grill, dripping sweat nonstop until i left for the night. The days were filled with heavy lifting, mountains of prep work, insane service during the rushes. Again i was miserable, but I tried to have a better attitude about it and stuck with it. Unfortunately my means of transportation broke and could not still get there. When I called and told the chef about what happened he screamed at me and let me go right then.

 Next stop was the zionist summer camp, I did pretty well there as the chef preparing a nice meal for 250+ people daily for lunch and dinner all by myself. I got a raise in the first 2 weeks, it was great until they never put my raise into my pay checks. I left a week before it was over after not getting payed the amount I was owed and they started pushing work unfair work loads only onto me and not the other cooks.

 My mind would always break at a certain point craving to do other things with my life, but I always made myself keep with it. Further down the line I was the lead cook at a kosher catering place that had poor practices considering actual quality and that really hurt my soul, I stayed with them for half a year until i was fired for making the chef a bad sandwich. I had a few jobs after that in NYC which were great paying higher up chef positions but my spirit dwindles. I just didnt care, I cant make myself care about this profession but i keep with it because i dont know what else to do with myself. I want to start a farm and have been trying to get internships. i have two starting in a few months, one is just harvesting produce and the other I have yet to contact the people to set it up.

I can't help but feel as though that's my mind lying to me.


Ever since about a year ago I've been starting to slip further and further away from the joy I once knew. Sure, I still have some times where I can actually say I enjoy life, but these times are growing fewer and father between. I'm currently living away from home, in Germany, until August. This year has been difficult, because my family, fiancée, friends from home; they aren't here. I have been losing interest in almost everything; sewing, drawing, video games. Sometimes I don't even turn on music while I mindlessly browse Reddit, just because I don't feel like it. I feel like I'm being crushed every time I get a rejection letter from an internship that I applied to as well. So far I've been working with the people in my program to land an internship that we all have to get in order to graduate in the program. 45 applications, a duration-of-stay question, and an interview later I still have absolutely nothing. My fiancée back in the US already has a summer position lined up, and I'm the last one in my program to get an internship.


I've never felt unhappier in my entire life. I went on MedMD quick to humor the notion that I might be depressed and took their survey. 29% into the survey, they stopped it and posted the phone number to the helpline (which I can't call internationally) and told me to call immediately. Clicking that little box that said ""Have you had increased thoughts of suicide?"" probably did that. Don't worry, I would never commit suicide; I won't ever let it come to that because of how anti-suicide I am, but the thoughts are still there almost like my mind is telling me *it's still a possibility...*


Now, I know a self-diagnosis isn't the greatest, but I think it might be right. Since I'm away from home I don't know how much reasonable access an American would have in Germany to anybody that could help. I'm even afraid to tell the people I know, though I have brought it up in the past that I might be getting depressed.


I don't know how to stop this."

qtufa,1,2012-03-12,"It's hard to find any reason to keep trying. (A bit long and rantish, sorry.)",depression_throwaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qtufa/its_hard_to_find_any_reason_to_keep_trying_a_bit/,"Forgive me if this is a bit long and involved. I can't get my head around most of this, so it's easier to write it out in list form.

*My academic adviser fucked up and failed to tell me that I need six more credits to graduate. I am in my final semester, supposed to be graduating in May.

*My parents have told me they are not willing to pay for the extra classes I now need to graduate. They suggested I take out a loan to pay for the classes, but I have no job, no credit history, and no way to assure any loan service I'm going to pay them back. (And ha ha, student loan bills will start coming in right after I graduate. Those I can defer, but still.)

*I can't. Get. Any. Fucking. Job. I'm not kidding when I say I've sent out close to a hundred applications in the last two years--for paid positions, internships, anything. My resume isn't shit, either--I've been working at least part time since I was fourteen, and have been doing work study the whole time I've been in college. Granted, I don't have many extracurriculars to my name (in part because I spent most of my youth terrified of other people), but it's not as though I'm totally inexperienced. In two years I got one response from an employer. One. I couldn't handle that internship because of my course load.

*The next thing my parents suggest is the whole ""move back home, get a job, figure it out from there"" thing. I'm familiar with that situation millions if not billions of college grads have found themselves in--get a diploma, nowhere to work and nothing to do, go back home. If I didn't loathe my hometown so much, I could accept that. But elementary/middle/high school was hell for me. I was an outsider then and am still treated as such. I have made almost no friends there, and what friends I made have moved away. I have nothing and no one there.

*Worst of all--and this might ring hollow, but it's what has been making me cry the most throughout all of this--I might lose all ties to my best friend. I honestly can't imagine my life without him. I don't know what would happen to our relationship once I leave.

So after all that, I've given up. I cry uncontrollably at least three times a day. When I'm not crying, I feel utterly blank--not happy, not sad, nothing. I can't get myself to do anything. The inevitability of it all--losing my chance at a diploma, my only friends, everything I've known for the last four years--has me feeling utterly helpless. Why keep trying to get a job/internship if I'm just going to get rejected again? Why keep up with schoolwork if I'm not even going to be able to afford a diploma? Why keep up with any friends if I'm just going to have to leave them in two months?

Please don't tell me that this is the time for me to completely reinvent myself and start all over or whatever, I respect that you're trying to help but I'm not feeling particularly optimistic and every time I try to be I just start crying.

I just got an internship, where I will be driving an hour there and an hour back a few times a week. I am worried about my car making the trips. Already since January I have spent roughly 700 in repairs. It is a 96 Contour, and I honestly do not think that it is going to last much longer. Especially with driving more than I have been. I am looking into getting a new car, I would like to get a used. I think that I should spend the money and get a newer used car and take out a loan and be able to have it for a while, with hopefully less problems (roughly 2k down and a 8k loan). But my boyfriend thinks that I should spend much less and just get a car that is good enough to get me by until I get a better job and making more money so we can afford to get a better car. 

**Here are our financial basics:**

* Last year I made 16 thousand
* My boyfriend made 36 thousand
* Our house payment is 580 a month, we are going to refinance. Our payment should stay the same because we are going to get a 15 year mortgage. 
* All bills aside, we put 700 into savings monthly, not including our retirement fund.
* My student loan payments are going to be coming up, I estimate them to be about 300 monthly

We are on a budget and put weekly allowances for groceries, eating out, gas, etc. in envelopes so we do not over spend.  We're looking for an unbiased opinion to see what the general consensus is. Any help, r/personalfinance? "

The good news is that I just landed an awesome internship for this summer! :) It's relevant to my interests, and the pay is really good, so needless to say I'm very excited. However... the company will be drug testing me. :( This is not too big of a deal; I have considered taking a break from smoking anyways, but the problem is that I have been an active ent for almost 5 years now, and specifically the past almost 2 months I have been smoking my new MFLB multiple times a day. I know that if they test me anytime within I'd say a month I will fail the drug test. Do you have any suggestions on how I should detox or attempt to get it out of my system? I am looking into getting clean piss from a friend, but I am still going out and buying a detox kit ASAP as well as loading my body with fluids. Any other suggestions guys? I've been freaking out a bit since I found out yesterday.

TL;DR - getting drug tested for the new job, been an active ent for 5 years, what should I do?"
qveit,2,2012-03-13,Realistic budget for trip to Australia/NZ &amp; SE Asia,umlong23,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/qveit/realistic_budget_for_trip_to_australianz_se_asia/,"So, I just signed on for my first engineering internship. Instead of going the traditional route of a 4 month summer internship, I've signed on for the next 12 months, and the pay is pretty good. That means I have 4 months off for the summer of 2013 before I go back to school.

I've always wanted to travel, so this is a great opportunity. Realistically once I graduate I will have either time, or money. Not both at the same time. Furthermore I've always had an interest in Australia and New Zealand, so that's the logical destination for me.

What kind of budget am I looking at? Round trip airfare from my homebase is ~$1800-$2000, starting my journey in either Auckland, Syndey, or Bangkok. Probably want to spend 7-8 weeks total, with 3-4 weeks in SE Asia. Hostels, cheap transportation and budget everything is what I'm expecting. I want the experience, not a luxurious holiday. 

I'm also using this job to pay for at least my next year of school, so I am budget conscious, so just from my brief reading in the last week, I'm thinking somewhere between $4-5000 on top of my return airfare should be adequate. I have an acquaintance who's in Australia right now, so I'll have to talk to her about what she spent when she gets back in a month or so.

Any other tips you have for these regions? Any personal experiences you've had that I won't read in the guidebooks? I only want to peg down my start and end date, everything in between will be last minute plans, but with a few goals of what I'd like to see.

Thanks in advance!"
qyhjq,3,2012-03-15,The worst migraine nap-dream. ,lemon_SQUISH,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/qyhjq/the_worst_migraine_napdream/,"Some background: I had just done yoga and cleaned my bathroom, and I'm dating a guy who does not have a brother in real life. I'm in Arts in school, and have never wanted to be a doctor.

Just had a nap to relieve a migraine, had a dream that spanned a total of about 5 years. I just kept flashing forward to different times in my life, and it just kept getting worse and worse. 

So in the beginning of this dream, I was studying to become a yoga master. My mentor was this mean young man, and his yoga studio was a small shack in the middle of an industrial part of town. Basically, I spent my time in this tiny little shack cleaning the bathroom. Nothing yoga related, just cleaning this decrepit little bathroom, everything was broken, and only some of the toilets flushed, and no matter how much I cleaned it, it was dirty. Then, one day, I met an old woman who was also cleaning the bathroom. She was also ""studying to become a yoga master"" in this yoga studio, but she had been cleaning the bathroom since she was my age. I realized that bathroom would never get clean, and decided to cut my losses, and become a doctor!

Fast forward, and I'm doing an internship (in a hospital in the biggest mall in NA, West Edmonton Mall), getting mentored by this awesome woman, being really successful at doctor stuff, etc. Then I look down at my abdomen, and it's huge. I realize I'm very pregnant, but my boyfriend and I have broken up a few weeks ago. 

Fast forward again, and I'm living with my ex boyfriend, his mom &amp; her boyfriend, his grandma, his sister, and his brother (who doesn't actually exist). I decided to live with them because my ex's mom and grandma wanted to help raise our baby, which meant I could continue with my internship. BUT their place is also in West Ed. Mall, you go down a hallway, and it's just this room, with a bunch of mattresses on the floor. There is no furniture or anything, just mattresses to sleep on, and I have this baby, who I HATED.

Then, back at my internship, my mentor had quit for some reason, and was replaced by an eccentric Swedish man, who claimed Swedish was the only good language in the world, and all of my reports and presentations had to be in Swedish. I live in Canada, and only know the Swedish word for ""Thanks"" so that was rough. I knew I had no chance of completing my internship, but I just kept trying and trying, translating everything I wrote to Swedish.

Fast forward again, baby is now a toddler, and she cries non stop. We are still living in our West Ed. Mall room, and I'm sitting on the floor with my crying baby. My ex comes into the room, he looks upset. ""My grandma just had a stroke"" he said, and we are all sitting on our cots. All of a sudden, his grandma looks at her left arm, and says ""fuck,"" and we all know she's having another stroke. So my ex starts freaking out, and vomiting EVERYWHERE. All over the ground, yelling the whole time. Most of the them go off to the hospital again, and I'm left with my child, my ex's brother, and vomit everywhere. My kid is playing with this glass bulb thing she found, and then she sat on my lap, and looked me, and for a split second, I loved her.

We didn't have any cleaning supplies for the vomit, so we have to bus to a different mall to get them (ex's brother didn't care that there was puke everywhere, but he had nothing better to do). The store is closing in 2 minutes, and we finally have all our supplies ready to be purchased. Ex's brother (who by the way has been a total dick this whole dream) is messing around and embarrassing me, so I playfully punch his arm. He is FURIOUS, slowly turns to me, and says quietly ""I would love nothing more than to punch you right now. Actually punch you, and cause a lot of damage. But I can't, because you're a woman. So I'm going to do something better."" And then he took all the groceries I was holding, and threw them ALL over the store. He threw them like 30 yards. Since the store was closing, I didn't have time to go around finding them, and we had to go home empty handed. He was very aware that the mess bothered me a lot, it was a dick move.

So we get home, and I just start crying. I'm basically sitting in a puddle of vomit, with a crying toddler, crying my eyes out. Ex boyfriend comes home, his grandma died at the hospital. He ask why I'm crying, and I sob out ""My life. It wasn't supposed to be like this. I was supposed to be a yoga master, but now I can't even be a doctor because I don't know Swedish!"" He comforts me, and tells me to get some sleep, and it will be better tomorrow morning. Then his fucking brother starts riding around our little room on a quad. He runs over my ex's phone, and I pick the phone up, to make sure it isn't broken. I see he has a new girlfriend, and they've been sending each other lovey dovey texts and shit. He has this new awesome life with a childless girlfriend, and I'm living in a room with no furniture, sobbing in a pool of his vomit. Then I woke up."
qyahp,7,2012-03-15,HB9.5 at work.,Mo3,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/qyahp/hb95_at_work/,"I've recently moved to a metropolitan city completely by myself, after living in a small Bavarian village for 18 years. I scored a paid internship at a very decent IT company, and a very very beautiful girl works there, too. Her looks easily make her an 8, and combined with her personality she appears to be the most perfect woman I have ever seen. (""Static public function can not be called"" out of her mouth -&gt; Instaboner). Her body is PERFECT. I can honestly say that I've never been turned on that much just by seeing a girls body.

Now to be honest, I would like to fuck the living shit out of her. She has been giving me IOIs all fucking week, sometimes she would wait for me to finish work so we could take the subway together, and every time I was around her she would look at me, smiling as we make eye contact. 

I have a few problems, though. First of all I'm 18 and she's 24. Well.. that wasn't a problem in my past PU career, why should it be a problem now. But in the past, a hige part of my confidence came from the fact that I would probably never see that particular girl again in my life.

qy62z,8,2012-03-15,On Day 2,dissucks,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qy62z/on_day_2/,"So... I've been smoking for the past 6 six years, I'm 22 now and just about to graduate university. The past two years I've been smoking pretty much every day (usually multiple times a day, bong rips are my main method). Before that it was 4-5 times a week. I'm feeling restless, agitated, and find myself getting angry at nothing. I've taken tolerance breaks before and while they can be a bit of a nuisance, knowing that I'm not going back to my daily habit seems to make it much worse, like I'm letting these feelings get the better of me. It sucks. My mind is racing and everything I do makes me want to smoke. I just feel like this is so stupid because it's just weed. To be honest, while I'm on day two, yesterday I took an amphetamine derivate to get some work done (I like to dabble with a variety of stuff, but none of these I use regularly), so I'm not sure if it counts. I also just smoked a cigarette (I'm not a smoker, I don't really enjoy it that much), and it calmed me down a bit. Even as I write this my sentences just seem to jump from one random thought to the next.

I've always justified my heavy usage through a variety of ways. All my friends do it (this is just because I regularly hang out with potheads, my friends who aren't smokers I just see infrequently), so it never really felt like a big deal. I do well in school, but haven't really had to work that hard. My major is largely test based and mathematical, and it's always come relatively. I've been accepted at a decent grad school for good money, so it's not like weed has ruined that aspect of my life. BUT, I know I could have done so much better, done more research, gotten all A+'s, internships, etc. I operate at the minimum level to convince people that my habit (really an addiction) is not a problem. I quit my job in november because I was sick of it, and haven't really been doing much since then except finishing up 2 classes and getting high. I wanted to go travelling this summer, but I've burned through what I had saved up so I could sit at home and get high. 

Reasons I'm quitting: I feel numb, I'm not even sure if I've felt real emotions in a long time. My Grandmother died in January (I think, my memory's shit), and I didn't feel anywhere near the same as when my Grandfather died. I enjoyed smoking initially because it calmed my sixteen year-old self down and really helped with anger issues. Now want to have real, deep relationships with people. I don't want the basis of my friendships to be our co-dependent use. Honestly even my friends who aren't regular users smoke when they hang out with me, mainly because I have some and want to get high. Money, I have no idea the amount of money I've spent on pot in the past six years. If I had to guess I would say it's around 5k (maybe more), including a beautiful $250 dollar bong and my $300 vape. I don't necessarily regret the money spent, but it just seems excessive for what pot's given me. I want to get my attention span back, I used to be an avid reader, going through 2 books a week during adolescence. Now I don't read at all (I just get distracted and do something else). 

Now, I don't think cannabis is bad, or anything of that sort. I just can't have a healthy relationship with it at the moment. At some point in the future I may want to indulge occasionally (never purchase for myself), but I'm not sure if that will ever be possible. I have such fond memories of the first times I got high, and they ridiculous things we would do sneaking around to take a toke. I don't regret my decisions, but enough is enough, it's time to not be dependent on a mind-altering substance. 

As I type this there's a part of my brain telling me all of this is silly and that weed isn't the cause of how I feel. It may be right, but weed let's me avoid dealing with a lot of things I need to deal with to be a happy person. My parents always said in order to be happy with other people, you need to be able to be happy by yourself, and I've never been without Mary Jane. I could honestly type endless paragraphs about my use right now, as it's pretty much the only thing on my mind, so I'll just leave it at this.

Thanks, and reading this sub-reddit has been a huge help."

And in the traditional sense of drunken Wednesday stupidity (well, it's tradition to *me*), YOU should come out to a fine, classy establishment with us and get shit-faced! And also because there's no better social lubricant between a bunch of strangers that point guns at each others' faces over the internet, than grub and alcohol.

Down for it? Leave it in the comments. Add me as a friend on Steam [asdf | DRUNK]. RSVP with a wax-sealed letter. I don't care, just make it known.

**Who exactly is ""Us""?**  
If Jereair and 1nked remember, they AGREED to make this meetup happen, so this is some real-deal shit. They can't even back out now without looking like total jerks who don't want the rest of you to have a good time.

**Where are we going?**
Somewhere local that has pretty good beers and pretty good food. I'm nominating either Stone Brewery or Churchill's Pub in San Marcos. If you think you know better than me, leave it in the comments.

**When are we going?**  
Unless anyone convinces me otherwise, we should make this magic happen on the last weekend of March. Coincidentally, this is also the first weekend of April. Maybe we party so hard past midnight and this turns out to be the best weekend you've ever had in both months, simultaneously. That's a two-fer, and you'd be kicking yourself in the pants if you were to miss out on such a steal. So if you didn't buy a new calendar for 2012 yet, that's 3/31, Saturday. Let's do 7pm, because that damn daylight savings messed everything up and I like to drink as it gets dark.

**How do I get there?**  
You're a big girl, you can use the Google Maps

**What do I wear?**  
A FUCKING HAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? PROBABLY OTHER CLOTHES, TOO.

**TL;DR;IMSTUPID:**  
You're going to be at Stone Brewery on Saturday 3/31 at 7pm. asdf | DRUNK told you to.

**So whaddya say, tf2west? See you there?**    
Even if it's just 5 of us, it's better than hanging out on the TF2 home screen waiting for that 24/24 to say 23/24!

-----

**EDIT 3/16:**    
CRY SOME MORE. Some of you propose next weekend, **Saturday, April 7**. I don't care the date, as long as the majority is happy and can make it. I think a Facebook event is in order? I'm not friends with any of you internet strangers so not sure of how to proceed. Should one of you be promoted to Head Event Coordinator and do all of the work at intern salary? Apply within.

Anyways, more details to those who wanted it:  
Stone Brewery for beer action at 7p, and wandering in the gardens with beers until we get over it and want to go to a place with a full bar. Stone has appetizers and stuff you can get at the bar, so if you come hungry, bank on eating this sort of stuff. If you're trying to get dinner, good luck. The kitchen is remodeling so they are PACKED. Then off to Churchill's, not too far away. There's food here too and it's pretty good. If you've never been to either, you're in for a treat, I promise. All you have to do is either like beer or not be afraid to order something new to drink. If you ask for a Budweiser, you will be escorted out of both of these establishments. Also, don't forget that we're probably going to be outside all night, so wear warm things. If you show up in full TF2 cosplay, I will pretend that I do not know you.  

Yep, those are the rules when drinking with asdf | DRUNK. But, I'm telling you all these things so you don't embarrass yourself (or me), guys. Remember last time we were all gung-ho about an idea and acted without proper planning and preparation? Yep, that's how koth_halffort got installed on this server. I'm just looking out for my peeps, ya dig?

qxkhu,3,2012-03-15,I just need to vent. This feels like a good place to do it.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/qxkhu/i_just_need_to_vent_this_feels_like_a_good_place/,"I guess I'll start off with this. Hi. I think I have some issues that can pretty much be summed up with the term anxiety. I feel like I'm always having to prove myself to people and I get really worked up over it. School, work, relationships, driving, fitness, everything. 

This first part is mostly about troubles with my weight anxiety, understandable if you'd like to skip over it. I know I'm not fat. Im not skinny enough to be considered anarexic. Ive never really tried bulimia, but I scare myself when I start thinking about how I could make myself puke. I'm about 5'4/5"" ish. My lowest weight was 108 five years ago. I was at an equilibrium basically between 110 and 115 and cried whenever I gained an ounce. I felt my biggest when I was at 108 and my boyfriend at the time told me I had fat thighs. This was about 4 years ago, shortly after my month long experience with what I guess could be called ""exercise bulimia"", which basically meant that I would vigorously work out on the eliptical for hours a day and burn way more in that workout alone than the strict 1000 cal diet I kept myself to. I know that behavior is destructive to not only my physical health but also my mental health. I'm in a great relationship right now, my boyfriend actually says I'm too skinny and shouldn't worry. I'm obsessed with the numbers though. I decided to stop worrying about it and get it out of my head by not weighing myself every day like I used to. Until a few weeks ago, I hadn't weighed myself in a year. I don't feel like it helped however. I was absolutely terrified to go to the doctors office because I didn't want them to tell me I gained weight, which I know I had. I passed out recently from little sleep, little food, lots of caffeine and added pressures from upcoming finals. Ended up going to the emergency room and I HAD to get a checkup done at that point. I am now 119 now. That's the most ive weighed since elementary and middle school, where my highest was 124. To keep things in perspective, ive been this tall since I was about 12 or 13. I'm 20 now. I didn't tell my doctor or anyone about how upset I was and how that was probably the main cause of the episode until I got home. I guess I tried to pretend I was okay and my boyfriend could tell because as soon as he saw me he asked what was wrong. That was the first time I told him any of these problems. He was there to support me and I'm very thankful for that. I still find myself relapsing though and feeling guilty whenever I eat something that isn't a low calorie fruit or vegetable. I've been looking at thinspo a lot recently and it doesn't help. I want toget back down to 108 so bad it hurts. I want to be really fucking tiny. My logic tells me I'm being absolutely ridiculous and to stop it, but I find myself wandering I thought about it and seeing girls at my uni and thinking DAMN. I wish I were as small as you. This mindset is really destructive and I know it. I just can't help it no matter how hard I try. It usual wins over my logical side and I end up just feeling really negative. I think I may have BDD. Girls I think are my size are actually way bigger than I perceive them to be. I wear a size 3 pants. I have a friend who I thought was my same size. Turns out she's a size 9. How do I get out of this?



School stress. I'm in my second year for a Chem degree. I was always told I was smart. I know I can be pretty lazy, but I get my shit done to my best ability. I want to pursue a masters degree but I'm afraid I'm not good enough to get an internship. C+ in the first semester of ochem. Im taking the second one right now and my grade isn't that pretty so far. I want to do better, but I just feel like I can't possibly absorb any more information when I try to study. And fuck. It's a chemistry class. That's my major. Why am I struggling? There's no excuse. Especially when I don't have a job. I'm starting to think about changing my major but I don't know anything else. It would also be a huge waste of time and money spent at this point. I'm not even sure if this is what I want to do anymore, but I'm stuck. Sometimes I freak myself out and think about how easy it would be to just drop out, run away. Sometimes even driving into a wall. That really scares me. It's only for a second. I'm not suicidal. I'm just scared of the future and want an easier way to pursue it. That train of thought has only entered my mind a couple times. Mostly I'm just thinking, fuck it. Im going to beauty school and doing hair. 


I've been thinking a lot lately about my future too. I think in scared because mostly I have no idea where I'm headed. No one else thinks about it like I do, so far in advance. At least anyone that I know. They're not thinking about masters degrees, getting married, internships, careers, morgatge payments, etc. Am I the crazy one? I mean fuck, I'm only 20. Pretty much living with parents and boyfriend rent free. Why do I worry about it so much?



Edit. Adding a bit more now.
Another thing that weighs on me a lot is that I've never really felt like I've contributed anything positive or productive to the world. Like I'm just a person that's here going through life and that's all I do. I don't feel like I contribute anything to my friendships/friend group and that they could easily lose me and not care or think twice about it. I don't feel like I have anything special or extraordinary to offer to anyone. I've tried actively contributing and supporting friends and all that good stuff but I feel like it just comes off as fake when I genuinely want to make these people's lives awesome. I dont feel like I really deserve anything that I have. Friends, things, opportunities, and do on. All these things are wasted on me, who isnt spectacular or special and doesn't deserve anything. This might possibly be grammatically unsound. Forgive me. I'm tired and it's really late and I can't sleep.



I feel a lot better now. I might add more but I should really get some sleep at least. I'd be amazed if anyone read through that wall-o-text. I needed it though. Maybe a hug too. And advice if anyone's ever been here before."

I felt the whole time, he was feeling pressured by his best guy friends to be chivalrous to me - he didn't need to be. I told him that. PDA and calling me his gf made him uncomfortable. I told him he didn't need to call me his gf (even though he did to his family...) or do PDA. I told him he didn't have to do anything that made him uncomfortable and that I just wanted him to be happy. I felt he was pressured by usual norms and trying to make me happy (in the wrong way). Originally we saw each other every 2 weeks, until we both landed an internship and were able to see each other every weekend - which I believe made him feel like I was a chore. (He said sometimes seeing his best friends is like a chore). He's told me things I don't think he's even told his best friends, and I know he has personal demons to deal with.

Long story short, after we broke up, he wouldn't leave me be. He would call me every so often on and off for a month until I told him I needed my space. Months later, he contacts me. I tell him it's not enough time and call him ignorant. Weeks later I feel bad and tell him I'm sorry; he takes it as a sign that I wanted to try being friends (it's my fault and I acknowledge it). Couldn't take it - still felt sad, mad, bittersweet and lonely memories whenever he was in my life. Told him /I/ couldn't be his friend and I needed space. 

Weeks later, he called and asked if it was ok he attended a mutual friend of ours party, where he knew I would be (I said yes). We did not talk too much, but we talked. Recently, he contacted me. I told him he is not allowed. Ended up crying and calling him on the phone, telling him he couldn't call... but then it ended up being I didnt' want to hang up and nor did he, so we talked on the phone. I told him I missed him and he said he did too. And he said he felt like he needed to check up on me every so often, and it wasn't pitying me and that he felt lonely. 

/r/relationships, my heart wants to ask him for another chance. I want to be with him, I want him to take away my loneliness, and I want to take away his. I want to help him through his demons. I felt like with him, it added more of a meaning to my life, and I wasn't depressed (which I have) - I was happy for 4 months straight (until it started getting bad). I felt like I became someone I really liked around him. And I know he doesn't have that many people to talk to. I've dated someone since our breakup, but there were no sparks like there was with him.
Isn't it to love someone to accept them for their flaws? I get it now, I understand he's introverted and that he likes his space. I understand he felt pressured. I am willing to be prepared for this now.Nothing worse can happen, we already lost each other. He was one of very, very, few that knew me well enough, inside out.

Reddit, what do I do? Am I being foolish and just lonely? Should I man my ground and stay away? Or should I follow my heart?"
r01uq,0,2012-03-16,Advice for an undergrad student needed,avanish11,neuro,https://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/r01uq/advice_for_an_undergrad_student_needed/,"Hi, I'm currently a sophomore at a community college, and I'm interested in entering the neuroscience/cogsci/psych fields, and would like some advice on just about everything.

First, some background: I did fairly well in high school, I had a 3.75 GPA, 1800 SATs, 30 ACTs, and I took 5 AP classes (most of which I scored a 4 or higher). Last year, I went to Drexel University in Philadelphia for a computer science major. Long story short, I hated my major and wasn't used to the amount of freedom I was given, and ended up with a 2.0 GPA that year. I ended up transferring to a local community college (general studies major). I took humanities, philosophy, and social science classes. My GPA last semester was 3.6, and I expect to do at least as well this semester. 

I'm planning on transferring to a 4 year school in the fall for either neuroscience or cognitive science. I'm applying to these schools: Temple University, Fitchburg State, Emory, Trinity College, Western Washington University, and Warner Pacific College. 

After undergrad, I'm planning on going to graduate school or medical school for something brain-related, possibly neuroscience, psychopharmacology, or psychiatry. I haven't made up my mind yet because I don't have any experience in the field. 

This is why I want to do an internship (in any cog/neuro/psych field) this summer, but have no idea where to begin searching for one. Any thoughts?

Also, I was wondering if there's anything I should know before entering the field, or if anyone has advice in general about undergrad, grad school, applying, etc. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!"

Got there, the guys interviewing me seemed pretty cool. I answered there questions best as I could.

Three hours later got the ""you are not qualified for this position"" email.

Miserable right now. Starting another temp job on monday but it only pays about $9 an hour. My internship paid $10 and i was barely scraping by on ramen rice and beans.

I'm pretty sure I spoke here about my internsip in the past. Yesterday I decided to give it up. I was hired as an intern to build a website and do general IT admin for a company. Getting the website built was supposed to be my top priority but this wasn't exactly easy given the very slow pace of feed back I was getting from management.

By the end of December and the start of January I had provided them with everything the required and the general manager was happy with it. Then everything slowed down even more, the website was ready to go online I was just waiting for the go ahead which I never got.

So yesterday evening before I left I was turning off all the computers in the office. One of the managers had left their email open and a few other windows. As I was closing them I noticed a website template using graphics and images that I had made for the company website.

I know it wasn't the most professional thing to do but I had a look through all this stuff just to see what was going on. From what I can see The company I work for has been dealing with another web design company to build a website for them also!
So for the past two months or so I've been sitting at my desk like an idiot while they have hired someone else to do my job. I was never told about any of this. Whenever I asked about the progress of my project I was just told to work away at it and they would deal with it when they had time! 
I don't understand it if they weren't happy with it why wasn't I told? and why did they tell me to keep working at my project when they already have made up there mind to go with someone else?
I've no idea where I stand in any of this but I'm not very happy with the whole situation and I see no reason why I should go back on Tuesday.

r0kwt,2,2012-03-17,My ex and I broke up over a year ago but are still in love and loyal to each other...,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r0kwt/my_ex_and_i_broke_up_over_a_year_ago_but_are/,"This is my first reddit post..I've been lurking for a while. I guess this is also a throwaway account. 

I could write a whole lot to recap our relationship and explain things but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

Ex and I were really in love...dated over a year. Broke up last February. We are 23. 

Ex and I both got really stressed out towards the end of college. He was stressed out/depressed about family issues and about finding a job.

I was experiencing some EXTREMELY difficult emotional issues that were in part triggered by our relationship and in part triggered by my family. Traumatic things happened to me in my childhood and I kind of relived the emotions sometimes in our relationship--not my ex's fault, but because I never got therapy to really heal. I would hide my pain from him because I didn't want to burden him with talking about it for the thousandth time, and I would grow really depressed and irritable. Seriously, although I was in love with him it was a dark time for me and it had a strain on our relationship. This coupled with things currently happening with my family were putting me through some unbearable emotions. 

Ex also had his shortcomings, although was all around a good boyfriend. I think some of the inconsiderate things he did were largely exasperated by my emotional state and kind of snowballed into bigger problems than they needed to be. 

Ex decided things couldn't continue like this and spontaneously, without thinking for things longer than half a day, decided we needed to end things. He claimed that I wasn't losing him but he didn't want our relationship to be completely ruined. I sobbed, assuming no man would break up with me unless he didn't want me anymore, and left, completely heartbroken, unable to talk about things.

We kept in touch (he always calls me every day, no matter what)--although I tried to cut off contact numerous times, convinced he must not be in love with me anymore or not desire me anymore. I was unable to really stick to my guns for any significant length of time. I felt like the breakup was a blow to my self esteem, like I had been ""demoted"" from girlfriend to....who knows. He says that is ridiculous.

For the most part we talk every day, just as we did when we were together.

We have both been 100% loyal to each other sexually and emotionally since we broke up. A few times, in an emotionally charged moment, I've told him we should see other people and he says he doesn't want to, but if I feel like I need to go on dates, he won't like it but he can't stop me, but he won't date. 

Six months after we broke up he moved back home to a city a few hours away. After we broke up we were seeing each other about once a month. Since he moved, we don't see each other more than every few months. This is mostly because he is completely broke, and even his car has been wrecked (long story). We are both trying to get off our feet, I'm starting grad school in a few months, and he is preoccupied with an internship and living with his parents.

A few months after we broke up I started crying and asked why we couldn't be together and he said he felt extremely stressed about finding a job and he felt the timing was off. He said he didn't think we should restart our relationship until we could really sort things out and start off on the right foot.

I am now in therapy. I realized I really needed to fix my emotional traumas and I realize now just how much our relationship was affected by my traumatic past. I talk to him about my therapy and he is supportive.

I offered to drive to see him this weekend (I haven't offered to do that before). He was happy and excited about it, even though I felt a bit awkward about staying with him at his parent's house since i'm his ex girlfriend. 

It was going to happen but last minute there was a death in the family. He calls me and I am there to support him. We are still just as close as ever..we just aren't as affectionate as we used to be even though the feelings are there. We are more reserved now. We don't call each other ""baby"" like we did every day. We don't discuss how bad we want each other sexually on a regular basis. We don't say we love each other on a regular basis although we both acknowledge that we do. We've recently talked about how we should start making the effort to see each other more often and spend some quality time together again, although this won't be easy, for obvious reasons.

 I know it seems obvious that he still loves me and wants to be with me but do you have any insight or advice? I want to be with him although I acknowledge that this is an inconvenient time period in both of our lives for a relationship. I'm glad we still talk but sometimes when I think about how things used to be, and how affectionate we were when we were together..it hurts.

I recently acquired a dress from a Banana Republic outlet that looks similar to [this](http://site.labellush.com/saleimages/fashion_files/FWCapsuleWardrobe/work-dress.jpg), except it's dark gray in color. I think it looks professional enough to wear to an office environment (or, say, to an interview for an internship that I hope to be getting soon). But I was wondering what I should wear with it. A cardigan? Or a blazer?

Also, does anyone know where I can find shoes similar to [these](http://www.target.com/p/Women-s-Merona-Erin-Mary-Jane-Pumps-Black-Patent/-/A-13469928?reco=Rec%7Cpdp%7C13469928%7CClickCP%7Citem_page.adjacency&amp;lnk=Rec%7Cpdp%7CClickCP%7Citem_page.adjacency)? I've been looking for shoes like these (I'm terrible at heels...they always seem to slip off and I've realized the Mary Jane style is perfect for me). But they're sold out at Target. :(

I guess I had more questions than I thought. One more: what length should dress pants be, in relation to heels? Like, should they hit mid-heel, approximately?

I'm from Long Island, NY, and after hearing about UCSC it instantly became my first choice for schools. I plan on majoring in Computer Science (or doing something in the computer field, not quite sure yet), and am extremely ecstatic that I was accepted yesterday; however, my parents have done their research and approached me telling me that the school is very ""druggie"" (I'm an undercover ENT) and the quality of the CS department is less than other schools I've applied to (Stony Brook, UCLA, UCSD, and a few others).

I, from what I've heard, think that the environment at UCSC is the best suited for me, and that the experiences and education I would get there would dwarf those at nearly any other university.

Are there any undergrads with a CS major who can speak on the quality of education/the opportunities available after graduation with Silicon valley internships (that's the major selling point to my parents).

Any other tips to sway the parental unit would also be good to have in my arsenal. Thank you!"

Right now I'm a student. I'm in my 4th year in a very difficult major at a good university, so I have to spend a lot of time studying. I'm also an intern at one of the largest corporations, and I have a job lined up after graduation. So, while future prospects look good, I'm poor as fuck right now. My parents are just as poor as me, so I can't ask for money. I'm living in a super small studio apartment and live very frugally, so I get by. 

My girlfriend is currently in school too, but she lives with her family. They're really abusive and she wants to move out, but her internship is unpaid, so she's poorer than me and can't afford to. Her family often kicks her out then forget about their argument after a week and let her move back in. During those few days, she usually crashes with me. It gets soooo cramped, but she's got nowhere else to go, so I'm fine with it.

The problem is that she eats all my food. I live off of beans, rice, eggs, and ramen noodles. I can't afford to feed us both, even if it's just one week a month. I'm perfectly ok with her staying with me, but I really need her to throw in a few bucks for food or buy her own.

How do I ask this? I don't want her to think I don't care about her or make her feel unwelcome, and she probably doesn't have a few bucks anyway.

tldr: I'm poor. My girlfriend is poor. Sometimes she stays with me. She eats all my food. I want her to pay for it. How do I ask her?"

The Op. thanks all of the generous workers who have struggled to re-build our recently ransacked SeaLab!  However, it is important to note that, due to the specific sterility requirements of our laboratories Cobblestones should not be used for rebuilding efforts in official Hennessey structures! It is too porous and risks contamination! I have began collecting stone bricks and glass to rebuild parts of the damaged SeaLab and would ask any collaborators to remember to sterilize their building materials with fire before use!  Safe materials are: Stone, Stone Brick, Brick, Glass, Obsidian, Lapis Lazuli, Iron, Gold, Diamond.

That said, the Op. could use as much sand, glass, stone, stone bricks, cobble and coal as any of our interns or allies can spare.  We are not actively rebuilding the SeaLab as priority 1, but we are interested in stabilizing the structure so that we may re-open it to the public -- even if official Op. experimentation moves to our SkyLab.

Here's my current situation:

- Will be graduating college this May
- No student debts/loans to pay back
- No credit card debt
- I owe my parents money for a car they helped me purchase 2 years ago. They gave me a 36-month repayment plan and I have 11 more months to go
- My only other bills I have are monthly cell phone bills and those run me $30/month
- I commute to and from school once a week, and I drive to and from work about a few times a week, so I'm spending about $40/week in fuel costs

I make about $500 every other week and from that $500, I have $70 automatically taken out for company stock. My employer also provides me with an additional 15% of my $70, so I'm getting $80.50 in company stock every other week.

I don't have any emergency fund saved up. Due to some lengthy periods of poor spending habits and a few unpaid internships with fairly large expenses attached, I have only just now begun to get back on my feet financially.

Should I continue to purchase company stock? I work for a massive, stable company, so I have no fears that the price of stock will suddenly take a dive. I'm just wondering if what I'm doing is smart, or if I should stop and really just start saving?"

Alternately, I have a few upcoming interviews for attorney's offices here in Florida where I live, which would again incur no major costs of living there, with no income either. However, I do not have anything locked down as of yet. 

I don't have family in Florida, so I worry that being able to display strong ties to the state may be a challenge for OCI interviews for my 2L year. Would going for the 1L position in KY harm my FL prospects in any material way? I need to decide this week, before I'd know the outcome of my interviews here.

Hello. I have been reading and learning about the Russian Revolution and other revolutions. Its seems to me that the use of Red Terror was a serious violation in Human Rights. Then I began to think about my own definition of Human Rights and Morality. If I have been raised in a Capitalist Environment, then have I grown up have those views ingrained in myself. That is, do I have a Capitalist view of Morality and Human Rights?

It is here I must ask you this:

Is it possible to have a successful revolution (I am not going to define how this is carried out, only that after the revolution, The Workers own the Means of Production, or some governmental system is in place to eventually achieve that goal) with out violating Human Rights via Terror etc?

Is the notion of Human Rights a Capitalist ploy?

What is a Socialist Morality? Does Socialism have a ""ends justify the means"" morality?

Is it right to torture, summarily execute, or intern Capitalists?

Thank you for your responses. This post doesn't have some sort of Anti-Socialist agenda, I am merely trying to find answers to my questions.

This post is also rather vague. This is on purpose. I want to get as many responses and as widely a variety as I can. Please, I want to hear from all the Socialists (Marxists, Leninists, Trotskyists.. etc... etc).

Quick Edit: What I meant, is that I want to hear from all shades of Socialism.

I started dating my ex about a year and a half ago. When we first started dating, there were issues. I we both had issues with exes, though mine were much more predominant than hers. I was afraid of falling in love again after the first girl I truly fell for absolutely destroyed me. She fell head over heels in love with me.

So after a year, I broke up with my ex (I'm going to call her B from now on) because I was having doubts. She mentioned moving in and I didn't know what to think. We soon got back together a week later.

Things were fine up until February where I broke up with her again. I hadn't fallen in love with her and it scared me. I thought I could do better, I didn't want to hurt her, or because the sky was blue, I don't know why I did it. 

And just like last time, we drifted back together. Except this is where things get bad for me. I realized that she meant so much more to me than I was allowing myself to believe. I was afraid of getting hurt, but after a month, I came to realize that I had fallen in love with her. It was wonderful, I had finally found what I had been looking for. She kept telling me I was the perfect guy, but during this time she was trying to move away from me emotionally, and didn't show it. She didn't know I was growing more attached. Then, She then tried to sleep with my friend who didn't know what was going on between us so I have no right to be upset with him. 

So in the span of two days, I realized that I had finally fallen for a girl years after I was emotionally crippled by my old ex, only to have the girl I had fallen for tell me she tried sleeping with my friend but he was too nervous to go through with it but she wanted it regardless. 

This was last week. Since then, I've been such a mess. I want to be angry, but after speaking with my friend, he really had no idea that anything was happening between us, and I believe him. B and I were supposed to let the other know if we wanted to see other people to give us a chance to start distancing ourselves. 

So now, she wants to see other people and I want nothing but for her to come back. I suggested we try for one month. To see if she can't feel something for me again. No dice. The past two nights I spilled my heart to her and she kept saying she was sorry, and crying but just couldn't shake the feeling she didn't want a relationship right now and she wants to see other guys. 

I'm usually a very angry person when things don't go my way... but now, I just feel empty. I'm just existing and nothing more. I don't know what to do. How to react to all of this. Not that I'll get any answer here that I haven't already heard or thought of myself, I just wanted to type this out. Feel free to comment if you wish.

**Edit**: Just adding a little bit more information and TL;DR

I am seeing a therapist and a psychologist but I hate both. The therapist doesn't tell me anything that I don't already know. Doesn't give any helpful advice, and I'm seriously considering not going to her anymore. As for my Psychologist, all he wants to make sure is that I don't go into recreational drugs and hardly knows me. I hate anti-depressant medication and I don't think I'll ever take it again.

This past week I could barely eat anything more than a quarter of a bowl of cereal. I feel sick all the time. I don't want to speak to anyone but I have a full-time job. (luckily I'm an intern and I get left alone for the most part.) I just want to forget everything. I want to stop thinking. 

I'm addicted to relationships. Everything else in my life is great. Health, a good job (I get paid a fair bit for this internship), I'm in school, I have friends, and yeah. There isn't much I can really improve other than finding a worthwhile relationship. I don't know how to be happily single. Right now, I'm so conflicted. I know I shouldn't want B, but I do. I can't see myself going after another girl. I hate the girls I meet. They're bitchy, conceded, fat, ignorant, cruel, immature, just so many attributes that make me sick. It's so hard for me to find someone I'm attracted to. 

**TL;DR - Had an amazing girl for a year and a half but didn't realize it. When I finally realized that I was in love with her, she's moved on and tried sleeping with my friend.**"
r4f71,1,2012-03-19,"My State Department Personal Narratives, oh god they suck, due Wednesday 3.19.12",[deleted],Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/r4f71/my_state_department_personal_narratives_oh_god/,"Ideas for state department:
1. Substantive Knowledge: 

1. Substantive Knowledge: The Foreign Service seeks a diverse workforce with broad job skills and a depth of experience to represent the US overseas. Briefly describe why you chose the career track you selected.

I believe that cultures are a puzzle.  Not necessarily an overarching series of themes, but rather a feeling that one can only understand or begin to recognize after prolonged living in another country.  This is why I want to become a consular officer, to learn more about the world and simultaneously better myself.  I have made a point to always expose myself to diverse backgrounds.  I abhor homogeny and believe that America's strength lies in its multiculturalism.  When I lived in Ireland I joined a musical society and worked with other Irish people in order to produce a musical.  I did this to immerse myself in their culture.  I am currently dating a Latin woman and I went to high school at a predominantly African-American school.  I have planned my own trips and activities abroad; I have even done so for friends.  I majored in Western European History, but my studies did not end there!  I have travelled and experienced other cultures on my own.  Operating and surviving on my own was a thrill and a challenge.  And I would use this knowledge and curiosity to immerse myself in foreign cultures to help other Americans remain safe abroad and at home, while at the same time helping them learn and grow from their experiences in foreign cultures.   My resourcefulness and curiosity makes me an ideal consular officer candidate.   

2. Intellectual Skills:  In the Foreign Service you will confront challenging situations that require identifying the problem, collecting relevant information, and formulating or advancing innovative solutions to resolve the problem. Describe a time when you responded innovatively to unanticipated circumstances to solve a problem. (What was the situation? What steps did you take to think through the situation? How did your action address the situation? What were the results?)

Work at Quatrefoil, being able to teach myself programming and adapt to the situation in able to effectively complete what was required of me.  I was given an internship at a company based on my strong computer skills.  However, I had never tried programming before.  The company needed to create a shell user interface for a crane simulator.  I sat down and basically taught myself how to code.  Instead of constantly questioning my boss for solutions, I found them on my own by consulting guides, asking my co-workers, and using online resources.  I was able to complete the program in the time required.  This is not the only project that I completed at Quatrefoil, I also set up and programmed a light display which required learning how to wire motion sensors and other circuits, and I also created an interface to calculate body mass index for the National Healthy Museum.  My work can be seen to this day on display at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey and Discovery Place in North Carolina.      

At Vocus, I proposed several solutions in order to help media research on various countries.  I have constantly received more responsibilities from my manager; she has often approached me for help finding difficult contacts or determining the viability of outlets.  I also have proposed and been able to implement many innovative changes, such as using Google translate to search in local languages for relevant information or using a program to develop macro scripts for the research application.  Moreover, when a French contractor was unable to finish research on Germany for Vocus, I volunteered because of my German language skills.  I gave cultural information to the rest of the team and even tips to deciphering the German language.  Our research team finished processing Germany at a much faster rate than the French contractor and helped to convince upper management to continue our project and even fund it further.  I have even been offered a job to help refine and manage the data.  

During my senior year in college I had no time to continue studying German.  I had deeply enjoyed learning a new language and unlike my previous attempts in High School, a decent amount of it stuck.  I decided instead to continue learning on my own.  I taught myself through a course named Assimil.  Unfortunately the next course was written in French, instead of ending my study there I translated the entire course into English for my own personal use.  With the knowledge I gained from both translating and the actual course itself I am now able to read novels in German; during my studies in college I could barely figure out word endings and declensions.  Now, I continue to study on my own by saving almost every word I do not know to a flashcard program on my computer.  My regular regiment of both native content and active vocabulary learning has led me to further consider a career with the State Department and now I feel confident enough to one day possibly be stationed in Germany or pursue a Master’s degree.  
  
3. Interpersonal Skills: In the Foreign Service, you will be called upon to interact effectively and diplomatically with people in difficult situations. Describe how you have used your interpersonal skills in a specific situation to resolve a problem or achieve a goal. (What was the goal or problem? What specific steps did you take? What was the result?) 

During my time at the Maryland English Institute I was given the task to help tutor a student named Mazen.  Mazen was from Saudi Arabia and was having trouble adapting to the situation.  The goal was to get him to follow instructions and complete his homework, and hopefully help him on his way to understanding more English.  I spent the better part of a week attempting to frame things in a way that Mazen would understand, including framing exercises in a way relevant to him: this included asking him to write about the Saudi King and attractions in Mecca, Riyadh and so forth when he refused to complete a rubric about a favorite sport player or celebrity.  Mazen was more responsive to my tutoring than the teacher and I believe he received some value out of my tutoring.  Unfortunately, he was not able to complete the course.  I actually don’t know what happened to him, fuck.  
	

While at the University of Maryland I was assaulted while attempting to reclaim my property.  My girlfriend’s roommate had allowed an extremely intoxicated man to enter into their apartment.  The man stole my property.  We called the resident assistant when we found him hardly conscious in the hallway of my girlfriend’s apartment.  When I convinced the man to return my property he had sudden second thoughts and charged at my girlfriend.  I was able to restrain him with minimal physical harm, despite injuries to me, and walking away peacefully.  The Residential Association attempted to charge me with instigating a fight, however I was able to represent my case clearly before a board of peers and the charges were dropped.  

In Spring 2011 my friend and I decided to go to Mexico during our spring break.  When we arrived the hotel was completely inadequate; it was dirty, and it did not have the amenities that were described.  I called our travel agency, all while calming my friend who was distraught because she had lost her phone, and explained the situation.  I told them that the hotel did not match the advertisement and explained to them detail by detail what was lacking.  I was insistent yet calm and eventually we were given a new hotel and an apology from a manager.  A similar event required me to coordinate with the better Business Bureau in order to correct fraudulent charges a company made on my debit card.  In both situations I remained patient and presented my case, while availing myself of such resources as the Better Business Bureau.     

During my time at University College Dublin I planned and led several trips on my own.  This included planning a trip with my roommate to London and leading him around the city.  I also planned friends’ trips logistically, showing them how to book hostels and rail tickets.  While in Paris, I helped guide my friends around using the public transportation.  To plan the trip I purchased airplane tickets, found a hotel, and researched what to visit and how to get there.  Towards the end of the semester I planned a nine day trip around Central and Southern Europe, through Munich, Budapest and Rome.  I made all the reservations myself and planned trips, excursions, and even nights out.  All these trips were an astounding success and we managed to do all of them relatively cheaply, finding budget airfare and hostels.  When plans went awry I took control of the situation; and communicated my way back to the airport after we missed our train stop.  

When I visited Budapest in the winter of 2009 we almost missed our non-refundable flight to Rome.  Our train tumbling through the darkened outskirts of Budapest, my travel mate and I were finally resting our feet after a long day of roaming the city.  I was sure that they would announce each station over the intercom; unfortunately they did not.  Our train ended up going forty-five minutes in the wrong direction.  I approached the conductor calm, but urgently showing him our ticket.  He seemed to understand that we had missed the airport but he did not offer any other options, instead of frantically running around I calmly paid the difference in fair and began to question those around us in the little Hungarian I knew: Do you speak English?  Luckily, the man in front of us did.  He helped direct is to a taxi cab and while we were waiting I explained to him where we were headed and how much time we had.  My outgoing nature and my ability to remain diplomatic and explain the complicated situation saved us in the end and we arrived at Terminal 2 five minutes before the check in counter closed.   

4. Communication Skills: Communication skills are critical to successful diplomacy. Describe a situation in which you used your communication skills (either in English or another language) to further an aim or achieve a goal. (What was the situation? What steps did you take to deal with the situation? What was the result?)
	 
At the Maryland English Institute I helped adult foreign nationals understand basic English vocabulary and grammar.  These students’ first languages were a colorful collection; many spoke Arabic, some Spanish, and even Japanese and Korean.  I used my communication skills to help them learn topics like the “past perfect tense” and tutored one student who was having trouble.  Instead of trying to frame topics in foreign terms I gave this student things to write about which were relevant to him: such as the King of Saudi Arabia, local musicians, and cities in Saudi Arabia.  In vocabulary class I used a flash card game to tutor a group of Saudis.  I also helped lead group work in class.  In doing so, I framed the project’s goals and expressed complicated geo-political concepts concerning the European Union in simple terms.  The groups were very cooperative and many of the students that I tutored enjoyed their time with me and at the Maryland English Institute.  I occasionally ran into former students around campus and they would always great me with a smile and a handshake.  

5.  Management Skills: Foreign Service Officers are often required to manage projects, demonstrating the ability to plan and organize, set priorities, employ a systematic approach, and allocate time and resources efficiently. Describe a project you managed or helped to manage and how you sought to achieve the project’s goals. (What was the project? What steps did you take to manage the project? What was the result?)

During 2006 and 2007 I worked at Quatrefoil Associates, a museum design company.  The company needed to create a shell user interface for a crane simulator; in order to finish this I taught myself from scratch how to code.  My manager gave me direct control over the entire process, from the use of hardware to the designing of the program.  This required coordinating with the company's graphics designers on both form and functionality.  The expectations of the project were fairly strict so I had to define and order graphics with specifications in mind.  I also had to determine what was realistic concerning animations (like a load screen) and a splash (intro) screen.  I also coordinated with other on-staff technicians in order to integrate joystick control: I found the appropriate software and coded it into the interface.  My work can be seen today at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey.  My entire work at Quatrefoil is an example of taking initiative and being able to correctly manage complext projects while matching deadlines and being able to coordinate several different aspects into one whole.  

(This might get left out)The crane simulator was not my sole project at Quatrefoil; I also set up and programmed a lights display which required learning how to wire motion sensors and other circuits, and I also created an interface to calculate body mass index for the National Healthy Museum.  My work can be seen to this day on display at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey and Discovery Place in North Carolina.  

6. Leadership Skills: Leadership can be defined as motivating others, encouraging creative solutions, establishing positive team relationships, or significantly influencing the direction of the work. Describe how you have demonstrated leadership, either on one particular occasion or over time. (What was the situation? What steps did you take to show leadership? What was the result?)

At Vocus, I proposed several solutions in order to help media research on various countries.  I have constantly received more responsibilities from my manager; she has often approached me for help finding difficult contacts or determining the viability of outlets.  I also have proposed and been able to implement many innovative changes, such as using Google translate to search in local languages for relevant information or using a program to develop macro scripts for the research application.  Moreover, when a French contractor was unable to finish research on Germany for Vocus, I volunteered because of my German language skills.  I gave cultural information to the rest of the team and even tips to deciphering the German language.  Our research team finished processing Germany at a much faster rate than the French contractor and helped to convince upper management to continue our project and even fund it further.  I have even been offered a job to help refine and manage the data.

r4eg3,1,2012-03-19,Day One,No_Touching_Willie,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/r4eg3/day_one/,"Hello nofap redditors. I'm rather glad I ran across this sub today. Here's my story.

I began my addiction to pornography when I was 12 and discovered Google image search. I soon discovered fapping, (all without any sex ed or parental sex talks unfortunately) and I've been addicted ever since. I'm now 19. I'm a born again Christian and have always struggled with the fact that masturbating goes against my morals, but I've never quite been able to completely, well, beat it! My longest nofap streak I've hit was two weeks, which happened after I had a completely awe-inspiring religious experience, and during those two weeks I felt wonderful! Not a single urge to fap. And then I just caved, without any real temptation. I think I almost wanted to congratulate myself, or see what it would feel like after two weeks, just one of those stupid rationalizations. Since that streak failed I stopped fighting the urge and just acquiesced to my addiction again.

Now I've met this girl who I've been talking to for almost 6 months, who is a great Christian girl,and I'm applying for internships, and I'm dissatisfied with the distancing that my pornography addiction causes in my relationship with God.

So here I am. I won't say that now I'm finally in it for the long haul, or today will be the time I'll finally beat it, because those statements rarely come true, and then it's all the more frustrating when failure hits. But I'm stepping back into the ring, and that's a start!

Thank you for providing me with the community I need start my battle again!

My current wardrobe now consists mainly of several ""cute"" tops, a few black or grey cardigans, dark washed jeans (cheap, bootcut and skinny cuts) that admittedly do not fit me properly, yoga pants, hoodies and camisoles - the typical student wardrobe.  I have a charcoal coloured fitted 3/4 sleeve blazer and pencil skirt combo that I love, but I obviously can't wear that every day.

r7f3h,0,2012-03-21,Why am I not seeing size gains?,Anal_Justice_League,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/r7f3h/why_am_i_not_seeing_size_gains/,"Hello r/fitness.  First time poster here! :)

I have been lifting for a good 16 months now, with mixed results.  The first eight months or so I saw moderate strength gains, but little in the way of physical results.  After taking three months off (due to an internship) I got back into a new routine, as suggested to me by my friend.  The results have been both positive and negative.  The routine is on a seven day cycle as follows:

Day 1: Upper Body Power Day

    Pulling Power Movement: Bent over or Pendlay rows
    3 sets of 3-5 reps @105
    Pressing Power Movement: Flat dumbbell presses
    3 sets of 3-5 reps @60
    Assistance pressing movement: Seated dumbbell shoulder presses
    3 sets of 6-10 reps @50 
    Auxiliary curling movement: Cambered bar curls
    3 sets of 6-10 reps @90
    Auxiliary extension movement: Skull crushers
    3 sets of 6-10 reps @70

I know it's a bit superficial and cliche, but my biceps haven't grown an inch in over a year.  Even with moderate training, I would have expected to see something, even small.  They were 12.5 inches around last year, and remain that size to this day.  Unfortunately, I lost the log book in which I kept my old weight max's, but I do remember that the most I could do on a machine (I do mostly preacher curls with free weights now) was 100 then, but two days ago, I managed to get up to 140.

Day 2: Lower Body Power Day

    Assistance extension movement: Leg extensions
    2 sets of 10 reps @260
    Assistance pulling/curling movement: Glute ham raises or lying leg curls
    2 sets of 10 reps @170
    Seated leg press
    4 sets of 5 reps @950
    Auxiliary calf movement: Seated calf raise
    2 sets of 20 reps @640

My friend suggested that I start to take D-aspartic acid as a supplement.  In the three months that I have been doing so, I have seen weight increases in most every exercise, but have seen explosive growth in my legs.  I'm not sure as to whether this is a placebo effect or not (I have a hard time believing I went from repping 550 on legs to 950 in only three months) but I have seen some serious increases in all four leg strength exercises.  I don't do squats (even though I know I should) because even after hours of watching other peoples forms and having them watch mine, every morning after I do squats, I wake up with a raging headache.  

Day 3: Rest

Day 4: Back and Shoulders Hypertrophy Day

    Pulling Power Exercise speed work: Bent over or Pendlay rows
    6 sets of 3 reps with 65-70% of normal 3-5 rep max  @65
    Hypertrophy pulling movement: Seated cable row
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @110
    Hypertrophy pulling movement: Dumbbell rows or shrugs bracing upper body.
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @60
    Hypertrophy shoulder movement: Seated dumbbell presses
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @35
    Hypertrophy shoulder movement: Upright rows
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @60
    Hypertrophy shoulder movement: Side lateral raises with dumbbells or cables
    3 sets of 12-20 reps @20

Day 5: Lower Body Hypertrophy Day


    Hypertrophy pressing movement: Leg presses
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @600
    Hypertrophy extension movement: Leg extensions
    3 sets of 15-20 reps @170
    Hypertrophy curling movement: Lying leg curls
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @110
    Hypertrophy calf movement: Seated calf raises
    3 sets of 15-20 reps @400

Day 6: Chest and Arms Hypertrophy Day

    Pressing Power Exercise speed work: Flat dumbbell presses
    6 sets of 3 reps with 65-70% of normal 3-5 rep max
    Hypertrophy pressing movement: Incline dumbbell presses
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @40
    Hypertrophy fly movement: Incline cable flyes
    2 sets of 15-20 reps @50
    Hypertrophy curling exercise: Cambered bar preacher curls
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @60
    Hypertrophy curling exercise: Dumbbell concentration curls
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @25
    Hypertrophy extension exercise: Seated tricep extension with cambered bar
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @55
    Hypertrophy extension exercise: Cable pressdowns with rope attachment
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @80

Day 7: Rest

I am 6'3"" and weigh about 205.  I eat 300g +/- carbs a day, 200g +/- proten and consume enough calories to gain weight while working out despite my tremendous metabolism.  I take NO Xplode and as I mentioned before, D-aspartic Acid.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

____________________________________________

**The Story**

We met in college my Senior Year her Freshman Year.  It was a blind date (read: no social skills on my part) set up by my best friend and his now wife to be a double date with seeing a movie and coffee.  Things started off real slow and progressed as a normal relationship should.  I ended up graduating college 1.5 years later and moved up north, about 5 hours away from her to pursue my career.  Like every long distance relationship, it started off very well with us both making time to see each other on weekends.  After about a year of this distance thing, the relationship we had started going sour.  She left to study abroad and we spent the first 2 months of that fighting and seriously contemplating our relationship. Up until this point too we were talking about getting engaged, and every indication I had from her was she couldn't wait for that to happen  (read: ignorant and complacent).

We managed to patch things up and I flew over there, traveled and brought her home to the states again. Things were great after that.....for a while. Fast forward to one year ago when shit really started to hit the fan.  She was really distancing herself from me and, ignoring the relationship and I was letting her. **I was to afraid to confront her or even talk about how I was feeling**.  It eventually got to the point where she wanted a ""break"" to figure things out, me thinking this would help, let it happen. It turned out she wanted the break so she could go out on a date with a co-worker that had been flirting with her. During the break too was our supposed 4 year anniversary (St. Patrick's Day), where she went out with this guy at 5am to the bars and proceeded to post pictures of her hanging all over him.

After the break we started talking again and semi got back together but it wasn't the same, fast forward another cpl weeks where we went to a 3 day concert in the middle of the desert. We took her car and drove with one of her friends, the whole time she was acting like a complete **** towards me. By the end of that night I had had enough of her bs and laid into her, ended up breaking up for good when I found out she made out with the bar guy etc... (read: Mistake on how I approached the situation)  The next two days culminated in her stranding me in the middle of the desert 9 hours away from home, with no car, to ride home and no where to sleep.  

One week later I had to go pick up some stuff from her house and she did everything but got down on her knees begging for me to come back.  **I agreed and things were starting to get repaired a little.** We went out the bars one night and she got super drunk and started yelling at me because she thought I was seeing someone else....she then told me out of spite that she had sex with the bar dude the Monday after the concert.  To wrap this up she moved down to southern caliifornia for an internship. Up until the week before we ended things she was loving and excited to be with me, I came to find out she was dating another guy down in SoCal while we were trying to work things out.
_______________________________________________________________

**What All This Taught Me**

I learned a ton about who I was through this whole ordeal, most importantly however that I was **too afraid of rejection** to speak up or even talk.  I was getting rolled over in every aspect of the relationship which translated into my life outside.  I became depressed because my life was spiraling out of control and I **felt** I couldn't do anything to change it.  That was the single biggest mistake I made through everything, **I stopped believing in my self**, I had hit rock bottom, felt hopeless and didn't know what to do.  My life for the last 4 years was based around another person, causing me to forget who **I was** and what made me who I am.

I eventually realized, through a lot of introspection and surrounding my self with close family and friends, that I had a lot going for me and I was pretty freaking awesome and **nobody but myself could change that**.  I was a single, 27 year old male supporting myself, living in the heart of the wine country in California with a successful job, a car and my own place to call home.

I started putting my self out there in social situations, because the single greatest thing I realized was  **I am never going to overcome this if I don't try**.  I have taken one of my favorite quotes by a famous hockey player and turned it into my personal Mantra

&gt;You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretzky

Yes some of those shots you do take, leave you crashed and burned, but what do you have to lose other than hearing ""No"" or ""Sorry"". Take every situation you are in and learn from it, its the only way you can help yourself.

From that point forward I told my self I will never be that weak, uninspired person again.  I joined a philanthropic club in town, started working out and eating healthy and stopped stressing over the little things in life, because its pointless to do so.  Most importantly I focused on who I was and what made me happy, and haven't lost sight of that since.

Feel free to ask any questions of clarifications, I am an open book and hope this story can inspire you in some way."

r6b03,1,2012-03-21,Am I dating a psychopath? Or is he just a spoiled only child?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r6b03/am_i_dating_a_psychopath_or_is_he_just_a_spoiled/,"I (F/21) have been dating my boyfriend (M/21) for almost 2 years now.

He is an extremely charming, gallant person with a lot of friends who worship the ground he walks on. His parents (who are angels) also worship the ground he walks on. They've tried to conceive for 9 years before he came as practically a miracle and they treat him as such - he can do no wrong. It didn't help his situation that he was certified a genius (MENSA) at age 6 and pretty much lived the rest of his life as a genius, getting into a prestigious ivy league school and landing really prestigious internships. He's also extremely good-looking and, aside from a brief awkward period during adolescence, always had model looks.

His parents didn't have much money growing up, so he wasn't (and isn't) spoiled materialistically. His parents pay his tuition, but other than that, he pays all his expenses from his summer job that he works his arse off at.  He knows the value of a dollar and does not like spending a lot of money on himself, but he showers his friends and his parents with lavish gifts. 

He exudes warmth and sweetness, but he has his times when he retreats from the rest of the world, especially when he is overworked. In fact, whenever one of his friends, or his girlfriend (me) is struggling, he is extremely attentive, caring, sweet, concerned, and helpful - when he is in a ""cornered"" position and can't escape - i.e. when I call his cell and he answers and says he has time to talk, when I skype him and he has no idea what it's about beforehand. When he knows I'm hurting or going through a hard time, he avoids interacting with me on impulse. He never follows up - i.e. ""how are you feeling?"" - unless I give him shit for being a jerk and never following up - THEN he follows up the next day because he doesn't want to lose me. He's obsessed with saving face (he's Asian, that might have something to do with it). 

He can be quite the asshole, it's as if he doesn't realize how some of the things he does can hurt people - it's usually the things he DOESN'T do that hurt people. I don't know if it's because he's a psychopath or because he has the ""I am the center of the universe"" mindset that excludes everyone else's concerns from his radar?

His parents both insist he's actually extremely empathetic and sensitive, and that he's also an introvert (his flamboyance and extroversion are just a persona) and tends to internalize things, so although he cares in his heart, he feels no need to express it externally.

He is very loyal and devoted to me. I don't think he would ever cheat, although he does have a mischievous streak. He doesn't like taking risks usually, but sometimes he does something completely crazy like cross-dress in public or skinny dip in 2ºC weather (it was with only guy friends though, and no, he doesn't have a gay bone in his body, he just likes the attention I think). He is a master manipulator, and can honestly do no wrong. If you accuse him of anything he goes ballistic and somehow always manages to turn ME into the monster for accusing him of such a thing - he makes me feel like whenever I have any concern whatsoever, I'm ""crazy"". When he is criticized, and his parents said he's been like that since childhood, he cannot deal - however, he quietly modifies his behaviour if the critic makes sense, without ever acknowledging them being right. He would never admit someone else is right. He does apologize though when he's obviously wrong.

I just spoke to one of his closest high school friends and she told me that he has had the tendency to retreat when others are hurting as long as he thinks no one is noticing - thus he is pegged as the ""fun-to-goof-around-with"" friend. He's very loyal and dependable to his friends and those he loves, however, if you want any care or concern from him you have to force it out. Because of this, I wonder if it is genuine. 

He loves animals and the environment, and he would never harm a fly. He claims to be a feminist but all his female friends unanimously agree that he is not. (To be fair, he was raised with a very old-fashioned, somewhat chauvinist father - although his father is extremely sweet - he is merely a product of how he is raised - his dad is elderly, born in the early 30's, and quite traditional). He treats people very well though, although he can be manipulative, idk if he does it on purpose though. 

[Please read this](http://www.lifeafterdatingapsycho.com/blog/2011/03/signs-you-might-be-dating-a-psychopath.html)- ever since I read this I got quite scared that he can indeed be a psychopath. 

All of these match how I feel about his behaviour, except for numbers 7, 9 (except he always expresses a distaste for my friends - maybe if I lived with him it would be true?), 12, 14 (although it has been suggested), and 18 (he cares so little about me that he never even asks what I'm up to - whenever he talks to me it's almost always about him), 

I notice that especially 21, 20, 13, 10, 8, 3, and 1 are very very true for us.

What do you think?

EDIT: I really do love him, our chemistry is amazing, he is extremely respectful to me sexually (he even told me he'd wait for me as long as I wanted, even if it means until marriage). He's a really fun person, very loyal and devoted, although he can be very self-centered. The good times are incredible. The bad times leave me feeling like a total unloved piece of crap.

I am currently sick now, and had to go to the hospital. I couldn't reach him for several hours, only when I got out of the hospital was I able to reach him on his cell (he had his cell off his person, clearly). He has not asked me how I am feeling and it's been two days. I finally called him and yelled at him and he told me he's sorry, that he has a lot on his plate too, and hasn't been sleeping because of his workload being too intense. He was the one who initially suggested I go to the hospital when I started complaining about my problem, but I put it off until It got very serious. He feels that he already gave me advice and stuff, and already showed he cared...etc.  It's  as if caring about me is a chore! That's not normal from someone who is supposed to love me!

**tl;dr:** I don't know if my boyfriend is a psychopath, or just an immature, spoiled only child who will grow up when thrust into the workforce. He has many of the qualities on [this list](http://www.lifeafterdatingapsycho.com/blog/2011/03/signs-you-might-be-dating-a-psychopath.html), except the really serious ones - he'd never lay a hand on me or anyone else and in fact has a soft spot for the disenfranchised/weak, and he is extremely honest (I think). All on the list apply to us except 7, 12, 14, and 18 (that's because he is too self-absorbed and doesn't give a shit what I do as long as it's not cheat on him), although these descriptions are a lot more severe than our situation."
r68ek,3,2012-03-20,"Reddit, I've been in a 3 year relationship, on the verge of marriage. We're taking a break and it's stressing me out to the point of depression. Help?",puckpuckpuck,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/r68ek/reddit_ive_been_in_a_3_year_relationship_on_the/,"Okay, here goes nothing Reddit. (This may be a long one.)

(I will first off admit I am a little drunk, so things may not be grammaticality correct, spelling, etc.) 

I have been in a relationship with this girl for 3 year. We have live together for 2. We had two dogs and two cats. Basically, we were on track for marriage. We have previously moved two other times, and were about to prepare for our third (and at the time final) move. On a couple of days before our third move, we had a talk about our relationship after I got out of work (I generally work late nights as a intern). We've had this talk before  about where our relationship is going before - while we had both discussed marriage before and wanting to go forward with it after I had finished college (she had graduated back in December, I had a year left). It basically came down to ""We needed to take a break."" 

She left that night to a friends. From there on out, I went to live at my mothers. We had many conversations that week that were emotionally charged and involved lots of crying. After the move, we met for dinner and drinks). We were both incredibly happy to see each other, with much affection from both parties. Since the break, we both managed to stay in contact, not just because of the move, but because of the obvious. After the dinner, we made plans to see a movie and just hang out at the mall (a bizarre choice on behalf of the mall admittedly), but those previous two encounters were distant and awkward. We were both tired, I from stress and her from having to take care of all the animals (I am not capable of taking care of any of the animals due to having a maximum of animals at my Mothers). Yet, in many conversations before, she had stated being sad about us not being together. She had admitted that she was sad because it was ""almost like she had lost a friend"". 

Yet, I was a lot off worse.

The reason for the break was because both of us had to deal with personal habits we needed to deal with. I am generally not neat, I don't eat well, I manage my finances piss poorly, and I intern for a company that is an amazing opportunity but bend ass over backwards for the in an attempt to get a job next seamster (or at least a paid internship as my current job pays nothing and gives no hours at all). She also needed to learn how to be independent of me, as she could not carry a conversation without even mentioning me. 

Or course, since I didn't want to force her into anything I obliged. 

Since the break, I have become increasingly depressed. I continue to use alcohol and food as a crutch. I am no longer happy anymore. She was the only thing that kept me happy apparently, despite having such great opportunities with work and college. I try to distract myself with work, but it only works when i'm there. I've gotten back into writing music, but once I hit writers block, all these thoughts come back. I skip class frequently. I lose sleep due to the stress. 

The big problem is that she can't keep her decisions straight. A week into the break, she wants to end EVERYTHING. I haven't even made any of the changes she had suggested. Her reason behind this was due to be being drunk at the time of the phone call and not having moved anything out of our previous house. Days later, we had realized we had a miscommunication about everything - she knew I was going to a beer fest and we had not discussed a date when I would move everything out. 

Our previous two outings together were very distant. She had wanted to go out just ""as friends"". I obliged, just so I could see her. Yet, it hurt for me not to get any affection from her. 

I have seen her once time since, last week. 


Since I have not been getting any sleep due to it, I was in a daze when I saw her (I had to get her money for final bills at our old place). She had noticed I was not right, and asked twice if I was. I, of course, played poker face and lied. ""I'm fine. I'm just tired.""

Co-workers and friends have even noticed my depression. They of course help, but I am the type of person that wants input from anyone that can give it, no matter their stance, position, or relation to me. 

So, I think that's it Reddit. Questions are encouraged, along with inboxes. I love this community and would love some sort of help. I still do love this girl and have invested a ton into this relationship to end it. 

Thank you.

r623h,10,2012-03-20,Soooo...I may or may not have had a super awkward interview. ,haneliz,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/r623h/sooooi_may_or_may_not_have_had_a_super_awkward/,"I'm a grad student and I am interviewing for internships for next year. I decided that I would LOVE to work with the LGBTQIA community. This particular internship involves individual and couples counseling as well as facilitating groups, etc., at the local LGBT center in my city. 

I just got back not that long ago from my interview. It went pretty well- I feel pretty qualified for the position (as I have a background in LGBT issues/history, and..well...I'm not exactly straight, I guess). In my awkwardness surrounding NOT having a good label for my sexual identity, I ended up just describing myself as an ally when she asked why I was interested in working with people on the spectrum. 

Later on, I asked my interviewer about this agency's policy on staff members being ""out"" to clients (because currently I am at a drug treatment center and we are NOT allowed to disclose if we are in recovery to our clients- something that differs based on the agency and its philosophy). I do have a girlfriend (I'm female) and I was unsure if it was appropriate to hint at this (or even to hint at an orientation either way). Somehow, I think the interviewer took this as my saying that I would have to ""come out"" as hetero to all of the clients instead of LGBT. 

She went on to give a spiel about if I were heterosexual and I intend to have to defend myself to other people and constantly let them know I was straight (""No, no...I'm not gay, I swear!"") or if I would be uncomfortable being in pictures that would identify me as working at the Center, etc., that this wasn't the place for me. She pretty much got the wrong idea all around (as I present very heteronormative) and I wasn't sure how to set her straight (no pun intended, I swear) and be like NO I'M NOT WHAT YOU THINK I AM! :P So I just let it go, and I'm just hoping it didn't hurt my chances there.

All in all, probably one of the most awkward interview experiences ever. 
 
EDIT: **TL;DR: I interviewed at an LGBT Center and the interviewer thinks I'm straight and had to make sure I was okay working with the gays.**

r8l63,8,2012-03-22,Student org for IT majors is recruiting,mercury_83,MSCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCD/comments/r8l63/student_org_for_it_majors_is_recruiting/,"'Sup, Roadrunners?

I'm working with the school's CIS department to try revitalizing the AITP [(Alliance of Information Technology Professionals)](http://www.aitp.org/) Student Chapter. Commuter campus, so...you know, it's not exactly easy. But I figured I'd leave this here just in case any interested parties happen to stop by.

It's $30/annual for students. On a basic level, AITP membership lets you attend monthly seminars in Denver where you get to listen to a few lectures relating to trends/happenings in the tech industry, get some grub, and rub shoulders with professionals for potential networking and job opportunities. 

Kind of useful and probably pretty boring to most. 

We would like to turn the student chapter into something more useful, though. Help people pick up some of those skills that are essential to entry-level jobs, networking for internships and jobs, help out with class material (the programming doesn't quite *snap* into place for some), provide exposure to concepts and tools that Metro won't teach, or generally just share our collective knowledge and experience in order to benefit everyone involved. I've even got a few computers collecting dust in the corner that I'd be willing to donate as guinea pigs for people to practice things like installing/configuring Linux, hands on practice with taking computers apart and reassembling them, or any other things that some may not have the resources for.

There's potential there if people are willing to make it work, and these things always make for nice resume material (which we could also help you write).

Now for the painfully honest part... The group fell apart after the last batch of officers all graduated last year (or two?). So, this would be starting from the ground up. There are currently three people (myself included) signed up and associated with the chapter, and one of them I can't even get a hold of. So this is all very much in an alpha stage and not even breathing yet. The only thing needed is interested and physically present bodies (not often), though.

If you're down, you can sign up on the AITP website linked above. I'm reluctant to drop emails addresses on a public site like Reddit, so if you'd like to discuss anything just reply here or send me a PM, and I'll try to get back to you ASAP. Alternatively, you can just stop by the CIS department on campus and they'll direct you to one of the faculty advisers. 

Thanks for your time, everyone!"

Live with my mom, single, unemployed, sleep 14 hrs a day, IAMA nothing. ",beller0ph0n,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r88ce/pleasesoon_i_hit_30_eating_disorders_have_both/,"
I am...so...at my end.

I'm a 29 year old guy, single, unemployed, living with his mother, ashamed, apathetic and completely lost in sadness, regret and self-loathing. 

I finally graduated college a year ago, after moving away to Chicago by myself, where I went to a good school, got good grades, made friends, was happy and excited about my future. The problem came in 2000 after I graduated HS, when I started trying to lose weight. I have always been the ""fat loud funny guy"", which, hey, its nice to be that guy, but sometimes, you just want to be ""normal"" or ""good looking"" or ""taken more seriously"", so after HS I started learning about weight loss and working out. Soon I dedicated my life to it and the days quickly revolved around calories in vs calories out. In Chicago I developed exercise addiction, bulimia and anorexia. Food was now my enemy. As a guy, it is so weird and socially taboo, the fact that I've spent nights huddled over a toilet purging myself after binge eating. 


Soon, however, my weight started yo-yo-ing and I began to lose control. Binge eating was a big part of my early childhood and I was now doing it on weekends on occasion. I began being able to ""catch myself"", that is, after a weekend of binging, I'd fast for a week or so and exercise even more vigorously than before. 

College ended and upon moving back home, into my mom’s modest house (because I was to busy exercising to find a job in Chicago), I fell absolutely in love with this girl Ive known since HS, but because I was so fat and ugly back then, I've never allowed myself to try with women. At all. Ever. 

We started hanging out a lot, I'd always drive 30 minutes to where she was to go get coffee and being out with her, people always thought we were boyfriend and gf, it felt nice. She told me I could be her boyfriend when I got a job (I had a PT warehouse gig, which wasn’t good enough). Soon she got another bf, while I was again on the backburner. At this point I had begun taking myself off benzo's, as I've always had severe insomnia problems and had pretty much always taken a sleeping pill of some sort since high school. Coming off benzos would be the hardest thing I've ever undertaken, with exception to what Im going through now. I began having withdrawals, depression, inability to sleep, fear, incredibly anxiety, hallucinations, twitches, the whole shabang. I checked myself into a mental hospital to be safe as the combination of getting off that crap and me seeing her go through 2 boyfriends without batting an eye made me begin having suicidal idealization. 

I got out, eventually got psudo-stable-ish off the benzos and finally got a good job in computers. It felt like the beginning of a career, for me. I was pretty happy. We made a date to go get coffee, her telling me ""I heard you got a job, Mr. Big shot!"" which to me was everything I had been waiting for. I texted her the day we were to go hang out and she said she had forgot and was at a bar for her friend’s birthday and my heart was broken.   

A few days later, on fb I see that she is, again, in a relationship with someone, this time, it being quite serious with a guy in la who, for all intensive purposes, does what I should be doing (film) but obviously he's applied himself and worked hard whereas I've only worried about my weight. 

Next I lost my job. I wasn’t even there for 3 months. It was the first job outta college, the most important job of your life, supposedly. Its really the only job I've ever had that was serious, too. This was nearly a year ago, now.

Since then, I've made powerful steps towards completely destroying myself. I've tried to kill myself with overeating and though I havent succeeded yet, I am emotionally dead. Binge eating is prevalent in my life again. And when I say binge eating, I mean it emphatically. I would go to multiple fast food restaurants in one day, get the food, take it home, sit on the couch and just gorge. I easily threw back TENS of thousands of calories a day(spending $40-60 a day of my moms money to do so). This was my protective barrier. I would make myself so physically unappealing again that I would never allow myself to interact with girls or believe in myself for doing so, ever again. The plan worked too good. 

I did this for 8 months or so. I stopped playing ball, stopped going to the gym, stopped caring, about everything. This soon evolved into not going outside, not looking in the mirror, not wanting to hang out with friends, not wanting to do anything but sleep, cry and overeat, giving the beast more fuel to hate himself. I threw out all my fat guy clothes a long time ago, but I wouldnt even be able to fit in a majority of them now anyways, because Im just that big. I was never an XXL in high school, but to my chagrin, I am now (and then some). I only squeeze into a few gym shorts, sweatshirts/sweatpants and a hockey jersey. Trying on and buying new “big &amp; tall” clothes is just too depressing, I haven’t even brought myself to do it yet. I was a fat kid, then an athletic mid twenties guy, and now am nearing a clinically obese 30 year old, the roller coaster ive taken is just too much.

I'm bi-polar and have had 2 short episodes of mania this past year but the rest have been the deepest, darkest depression I can imagine or describe. Because of my experience with benzos, i am apprehensive to get on anti-depressants of mood stabilizers (i tried them when I was young and they were nothing but problems). Ironically, the greatest anti-depressant I ever gave myself was becoming addicted to exercise and maintaining my 162 weight, muscle mass and tone. That was the happiest ive been.

I'm so fearful about my future. I don't look for jobs and when I do, its so discouraging seeing the experience requirements and what not, realizing that instead of getting jobs and internships to put on resumes, I was exercising, which holds no merit today. Still, i don't apply or even draft up a resume, out of apathy or fear of rejection. I cant imagine what I’m going to do in an interview, when they ask me what I’ve been doing for the past 9 months or so, since my last job. I can’t tell them that I've been incredibly depressed, and have been busy destroying myself, emotionally and physically. But its worrisome as, clearly, I don’t care about self preservation. I no longer bathe or brush my teeth, let alone try and craft a future for myself. I'm 1/10th a human.

The apathy, towards both things I once loved (basketball, golf, friends, comedy) and the things I really should be working on (my future, career, relationships, myself, etc) keeps me under the covers all day, every day. I don’t know how to escape this. I can't escape my thoughts, this room, this house, this town or this sadness.

I think about getting back on sleeping pills and that's obviously quite scary, but I cant just wish myself to fall asleep at midnight or 2 or 4 or even 6. Sometimes, because of the way I feel, they way my brain is thinking and tormenting me, I just cant sleep until absolutely physically depleted. And obviously I will never be able to go to the gym and start working out unless I’m awake before 8 o’clock at night. This is no way to live.   


I don’t know how to fix my eating problems, how to tackle my resentment/regret towards myself, how to deal with my sleep issues, not to mention weather I should once again give a run at the lab rat game of anti-depressants or how to be able to step back into the gym and devote myself without thinking of all the negatives, time lost and pain I’ve accumulated. Id love to be able to say that I will one day love myself in this obese body, but I cant and I wont. I know, after feeling what I felt, leading the life, NOT of a fat man, that I will never be happy as a fat person again. I was the class clown, always confident in my ability to be funny, its what I wanted to do with my life (comedy) since childhood yet now, because I’ve changed myself from fat guy to swan to super fat guy, I just cant be myself. I cant even be funny or anything but terribly cynical. 

TL:DR: As of now I am a single 29 year old, the fattest of his life, living at his moms house, no job, no aspiration to find a job or friends or a significant other, completely wrapped in a cocoon of regret and extreme self hatred for all that I have given and taken away from myself. I am now a cynical being, whose religion is apathy, finding joy in absolutely nothing that he used to, feeling every day that the sweater is unraveling a bit more, and all it needs is one final tug on the string. Not sure about meds. Therapy doesn't really help. I am on my way to becoming a homeless person, i say this not in jest. There may be a bigger chance of that happening than of me taking my own life, which, i don't know if that's good or not. If anyone wants to talk...

**The Five Minute Interview**

It's been fourteen years and I've never told a soul about this until now.  Not that it matters much; they wouldn't have believed me and you probably won't either.  But, it's true.  I was there and I saw it with my own eyes.  To this day, I still am awakened at night from nightmares of it.  And, when those tight-lipped memories bubble into my subconscious, they share as much with wet dreams as nightmares.  But, I digress.  Let me start from the beginning.



It was the winter of 1997 and I had just moved to D.C. with my first husband, Lee, during that summer.  We had finished our undergraduate degrees at Texas A&amp;M, me with Journalism and Lee with Pre-Law, and Lee had been admitted into Georgetown's Law program.  The plan, ill-fated though it was, was for me to get a job as a journalist to help pay for Lee's tuition while he ""invested in our future"".



I was young, twenty-two at the time, a native Texan so constitutionally a greenhorn about the District that I believed my husband and I would have an easier time as an interracial couple there than at College Station.  In all my youthful enthusiasm I honestly thought I would easily land a job at a major rag, maybe even the Post.  After all, I had graduated Summa Cum Laude and was involved in all kinds of ""filler"" for my CV.  It should have been a cinch.



Needless to say, I spent the first three months getting a lesson in what the old boy network in D.C. thinks about Southerners, especially Southern women.  By the time Lee was registering for Winter term, we were dipping way too deeply into our savings and I needed a job.  With dejection growing frighteningly familiar, I tried the unthinkable to my recently emancipated mind: the college paper.



The then-editor of The Hoya took a liking to me for all the wrong reasons and hired me as his Assistant Copywriter, which essentially meant that I'd do the writing that he that was interested in but was too lazy to write himself.  Although I was thankful to get the job, this seemed like a downgrade from life in College Station and after a few days the editor, with his preternatural scrutiny of my every mood and curve, picked up on this and decided to play the friend.



""What if I told you that I've got the inside scoop on the biggest story of next year,"" he said, feigning breathlessness.



""I'd say you like to tell what we call 'Tall Tales',"" as I smiled courteously and suppressed my eyes rolling.



""Oh, this is the tallest of them all, honey,"" he continued, ""and yet it's the genuine article, if you get the pun.""



I coughed out a laugh.



His voice hushed to a whisper and he leaned uncomfortably close, ""President Clinton's errant cock has caught up with him.  The word up the street is that he's been having an affair with a White House intern and this isn't going Gennifer Flowers, either.  He's made plenty of enemies and they intend to put him under a rock for this one.""





Well, now this was interesting.  If it was true, of course.  Maybe you'll remember that a lot of folks were nodding their heads and saying ""duh"" when they heard news.  It wasn't like it was out of character for our President.



""I'm in.  What's the scoop?""



""Hon', I don't know all the details yet,"" as his grin broadened, ""but, that's what you're getting paid for.  What I can give you is a damn good lead.  None other than Hillary Clinton herself is coming to Georgetown to give a speech tomorrow and I want you to try to find out some details about what's going on in her personal life.  She knows about this and the coming shit-storm for sure!""



""Wait, you want me to follow her?""



""Don't be an idiot, Sheri.  She's got Secret Service and all that crap.  I've gotten her PR person to agree to you interviewing her for five minutes afterwards.""



""Holy shit!""""



He looked happier than a Jersey bull sucked off by Dolly Parton, ""Now, look, you can't go and ask her directly about anything because we're not supposed to know.  But, what I need you to do is get inside her skin and see if they're worried.  This bigger than just an article.  There are... people... who want to know.  Anyways, it doesn't matter.  Can you interview her?  Ask her some crap and probe how she's doing?""



""Y-Yes... of course!"" I tried blustering over my embarrassment and genuine nerves, ""It's no big deal.  I minored in Psychology.  I should be able to read her like a book.""



""Uh-huh,"" he dipped and smiled, ""you just get over to the Columbia room at fifteen of two tomorrow and make it happen.  Got it?""



I quickly nodded and mumbled affirmatively.



""Remember, you can't let on that you know.  I've been assured you'll have time up close with her, at least a couple minutes worth.""



  *   *   *   *



I watched the seconds hand tick upwards on the wall clock, ticking each step of the way.  2:16.  Christ, lady, how long are you going to be in there.



Her handlers told me that she needed to take a personal call and would be with me as soon as she was done.  I hadn’t so much as seen her and my nervous bladder was becoming dangerously full, though I didn’t dare move an inch from my seat.  I was going to get this story, come hell or highwater.





“...so you can meet here then?  Downstairs?  Alright, give me a few.  Yep, OK.  Bye,”  Hillary said as she stepped out from behind the door, looking distractedly at the ceiling as she walked and clicking her phone shut with a decisive clack as she fixed her gaze on me.  And, the performance began.



“So, you’re Cherry?” she intoned, extending her flecked hand as her cheeks blossomed into a convincing, many-ringed imitation of a smile.  This was before Botox, after all.



“Yes, Ma’am, ‘Sheri’,” I corrected as gently as was humanly possible, “I’m here from The Hoya to ask a couple questions about your speech.”



“OK, great.  Do you mind if we walk and talk?” she pretended as she briskly stepped towards the hallway, “I’ve got to meet someone in a bit and can’t be late.”



“Of course!” I hurriedly followed along with my Montblanc and pad clutched in hand, “Could you tell me about your plans for promoting SCHIP in 1998?”



“You know, we’ve got many things planned, um, hold on a moment,” she turned to the two Secret Service men shadowing us and added, “Guys, I’m going to need about thirty minutes.  RP at the driver?”



There was a long pause as if there was an inaudible sentence and then the two men in black said in unison, “Yes, Ms Clinton.  Understood.”



They disappeared behind us and we walked silently for what felt like minutes when she suddenly continued, “Anyways, if we’re going to make it a reality for ten years it will take bi-partisan support.  So, of course I will need...”



Her phone buzzed in a strange rhythmic pulse, almost like a code.



“I’m sorry, I’ve got to take this.”



We continued walking as she turned away from me to answer.



“Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Okay.  No, I like that a lot.  Uh-huh.  Sounds like fun.  It’s got to be fast though.  Wait, could you hold on just a second?”



Suddenly she stopped and with simulated embarrassment she turned back to me and covered the mouthpiece of her phone.



“I’m sorry, Sheryl, but could you wait here for a moment?  There’s someone who has something for me down here.  It won’t take long.  Write some notes or something.”



I was helpless to protest as she opened a nondescript brown door and stepped through, shutting it softly behind her.  I bit my lip and crossed my legs, my bladder directing my thoughts to where a bathroom might be.  As I looked around, I heard a slight squeaking sound and stared as the brown door leaked open, spilling a faint light up from its contents.



I waited silently for a moment and, hearing the faint echo of the First Lady talking on her phone, I edged suspiciously towards the door.  It beckoned now, stopping a full inch open, allowing me to see that behind it were metal stairs leading downwards.  As I bent towards the door, my hand almost unconsciously reaching for its handle with my heart pounding, I could almost make out what she was saying.



“You know what it requires... I know it to will be enjoyable... He had his fun, let’s have ours...”



And, then, like a beam of light, I heard another woman’s voice, “I’m ready to begin.  We’ve got a wait ahead and the sooner we start the better.”



Without a clue who was down there with her, my hand, slippery with sweat, pulled the door open ever so gently and, refusing to let my brain think it through, I stepped stealthily into the stairwell.  And, to this day I don't know what the hell I was thinking.



Hillary spoke, “When Bill left here in ’68 he knew big things were in store for him, just like Barry feels over in Chicago.  But, we can’t forget what we’re really about.  That clown John Paul’s time will be up soon and the families will be one again with a new Duce at the head.”



“Barry’s ready for that.  I’m ready, too.  I accept the rite and all that it entails.”



Who was this other person Hillary was talking to?  I crept down the stairs as slowly as I could until I could just begin to make out her face.  Her strong, even manly black features balanced mischievous feminine eyes that switch from stunning to withering in a temperamental instant.  I’d learn several days later that this was Michelle Obama.



Hillary cleared her throat and produced a small, yellowed book from her coat pocket and, drawing a deep breath, began reading in a solemn, serious voice.



“In 1430 our Endless Mother, Joan d’Arc, was accused of mating with Dunois’ donkey, among other blasphemies.  The fraudulent church of course could not understand the ritual of Saturn and so wanted to squash it, even though it secretly arose from their very own pope’s perverted sacredness.  This honor, this privilege of uniting Heaven and Earth remains to the sisterhood even today.”



WHAT?!  I gasped and felt for a moment like I was going to pass out while trying to process this unprocessable information.  Were they pausing?  Had they heard me?  Fear numbed my panic as I steadied myself on the railing and waited, desperately hoping they would continue, uninterrupted.



“Sister Michelle, the Seven Starred House was come to meet with yours today.  We have brought the Golden Ass, as has been ordained.  Prove your submission to greater path of the Order and in this moment wed the donkey with your gifts.”



It was then that my stupefaction cleared sufficiently for me to see that Michelle was wearing a long, light brown robe, several shades lighter than her own chocolate tone.  The robe had a silver fringe and lowered hood and, with me more in shock than had I been abducted by aliens, she pulled the robe cord open and stepped smoothly into pure nakedness as the robe fell behind her.



Her supple, muscular body stood erect, her pear-like breasts attenuated with her gaze, which was directed at something just out of sight.  Past the point of no return, I lowered myself downward, scooting a couple stairs until I saw something I had not seen since College Point, a gray Cypriot Donkey.



Hillary led the donkey to Michelle with a silver-looking rope attached to his tack.  It was easy to see that the donkey was a “he”; the donkey had an enormous grey and white penis longer than its ears sticking out between his furry legs.



Now, growing up in Texas, I’ve seen plenty of animal cocks and they don’t just go sticking out unless there is a female animal of their kind around or they’ve been specially trained to breed, like for artificial insemination.  This donkey, with his hard cock easily as long and thick as my whole arm had been trained for sex and what happened next made that doubly clear.



Michelle put her forehead to the donkey’s and cooed, scratching his ears before sidling along him and kneeling, her sable hands massaging his rear leg in circles that inched towards his cock.



“Hurry, Michelle.  There’s more to the ritual and little time.”



Ms Obama didn’t look up at Hillary, but nodded and smoothly stroked her hands across the beast’s leg to his massive, curved shaft.  She gripped the donkey’s huge member with both her hands together and milked it forwards towards the glans.  The donkey’s eyes blinked rapidly and Michelle, without hesitation, bent her face towards the donkey dick, opened her mouth very wide, and began licking and sucking on the pulsing head of his cock, still stroking his giant root.



Hillary meanwhile removed her pantsuit and stepped into some kind of metallic shorts with complex silver and golden patterns.  Attached to the front of these shiny bloomers was a large but short, tawny white cock made from what looked like ivory.  Hillary dipped her hand into a metal bowl of oil and liberally coated her artificial phallus.



“Let Heaven and Earth meet and the animal and divine again reign in passionate, frothing ecstasy,” she incanted as she got behind Michelle, who was on all fours as she continued to ardently give the donkey head and a handjob.



With an “amen” from both women, Hillary pushed the ivory cock into Michelle’s frizzy pussy and Michelle stopped sucking just long enough to emit a moan before she returned, smiling now, to felating the donkey.  Hillary looked down with unabashed pleasure as she fucked her initiate, writhing in pleasure as the donkey’s slippery pre-cum began to drip from Michelle’s dilated lips.



I’m not proud of what happened next.  In fact, I’m very ashamed of it and I wish it wasn’t part of the story.  But, when I decided to tell the world about what happened, I determined then to state the whole truth and not leave anything out.  Even the most embarrassing parts.



I’ve had a lot of time to think about it and I think I was extremely sexually repressed when this all happened.  Lee and I hadn’t fucked in weeks and growing up Southern Baptist the only thing worse than fucking was dancing.  I’m not saying it as an excuse, but keep in mind that I was, I think, more horny during that winter than probably any other period of my life.  And, we all know, Bill Clinton included, that being horny can affect one’s judgment.



Point being, I was in such shock seeing the extremely lewd acts in front of me that I hadn’t even noticed that my right hand had strayed to between my legs and down my panties.  My knee-length skirt was hiked carelessly to the side and my fingers pressed hard on my pubis as I slid my fingertips up and down across my slippery clit and sopping pussy lips.



I may have been even more surprised by the sight of my finger fucking myself to such obscenity than the otherworldly scene in front of me.  But, I couldn’t stop.  And, even if I could, I didn’t want to.  My hand thrusted up and down between my legs and I arched forward, beginning to cum as Hillary quickened the pace of her fucking Michelle and both women sung their ecstatic rite.



Just as I reached my orgasmic tipping point, strong, large hands gripped each arm and literally lifted me off the seat of the stairs and started downstairs!  I yelled instinctively, but one of the brutes stuffed a musky soft fabric into my mouth and I could only procure a muffled objection.



Then, to my abject horror and yet indescribably relief, I peed myself in front of the two woman as my captors reached the bottom of the stairs.  My face flushed with fiery embarrassment as I felt the hot, wet piss stream all over my legs and ass, soaking my skirt and dripping on to my flats.



When I opened my eyes, both women and the donkey were in the same gyrating sexual dance and the two Secret Service creeps were holding my arms.  Hillary smiled at me and licked her lips.



“Every ritual needs a sacrament.  You look worth every penny we paid that moronic husband of yours.  Don’t worry.  We won’t hurt you,”  Hillary stated authoritatively, “but, you’ll need to play your part for this to be fun.  And, just to erase any doubts about what you’re worth, you’ll be getting a generous... kickback.”



She laughed and the agent to my left roughly pulled a huge wad of cash from his jacket, throwing it on the ground in front of me.  Without delay, the men led me to a thick wool blanket and firmly lowered me to it.  The one who had produced the cash now took out a small tool, like a box cutter and in smooth, professional movements cut my clothes from me in a matter of seconds.  Suddenly naked laying on the bed, the Secret Service men stood up at my sides and the women eased to a stop in their bestial sex and stood up together.



Striding towards me, Michelle Obama soon stood over my recumbent figure, each of her feet by a shoulder of mine.  She got to her knees and squatted her dark pink pussy over my face, leaning forward and balancing herself on the back of a chair.



“Lick my pussy, heathen.  Make me cum with that philistine mouth of yours,” she commanded with beguiling strength as she pulled the gag, which turned out to be a pair of green panties, from my mouth and lowered her steamy cunt on to me.



I had never been with another woman, but I was too far gone now to do much else other than comply and so I raised my face to her glistening pink pussy and licked it like I had many times wished my own pussy to be licked.  Her pussy smelled like cantaloupe and it was wet with her slippery horniness, which soon covered my lips and chin as she slid her crotch back and forth over my fluttering tongue.



As I began to suck on her large clit, I felt my legs being pushed open and Hillary’s hands traced their way from behind my knees down to my ass cheeks.  Squeezing my buttocks and stretching my asshole open, her hands slid from my ass to meet at my aching pussy.  Still very slick with my piss and horniness, she slid three fingers from her left hand into my hole as her right hand slathered more oil on her strap-on cock.



Hillary pushed the head of the ivory cock into my tight pussy, stretching it to a barely comfortable fullness as the top of her pussy pushed hard onto mine with each thrust on her attached dildo.  Michelle grabbed my hair and pushed my face hard into her pussy as I heard motion around me.



“Oooooohhhhhhh...... YEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!”



Michelle came hard on my nearly smothered face and when I emerged for air I saw that the two agents had positioned the donkey over us, with his huge cock dangling right behind Michelle’s ass as the men stroked it and their own poles, which at some unseen point they had unzipped and begun masturbating.



Hillary leaned back allowing them room as she started fucking with deeper, longer strokes and the men’s hands dripped oil on my exposed belly as they moved the donkey’s cock just a couple inches from Michelle’s asshole.  One of the men begin probing two of his fingers in the nubile woman’s butt, generously lubricating it.



Soon all four fingers on his hand slid easily in and out of Michelle’s asshole and were replaced with the fat, oblong head of the donkey’s cock.  Michelle quickly vibrated her fingers on her clit as the men began pushing the huge penis into her ass.



“Mmmmm.....   Oooooohhh.....   More!!”



The men continued to slide their hands up and down the donkey’s shaft and balls, allowing the donkey only to enter about five or six inches into Michelle’s yielding asshole.  The future First Lady propelled her ass up and down on the animal’s dong, matching the rhythm of Hillary who was getting more and more vocal as she pushed her ivory cock into me.



“Eat my pussy, you heretic!” Michelle said as she roughly pulled  my head back up to her pussy.



As if in response, Hillary announced while she thrust her cock into me faster and faster, “the most sacred part of the ritual now begins!  Let us mix the profane and the sacred, the dirty and the clean, until we are one with the gods.  Purify us with what is taboo.  Expose our souls to the most divine truth: the mundane!”



All four of these shocking Bacchanalians then said together, “amen”, and even the donkey brayed as it came, overflowing Michelle’s lovely ass with thick squirt after squirt of donkey cum that poured out all over my breasts, belly, and down to the tops of our copulating pussies.  Michelle thrust her butt outwards over me as the animal spunk spilled from her gaping asshole and grunted, discharging a loud, wet fart from her rear.



She grunted again, and a huge squirt of donkey cum, mixed with her fresh brown shit exploded from her asshole and onto Hillary’s breasts and face.  Hillary licked her lips and slid downwards to lay right on top of me as Michelle moved forward.



“Mmmmmmmmm.....  Kiss me, disbeliever,” Hillary Clinton ordered as our bodies smeared the wet, slimy mess of donkey cum and shit between us and she tongue kissed me vigorously.


I could taste the sourness of Michelle’s shit in the salty glaze of donkey cum as Hillary fucked me faster and faster.  With a reckless abandon I’ve never felt before or since, our lusty, smelly rutting mounted to a mammoth orgasm Hillary and I shared for what seemed like minutes as my mind flooded with the most intense pleasure I’ve ever dreamed of.



When I awoke, I was in a warm, clean blanket and had been cleaned of all sign of what happened.  I never again saw or spoke to Hillary, Michelle, or either Secret Service men, but I was given the wad of cash and a very clear message that I would never be believed if I tried to tell anyone so why mess up my own life trying to mess up theirs.



I left D.C. that night, divorced Lee in a record two weeks, and moved to Belize before Spring where I’ve lived ever since.  I don’t intend to mess up anyone’s life by revealing this story and I’m sure you won’t believe me.  But, it certainly gives me at least something to think about when I figure that the Monica Lewinsky affair was probably the least scandalous thing about the White House.  And, even when it wakes me up in the middle of the night, I’d rather finger myself remembering that day than eat fried chicken.

r82ps,27,2012-03-22,There is hope. My update 7 weeks later. ,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r82ps/there_is_hope_my_update_7_weeks_later/,"Hey r/leaves! I hope this post finds everyone in good health and fighting the good fight against MJ addiction. This sub-reddit greatly aided me in my endeavor to quit seven weeks ago. I would like to relate my experiences with MJ addiction up to now.




I have smoked since I was 17. I did not start the heavy abuse till I was 21. I started smoking MJ daily along with tobacco in the form cigarettes and spliffs (MJ and Tobacco). I really lost motivation for anything. My addictions genesis can be placed on breaking with my girlfriend of 3 years. This is a big pitfall by me, I turned to MJ to cope with our problems. I lost motovation to succes or do anything really. 




I began playing World of Warcraft, pretty seriously too. I started raiding 4 nights a week and toking. Combining those two addictions is far worse than any type of addiction I have experienced before. I was in my own dream world, a hazy fog with only the pursuit of purple pixels in my immediate future. I started to think more and more that my life's ambition of getting a minimum paying job and playin WoW was a reasonable one. 




I stopped playing WoW after I had a depressive episode. I crashed really hard people. Taken out of school a semester before graduation, put on anti-depressants and started seeing a psychiatrist. My parents, bless their souls, really helped pull me out. However, I still toked.




 I went back to university to finish my last semester. I decided not to smoke for my last semester. I was a semester from graduating prior to my bout with depression. Thus, upon my return all my friends were gone. It was a lonely semester but it allowed to focus on work. It was during this time that I realized my reliance on drugs (MJ prior, anti-depressants and tobacco) really messed with me. I quit my anti-depressants cold turkey but still smoked cigarettes. I graduated and returned home.




 I had graduated from university with a degree in a field I did not wish to pursue. I began to be interested in politics and realized that I wanted to make a difference in the government by helping to get decent individuals elected to office. After graduation, I landed an internship on a prestigious senatorial campaign staff for the summer with hopes of receiving a full-time position. 




But I also returned to smoking pretty often with friends. Towards the end July, my smoking spiraled out of control. I quit my internship because of that all too familiar lack of motivation. I was playing video games and started working at a restaurant as a waiter to supplement my video game and MJ purchases. I subsequently quit the job a month later due to heavy MJ use that rendered me useless.




During this time I met a girl who I began dating. Unlike any girl I have met, she understood and tolerated my MJ and tobacco habits. I only smoked with her once so all the other times I was with her, I was sober. The time I spent with her allowed me a glimpse of the other side of life that I used drugs to shy away from. The life of love and happiness generated by being with another person who understands your soul. I tell you this because she was/is my support system. 




In January of this year I made a promise to myself to quit cigarettes. I did it and have not smoked once since December 31st. I supplemented my cold turkey quit of tobacco with heavier MJ use, browsing r/stopssmoking for support and talking to my girlfriend about all the feelings I had been going through. Anyway, the MJ abuse full blow. It got to the point where I did not want my parents knowing I smoked MJ so I would hit my bowl in the bathroom that had an exhaust while sitting on the toilet. I felt like shit while on the shitter-a new low.




Finally, in February I decided to quit MJ. I came here to r/leaves for support. I quit cold turkey on Febraury 1st because I was unemployed, living at my parent's house, felt like a sack of shit and just generally sad about where I was in life. I had to make moves at some point. 




So I began my journey to sobriety. I frequented r/leaves everyday. This sub-reddit helped me immensely through the tough times when I would want to give in. Your stories assured me withdrawal was just as bad as 
I felt it was. I am confident in saying that MJ withdrawal is the hardest addiction I have ever kicked. It is harder than tobacco, anti-depressants and pain killers for me at least. It really sucked. I was angry, irritated, emotional and all sorts of sucky for 3-4 weeks. 




At the behest of this community I began working out and looking for jobs. I was productive, that's key. I found that you have to replace the time you spent smoking MJ with something else. I had a support system with my girlfriend. I talked to her about all the feelings I had going through this process and she listened. She was the rock I leaned on during these hard times. 




All my best friends smoked as heavily as I did, so I was hanging out with them less and less. It's tough as balls to be in the MJ smoking environment when you are trying to quit. I didn't hang out with them for the first 2 weeks of me quitting MJ. It's not a sign of weakness, just a necessary step. 




Anyway, after quitting MJ I started to feel the positive affects. The lift of a foggy haze, the renewed energy, one less mouth to feed (weed) and finally, the improved mental capacity. 



So now the update of how I am doing in life now. I have been doing fantastic. I got a job on a congressional campaign staff in a Republican district that has the very real possibility of going from Red to Blue. And I'm on the blue side. I moved out of my parents house. I work from 9am to 8pm everyday doing what I love. I have natural highs and lows during the day but the highs are a lot more frequent. I have really excelled however. They love me here and in my short time here, I was already promoted. I was told if I keep my level of work up then they'll have no choice but to keep moving me up and giving me more responsibility.    The hours are long but for the first time in a long time I feel happy in my life. 




I'm going to conclude this by saying, thank you r/leaves. I show all my friends who asked me how I quit, this sub-reddit. Everyone who posts here, whether you receive a response/upvote or not, are doing a great service to those in need. 




From the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping me. It's been a long journey so far but I have no plans on stopping this car ride that we call life-the sights are too damn beautiful."

ra6gb,4,2012-03-23,Any other musicians going to the South FL Music Get Together? Check it out if you haven't heard of it.,[deleted],Miami,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/ra6gb/any_other_musicians_going_to_the_south_fl_music/,"Hey, fellow artists (or curious redditors who clicked the link). Just wanted to make you aware of the upcoming Get Together for musicians and anyone in the scene. It's going to be at Churchill's Pub, Wednesday, March 28.

I'm not a promoter or organizer for the event, I just happened to attend the one last month and found it to be great help and a lot of fun. This will be the third, and they do it every month at a different venue. There are other bands to meet, bloggers, reviewers, radio interns, promoters, venue owners, etc... It's not a competitive environment at all, unlike feeling like I need to gather a show before another band, it's just a fun get together to make connections in the scene.

[Here is the Facebook event.](http://www.facebook.com/events/192901717480202/)

[And the get-together page.](http://www.facebook.com/flmusicgettogether)

I know Miami has a lot of great musicians and I've seen some in r/miami. The only thing I think I need to warn is that if you're a producer/dj/primarily electronic artist, you might not have the warmest welcome. It's great for indie, punk, metal, whatever. Basically if your music would be played in a club and not a venue. This isn't my opinion, just a lot of the members have that ""if it's a computer, it must be easy"" mentality stuck to them. But let's not comment on that here."

r9vpl,3,2012-03-23,What else can I do to make her happy?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/r9vpl/what_else_can_i_do_to_make_her_happy/,"My girlfriend is 25 and I'm 26. We've been together for about a year and a half. We've gone through a lot together and we love each other. At the time we started dating I was in school and she was in graduate school. I was being supported by my parents so I could afford to take her out on dates and to dinner. Since I graduated I've been supporting myself and through a series of unfortunate events was forced to move out of the rent free accommodations I was staying while attending school (my grandma's house) and am working for $8 an hour. 

I can barely pay my rent and bills now and usually we have been splitting the bill when we do go out, but for a period of time she was the one to pay as I was unemployed. She has brought up the fact that she has to pay numerous times and I try to explain to her that I just cannot afford to take us out. She knows that my patents were supporting me at the beginning of our relationship and I guess she got used to being treated that way, me paying for everything. 

She constantly says we don't see enough of each other (twice a week sometimes more) but we both work full time, her at an unpaid internship while getting her masters and receiving loan money. I try to explain that we are both working now and it won't be like it was when we were in school. She says it's not a relationship.

She also constantly brings up marriage and while I do discuss it with her and tell her that I do see us being together in the future, I don't quite understand the point of marriage if we aren't planning on having children. It doesn't mean I don't believe in it, I just feel like no way am I ready for that and I don't like feeling pressured to do something because society says you should. Maybe I'll come to understand it more when I get older but I honestly think there is no benefit to marriage in this modern world.

She is a great girl and I am happy being with her but lately it has been difficult, she has said she isn't happy, mainly because she has had to pay when we go out. Now mind you I am the one that is doing the driving always, with gas at $3.99 a gallon, I am always the one to visit her, that doesn't seem to factor in for her. She compares me to her ex boyfriend who sounds like a loser bum who she also had to pay for everything, but he wasn't working at all. She compares him to me also when I get depressed.

I don't know what else to do to make her happy, I can't afford to buy her dinner, but I did take her to see the lorax and bought her five guys recently so I mean I am trying. I feel like we get along great and always have fun when we are together. 

There is one other thing that is starting to get to me now. We haven't had sex. She is a virgin and has cerebral palsy and each time we attempted it hurt her too much. She went to her obgyn and got a gel that will numb her so it won't hurt her so much because she is extremely tight. We do perform oral on each other but no penetrative sex. I have been a very patient boyfriend and have never pressured her or made her feel guilty about it but I do not know how much longer I can go without. I am a very sexual person, her not as much. I just want to have sex with my girlfriend whom I love. I feel like that could be taking its toll on us also.

I know that was a lot to read but I needed to vent. Other than those things we really have great communication overall and we rarely fight. Any advice would be appreciated.

TLDR: girlfriend of a year and a half upset that I can no longer afford to pay for everything. Insistent on talking about marriage when I'm not ready or in a good place to even consider it. Have yet to have penetrative sex.

r9pze,1,2012-03-23,"This time, I'm going for greater than the gold.",jrk08004,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/r9pze/this_time_im_going_for_greater_than_the_gold/,"Hello there. I've stumbled upon this subreddit multiple time lately from various other subreddit comment threads. Usually these threads show a complete lack of understanding for this type of goal, but I understand well. I'll tell my tale, with hope that it can continue to help, as I had never fully revealed everything until now. Sorry if this is a bit long.


I'm new to this subreddit, but not new to the idea. With a strong background in Roman Catholicism, I have always been *against* doing these things, but had found that it was becoming more difficult to stop. Sadly, when I was around 10, I stumbled upon pornographic content while looking for a certain video game online. This of course led to my inevitable and eventual downfall. Over the years it would get worse, sometimes multiple times a day I would indulge. At the end of the 8th grade, my Godfather died at 56. I was quite close to him, even though we lived far apart. It started to get worse from there. 


However there was some light at the end of the tunnel.


I went to a Catholic High School, where I somewhat quickly obtained the nickname ""Pope"", because of my questioning if I should become a priest or not. At first I think they were trying to make fun of me, but little did they know at the time that I appreciated it because it was helping me realize that I'm supposed to be an example. I tried really hard to quite porn and fapping. At the end of the year I went to a summer religious retreat that had a talk about all of this stuff. They were rather cool about it: There was no ""STOP OR YOU'LL BURN IN HELL!!"" speech, but rather a ""We've all done it, we all know why, but there's a better solution than continuing down that path"". After that summer I stopped viewing pornography. This was a wonderful success, because at least I wouldn't be corrupting my mind with new images.


The next year, new summer, the term ""Pope"" had become a term of endearment for me instead of slight mockery, as everyone knew me by this name. I managed to stop swearing, using curse words after this year. I know this isn't entirely related, but it's a form of self-control for sure.


Junior year rolls around, and I'm focusing extra hard on trying to stop. This is difficult, but one of the reasons is that I don't want to be reliant on physically pleasuring myself for sexual relief, and instead be able to transform these feelings into love for the girl that I had not met yet. Romantic eh? Well, I wasn't letting myself date in high school because it would've been quite a bit of extra work. Also, I lived 45 minutes from school, so it was unlikely that I'd find anybody close-by there. The year ends, but no definite success.


Senior year is here. I manage to go entire days without doing anything. I remember the amount of time I could go without getting longer. At first 1 day before relapse, then 2 days, then 4. Before I knew it I was going a week or two without relapsing. I was on the fast track for success. I picked up a game of DDR to help exercise to, since I was a bit overweight, and focused more time into exercise and less into sexual thoughts. I lost 47 lbs (~25 kg) (242 down to 195 (~120 down to ~98)) by the time college started. I was going months at a time without any urges.


It was at this time that I met the girl who is now my fiancée (we've been dating for 3 years and 7 months. After I met her I hadn't done anything for 4 entire months and then some, when winter break hit and I was overcome with boredom. Saddened by that defeat but still determined, I kept trying to fight it. I never hit 4 months again, though I had been able to often go about a month at a time without. She and I have never had sex, and won't until we're married in another 2 years. We both want to graduate from college, and have traditional Catholic views about our marriage. (We're open to other people wanting to do whatever with theirs, for example, gay marriage is just marriage and should be allowed by the state/any churches the want to, etc. We're both fairly moderate.)


Here's were it gets bad again though. So now I'm studying abroad in Germany. Yay study abroad, but that means no seeing my fiancée for 11 months in person. The separation anxiety of only being able to see the person I love on Skype, and the lack of the human touch, has caused me to relapse immensely; throwing away almost all of the successes that I've made in the past. When I'm with her, my sexual energy is transformed into the love that I was going for earlier. Alone, however, I'm left with nothing to quell the urges. I've had days again of multiple indulgences, and days in a row of these. There have been plenty of stressors lately about housing, internships, grades, etc. I had a bout of depression, but after most of it cleared up I'm feeling a bit better. Still, I'm trying to refocus on returning to how I was when I met her; completely fap-free and proud of it. Aside from my religious reasons, I really just don't feel good about myself whenever I do it. Looking in the mirror is hard, feeling happy is hard. I want to be free from this.


I'm currently pushing 3 days of no activity. I figured one way to combat the urges is to refuse to make myself food for the following meal if I do it. While fapping does relieve some ""need"" for sexual pleasure, it doesn't seem to outweigh my brain's desire to not be hungry. I'm hoping this tactic will work. People know I like to eat, so it'll make people really suspicious if I suddenly start saying I'm not hungry during meals.


I know this was extremely wordy, but thank you for reading if you got this far. I've come here for a kind of moral support group. Being abroad doesn't let me connect with the friends I normally could in person, but I know that this group will understand for sure. If there's anybody that would like to be like a ""responsibilibuddy"" to me and I for them (I don't know if you do that kind of thing here or not), then  let me know and I'll gladly oblige. It's always easier with more than one.


This time, I'm going for greater than the gold."

The place where my computer is getting fixed doesn't have financing, which means I have to pay the $270 in full at once (I may be able to negotiate this, but I'm not sure). All this, and I have some college application fees to pay, and I have to save up money for gas because soon I'll be doing an internship where I'll travel 40 miles per trip, 3-4 days a week. 

All that said, I could use some help on this. By the end of August or the beginning of June I should have all the money to pay you back. I will be very grateful for whatever help I can get :) All with interest!

I haven't owned a car of my own(mainly because I don't want to pay insurance when I never needed it, I live on campus), but since I picked up an internship for the summer I'm going to need some of my own wheels.

Like I said, $9k is the max, $8k is more of what I'm aiming for. I'm not too picky, here are my musts:

1.) Reliable/Low Maintenance

2.) Reasonably good looks

3.) Interior better than what early 2000's American cars provided(I'm a sucker for a decent interior)

And some bonuses

1.) Little bit of power is welcomed(around 200hp)

2.) AWD

3.) If low power, good gas mileage(27~)


Imprezas and WRXs caught my eye, but seem expensive for what you're really getting. BMW E46s also caught my eye, but maintenance seems a little high even if the engine and transmission is reliable.

The only cars I've found that interest me are

2005ish Mazda3

2005ish Subaru Legacy 2.5(and possibly the turbo GT)

I was leaning more towards the Legacy 2.5GT if I can find a clean one in my price range, but was wondering why a car with a nicer interior, turbo engine, and nice exterior is cheaper than the 2005 WRX? Are there major reliability issues I'm missing? 

My commute is going to be roughly 75 miles a day."

I'm in college now, my 6th semester going for a B. Tech in IT, so I'm looking for a summer job. I've tried working in non-computer based jobs in the past, and I just don't want to waste the skills I've developed anymore. 

I'll be going back to school after the summer for a single semester, then back home to do an internship, and then start my career. I'd love to be able to do all these things within one awesome company.

Here are some of the things I'm good at:

**VMware ESXi/vSphere/vCenter** - I've been working with server virtualization for at least the past 2 years. Currently, I've got a 7 host ESXi cluster running in my home for training/lab purposes. Basically, a standalone vCenter server with 7 other boxes running ESXi 4.1. I've got neat things like DRS, FT, HA, and power DRS running on it as well. I've also got a whitebox iSCSI server to provide redundant datastores for my cluster, so I'm familiar with the working of iSCSI as well, and how ESXi interfaces with the technology (NFS too.) Currently, my cluster has 27 VMs on it. Most of them are 2008 R2 servers, along with 10 VMware View workstations. I usually only have ~7 of them running, which provide basic windows services to my home network. (AD, WSUS, game servers, server monitoring (PRTG), media storage, and HTTP/MySQL services. [Here, have a screenshot of that.](http://i.imgur.com/teh9U.png) (Awesome, right?) I've got VCP-5 training, but haven't gotten around to taking the cert exam yet. I'm working on that one.

**VMware View** - I've fiddled around with VMWare View, vmware's VDI solution, and I've got a working lab setup on my home network. Really cool stuff, and I'm pretty familiar with how one goes about setting it up and getting things running. I've also taken training for view, but haven't had the time to take the cert exam for that either.

**Windows Server 2008 (R2)** - Like I said earlier, I've got a bunch of 2008R2 servers running on my home network. I run AD DS (with a bunch of group policy stuff), DHCP, DNS, WSUS, WDS, and DFS. I've also got a contracting project coming up that involves setting up a first server solution for a local small business. Basic AD DS, WSUS, and WDS. It involves SBS 2011, not 2008R2, but they're basically the same OS. I've already got that all set up and running in a virtual machine on my workstation. So, I've got experience doing that sort of thing. Once again, I've got MCITP training, but haven't been able to take the cert exam for it yet. Oh, before I got into VMware stuff, I ran all my servers on Hyper-V inside 2008 R2, so I've got a fair amount of experience working with that as well.

**Cisco/networking** - I've got Cisco Academy CCNA training. Haven't got the cert, again, but I should be getting that *soon*. Since I've been in college, I've also been working with Enterasys network gear for the past 6 months or so, as I've been doing an unofficial internship at my college (for fun :D). Routing, switching, wireless, I love all those things. Networking is what I enjoy doing most, and what I'm trained in doing best out of all the various skills here.

Last but not least, I've got an A+ certification. I know, not the most useful in an enterprise environment, but it means I know how to diagnose/repair workstation and server systems, so that's a plus.

So, there's mostly everything about me you might want to know. If you've got questions, or an awesome job you might think I'll be interested in, just send me a PM, or send an email to n.graham1024@gmail.com. Thanks :)"

I just graduated with a marketing degree and am finishing up a marketing internship for the Australian govt in Washington. I'm adamant about not wanting to live in Washington and want to make a move to a bigger city with more opportunity in the industry. I've generally narrowed down my choice of cities to NYC and LA with the possibility of Chicago. How hard is it to get into a marketing associate/assistant or a social media role in these two cities.

Couple things:
-I've had two marketing internships in LA before as well as a marketing management role for a successful start-up in Orlando. I'm fairly experienced for a new grad and have a portfolio with some graphic design experience as well.
-I'm very mobile with some money saved. I have a truck and want to make the move and apply once I get to the location.

I know NYC has better opportunities but I've always loved LA. How much harder would you say the opportunities are for a new graduate with only a few meaningful contacts in both cities?

If anyone has any advice I'd really appreciate it!"

I'm launching an online video publication on music, culture and nightlife with a partner of mine, and we're looking to create the definitive voice for things to do in Vancouver; something you can just quickly go to and not only discover something to do for the night, but see some of the shows you might of missed and discover new sounds and places the city has to offer.

Our website is epicvan.com, which is currently in closed beta (which we show for our partners, so venues, promoters, labels and artists), it will launch within a month and a half. In it, you can find the link to our Vimeo page, in which we have a couple pre-launch sample videos.

I'm wondering if anyone would be interested in doing some volunteer videography for downtown nightclubs, people who we'd love to take on as interns and ideally put on a fast-track to pay as soon as revenue comes in.

While it's an internship, we currently offer some great perks for anyone interested in music or nightlife: we go backstage to meet the artists for a video interview, there's (of course) no cover (even for the biggest events!), free drinks (for most locations in the city), and after just one round of initiation you'll be able to bring a friend to spend the night at the event with.

If something like this interests you (you enjoy going downtown and being up late), please shoot me a message! We like to have a lot of fun, and if concerts are your thing, you will as well.

I'll of course be paying attention to this thread for any questions you may have!"

The internships are in Düsseldorf, Germany; Sweden (I still have to decide between Göteborg and Stockholm); and Osnabrück, Germany.

For one trip I want to go to Spain, France and probably Portugal. 

For the other one I'm thinking about travelling down Italy and then taking a ferry or flying over to the Greek islands.

I also want to go to the Neatherlands, Belgium and Croatia but I have to see where that would fit in best.

When do you think is the best time of year for each of those trips? Is there anywhere particular worth seeing in winter? I was thinking about working in the skifields from when I finish the last internship in Dec to when I have to go back home in Feb because I think it would be fun and relatively cost neutral.

rb03r,0,2012-03-23,"My review of Mel Gibson's new film ""Get the Gringo""",[deleted],movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rb03r/my_review_of_mel_gibsons_new_film_get_the_gringo/,"I typed up a review of this film for my internship, and  I figured some people on reddit might be interested in what the film is about/what a fellow redditor thought. I'm not a fan of the man, but his movies are usually something I enjoy to watch. This film was extremely different than Gibson's past work, but it was a solid film overall.


***GET THE GRINGO REVIEW***

Get the Gringo is unorthodox, in-your-face, and a lot of fun to watch (when it’s not trying to disturb you). It rivals other high-octane action comedies with its absurd action sequences (the shootouts often conjuring the spirit of Hot Fuzz) and its dry, often dark comedic qualities. With its macabre imagery and odd sense of humor, this film will not appeal to all audiences, but it’s the kind of enjoyable romp that most should appreciate.  
 
The film centers on an unnamed career criminal portrayed by a gritty, obscenity-spewing Mel Gibson. At the tail-end of a high speed pursuit, Gibson smashes through the US-Mexican border and ends up booked in a corrupt Mexican prison, losing the $7 million he had stolen from a San Francisco crime boss in the process. His experience on the “inside” while stateside seems to be of little value initially (“Inmates with guns? That’s something new…”), but with some tenacity and improvisation, Gibson manages to make valuable alliances and connections to the prison’s ring leaders. 

Gringo’s main source of tension comes from Gibson’s chance relationship with a 10-year-old prison-dweller, who was born on the inside and whose rare blood type makes him a valuable resource to the prison’s top criminal: Javi (portrayed by Daniel Giménez Cacho), a man who smokes and drinks in excess, and plans to use the boy as a forced liver-transplant donor. Gibson, while saying the course of rational self-interest, returns to the prison after a purchased escape to recover his money and rescue the boy and his mother along the way.  

The writing in this film isn’t always consistent, and can seem almost self-aware of its occasional campiness (“The name’s Richard Johnson”, “No sh** Sherlock”, etc.), but the quirkiness of the film as a whole keeps the occasional jarring line from creating too much dissonance. Overall, the acting is solid, especially among the Spanish-speaking actors. This isn’t Gibson’s finest performance, but his delivery reflects the film’s tone, ranging from carefree and confident assertions to deadpan comedic voiceovers (a la Nicholas Cage).  

Grunberg’s directing emphasizes the visceral qualities of the film while also enhancing the mood and tone of his scenes. Images of debauchery, sloppy drunkenness and drug-use are portrayed with shaky handheld cameras, while tight action scenes are shot with wide frames emphasizing the outrageous scope of the battle royales. There are a few very cool visual moments (the continuous single-take following Gibson as he burns down a drug den, steals its money, then stalks away) and some clever visual gags (literally “cutting the small talk” when Gibson’s conversation with a company executive abruptly cuts away to Gibson incapacitating the man) among many other moments that set the film’s visual style apart from comparable films. 

Despite its few shortcomings, Get the Gringo is a well-paced story with plenty to laugh and cringe at. This is a strange and over-the-top experience, but the solid execution makes it an experience worth having. Once you get over the barriers to entry, it’s easy to buy in to the silliness and violence. All you have to do is approach the film like Gibson’s character approaches life: “Ah, what the hell.”

And as if the name of my degree wasn't long enough I might be able to tack on a minor in math. And FYI I will probably graduate with around a 3.9. And after doing some reading about people with physical science degree's going into finance I became interested. But how hard is it to get into these top programs? How hard is it to secure a good financial internship? Anybody with a similar situation to me have a good story? Is being a ""quant"" boring as hell or is there still some intellectual stimulation? If I wanted to stay on the west coast could I or are all the jobs on the east coast?"

rg6su,1,2012-03-27,My weekend from hell.,JackOhBee,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rg6su/my_weekend_from_hell/,"Reddit, this will be long and rambley. You have been warned.


I have been with my girlfriend for nearly 2 years, we met last summer and hit it off right away. Within 2 weeks of meeting I pretty much moved in with her for the rest of the summer, and it was the best time in my life hands down. We have two completely different views on the world and have completely different beliefs. I am a left winged, stoner and atheist while she is very religious, right winged anti weed girl. We didn't care, we loved each other for who we are and our differences have never triggered fights but thought out conversations. At the end that first summer was our first major challenge, she was going back to school which was a 4 hour drive away. We were both scared that it wouldn't work, that we would grow apart, find someone else or even just forget about each other. That wasn't the case, we made it work and it worked out great, we would skype every night and once a month one of us would make the drive to see each other. By the time summer came again everything was amazing, she even got an internship in town so she was here from May until January.


This is when everything started going wrong. As a graduation gift her family was sending her on a 6 week back packing trip to Europe where should would be traveling by her self for the entire time. Her parents told her to book everything and they would pay for it all. During the coarse of the 7 months she was here for her internship she would go on and on every day about how I have no idea how excited she was for this trip, even when she was dropping me off at the airport to visit Disneyland for the first time in my life, she told me I have no how excited she was for ""the vacation I've dreamed of my entire life."" Now I know you guys have no idea who the hell I am but I'm 24 years old and my entire life I've dreamed of going to Disneyland and riding the Matterhorn. 

Christmas comes and she books her plane tickets for the Europe trip. She graduates school 4/28 and her flight is leaving 5/1. I would only have 1 full day with her before she would leave for 6 weeks. Wanna know what makes this better? My birthday is 5/12. We've been together long enough at this point for her to keep that in mind when booking the reservation. Her flight home would be landing at 8PM on our anniversary too. Not only am I going to be alone on my birthday, but I'm really not going to see here to celebrate our anniversary.

THE PLOT THICKENS, just before she leaves for school again she tells me that she was been accepted to teach English in Spain for 9 months, meaning she would miss the following birthday too. She claims that its been her life dream to do this, even though when we started dated her life goal was to move to Washington DC to work for the government. I told her that I didn't want to go but I would support her no matter what she chooses. I was worried that being that far away for that long that she would meet someone, either start a relationship or even just a one night stand. I know how paranoid I sound with that but I don't think its out of line to have those fears.

This is where the weekend from hell begins. It's Valentines Day week and I'm driving up to see her on the 15th. (I'm the guest services supervisor for a major hotel and getting vday off was impossible.) I was up all night working on making her that melting crayon thingy that was all over the front page of reddit that week, stressing because it wasn't working out and I didn't want to show up empty handed. I got to WalMart and spend over $50 on Vday swag (at 70% off mind you) so I can have something for her. The moment I get into town my car dies. Dies. As in the mother aint coming back. She picks me up from where I was and we enjoy our evening together. The next day she had class so I stayed at her place until she was done. While I was alone I played around with her iPad and found emails that she had been sending to some guy. She made plans to meet up with him and even ended one email with ""I'll buy condoms on the way so we don't have to use yours."" This was sent before Xmas, when she was staying in MY house. These emails when on for a few months and she even said in one emails ""I feel guilty even though I shouldn't because we are both clearly attracted to each other."" I confronted her right away when she got home and the nasty fight that you can imagine came about. She claims that nothing happened and I did find that to be genuine. She sobbed and begged at my feet for a hour to forgive her, that I was the love of her life and she fucked up and didn't want to loose me. 

All I wanted to do was get away, be alone and process everything that had happened. But i couldn't. My car was dead in the shop, and it wouldn't be ready for 5 days. This is college housing, she had no couch for me to even sleep on. I never got a moment alone, not to cry, not to think, not to be angry at the world. She was always there apologizing non-stop the entire weekend. I shut down and went into autopilot in a way I never have before. I just went on almost as if nothing ever happened. We fucked, went out to dinner, and even at the Vday chocolates I bought her. I thought maybe my car dying was a sign from the universe that we were going to be ok and grow from this, become a stronger couple then we were before. I didn't want us to end, but once I got the phone call that my car was ready I knew it was over. I knew that would be the last time I would kiss her goodbye. I didn't want it to be but I knew deep down that it was over. We didn't break up, we tried to work it out. Spring break was a week and a half later and she was going to be back in my town. We made plans to meet at Disney World, but the night before she said she forgot and made plans with her friend to go to the parks. I meet up with them in the park and the moment I saw her I felt nothing. I was empty and hallow, I couldn't even go into my autopilot bullshit self to get through the day. I couldn't take it any more and ended up breaking up with her in the parking lot in front of her best friend.

I was a wreck for weeks and I'm still not my normal self. I still love and care for her deeply, I even reached out to her last night to extend my compassion for her hurt. I don't hate her, I know how cliche it is but she was my best friend and i do not want to loose that friendship. I want her in my life, but not in a romantic way. With the distance I can see now that she wasn't the right match for me, just as i'm not the right match for her. But this is still rough, I honetly saw myself marrying her. We had plans to move across the country together, to start a life together, and now here I am. Alone, with no plans for my future. I was putting all of my eggs in that basket and now I don't know what to do with myself. I'm seriously considering just saying ""fuck it"" and moving California to get as far from here as possible. 

Im not sure if this is the right subreddit or not, I don't know what advice I could even be give. We broke up, we are over. But I miss her. I still love her. I can't stop thinking about her.

For those of you that read this, thanks for listening (reading?) me ramble on and on. I just don't know what to do with myself, but even just typing this all out has helped me feel a little better."

I am unsure if I would be a prospect for Big4 or If I should focus on networking with the other firms. I have a 3.7 cumulative gpa but no work experience and slightly barren resume.

If any recruiters or professionals could weight in on a few questions it would be greatly appreciated.

- What are some make or break issues during an interview for you? (Grades, personality, manners, etc.) I was told by a recruiter that during an interview she was asked other locations of company offices and it immediately ruined the candidates interview.
- What is your favorite question to ask during a interview or unique questions you have been asked?
- What should I focus on when talking to recruiters? (being friendly, showing myself as being professional, getting my name in their head, etc.)
- What question have you been asked by a student that made them stand out and helped them create a good impression with you?
- What qualities from recent candidates assured you to offer them a position or internship?

However, I have a long-term overseas farm internship coming up and will inevitably be using it less for the Android functionality and more for the reading, and I'd like that battery life boost that comes with the eInk screen. So, I'd like to slim down to a Simple Touch (preferably with case).

 I’m a mom with 2 kids (4 if you count SO’s kids who we have a lot) 
One of those kids being a new baby 3 months old. 
Last October I was giving a raise and promotion at my job. Basically doing the same thing that I had been doing but more money and better title. 
Last Wednesday I was offered a position in my dept, supervisor position that is…..

I would still be reporting to the same people, who I like and enjoy working with. 
I would be supervising the team that I have worked with for years. I’ve always sort of been in an authority position just without the title. I like these people for the most part. 

Here are my worries. I would have to spend the next few months learning the new role and would probably have the position official by end of summer. (Which means I don’t think I would see a pay increase till the end of the summer, nor a shift change, I asked to go to four tens.)
I would spend less time at home because my hours would change to 830 to 500 (if they don’t approve schedule change) and occasionally staying late to close down the building when needed. (probably not too often though) possibility of travel about once every 3 months. The added stress of being a new supervisor to people that I was on equal field with previously. Feeling like I was losing out on my baby’s milestones. 
Stressful evenings because of cooking, cleaning, taking care of baby with getting home later. Boyfriend does help me out but I feel like the role of mom should be left to me. 
SO is also moving up in his company and is in management training 3 days a week with other managers (he is not a manager yet but they have been prepping him for that position) My commute sucks, its 45 to 50 mins each way. 

I cried after picking up my daughter from daycare (3rd day). I get so sad when someone else is telling me about her day. Thankfully I didn’t cry till I got home. It really bothers me that I’m not there with her. 

SO makes really good money a lot more money than me, we can technically survive on his income alone. My income is just extra money that would pay for daycare, fixing up the house, vacations, maybe a minivan in the near future. Even if I were to take this job I would still not come close to what SO makes. If I were to quit we would have to cut down on certain things, we already cancelled cable, and we don’t eat out often. On paper budget wise I could stay home. 
I would lose my really great insurance. 

I was considering being a sahm and was pretty set in my decision just didn’t know when to put in my notice because of my help being on maternity leave as well and a couple other people have gotten promoted in my dept and we are down people. I wanted to leave the company on good terms and feel guilty if I were to leave at a bad time. 

The pro’s are- I would be making more money. I think I would get about a $2 or $3 raise, maybe more my boss wasn’t sure because it wouldn’t be his decision. I would be salary. 
This is good for my career. I put myself through school as a single mother paying cash the entire time for a bachelor’s degree so I wouldn’t have student loans. I graduated in April of 2011. I worked my butt off going to school full time and working this job full time while also maintaining a house and mothering my teenage daughter (she is 15) 
A little background so no one is confused. My boyfriend and I moved in together in August of last year so I was no longer a single parent at that point. We bought a house in Dec of 2011 and have been living and parenting our children very happily ever since. 

SO and I have talked and talked about this, ( I thought it was coming with being offered the new job) SO is a ‘provider’ his words and would rather have me sah. However he says he will support me in whatever decision I make. 

I’m so stressed over this and honestly feel like I’m stuck in a rut. My boss told me that I’m the only person internally that they are considering for this job and if I don’t accept it they will hire outside the company. 

The company I work for is actually really great, pretty family oriented. We get lots of vacation time and days off and the benefits are pretty good in this economy. 
I’m already vested in the company with my 401k, and once I’m here 7 years ( in Jan 2013) I will start accruing 2 days off a month instead of 1 ½, in addition we usually get about 15 days off a year paid for holiday, work shuts down over Christmas for minimum of a week. 
Plus my teenage daughter may be allowed to intern this summer in a different department. My bosses are looking into it currently. She would be making 10 an hour and she is excited to be able to work and put the money away. 

My work will not allow me to work from home, and will not allow me to switch my schedule to better accommodate my life at this point. 
Advice PLEASE!!!

It's for retail folks who have to manually count out a cash drawer at the end of the night. It accepts the amount of each piece of money in the till, as well as the total to be left for the next day, and outputs an array that tells them what to pull! 

Right now it's setup with a ""presentation"" index page that asks for user input. That input gets put over to a ""business"" changemaker page that verifies the data and then runs the functions and outputs a the message to pull.

I am interested in applying for the scientific research summer internship position that was listed through the University of ___ Career Services Office. I am sending my resume, so you can determine whether I qualify for the Internship with the Urban Wildlife Institute.


I have had a great deal of laboratory experience in chemistry, biology, physics, soils, and ecology. My laboratory experience pertains to both field techniques as well as indoor lab skills. I possess excellent troubleshooting skills which can assist with trapping, using remote-triggered cameras, radio equipment, and almost all essential computer skills needed for the position. In addition to assisting with the wildlife research, I can easily work well with other in a group project, as well as working individually on a project, where I have done so in the many Environmental courses I have taken. As a Natural Resources and Environmental Science major I believe I am qualified by my knowledge of Ecology, the Illinois fauna, and my commitment to wildlife conservation. Also, as an active member of the Illini foresters and Red Bison two environmental clubs at the University of Illinois, where I participate in wildlife management, and the conservation of fields in the Champaign area, there we steward areas with some lopping and pruning. 


I believe that I would an asset to your program. This internship would provide me with the ideal opportunity to assist at your organization and to expand my research skills. I am willing to whatever institute related activities as necessary, as well as work outside and early morning hours. If so, I hope to schedule an interview at a mutually convenient time. I look forward to speaking with you.
Thank you for your consideration.

advice?",ferrarisnowday,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/rgxei/shafted_by_my_schools_internship_requirement_any/,"I'm writing this partially to vent and partially to ask for advice.  I'm posting this to /r/lostgeneration because I'd also like to spawn a discussion on internship requirements in general.  I think the best way for me to tell the story is chronologically in the way it happened to me.  It will be wordy, but I hope I can make it coherent so that you can follow the ups and downs.

**Jan. 2011**

Classes for my Master's program start.  I'm working through a contracting agency, not exactly happy with my job situtaion at the time.  I'm aware that my degree requires a 200 our internship in order to graduate.  I figure the school can help hook me up with companies, and it will be worth it because I can hopefully get hired in or at least make good contacts and get industry experience.  You know, the typical internship stuff.

**May 2011**

Holy shit!  I've just been hired in to a full time job directly in my current field of study!  I'm feeling awesome and am flying high.  I even begin to feel like I don't need the MS after all, but I decide to stick with it for a few reasons.  1.)  My work will pay for roughly 1/4th of it.  2.)  Should I ever switch companies, the MS will help on my resume.  3.)  An MS can also help meet requirements for higher pay grades in the future.

**August 2011**

I officially ask my advisor if I can use my current job as the internship.  He says yes, and I officially register for the internship.  I submit all the forms, and I'm officially in the class titled ""&lt;my program name&gt; internship"" (not actually a class, by the way, it's just credits).  Now, I'm a full time student that semester, but I decide to drop a class.  It was too simple, I have an Information Science undergrad degree and the first day of this class was about the difference between hard disks and RAM.  With the way my school prices credits for full time vs. part time, which could be a post in itself, I decide to postpone the internship, too -- so I drop the ""internship"" course, as well as the overly simple IT course.  Doing this rearrangement me about $3,000 on my degree overall, not just that semester.

**March 2012**

This whole time, I've been feeling ripped of that I should have to pay nearly 3 grand just for my school to acknowledge that I already work in the field.  I decide to write the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies a polite e-mail explaining how I feel.  I offer to take an extra course in lieu of the internship, as I already have far more than 200 hours of experience in the field.  Surprisingly, she says there is a form that I can fill out for a $100 fee that will give me credit for the internship since I already have the experience.  I go and get this form, but am slow to turn it in.

Side note:  why didn't my advisor know about this money saving form when I asked if I could be let out of the internship requirement!?  This is just the first example of the university showing an inability to empathize with the students and the huge costs of school.

**Later in March 2012**

I suddenly receive an e-mail from my advisor saying that the department chair has now stated that even though I work in the field, not only must I pay for the internship, I can't even used my job as the internship!  I *must* find an internship at an outside company.

* Nevermind that I already have 2,000 hours of experience directly in the field.  10x what the internship requires.

* Nevermind that you already let me actually *register* for the internship course in the Fall, using my current job.

* Nevermind that this is a program aimed towards working professionals.  Roughly 2 out of 3 students have full time jobs, many of them in the industry or even in the field directly.

* BUT MOST OF ALL:  Nevermind that I carefully budgeted and scheduled when to take my credits so that it would be as cheap as possible with my school's pricing structure.  Taking on this internship and still graduating on time could very well cost me $3,000 - via kicking me from part time to full time in my final semester.  I *could* try to cram an internship in the summer.  But frankly, I shouldn't have to.  Months ago I was told by my advisor that I wouldn't have to.  And just this month I was told by one of the Deans that I wouldn't even have to pay for anything besides a $100 exmpetion fee.  Why the dean is overridden by, or yielding to, the department chair, I have no clue.

Anybody have similar experiences?  Any advice on how to take this up or if I should just cut my losses and give up on it.

Any thoughts on why my school is so lame-brained as to require internships from people who already work in the field - even as their fellow full time students without jobs get by with just a 200 hour internship?

Any thoughs on schools requiring interships in general?  Why should students have to essentially find their own internships, and then pay the school thousands of dollars just to acknowledge it?

**TL;DR School can't get their act together about the internship requirement, probably costing me both money and time.  Misery loves company - share your stories if you have them.**

EDIT:  One last thing, the department chair has to accept and approve of a scholarly paper (mini-thesis) written by each student before graduation.  Pissing her off would be a bad move.  I need to handle this diplomatically, if I do anything at all."

Last summer I accepted an internship position with a programming consultancy out in San Francisco when I was 16. I lived with my brother over the summer, he has since moved. 

Since then I accepted a full time offer with the same company. I will be moving out to San Francisco in late June. I turn 18 in mid July. I have a few questions about the move.

Will I be able to find a place to live on my own at 17?

If necessary, I can become an emancipated minor. Will this help?

Any advice that you have is greatly appreciated, thanks!"

I'm nearly 18 and in high school. A 20-21 year old college student is doing an internship in the computer department at my school. We've chatted a bit (he's a redditor!) and I ran into him at my work... basically, I have a major thing for him but I don't really know how to approach the situation. I'd say that we're friends because we do talk whenever I go into the IT office and we joke around and stuff. Is it completely inappropriate? My last relationship was with a 23-year-old so I guess I'm not too fazed by age... my friend told me to ask him out for coffee but that's definitely crossing some sort of line. He is not a school employee - he's doing a college co-op - and it isn't illegal. Is there anything I can do, really?"

Know anyone personally at the many fine dining restaurants in Chicago? Come on in and lets help a military chef get an un-paid internship there!


**tl:dr help a Chicagoan start work for free at an excellent restaurant where he can move up the culinary ladder to excellent chef, and a paid position.** 
 

I am trying to help a Chicago friend out, he's about to get out of the military, and needs a job asap. His military occupation is a cook. His training is not Cordeon Bleu, but that's the dining he wants to create.

He is interested in working either from the bottom up in an excellent, well managed, restaurant with fantastic Chefs. He is extremely motivated and has mentioned a few times that he will work the lower levels of the kitchen hierarchy for free. He is serious. He is an all-around great guy, with common sense, wit, energy, zeal, and a practical head on his shoulders. 

Does any Chicago Redditors know anyone personally at one of the many fantastic restaurants where my friend can start for free, yet remain in that one place, while moving up the ladder to a paid position and eventually a respectable chef position.  

Thank!

riptj,16,2012-03-28,What are some good computer hardware weekly videocasts/webshows?,[deleted],hardware,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/riptj/what_are_some_good_computer_hardware_weekly/,"A while ago, maximumPC did this series called ModMen. In this show they covered a whole wealth of information in tiny little segments. They reviewd various cases, performed builds, showed off neat little products like 3M mounting tape, and even did a 100% custom PC build with CNC milled waterblocks and such.

I would like to watch some web shows along that vein. I like reviews and benchmarks of hardware, I like when people make new exciting builds for specific purposes (instead of the i5 2500k+evo212 cooler+8 gigs ram+560Ti build over and over and over). I love case modding.

I have never built my own computer, though i've been lusting after various components since 2005. I dont have the money to and I was in college so the only time I DID have the money to I spent it on a laptop. I feel that within the next year or two i'll get some sort of funds, probably from an internship or a ""fuck it, fast food"" job. I want to stay up to date and current on hardware.

Another bonus would be IT related stuff, specifically home IT. Ways to get a media server or NAS, home automation and metrics, etc. Just really cool interesting uses for computers apart from gaming and casual stuff."

I just switched from Computer Science / Math to Biotech/Pre-Professional/Math. I realized that I hated programming, and would never enjoy a future in it, so I went to one of my other dreams in life; becoming a surgeon. 

To be frank, my GPA isn't good right now (because I've been taking courses that I absolutely hated). However, in my junior and senior years, I'll only be taking classes I find interesting (physics, biotech, anatomy, orgo chem, etc...), so I'll definitely have the motivation to get the best possible grades. 

Assuming that I get good marks on my MCAT, have plenty of shadowing, hospital volunteer work, and internships, and get excellent grades after switching majors, will I have a chance of getting into medical school?

rmdct,9,2012-03-31,18 years old with credit card debt. Need some reassurance/advice here?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/rmdct/18_years_old_with_credit_card_debt_need_some/,"So my situation isn't very bad, but I am still freaked out by the fact that I will be accumulating interest on my student credit card once the APR goes from 0% to 16% next month.

Basically, I had my first internship last summer and I earned a good deal of money, $12,000. I really didn't want my parents to have to be sending me money during the school year for my soph. year so I made them a promise that I would pay all my bills, utilities, food expenses, books, health costs ETC. and only take out loans for tuition. 

Of course, over the summer I was extremely naive and ate out alot, got a ton of new clothes, bought tech toys, and didn't budget properly at all. This was also the case first semester of school because I started mindlessly using that first credit card, and it screwed me up. I have since then bought a couple of things that I shouldn't have, like a tablet PC and a bicycle to get my classes faster, but I actually have a budget... In addition, I underestimated my monthly costs like crazy, so I ended up having to get 2 credit cards. I have one card with $3K on it, whose APR will shoot up from 0% to 16% when I have to pay off the month of June in July. The other card that I am using has $1200, and has an APR of 10% for another 11 months.

I currently have a job that pays me $13.50 an hour and I can work a max of 20 hours a week (it is research, so hours are flexible) until the end of May, where I go to my internship starting June, where I will be getting paid $31/hr and definitely working 40 hours a week. 

My monthly expenses, budgetting in bills, rent, food, travel, and credit card minimum payments add up to $700 a month, which has all been going on this other card that I have.

I really want to be able to pay off these cards as fast as I can, however I need to focus on doing well in school, but I know I can't just ignore the debt right now. I guess I sort of need an action plan/advice as to how many hours I should force myself to do my research work in addition to my huge courseload in order to feel that I am working towards eliminating my debt as fast as possible?

Should I be worried here? I guess my goals here are really to A: figure out if I need to be doing more research assistance stuff to get the money faster, B: If my new budget is realistic enough, C: a good plan for if I should buy something that I feel would help me improve efficiency (like a bicycle) or if I should try and save as much as possible....


My budget:

Rent - 313$/m
Internet - 22.5$/m
Water - 15$/m
Heat/Elec - 40$/m

Food
Groceries - $120/m

Travel (going home to visit my family)
Bus or Train - $50/m

Misc expenses (shampoo, hygiene, notebooks, etc.) - $50/m

Paying off cards bit by bit - $100/m right now, will increase to $1000 once I am at my internship (is the plan)

My income:

I've been treating one of my credit cards as temporary income until my new job up until this point. BUT I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE! But judging by the responses I just need to put both of my credit cards away

It has $1400

I have $410 in the bank currently which will be going to my rent and utilities, I will also be getting a paycheck for like $150 dollars too.

My income is like this:

I get more work to do as I make myself available to my group. I want to make myself more available but I am extremely paranoid I will be stuck working and get behind in my classes, so I haven't been working nearly as much as I should have been for the past 3 weeks with midterms and such. 

Usually I would do 12 hours a week, which would bring in $600 a month. I haven't been accumulating any more debt since december, and I've been able to sustain myself for a while with this extra card helping me when I couldn't work for a week or had too much homework to do. I'm an electrical engineer at really difficult school, so I have quite a bit of school work do be doing. (thus the insane internship).  

But I feel I should be working more. Now I know I cannot rely on my cards for anything and I need to make sure to be working more to pay them off faster? I don't know... :(


Also the internship goes into the fall semester (8 months) that's why I was trying to go easy on myself with working... It is a very hacky plan though, and I need to understand better habits.


EDIT 2: I decided that I'm going to put away the cards and be extremely frugal for the next few months until I get to my new job, where I'll just pay the cards off immediately. According to my calculations I won't have more than $100 dollars of interest as long as I pay them off within 3 months of having my job. I think this is the best option for me at this point.

rlvv6,9,2012-03-30,[Update] Blood Glucose readings ... a project for science going for the next 24 hours.,abraxsis,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rlvv6/update_blood_glucose_readings_a_project_for/,"From my previous post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rdj2a/weve_discussed_glucose_levels_but_what_if_they/) you might remember that my blood glucose levels seemed strange to me. After some logging I discovered that on average my levels were staying between 101 and 104, all the time. Even when I was fasted for 8 hours. As such, I began using myself as (yet again) a human guinea pig since it piqued my interest. Below are my fasting glucose readings for the past days (including today)

* Tuesday: 103
* Weds: 105
* Thursday: 104
* This morning (Friday) reading was 111.

Then, I began my experiment. I began by getting a rich carb/sugar source that I liked, in this case apple fritters from Walmart. Literally, one of my all time favorites. Been about 4 months since I had one since they all clock in at about 40g of carbs each. Between 9am and 10am I consumed 4 of these fritters and 1x 20oz Diet Pepsi. This is approximately a carb intact of 160g inside of 60 minutes.

I went on to my internship site, an inpatient psychiatric crisis stabilization unit. I say this because they are a medical facility and often care for diabetic clients. As such, they have three glucose meters to cross check those diabetics with severe problems.

I did no exercise other than driving and walking in the building. I say on a couch in an office during a meeting. I ate nothing after the 4 fritters. After 2.5 hours had elapsed, approx. 12:30pm I proceeded to check my glucose levels on 2 of the 3 available machines plus my personal machine. Two machines gave a reading of 102 mg/dL the third registered 101 mg/dL. After 160g of carbs my levels actually DROPPED from my morning reading. Even the on-site nurse practitioner was like, ""Wtf? Youve not had carbs in weeks so it should be spiking, just a little bit at least.""

I allowed an additional hour to pass and tested again. Again, 2 of the machines read 103mg/dL and the 3rd read out 102 mg/dL.

For my science brain this just wasn't making any sense. So I trudged further and declared that today would be an official cheat day ... for science.

I ate pizza for lunch around 2pm, 1x oatmeal cream pie @ 3pm. left work at 5pm. Travelled home, ate 2x oatmeal cream pies, a bowl of reduced fat (the horror!) butter pecan ice cream, and finished the evening off with a few muncho potato chips at 7pm. I chose 7 pm so I could begin a full 12 hour fast versus the ~8hr fasts I have been doing the past week. At 9pm a glucose check on my single, at home, meter read 128 mg/dL.

At 10pm (approx. 10 minutes ago) they read 150 mg/dL. (For anyone interested my blood pressure is also elevated at this point at 138/78 mmHg and my pulse is 76, both up from my usual 120/60 and ~55bpm)

**11:30pm Update** Blood Sugar is now 117 mg/dL, blood pressure is 131/71 and my pulse is down to 68.

I am now **5** hours into my fast, I did use a small drink of non-caloric beverage to swallow some meds at 9pm and I'll likely have some cold water just before bed

**8:05am Update** Glucose reading have dropped back to 106 mg/dL. Blood pressure and pulse have returned to normal. Next step, is to the gym.

At that time, I'll resume a strict keto diet checking my levels every 2-3 hours. I'll post all of those here.

Just some random science points for those curious ... when checking on 3 meters all the blood came from a single finger with the actual lancet pricks being evenly spaced from one another in a triangular pattern. Blood was expressed and placed within each meter within 5 seconds of its exposure to air.

I realize this isn't a completely scientific test, but I think in addition to giving me a good idea of what carbs do to my system after being severely limited for so long, this little experiment let someone see how levels can change in response to what we consider significant amounts of carbohydrates. Sadly, what I have eaten today, which likely tops 500g of carbs, is what many Americans eat every single day. The stress this places on the pancreas and even the cardiovascular system is insane!

**After doing some researching I found several references to higher than normal fasting glucose levels in low carb dieters. In particular ...**
&gt;**One caveat here is that very low-carb diets will produce elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Why? Because low-carb diets induce insulin resistance. Restricting carbohydrates produces a natural drop in insulin levels, which in turn activates hormone sensitive lipase. Fat tissue is then broken down, and non-esterified fatty acids (a.k.a. “free fatty acids” or NEFA) are released into the bloodstream. These NEFA are taken up by the muscles, which use them as fuel. And since the muscle’s needs for fuel has been met, it decreases sensitivity to insulin. So, if you eat a low-carb diet and have borderline high FBG (i.e. 90-105), it may not be cause for concern. Your post-meal blood sugars and A1c levels are more important.**

* **Just a final note, Ill be editing the lower half of this post as I complete each section of the experiment. So be sure to check back tomorrow evening.**
