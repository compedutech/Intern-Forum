I find myself spending whole days on reddit out of loneliness and also aimlessness. 

I have notes from horrible community college courses (no job placement, no experience, and not even really teaching the class in a meaningful way) I have forgotten and can't bring myself to view; excel notes to untangle; and you could easily blow 500 bucks on coursera or lynda...the thought of putting it on a resume makes me sick. 

Do employers even give a shit about online courses?

...It's all for nothing. I would say it might theoretically help to keep a job...but I'm pretty stupid. I left each in-person continuing ed course more or less lost and directionless.

I left college that way nearly a decade ago; the hatred I feel for myself browsing internships *now* makes me want to jump out a window. I never even looked for one and no one adult told me the truth I know now - interning was even more important than my GPA. 

I was so **stupid**. 

Does anyone relate to this? To the  loss of time, the aimlessness, the hours lost in a stew of loneliness and queasy ADD with the knowledge none of it is really changing into a job, an accomplishment, a path out of this? 

I spend all day looking at the linkedins of old classmates, buzzing in worry and sadness from one coursera/grad school catalog/Taleo job app/recruiter email to the next - unable to finish anything because it has no fucking point. 

The cover letters have no point. The resumes edited so many times, I find - in horror - I've spent an entire day sending at a resume with 3 typos over and over again - have no point. 

The horrible realization and brooding I'm applying for a minimum wage admin position in a company where an acquaintance or a classmate or their close friend (whom I never met) that I haven't talked to in 5-10 years, based on shame and natural drift - that has no point. It's strange to think I knew and was theoretically once in the same context as so many people - same class or major - when...of course I wasn't. It makes me bitter. I know it's dumb. Can't help it.

One of my classmates in my shitty, worthless liberal arts program is not a programmer in a company where I applied to be a receptionist and has never taken a single programming course but at UConn I can see a friend let him work in a startup, probably guided him through a shitload of projects...he has a JD, and he's still programming. 

It makes me hate myself and the jealousy and anger about all of it - the importance of networking, of luck, and having being intelligent enough just to choose a path and do well in it enough to shift in the real world...I've probably last three years doing it.

And trying to mimic others now feels like a huge fucking joke. 

I have no skills and guides are horseshit. I've worked enough to know that. 

A week of experience and training with someone using software for something specific &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2,000 worth of coursework taken from Inuit or Salesforce or Oracle itself. 

It's just fucking horrible. 

It's even more fucking horrible to realize how much hope people put on learning what they can afford to and how it means nothing to employers and it has no real connection to work.

8118mz,3,2018-02-28,[HM] One More For The Trash King,DoctorLawyerJr,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/8118mz/hm_one_more_for_the_trash_king/,"**MONDAY**

Pops was a sanitation professional with thirty years in the business, a true specialist with no other discernable skills. In those decades he met the love of his life, raised three beautiful children, and kept their home and lives as clean as a sanitation professional possibly could. The whole family showered, brushed their teeth, and washed their hands exactly three times a day as a habit. And Pops was happy with this.

Pops was a proud employee of Sparkle Pimp, the city’s largest and most monopolistic cleaning corporation. They cleaned offices, schools, and Thai massage parlors. The work was straightforward, the pay was good, and the Thai gave great massages. But today was something new to Pops. Today was the very first ever volunteer day held by Sparkle Pimp, at the mandatory order of the city court. The court also gave the CEO of Sparkle Pimp twenty years in prison, but that’s a story for another day. It was a good company. Pops had faith in his long-term employer.

Pops scratched his clean-shaven, baby-butt chin as he observed the job in front of him – bathing homeless peoples, college dropouts, cave hermits, work-from-home entrepreneurs, morbidly obese superhumans, and anyone else in the city who desperately needed a bath. The city was trying to smell better, Pops concluded, and he supported this cause. Dozens of extra-large plastic tubs choked the wide alleyway, all filled to the brim with foam soap and water. Pops and his colleagues gripped their brittle brushes, ready to scrub these odorous individuals into minty-fresh model citizens.

The first round was a breeze, like cleaning the dishes, except the dishes kicked and screamed as iron brush bristles scraped the dirt from their pores. Blood power-washed away by Pops himself, these citizens were made anew as they ran away shrieking, naked into the streets. The college dropouts were now ready for employment.

Next up were the homeless peoples and cave hermits. The grumbling, gruff crowd waddled their way into the freshly-refilled plastic tubs, plopping in, turning the bathtub waters various colors unique to the individual. A few patrons dissolved completely into the soapy water, leaving a bubbling goo that a Sparkle Pimp intern emptied with a rolling fifty-gallon vacuum and drove back to headquarters for further analysis. As the rest of the homeless peoples and cave hermits kicked back in their warm foam-soap baths, Pops and his fellow cleaners lubricated their brushes with the proper solvent chemicals, ready to approach Round 2 with finesse. As his colleagues picked their favorite cave hermits, Pops eyed the remaining crowd. A scruffy, old man or woman in his or her late 50s to 80s stared back with fat squinting eyelids. His or her massive matted afro called for the iron bristles of Pops’ brush. The sanitation professional had found his match.

Confidently, Pops approached the afroed individual with precaution. He stood in front of the bath assessing the thick mass - reminiscent of a head of broccoli - as the man or woman stared back with his or her fat squint. Pops stretched on his latex gloves and safety goggles, then leaned down to apply his brush to the extraordinary afro. At the very moment his brush touched the furthest particle of hair, the man/woman shot his or her hand up, gripping Pops’ shirt collar with grimy fingers, and dunked him into the murky bathwater. Pops jerked his head out, gasping for air. The man/woman tugged him close to his or her chubby, wrinkled face. The squinted eyes shot open, blood-red, staring into Pops’ pupils. Pops flailed to no avail. Like a hair dryer of dog-breath, a toothless mouth spoke:

“BORN AGAIN, one more for the *TRASH KING*!!”

Then Pops once again was baptized in the thick waters, his entire body pulled into the pool. As he emerged gasping, the man or woman was gone, completely dissolved into the chemical soup. His colleagues gaped at the scene in shock, doing absolutely nothing. The intern hustled over with her fifty-gallon vacuum and sucked up the goop from around Pops. Pops stood up, swaying left and right, high as a Russian space station from the solvent waters. He collapsed on the sogged concrete, blacking out.

**TUESDAY**

With a sledgehammer-esque throbbing headache, Pops awoke to sounds of tin cans crackling over an open fire. The night was dark. He was still in the alleyway, but all his colleagues and equipment were gone. His Sparkle Pimp shirt was gone. Even his Sparkle Pimp belt buckle. Shirtless and fearful, he darted his head toward the tinny sounds. In the corner of the alleyway, hidden behind carefully arranged dumpsters, was a humble hobo camp. He stood up, holding his unbuckled pants as professionally as possible, and approached the scene.

A barrel of plastics set ablaze, cooking a box-full of canned beans still in the box. Two old homeless men rotated the bean box slowly with a metal coat hanger they had stuck through it. They looked up at Pops like an untouchable.

“Gross.”

“Ew.”

Pops stared back at these two scruffy grandpas with disbelief. 

“Hey! I shower three times a day!”

“No you don’t. You’ve been lying over there for almost two days now.”

“Yeah man, we thought you were dead, and rotting or something. Smelled like it. That’s why we’re all the way over here.”

Pops held up his arm and smelled himself, instantly whiplashing his neck away, cringing so hard that his face turned into spaghetti. One of the old homeless men poked him with a glowing orange coat hanger, setting his chemical-soaked pants ablaze. Pops shrieked and ripped off the loose, flaming pants, throwing them as far away as possible.

“Whoops,” the old man scruffed, “Didn’t mean to do that. But those pants are probably better off burnt anyway. You smell better now. Just a little bit. Anyway, I was gonna invite you to sit down with us.”
Defeated and baffled, Pops sat down on a spare barrel in his tightie-whities, stained fluorescent brown from the man/woman’s goop. He looked up at the men, his right eye twitching.

“All I knew in life was clean…”

“And that’s where you fudged it up, man. High expectations will leave you shirtless, pantsless, abandoned by society, left in an alleyway to be eaten alive by street wolves. That’s what happened to us.”

“Something… something must be wrong. A misunderstanding. I… I have a job. I have a family. I have rituals… rituals of hygiene and sanitation!”

 “You have new rituals now, man. We saw what happened to you from our bathtubs. You’ve been chosen by the Trash King, baptized and bound to his rites.”

“The Trash King?”

“Yes.”

“Who the hell is the Trash King?!”

“They say he lives atop the tallest trash mountain in all of the city, a pile higher than a Saudi Arabian skyscraper. No one knows how he got up there, or how long he’s been up there, but he won’t come down. And he shakes his fist at everyone who comes too close to his mountain.”

“What does he want with me?”

“I guess that follower of his thought you were worthy. You got dunked into destiny, like a breadstick into marinara. There’s no going back now. You’re a trash man now, follower of the Trash King.”

“This… this is bullshit. I don’t believe you guys. I’m out of here, I need a shower.”

“Good luck out there, trash man. You’ll believe it soon enough.”

The two old men chuckled dryly. They cracked open a pair of heated bean cans, toasted each other, and poured the refried slime down their throats. Pops walked away in disbelief. There was no Trash King. How could a man survive on top of a trash mountain? How could there even exist such a trash mountain?

In the cold night, Pops walked home, clothed only by shoes, socks, and undergarments, avoiding cars and pedestrians with great smelly shame. At last he reached his suburban home. The house lights were off, as were the porch lamps. Like a starving, shivering ferret, Pops scavenged the nearby bushes for the spare key. It was missing. The porch lamps flickered on. He turned to the front door to see his wife of twenty-five years pointing a double-barreled shotgun at his greasy forehead.

“Mary! What are you doing?!” he cried at her.

“I could smell that stench from a mile away. You woke up our children!”

“Just… just let me in! I need a shower! A really, *really* hot shower!”

“No, Pops! I cannot let you into this house!” She cocked the gun.

“Jesus Christ, why are you pointing that thing at me?!”

Mary plugged her nose with a plastic clamp. Continuing to hold the shotgun at her quivering, mostly-naked husband, she ruffled through her robe pockets and threw a wad of legal papers at him.

“I want a divorce!”

Pops held the papers in his hands. “Why?”

“Because you smell like the Trash King!!”

“How- how do you know about the Trash King?!? Why does everyone keep talking about the Trash King?!?”

“Everyone knows about the Trash King, Pops!! Now get out of here before I shoot your head off in front of our children!”

Pops looked at the front window where three little clean children stared wide-eyed at him, noses plugged with clamps of their own.

“Okay, okay! Damn, woman!”

Pops backed away slowly, then turned and ran through the neighborhood streets. At a small cul-de-sac park he found shelter, curled up for warmth inside a tube slide. It was there he slept through that cold, lonely night.

**WEDNESDAY**

It was an odd feeling, like a crinkling plastic stickiness being placed all over his forehead. It was a bad, highly tactile dream, surely. Or not. What was that weight on his cranium? It felt like a hundred pounds. Some form of headache experienced only by the unkempt? Pops’ eyes shot open. He moved his hand to massage his aching head, but ended up poking something squishy above him. Little chunky hands placed another plastic sticky on his forehead. Pops rotated his head back and spied a dangerously overweight child halfway down the tube slide, resting on his head, holding a miniature tape dispenser.

“What the hell are you doing to me, kid?”

The doughboy made no response, and continued to place another tape strip on Pops.

“Hey, stop that! Why are you doing that?”

Another tape strip.

Pops shot his hand up and grabbed the tape dispenser from the fat kid. The kid began kicking his chunky legs on him. Pops scrambled out of the tube slide and slid to a grinding hault in the woodchips below. The overweight boy slipped out of the slide, then jogged away with his mutton legs as fast as he could, heaving and huffing, disappearing around the block. Where was this kid going – Pops did not care.

Pops grumbled, pulling the divorce papers out from his undergarments pocket. He held them in one hand and the tape dispenser in the other. Then he taped the papers around his exposed body for warmth and decency. The last thing he needed was to be naked in broad daylight. That kind of stuff gets you fired from your job. And today was a work day. Pops was going to work, as he had for thirty years straight.

Surely his Sparkle Pimp colleagues would help him. They saw what happened. Maybe they’d give him a new shirt. And let him take a shower. And lend him some pants. Covered in crumply legal papers, the cleaning man trekked just ten miles to his employer headquarters. With confidence drawn from his last noodle of hope, Pops approached the intercom to get buzzed into the building. He pressed his thumb into the big purple button.

The intercom gatekeeper spoke. “…Yello?”

“Bill! Bill! It’s Pops! Please! Please let me in!!” Pops had overdrawn his confidence bank, and was overcome by desperation.

“Yeah… no-can-do, Pops! Management fired you two days ago!”

“What- WHY? WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?!?”

“You were gettin’ high on the job, Pops!”

“I WAS INTOXICATED BY SOLVENTS BILL!”

“Same damn thing, Pops. It’s against the rules. Plus, you smell like the Trash King, and there’s no getting rid of that. We’re a cleaning company for God’s sake. We can’t have our people smelling like they just climbed Trash Mountain!”

Pops fell to his knees, holding his finger on the intercom button. “Please. Please Bill. I have nothing.”

“Uh, I guess I can call you a cab?”

“You will?”

“Sure.”

Pops let go of the intercom button and lay on the asphalt, eyes wide and bloodshot, wondering when this nightmare would end. A taxi pulled up. Pops picked himself up from the ground and shuffled to the rear door. He opened it and got inside. 

The cab driver pinched his nose and put a scented pine-tree air freshener on his mirror.

“I don’t want no trouble.”

“I will cause you no harm, cab driver, but I might kill myself after this.”

“Where you going, stinky man?”

“Alleyway downtown.”

The cab took off with great speed, with the cab driver as desperate as he. With a few sharp turns, they were there. As he exited the vehicle, Pops paused.

“I don’t have money for the fare.”

“You owe me new car!”

Before Pops could even shut the door, the cab driver slammed his pedal and took off, crashing into incoming traffic in a great, mushroom-cloud explosion. Pops shed a tear.

“I am cursed…” he mumbled to himself.

In the alleyway shade, the hobo camp was still lit, but only one hobo remained. Pops approached, twitching and tweaking. The old man looked up at him.

“You’ve come back, trash man. I knew it was only a matter of time. Why are you covered in tape and paper?”

“I have no clothing.”

“Wow, you might be the dirtiest man alive.”

“That’s probably the case.”

“So why did you come back, trash man?”

“Tell me where I can find the Trash King.”

“He lives on Trash Mountain, trash man.”

“Where is Trash Mountain?”

“Over there.”

The gruff old man pointed off in the distance. Pops turned to look. Past the city skyline was tall, glimmering, multicolored shine. It stood taller than any skyscraper downtown.

“That’s Trash Mountain?!”

“It is.”

“How have I never noticed it before? I’ve lived here for thirty years!”

“You were blind, and now you can see, trash man.”

“No! I refuse to believe that freaking mountain of trash has been there more than a week!”

The hobo checked his watch. “Yeah, I guess it’s been about a week since Spring cleaning.”

As he looked back up, the former sanitation professional was already storming off in the direction of the mountain.

“I hope you find what you’re looking for, trash man,” he called out to the angry Pops.

The old man turned back to his burning campfire, lifting his red-hot hanger into the air.

“One more for the Trash King.”

**THURSDAY**

The early morning grew grey as storm clouds blanketed the city from above like a powdered wig. Cats hissed at the tape-and-paper-covered former sanitation professional as he slipped through the last alleyway at the other end of the city. He had come a long way, traveling by foot for more than a day. The mountain was in sight.

It looked much bigger up close. But then again, it looked pretty big to begin with. Still, Pops was baffled to hell how something like this could exist. He looked up to the top. Pops choked on his own jaw drop. In the distance, he could indeed see a figure of a man moving around up there, silhouetted and as small as a mouse, thousands of feet up. The Trash King lived.

Gated by nothing, the mountain base stood where the city dump used to be. Pops had been to this dump many times before in his career. But the dump was no longer; the mountain had completely consumed it. How had it gotten so bad that the city built an entire mountain? How would they ever get rid of it? Pops watched as entire families drove up in minivans to the base of Trash Mountain, throwing offerings of over-bloated trash bags onto the pile. Vagrants bowed at the edge, cloaked in musty hoodies. And just as that homeless old man had told him, the Trash King shook his fist vigorously at them all from the top.

Pops walked up to the mountain, perplexed and pissed to hell. With nothing to live for, not even a single warm shower, he clamped his hands onto the edges of a broken plasma screen TV at the base and began climbing his way up. The vagrants watched silently as he climbed from toaster to trash bag, rusted cans to rotting meat. Crust, must, and dust. Pops cringed his face into spaghetti once more. The cleaning man he once was died in that murky bathing pool days ago.

Far he climbed, shielded from needles and tetanus by only tape and divorce papers. He wheezed, not giving a damn about airborne diseases. Little rats followed him as he went further and further up, curious as to what this human-rat was doing, cheering him on with their tiny squeaks. Pops gritted his teeth as the cold wind blew against him. The sky turned darker - soon it would storm.

Stretching his arms, he grabbed an aged ragged bible. It gave way, flying from his hand. Pops held onto the arm of an old baby stroller, watching the bible fall thousands of feet all the way to the bottom. As he realized how far he had climbed, he became lightheaded and his heart beat like eggs in a processor. 

“God, don’t people recycle in this city?!?” he cried to himself.

Pops turned his head to the left where he spotted another massive mountain, that of recyclables, just one mile away. It sparkled with relative cleanliness.

“Why?! Why couldn’t I have been chosen by the Green King?!?”

Cringing hard, Pops looked to the right where, to his heart-splitting surprise, the afroed man/woman stared at him with bloodshot eyes, less than a foot away from his face.

“The TRASH KING has chosen *YOU*, Pops!” the toothless, dog-breath mouth spoke.

“Why me?! And I thought you dissolved two days ago?!”

“No one has EVER climbed HIS mountain until *YOU*, Pops!”

“I’m just climbing it to kick his ass!”

“That’s not ALL you want, Pops!”

“Yeah, I want some freakin’ answers too! Damn! Then I’m gonna kick his ass!”

Pops knuckled up his free hand and punched it into the man or woman’s face, shoving him or her off of the mountain. He or she plummeted down, past the clouds below, wailing, “ONE MOOOORE FOR THE TRAAAASH KING!!!”

Pops looked at his punching fist, grimy as could be. 

“Hm. I hope that was just a hallucination.”

His rat friends backed away in fear. He wiped the grime from his knuckles and continued climbing.

The storm clouds grew darker, and droplets of dihydrogen monoxide splattered onto his face from above. First it pattered, then it poured. It was the first shower the man had taken in days – only by the kindness of Mother Nature or the wrath of the Trash King, Pops mused. He blinked upwards. The peak of the garbage pile was in sight. And the outline of an angry, shaking fist hung over the edge.

Pops shook his fist back.

“Is that you, Trash King?!”

An indiscernible garble of dehydrated tongues answered him, like a cross between a grumbling grandpa and a pressure cooker, masked by the falling raindrops and earth-shattering thunder.

“Fuck you too then, Trash King!”

Pops scrambled closer to the edge of the peak. He gripped his nails into the last nasty bag of trash with all his strength. It popped open, caking his face in kitty litter. Pops coughed it out and pulled himself up. Wiping the stank litter from his eyes, he blinked in an altitude-induced haze. As his vision clarified, he saw the Trash King. The Trash King. The Trash King. The Trash King.

Nothing but a sludge-crusted, half-inflated, life-size, blow-up Santa Claus held upright with a sandbag base, its Christmas fist blowing around vigorously in the wind, the movement triggering a garbled, broken-circuit “Ho Ho Ho”.  Pops tackled the Santa in rage.

“AHHHHHHHHHHH!!”, he screamed, deflating the Santa Claus further as he tumbled around with it.

Pops jumped up to his feet, grabbed the Santa’s hand, swung as hard as he could, and flung the inflatable off of the mountain.

“Hoo, hooooo, hoooo…” the Santa garbled as it plummeted through the wet air.

Then lighting stuck down on the Santa, vaporizing it entirely. In tears, face wretched, Pops looked around himself. Nothing but a pile of wasted consumables, worthless products, tossed memories, and broken dreams.

“There is no Trash King…” he mumbled sadly.

A piece of crumpled paper detached from his leg and fluttered down, landing at his feet. Curious, he picked it up. It read in streaking, stained letters:

*YOU ARE THE TRASH KING*

He tossed it aside, grumbling to himself. Pops walked through the pouring rain all the way to the edge of Trash Mountain. He stared down. Past the rainy haze below, ten thousand feet to the ground, hundreds of torches were lit. Trash men and trash women, all followers of the Trash King.

Pops shook his fist angrily at them, shouting with all his rage.

After I graduated college, I realized I didn't make any lasting connections in college. I started wondering what I did wrong, and that just led to re-evaluating my whole life and all of the relationships I've destroyed. Most of my problems stemmed from my inability to deal with jealousy and my self-consciousness. I wonder how many of these relationships I could have saved if I had been a better person.

I'm dealing with a lot of regret, anxiety, possibly depression right now. I keep on having negative thoughts and feeling ashamed, so I just need somewhere to vent.

Let's start from kindergarten:
-I forget why, but I got mad at my friend at the time, so I wrote ""I hate Jessica"" on a table for everyone to see and got in trouble for it

Fast forward to high school:
-I was jealous that my crush thought my friend at the time was hot, so I stopped being friends with her without telling her and called her a slut
-This guy took me to prom and paid for everything but I didn't even dance with him because I didn't like him
-I was friends with this girl but I started avoiding her because I was jealous of her talent
-I made fun of my friend at the time because she was poor and it made me feel better about myself

Fast forward to college:
-I was friends with this girl but I stopped being friends with her because she was better than me in every way - more attractive, bigger boobs, popular, got more prestigious internships, and then I ended up hating her with all my heart
-I was friends with this girl and I couldn't deal with her anymore, so instead of ghosting her like I did with my previous friendships, I attacked all of her most self-conscious aspects and made her cry
-I had a boyfriend but I wanted to sleep with someone else so bad I asked my boyfriend for permission, even though he was the best thing ever

Other fun stuff:
-I've slept with a lot of people and most of them make me feel ashamed and disgusting. I slept with them because I was self-conscious and it made me feel wanted
-I've had a lot of experiences where teachers publicly humiliated me/I publicly humiliated myself because I was a lazy piece of shit and wasn't doing the work. I accept full responsibility but it haunts me pretty often

Hindsight is 20/20 right? I can't really change the past. I'm trying to forgive myself, learn from my mistakes, and move on. It's really fucking hard."
812dje,7,2018-02-28,"Mom, I feel lost and dejected.",electricloogaboo,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/812dje/mom_i_feel_lost_and_dejected/,"tl;dr first world problems and a pampered 19 year old boy whining about baby's first hardship in life^TM . please tell me if this does not belong in the sub and i'll move it to a more suitable sub.

I apologise if i'm rambling or the post doesn't make much sense; there's a lot going in my head right now and i figured typing it out and seeking advice might help a little.

I'm an 19 years old Singaporean that recently graduated. For the past 18 years of my life, i've had no grand aspirations nor calling in life. I've been cruising quite comfortably through the Singaporean education system (making it through the Gifted Education Programme and enrolling in the top school of the country). I figured that with what I had, I might as well work towards becoming a doctor which is highly regarded within my family and our society. I have went for all the necessary tests (and passed with satisfactory results) and volunteered on and off in preparation for this.

I have also never been a far sighted person in my life. I only pull through every school week because of the weekend where i can unwind or because some big event is happing in the near future.

Another thing to note: our country has a 2 year mandatory enlistment period that all Singapore males, including me, has to go through. This in itself is quite intimidating and scary for me, but I tell myself to pull through by assuring myself that I have a bright future ahead of me in pursuing Medicine: 

* i get to study overseas for a change in scenery (this has been a big push for me; Singapore is only so big and i get bored seeing the same roads, faces, landmarks, and other stuff)
* money ~~would~~ might not be an issue if I managed to get a scholarship
* i might find some bigger calling in life overseas (who knows, i might find another career in acting like ken jeong haha)
* i would score good internships overseas which would ensure a stable and decent paying job in whatever clinic i work with

Unfortunately, I faltered (got too complacent maybe) and missed the mark for straight As for my final exams and most boards say that i'm not qualified to enter course in Medicine, not even overseas. I've spent the past few nights after getting my results being sleepless and worrying about my future in general. I dread talking to my relatives in case they ask about my results.

Right now, I have to deal with both fact that the past few years of my life amounted to nothing and I have nothing to look forward to after my enlistment which makes it all the more difficult to get through. The fact that some Singaporeans are [owning life overseas](https://np.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/7dpka5/question_for_students_in_singapore/) is not really helping with my mood either.

Of course this doesn't mean that i'm going down without a fight. I'm still planning to apply for both the local and overseas universities despite their strict cutoff points in the *very very very* unlikely event that i'm somehow able to get in because the admissions office is in a good mood that day. I suppose that sliver of hope is the only thing that's pulling me through right now.

I feel like sharing this with my parents but seeing as to how they're also trying to get me into Medicine (scouring through forums and websites to look for other ways to get into the course) i really don't want to add to their burden in any way whatsoever. 

So, to all moms out there, I would like some words or comfort and possibly some advice (preferably before all the university rejection letters start pouring in and i die by paper-cuts). Thank you for taking the time to read this.

edit: fixed some formatting issues that didn't save for some reason

doubleedit: please take whatever i say about the singapore university admissions process with a pinch of salt since i'm not very familiarised with it yet. i'll try my best to correct it with whatever additional information i encounter in the near future in case anybody finds this useful or helpful"

Backstory:

Me, AE at Xerox with 2 years of experience selling copiers (top of the division), 6 month as SDR intern in Copenhagen, wanting to break into SaaS AE role. 

I have an informational interview with AE and SDR at the SaaS startup that I like as I got introduced by my friend to them. They have 2 AE positions open, and I want to apply for it soon.  

Right now it's more of a getting to know the company interview, so I was wondering what kind of questions would you ask to achieve following:

1) Leave good impression
2) Help yourself down the interview road by knowing what the company is like.

Should I ask about the current process? Like how many leads AE gets, how is the quality?

First time I'm doing this kind of thing, so was wondering what would you ask?"

812yfg,0,2018-03-01,I [19 M] am in a complicated spot with a long term friend [19 F] of mine.,StevenTheBoat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/812yfg/i_19_m_am_in_a_complicated_spot_with_a_long_term/,"This goes all the way back to my freshman year of high school. I had a lot of friends already going into high school so the need to make new ones was low. I did, however, meet two girls who we will call BadDecision and MissedOpportunity. I became really good friends with both of them and started to develop some feelings for MissedOpportunity, so I decided to ask BadDecision for some advice on asking MissedOpportunity out.


BadDecision turns right around and tells me that she's had feelings for me this whole time and that I should at least give her a chance before I run off with MissedOpportunity. Since BadDecision was a year older than me, pretty funny, and really attractive, my dumb ass said why not and gave her a shot. After two and a half years of a severely abusive relationship with her, I had become distant from the majority of my friends, especially MissedOpportunity.


I decided from pretty much the moment that I cut off BadDecision that the remainder of my senior year was going to be dedicated to reconciling with all of the friends I had lost. And I did a really good job of it. I still talk to those seven-ish people every day, despite being in in a different state as all of them.


In getting my shit together with the people that actually cared about me, I started to regain the feelings I had lost for MissedOpportunity. We started spending a good amount of time together again and it became more and more difficult to see her as just a friend, but I wasn't about to ruin our relationship a second time over, especially before we both left for college... and then we both left for college. 


I expected to get over it but I think moving away actually made it worse. Since I now had reason to go around and meet a ton of new people, I think I realized how much I actually cared about her. We talked plenty but it was a couple of months before I actually saw her again (for context, we both go to school in states that are pretty far away from home.) Our Christmas breaks lined up nicely and we got to go back to our normal friendly routine for about a month.


At the end of break, I decided to tell her. We were supposed to go rock climbing, then out to dinner and just have a good time. Turns out the rock climbing place was closed and about two minutes into trying to figure out what we were going to do, her parents called and asked if I wanted to come over for dinner instead of going out. In hindsight, I'm really glad that happened. We went back to her place, talked and played some cards, helped cook, I had dinner with her family, and then we sat down and watched a movie. We're both pretty adventurous people and had done a lot over break so it was nice to just keep it simple.


After the movie I told her how I felt without really getting into the pre-BadDecision feelings. Going into the conversation, I didn't really know what to expect, but I knew I didn't want to start anything while we were both so far apart; I kind of just wanted to get everything off my chest. We talked for a while but the gist of her response was, ""I've definitely thought about us dating before and the reason I started talking to you in the first place was because I had feelings for you. After you started dating BadDecision, I had some feelings off and on but tried to get over it. At this point I wouldn't completely rule out the possibility of a relationship in the future, but with us both off at school I don't think now's the best time.""


At first I was really happy with that response since it wasn't exactly a no and we agreed that now's not the time. I did bring up the summer as a possibility and she didn't seem too opposed. We agreed to try and Skype a little more often and kind of left it there. The whole long-distance friendship thing is going just fine but I've become really confused as to where to go with it. Since that conversation she's gotten a summer internship near her lake house, a few hours north of home. Visiting up there isn't impossible (I went last summer with her and some mutual friends; the drives not terrible) and it wouldn't be for the entire summer, but it does complicate things a bit.


Honestly, I'm just worried about losing my chance for a second time. We haven't talked about it since and I don't think either one of us would really like to have that conversation over the phone. I do get to see her for a couple of days in about a week but I'm really conflicted as to whether or not to pursue it. Whatever it is. I'm really scared about fucking this up and losing her as a friend again and I think that's where most of her apprehension comes from too.


So, great people of Reddit, what do I do? Part of me says go all in for it, she's worth the risk. The other part of me says I've already missed my shot and I should just stick to the awesome friendship I'm lucky to still have. Should I avoid the topic until the summer? Any advice is appreciated!

tl;dr: Feelings for girl 1. Dated girl 2. 2.5 shitty years later, broke up with girl 2 and re-developed feelings for girl 1. Told her after a while, got a confusingly cautious maybe. Tabled it for now and I'm wondering if it's worth the risk of bringing it back up."

Happy to make my first post here. I am another aspiring data scientist, still in college, studying applied statistics/computer science.

My university really doesn't have many resources for learning data science, so I am taking as many statistics and computer science courses as I can while practicing python and R in my free time.

That said, a local 'tech' company (they build software for insurance companies) picked me up this summer for my first internship. My title will be ""process excellence intern,"" and I will work with the business process manager, getting a high level view of the life insurance and annuities industry. I have been told the position has many opportunities to work on a project I am interested in, and I was hoping to try to implement some data science techniques and squeeze some value out and impress some people.

I guess my question is: do you guys think this is a reasonable opportunity to practice data science in a professional setting? If so, do you have any idea what I should be looking for? I really won't know what kind of data is available until I start this summer, but I want to prepare my skills beforehand if possible.

I'm just excited to break into the professional world, and I really want to get started with some real, practical data science! Thanks for any input or advice."

[Kinda longish story],VKS23,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/813ggh/a_girl27f_i25m_was_dating_texted_me_she_wants/,"Hey everyone, so I think the best way to explain this is through a quick timeline with exposition. I really apologize for how long this is but please bear with me.


About this girl:
27 years old
Trying to be a actress, very early in her career.
Has had a 5 year relationship from her late teens to early 20s.
Probably went on some dates after that and when she met me but no other short-mid term long relationships that I know of.
Lives with her folks and owns 3 of her own dogs and and works part time at an animal shelter.
She says she's an over-thinker.


2015 May - 
I meet this girl at my acting camp in a different city, I feel a nice connection with her that I have never felt with a girl before and it was just through talking to her and being with her. During the brief 3 weeks at the program, we talked a lot few days after class culminating to kissing a couple times the last day before we leave.
I go back to my home city which was a 2.5-hour flight away.
We lose touch within a few days or so and I don't meet her again until..


2017 August - 
During the final level of the acting camp. At this time, I've moved into the city at the beginning of that year. So, we reconnect stronger. We begin dating after camp ends but it's long distance dating, she lives 3 hours’ drive away from the city.


2017 October- 
She came over to be with me at my apartment twice. First time she took the train and came over for 1 day which was when we had sex for the first time. We felt very connected.
She came over for another visit about a week later and stayed with me for about 2 full days. It was amazing, and we had a lot of fun and bonded.
This girl lives with her folks and works at an animal shelter in her hometown part time but a few hours almost every day and she own 3 dogs she takes care of entirely, 100 percent dog mom.


I don't see her for 3.5 months because she was always busy and couldn't find the time, we texted each other pretty regularly on weekly basis. We talked on the phone about 2 or 3 times and was all good.
I missed her a ton during these months and she also told me she did too. I also ended up becoming a little busy for a month doing theatre, so the timing didn't work. 


During December, 
we start texting more, almost every day for a good portion of the days and she says she'll be able to spend New Year’s with me. She also says she got an internship in the city starting after the New Year and will be in the city for at least 2 full days for the intern and we were both excited. She'll be spending every week with me for 3 months! I was super positive about the New Year and starting it strong with her. 


But a few days before New Years, 
we’re having a phone conversation and she’s mentions an alternative casual relationship and not being committed. I’m shocked and upset and I ask why and why she’s saying this before seeing me. But she doesn’t give me a clean reason and just talks about it might be easier. I tell her I’m not sure I can do that because I have deep feelings for her. We end up having phone sex and we’re both connected we forget not being serious.
The next day she says sorry for the how grumpy she is during nighttime before bed and shes always like that when shes tired and maybe we shouldn’t do phone calls at night. 
I say no problem, you can pick when we talk on the phone.

2017 December 31 -
We finally meet up for the evening near her town at a hotel and spent the evening and night together. A friend of ours (more hers) had also come into town to take classes for a few weeks so also hung out with us part of the night to celebrate the New Year. The next morning, she had to go to work so she dropped me off at the train and I went back to the city to my apartment.

2018 January - 
Her internship starts, and she came over for two full days during the end of the first week of January. We have an amazing time together, before and after her internship. She goes back home via train on Friday afternoon. The next week she returns on Wednesday and now all of a sudden it feels different, she still seems connected to me but she doesn't want to have sex which is fine she’s probably tired that night no biggie, but she barely kisses me. We go straight to bed.
Next morning,
I pack her a lunch and she leaves for her internship. After she gets done, we meet up for dinner and she say she wants to go home the next morning with the 630am train. She doesn't give me a reason why other than I already bought the ticket and it was the only one on sale. I find another ticket for an afternoon time that she can exchange for an extra 6 bucks, but she complains that she doesn't want to spend that.
During dinner she says she overheard her parents are discussing her acting pursuits and when she'll get a real job and not doing acting stuff. Her mom defends her towards her dad.
We discuss about it and I advise her to talk to her parents and show them how passionate/serious you are about it, not to worry and use your energy towards your goals as much as you can.
She agrees but I can tell it’s still on her mind. I'm not sure exactly how else to help. Later we go back to my apartment and I try to be sensual/affectionate and close with her, but she doesn't want to. We end up just talking about other things, life, ask questions etc. We go to bed early since she's still going home early tomorrow, she still doesn't give me a real reason. I go to bed disappointed. But I feel this weird thing between us.

The next morning, she wakes up kisses me and leaves. I feel super weird the whole day, but we text each other goodnight at the end of the day.

2018 January 3rd week - 
We text a little bit in between, it seems fine. 

On Monday 
she says I quote ""So I'm not sure I can come over this week to stay because I have this thing back home""

I say ""Ok :(""

Then she says ""But I still gotta figure out the logistics""

The next day, she texts me during the day ""Can we have a phone conversation tonight, I wanna talk about something""

Immediately I knew she was going to try to end the relationship or something and my heart sinks.

I say ""OK, let me know what time you wanna talk""

8:30PM comes by and she still hasn't called or texted me about the time and I was getting anxious plus I had to be up early tomorrow.

I text her ""What time do you wanna talk? I have to be up pretty early tomorrow""

She says ""Nevermind, I'm pretty tired right now, what do you have going on tomorrow?""

Now I'm a little annoyed she’s trying to avoid it so I say ""Can we just talk really quick, I feel like it was important""

She doesn't respond back immediately

I say after a minute ""Or you can tell me tomorrow when you see me""

She texts back ""Well that’s part of it, I think I want to hang out with my other friends in the city tomorrow, I haven't seen them for a while""

Now I'm thinking, well we could see them together since I've hung out with them multiple times before or you could still see them and me for a little. I felt like she wasn't being honest.

So I said ""And what's the other part?""

She says ""Honestly I don't know, I feel like we both need a little space, life feels pretty chaotic and I think we both have a lot going on

I say ""I figured that’s what it was but I don't think my life feels like that, I feel pretty levelheaded""

She says"" Maybe it's just me then but until I move up or something, I don't feel good""

I say ""I do also have a lot of things to do, but I’m not feeling overwhelmed, but I respect your decision, I know you'll get through it""

She says ""I don't think I have anything to get through, it’s just an actor's life is busy, but thanks for understanding""

I don't text back after this, but I feel super down. Also, because she does all this through text and not phone call""


Next week I text her back because I'm still thinking about her.


I say"" Hey, so I was thinking about you our text conversation felt weird and I just want things to be cool. Do you want to grab coffee or a bite to eat or something after your internship? Hope you're well.

She texts me back after a few hours ""No worries! We're totally cool! Hope you're well too.
I don’t text back after this thinking she does not want to see me at all.

The next week I have this big audition that I was telling her about when we were still talking 2 weeks ago.

She texts me a few hours after the audition ""Hey, I saw someone posted about that audition today. How was yours?""

I texted her back ""It went well! I did a comedy monologue and I got a lot of laughs!""

She texts back the next morning ""That’s awesome!!""

I don't respond back and that was the last time we communicated.
That was back in Jan 29th, 2018.

Now I'm still down and can't get her out of my head. I'm not sure how to go forward. I'm giving her space and not talking to her at all. But I don't know if she totally done with me and that was just a cheap way to end it with me or what.

I'm pretty annoyed she didn't bother to do this over phone call at least. I felt like I deserved that at least because I thought we had a stronger connection.

I'm planning to not text her back but a big part of me does want to reach back out to her.
I just want to know the truth of this. I don't care if she stopped liking me or doesn't want to date me anymore ever for whatever reason but the way she ended it doesn't seem to have a closure. 
We had so much amazing text conversations and it felt so natural. She even talked about spending Christmas together the next year.

Also, next week is her birthday and I'm wondering if I should wish her Happy Birthday or not?

What do you think I should do about any of this?

How can I best move forward?

I know we had our personality, habitual and lifestyle differences but I still felt super into her and we had other traits that were very similar and close. 

Maybe she just wasn’t feeling the same about me? 

Maybe we moved too fast?

TLDR: Girl I dated for 5 months long distance texts me she wants space because life seems chaotic with her acting pursuits and part time job and trying to move to city. During the 5 months we hung out about a total of 12 days. I felt super connected and into her and I thought she felt that way about me too but this almost came out of no where and I'm not sure how I should move forward and if I should ever reach out to her in the future, even for her birthday next week?"
813pun,44,2018-03-01,An investors perspective and lessons.,Oksano,waltonchain,https://www.reddit.com/r/waltonchain/comments/813pun/an_investors_perspective_and_lessons/,"Now I've been through every FUD imaginable in the cryptocurrency realm, the first being back last year when China came out with an outright ban on exchanges. The list goes on from then on, what I'm trying to say here is that no matter whatever the situation is, as long as the fundamentals of a project is still intact, it should be enough for you to hold through the storm. I've done exactly that with my investments in NEO and WTC (yes, even during the announcements of announcements, no matter how ridiculous that was) and it has paid off well.

Listen, fellas, the crypto realm and its investors are mostly comprised of a bunch of fickle and emotional minded people, such a mistake like the recent tweet can cause such fear, panic and drop in price. It's very important to research in-depth to a coin you plan on investing, make sure it has a strong vision, team, partnerships and lastly whether it is B2C (Business to Customer) or B2B (Business to Business). I can't emphasize how crucial that is, it was one of the reasons I wasn't affected at all by the tweet. I'll explain why later.

Moving onwards to my positive take on the recent FUD/tweet, I see as a cleansing of sort, weeding out the fickle/emotional investors from this project as well testing the firm believers. Those that did exactly what I mentioned above will continue holding their investments through, initially, I was shocked at first, after all, my money is involved in this. But what concerned most was whether the fundamentals had changed, it did not, so I took the opportunity to buy more while the FUD continued. A famous saying goes ""Buy when there's blood on the street and when the fundamentals haven't changed"" with a little twist of my own.

This doesn't mean the actions of what the intern did was correct. No, it was stupid and unprofessional, no intern should ever be allowed to have access to the main Twitter page, especially since we know how well irrationality plays in this market. Waltonchain delivered an apology soon after, although not as fast as I anticipated (That's understandable since it was around 6AM in china when the tweet was out) 

Finally, why I think the B2B model is crucial in this, small investors, although they do to a certain extent affect the short-term market cap and price of the token will not affect the long-term goals of this project, after all, it's the businesses and partnerships tied with Waltonchain that'll be buying the huge bulk of tokens once main net launches. And that my friends, is where the huge bulk of your ROI will be. So worry not and stay safe out there. This is an important lesson everyone should learn from."

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
 
Open to either short or long-term scenes, so feel free to PM me anytime you see this."
813vtt,3,2018-03-01,[F4A] Daring Desires,TheNubileNymph,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/813vtt/f4a_daring_desires/,"I’d been called a workaholic throughout my life. Since highschool I’d been working out, constantly running, doing yoga, riding a bike, or playing tennis.  When I wasn’t working out, I was studying. I graduated tied for the top spot in my class, and although I didn’t go out and party as often as other girls, my life had been made difficult – or at least, annoying – by jealous girls who had crushes or boyfriends more interested in me than them.

I hadn’t cared. I’d gone to college, leaving my small town behind, and I’d excelled there too. I found it difficult to multitask: when I did something, I put my full effort into it, and since my full effort was considerable, that meant I was able to get a lot done. I studied, I worked out, I learned how fashion worked so I knew how to dress and avoid nerdy or rural stereotypes, while still being comfortable.  I learned to look good without being scandalous.

With my short, slender frame, narrow waist, flared hips, and round, smooth, thick ass – along with cute perky b-cups (some days closer to a-cups) and my short, dark chocolate hair – sometimes in a bob-cut, sometimes a top knot – I also managed to pull off a mixture of cute and sexy that worked to my advantage. I was pretty, with perpetually tanned skin – it was a fair shade of olive, the result of my part-Hispanic, part-German heritage.  I have huge amber-brown eyes, like some Disney princess, which I often hid behind glasses. I didn’t shy away from using my attractive, petite frame to encourage someone, tacitly, to take out the trash for me.  Perhaps it even helped me get into the schools and internships I had wanted, but I figured I should’ve gotten in anyways based on my grades and skills.

Everything I did, I did using every skill I had.  That included pleasuring myself.  I was settled on my knees, supporting my upper body with my left forearm, while I twisted my upper body and reached back behind me with my right.  In my delicate right hand, I held the plug.  I used my fingers to shift and press the metal point of the plug against my tight little asshole, deep between the thick cheeks of my ass.  I’d already poured a dash of lube against my asshole, and put another dab on the toy before I’d settled onto my knees and arm in front of the tall floor length mirror I had against my bedroom wall.  The metal plug, expensive and luxurious in both appearance and feel, was warm from the heat of my mouth, as I pulled it between my lips and teased my tongue against it.  It had filled my mouth, and I’d only withdrawn it once it was the right heat.  Then the lube, and now the teasing touch. 

I kept a steady pressure against my asshole, felt myself spreading as the plug flared from a narrow tip to its widest point.  It wasn’t difficult at the start – but the plug flared rapidly, and soon I felt my mouth spread wide as I marveled at how *huge* the plug felt against me.  I knew how big it was, had taken it in my mouth, had rubbed it in my hands.  But my ass had never been spread so wide.  I wished I was recording it, watching it slowly spread me as I kept that steady pressure, interspersed with sudden pulses of more force.  My glasses, the lenses themselves only slightly corrective but the frames a classic matte black style, were fogging as my breath grew hot and fast, and I bucked my head to try and nudge them back up my nose.  

I sat back, pushing my hips back as I lowered my ass towards my heels, towards the mirror, towards the *plug*.  Felt myself spreading wider and then–

–there was an audible pop as the plug tapered back to a narrow stem, my asshole immediately gripping it tightly.  Pushing the last centimeter of the stem, and the whole of the plug inside me, until the circular flange of white metal nestled tightly against my asshole.  Fuck.  I felt so full.  I’d been curious about anal for a long time, and I’d slid my fingers, or little safe objects I had on hand when I’d craved it in the past.  But it wasn’t until now, as a graduate student, 25 years old, that I’d bought myself a plug.  I wished I’d figured out a way to do it sooner – I’d let amazon order histories and worries of discovery from roommates or relatives scare me off too long.  

I groaned with pleasure as I felt the plug shifting inside me as I stood, pulling my skin-tight jeggings back up my fit legs.  I was foregoing panties for this date – not something I’d ever actually done before, but another kink I was curious about, one I read of and fantasized about.  It wasn’t like I’d never met my date before – we’d had classes together, and were somewhere between friends and acquaintances.  The jeggings were every bit as tight as yoga pants, but were made of dark quality denim and other more elastic materials in the lining – invisible but ensuring they hugged every curve.  I chose a bralette, lacy and white, without a wire or much in the way of support, to settle over my high perky breasts, then slipped on the blouse I’d hung in the doorway before I’d started my little pleasure session.  

Five minutes later, after I gave myself a once over in the makeup mirror – I practiced the minimal make up look, the look that some men think actually includes *no makeup*, but still has some liner and foundation.  But it was light and breathable and quick to touch up.  I tied my hair up in a topknot, securing it with a navy ribbon, so dark it almost appeared black, matching the color of my jeggings.  

I grabbed my clutch, blushing as I felt the plug shift inside me once I started to move more naturally.  It was too late to rethink my decision – a glance at the little watch on my wrist was confirmation of that.  My heart raced as I left.

------------

My kinks are: uniforms / clothing – I like spending time undressing and revealing each other’s bodies, or having sex with yoga pants at my knees, or a skirt flipped up, etc; booty stuff – I like spanking, but I don’t like bruising or anything like that, and I don’t like scat – mostly playful spanking to turn my cheeks pink and make them sting a little, and if you’re good at it maybe a little harder, as well as just groping, kissing, gently biting; teasing (not verbally, but like stripteases, flashing, masturbating while the other person watches); sex outside of a bedroom (I don’t like being caught but I do like sort of mild exhibition or voyeur I guess – tough one to explain, and I don’t like dirty settings like alleyways); lingerie; D/s (I’m a switch and I don’t like passive partners – we should both be advancing the story); anal (probably could’ve put this with booty stuff – I like semi-realistic anal, with the exception in that I’m not going to write an enema and I’m just always going to be perfectly clean – I mean that working your finger in should take like two posts from both of us, as your knuckles gets stuck and you have to wiggle and pulse and spread me or give me instructions or get lube etc. No just sliding in.)
I have other kinks but since I was explaining the details that’s already pretty long.

 Limits: non-con, heavy pain, scat, gore, watersports. Also, please **don't** tell me your cock is *x* amount of inches long and *x* wide. **Just use adjectives. It's sexier.**

I’m also open to playing as a futa. Partners of all genders equally welcome, and you could also play something different too &gt;.&gt;

814lds,1,2018-03-01,I'm in an unhealthy relationship. Should I(19f) break up with my boyfriend (20m)?,Djangotito,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/814lds/im_in_an_unhealthy_relationship_should_i19f_break/,"There is a lot of pointless information in here. I'm not exactly sure what I'm trying to get out of this but it feels good to vent. looking for advice. I'm writing this super late and have not proof read any of it. I apologize in advance.

My boyfriend (we'll call him Sam, 20m) and I (19f) have been together for nearly 2 years and have known each other since childhood. 

Prior to our relationship I have been made to have trust issues/abandonment issues by an ex boyfriend. My ex would constantly play games with my head and leave me at any moment he began to feel bored. During our relationship I was constantly questioning my self worth and going to extremes to gain his approval which never worked. I felt addicted to the highs and lows it gave me. This 'on and off' relationship lasted from the time I was in 7th grade until my junior year of high school. When he dumped me for good, I noticed that I began to badly mistreat boyfriends I had during our off periods and resemble his behaviors. I find that these feelings still stick with me. 

Sam is a great guy. He is very thoughtful, funny and well rounded. He cares for me, picks me up when I am down, and pushes me to be and do my best, which was a very foreign concept to me. I became involved with him at an inconvenient time in our lives, during the summer following high school graduation. I was going to Barcelona for the summer and when I returned home he would be going to college out of state. Our time together was very limited. During the short month we were together, before we had to part, we fell in love and decided to go long distance. Although I found him to be caring and loving, I still had irrational fears of betrayal and abandonment and questioned whether or not our relationship would last. During my time in Barcelona I harbored those feelings and was partying a lot with my new friends. On many nights I would dance/flirt/make out with guys I met in the club or on the beach. Each time knowing it was wrong while thinking of him and instantly regretting it yet continually doing it. 

Prior to our relationship Sam was kind of... a ""douchebag"". He was the type of guy that had hooked up with many girls and even sent his whole team a video of a random girl from tinder giving him a blowjob. I feel that knowing that information was part of the reason I cheated on him in barcelona. He had done nothing to lose my trust at that point in our relationship but my trust issues and insecurities were so high that my defense mechanism was to hookup with strangers I guess? Still don't understand why exactly I did it. Also, Sam was headed off to a university notorious for partying. Sam was following the Instagram page ""I'mShmacked"" and constantly liked their photos not knowing that I was aware. If you're not familiar with the page it's basically hot, half naked girls from colleges around the country. Many from the school he was going to. 


After that summer when the two of us went to college we became very dependent on each other and attached. He gave me a promise ring. I shit you not, we were on FaceTime about 21 hours a day, anytime we weren't in class. Even when we were sleeping, doing homework, showering, using to the restroom etc. We were super in love and still in the early stages where most couples would be together all the time but we were states away. One night he decided to have some drinks and go out with his roommates for the first time. College was passing us up since were constantly Face-timing. He called me super drunk and told me that he was talking to this girl he was trying to hook his Roomate up with and grabbed her ass. I immediately shut down and stop talking to him for the next  day which was weird because I was used to being on the phone so much. He sent me multiple voicemails pleading and crying. I felt like I was back in my old relationship and I had hoped he wouldn't ever cheat or even think of other girls but it was inevitable. 
I forgave him after he had a complete meltdown, and I honestly wasn't ready to let go of him. After all, it was really minor and petty but I thought he was perfect and could do no wrong, or ever would, up until this point. Couple months pass and one night I was out with my roommates and was highly intoxicated and on several other substances when I stumbled back to my dorm and told Sam about what happened in Barcelona. It went horribly and I still love him to this day but our relationship just hasn't quite been the same since, expectedly. 

Okay now months pass and he decides to transfer back home for the second semester. It was a huge relief to be with him in person and hold him in my arms. We were still very attached and it was really the first time throughout our relationship that we could be together every single day without limitation. After a while we began to notice that we were so entangled in each other it had hindered our school work and social lives. At this point we didn't really have any friends other than each other and to this day that's still kind of an issue. We depend on each other a lot because we don't really have anyone else. 

Fast forward, I have been finding porn sites on his phone and he had looked up girls that go to his university but he doesn't know them. All of which look like the type of girls that would be featured on ""im schmacked"". This REALLY bothered me and he would try to hide it but it this point the relationship became so unhealthy that I would go through his phone whenever I had the chance because I was constantly wondering what he was doing and found those things on many different occasions. And when I called him out on it he would scream and cry and beg for forgiveness yet we'd find find ourselves in the same situations again. 

Fast forward. We have already been together for a year and half at this point and I still love him to death but we have been fighting like animals. He had been working a job, internship and going to school full time and we hardly had time to see each other. Selfishly, it had really taken a toll on me because I don't really have friends anymore and rely on him to hang out and vice versa but he was too busy to hang out with anyone anyways. Our fights are beginning to get worse and worse with things being thrown, restraining each other, spitting in each other's faces, screaming, and he has threatened to hurt himself many times if I were to leave him. Then I found in his phone that he had looked up a porn where he specifically typed out, "" hot blonde college babes with small boobs"" all hell broke loose.

Most recently he has decided to join a fraternity. His reason being philanthropy and leadership, while also making friends. I call BULLSHIT on the first two reasons. He does want friends but I wholeheartedly believe that he fantasizes about being in a fraternity to get shitfaced all the time and hook up with girls while acting like an idiot with a group of guys. Now he is pledging and there is absolutely no time for me anymore. The day starts at 5am when they go on runs and ends at 11 pm when there done doing whatever the hell they do. Not to mention he is constantly running errands for them when he actually does have fee time.

My trust is way too thin for him to be in a fraternity and I'm losing my mind. Constantly wondering where he is and what they're doing. One night he convinced me to come the their frat party. I didn't want to take part in that but after constant begging I finally went. At first it was fun, we had a lot to drink and we danced a lot and he introduced me to the fraternity brothers. We took shots out of an ice sculpture of a naked woman's breasts and laughed the night away. Next thing I know  I'm making myself a drink and look behind me to see this girl who I had never met or seen before. She had called him by name and hugged him as if they had gone way back. I went up to the two of them and introduced myself she starting saying ""you're boyfriends such a good guy you should stay with him forever. We had lunch the other day."" She seemed extremely fake and even sinister. I was so taken aback. As soon as she walked away he started telling me that it wasn't like that. He had ran into one of his fraternity brothers who she is dating and the three of them had lunch. If that's the case I don't know why she felt the need to tell me that the two of them had lunch and also hug him. I let it go for the night and when we got back to his apartment I drunkenly took an Uber home 40 minutes away while he was asleep. Anyways the fighting has gotten worse and worse to the point where I don't know if we can ever fully recover. When I bring up the countless porn and Instagram incidents he brings up the time I went to Barcelona. 

I don't know what to do anymore he says he cares and crys, begs, threatens me, but his actions show otherwise.

Tl;dr: I'm in a bad and unhealthy relationship and need advice"

The question to ask is how did it come to this, well luckily we can come up with a few *fertile* scenarios to *impregnate* with lust.

**Husband's Best Friend**- So your husband and yourself have been trying to conceive and it hasn't been stuck, not for a lack of effort. After doubting yourself you convinced him that you both need to be tested, only to find out that he has an incredibly low sperm count that would make it next to impossible to give you what you want.  After you both secretly confide in me what is going on, I offer to help out just planning on donating some sperm. But the cost that it would take is a little out of the price range that the two of you can afford, so we reach a deal where you are able to call me when you are ovulating and we fertilize the egg, the old fashion way.

**The Biological Clock**- You've been single all your life, not wanting to get married... but wanting to be a mom. Adoption agency aren't in a rush for single business women, but you can feel the clock starting to tick down. Do you want to seduce the young intern in the office or maybe hash out a deal for a FWB deal with your black co-worker.

I have a few more ideas brewing, but they don't feel like full scenes just yet, if you are into helping craft a new scene and turning it into something.... I'm more then happy to *reproduce* with you"
81702y,0,2018-03-01,Help! I need advice on how to proceed with my boyfriend who has never been in a relationship before this one.,AcrobaticZombie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/81702y/help_i_need_advice_on_how_to_proceed_with_my/,"I apologize for the long post, there's a lot to explain about the situation. I'm using a throwaway account for this because my boyfriend is also on reddit. Also, I'm on mobile so I'm sorry if this formattigg sucks.

TL;DR: I want to move in with my boyfriend but he has never been in a serious relationship before this, and I am also more financially independent than he is. Is moving in together even a good idea at this point?

I (22/f) have been dating my boyfriend (23/m) for about 6 months. We'll call him John for the purposes of this post. We met on tinder early in 2017 and have been seeing each other since. Our relationship experiences up until this point  are completely opposite; I was coming from living with my fiancé at the time, while John has never had a girlfriend before me.

We both went to the same university, I graduated May of last year and landed a full time job in a related field pretty soon after, so I wake up at 6:00am everyday for work and get home around 6:00pm. He has never had a job and is still a student. His family has the means to allow him to continue doing this pretty much indefinitely. I don't mind that he doesn't work since it's financially secure for him to do so, but the fact that he stays asleep in my bed and hangs out at my apartment while I work 9 hour days is definitely not the type of situation that I want to continue to be in for an extended period of time.

My concern is that we are not on the same page when it comes to how we're going to move forward from here. He told me that he loved me first, I was hesitant to take it to that level out of fear of getting too serious too soon, especially considering the circumstances. He sleeps over at my apartment pretty much every night, and we'll spend the weekend at his place or out and about together. He always initiates the hanging out, and seems to love spending time with me. 

John has a pretty low EQ and also tends to be quiet, so it's hard to get a reading on his feelings or opinions on any matter. He's said that he understands his own emotions well, he just has difficulty relating to how other people feel or understanding their side of things. So while everything has been great with him, I feel like we're lacking in communication. We never talk about a future together at all, but when I ask about what he thinks will happen when he graduates and if he thinks we'll just break up, he says no. He says he doesn't see our relationship ending anytime soon. But that's all he says. He says I love you and says he's happy occasionally, but nothing other than that. Am I over thinking this part of the relationship? My worry is that I can't tell if he doesn't tell me that he wants to spend his life with me because a) he doesn't know how to say those things because he's awkward and this is all new to him, or b) while he might enjoy spending time with me now, he doesn't feel serious enough to commit to any kind of future with me.

So, the main reason for this post is the fact that I want to ask him his feelings on moving in together. We're together practically every minute I'm not working. My lease ends in July, his in August. I'm struggling with an awful roommate right now and have no idea where I'm going to live next year. I am 100% financially independent from my parents. My dad was recently diagnosed with cancer and I have had to start contributing to my parents bills recently as well, so any reduction in my monthly costs would be incredible. When I have asked him what his plans are for next year, he said he'll either be staying here taking classes/ working an internship/ finding a job, or he'll move back home with his mom (2 hours away) if he graduates and doesn't find a job here. 

I'm not sure what he would say to moving in together (even with other roommates, I wouldn't mind that), but I have a feeling that his mother is going to be a huge barrier to taking this next step. She's super sweet, but very religious. If he's home for the weekend, he goes to church with her, she has no idea he's an atheist. She doesn't believe in sex before marriage and probably thinks he's still a virgin. This is a huge red flag for me because at this point I am independent from my parents and trying to start my life, but I feel like he's still stuck in the teenage/ college phase, and can continue to do that for as long as he wants.

I know that every person is different, but does this situation seem like something that can work out in the end? Am I asking too much of him too soon, or is this a reasonable next step? What can I say to him or ask him to try to get some of this out in the open? I'm afraid of wasting my time and focusing my energy into something that's just going to end, and being hurt like I have been in the past."

I do some of my best code when I'm lying around my house in shorts and it infuriates me that girls can wear skirts but guys can't wear shorts."

Background: 
My boyfriend is bipolar and has medication. We have been together for a year and a half and live together in the city. 
He has had episodes before that have landed him in jail. Other than that he gets in screaming matches with me and then comes back like a scared child. He was diagnosed with a bipolar condition and he got his charges dropped. (This was back in September)
He stopped taking medicine a month ago because his dad lost his insurance so very recently my dad said he would pay for it out of pocket. 
It needs to be said that my bf has a poor background with alcoholic drug addicted parents. This was never an issue for me and my family have financially supported him from paying rent to groceries to clothing car etc. however when my bf has episodes he says it bothers him.
My bf has a job where he needs X amount of clients before he triggers his contract. He is at 4 now so unfortunately we are relying solely on my income which is a nannying job. I graduate at the end of the year and I am currently pursuing an internship. 
When he is on his medicine he is amazing. He has two degrees, plays a semi pro sport and is looking to go pro. He has many friends and very likable.

Problem:
Fast forward to last weekend when my family and I flew us down to celebrate my grandmas birthday. Unfortunately we made the decision to drink. Drinking for us is a hit or miss, I regret drinking now but at the time we were confident. 
We were fine Friday drinking and actually had a great time with my family. It was his bday and we all surprised him with a cake, it was a great memory because he never had anyone to celebrate his birthday with. He felt like he was always part of the family in that moment. 
Here comes Saturday.. we were drinking again but this time I had half a glass of wine and half a glass of scotch. My boyfriend on the other hand had multiple beers, multiple glasses wine, a shot of an aged Don Julio and a huge glass of scotch. 
Surprisingly we were fine again and we retired to the bedroom. 
We were talking in bed (at my aunts house) about my cousin (she is a spoiled brat, no way to sugar coat it. Very wealthy, talks about herself constantly, very vapid to the point where she talked about herself at my grandpas funeral and my aunt (not her mother) had to tell her to shut the fuck up). 
My boyfriend got extremely angry and said now I am “two faced” because we were staying in her old room (she moved out 5 years ago) and how no one wants to date a two faced bitch like me. 
I was floored and not expecting this. I also realized he did not take his medicine that night so I knew he was about to have an episode. I immediately hid under the blankets and he ripped them off. I stayed hiding and he pulled my underwear down. Now I am a rape victim of the age of 4, 18, 20 and 24 which he knows about, and I went OFF. I suffer PTSD from the childhood rape since I couldn’t properly defend myself so I hit him multiple times. He returned the favour and hit me multiple times back. It was bad he strangled me, open palm fisted me. 
He then went to call the cops for suicide on me since I have cut myself and landed in the hospital. I was hysterically crying so I get why he would but I did know we would both get arrested for DV. 
I ended up breaking his phone in an attempt for the call not to go threw and tried to fight him off it because he was arrested before for DV so I was scared shitless for him. He ran out the door successfully called 911 and we both were arrested. I was in jail from Sunday 2 am till Monday afternoon.

I spent my time and my parents immediately took me home, they gave my bf hundreds of dollars and a safe flight back to our apartment where my car is as well. 

Where I need help: 
Obviously this is a mental illness case. I am what I’d like to consider well equipped with mental illness as my two best friends are professionals and one has talked to my bf multiple times about his behavior and is the only one to successful calm him down during an episode.
As I said earlier I have an internship which I just got today (yay me) and it is in a remote location meaning I can do it from home.
As for my nannying job it is in the city where my bf and I live and I love the family. They know about all this and still want me back and said they love and will support me as best they can. 
I have heard NOTHING from my boyfriend since the day of the incident which was Sunday. I pathetically sent stupid amounts of messages hoping one would get threw but my friends said that’s the worst thing to do since he is still in an episode. 
I love the guy. He’s the best I’ve had in a relationship, but of course with the bipolar side he can also be one of the worst (not the worst because I was raped by one). 
I need to figure out if I should go back to our old apartment and try and salvage our relationship, he financially depends on me and I feel responsible in a way for what happens to him.
OR should I stay at home with my parents (ugh) and eventually move out my stuff from the apartment
I don’t have much time because work wants me back next Wednesday. 
Also since my bf ghosted what should I do? He is on social media which is frustrating but the last I heard he was where we got arrested which is a different city pretty far away from our apartment. 

Any advice helps so thank you so much "

817p1h,4,2018-03-01,The Post-Psychosis Blues,suzypulledapistol,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/817p1h/the_postpsychosis_blues/,"Hi again fellow /r/leaves. I feel I have to get this shit off my chest.

I had cannabis induced psychosis in early December, went into treatment for it and quit cold turkey (because I literally had to). Some time back I [wrote about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/7x2x6g/i_had_cannabis_induced_psychosis/) and got a lot of support from you amazing guys and gals.

I always had my soul mate to fall back on, my girlfriend of 6+ years, but since yesterday she's on the other side of the planet doing an internship and basically having the experience of her life (which I feel is totally awesome).

Me though, I'm feeling down and out for real.

After the psychosis I quit cold turkey and didn't have much problems. I felt pretty great pretty fast, I am on anti psychosis medication since then, went to work again after 3 weeks. I felt like I fixed up really easy, until I relapsed in early February basically.

Since then I've been having days of feeling in the gutter which I feel are becoming more frequent, especially now my girl is gone.

I'm a university drop out. I studied cultural history. I've been smoking since before I started, basically since I was 20 (now I'm 34). I feel I f*cked up my opportunities there. I was studying the shit I love. I was going to learn Spanish for the studies, which is ironic because years after I dropped out I met my Spanish girlfriend, but I never got to learn the language. I dropped out because I was smoking like a dumb ass every god damn day of my life.

Lately I've been questioning my entire life, where I ended up, having major feels every day which I used to blot out with thick smoke, but are now way up in my face, so it's like I'm a teenager growing up for the first time. I figured out I'm basically doing a job I don't like any more in an industry I don't like any more. I took this job because it was an easy fix for me at the time I dropped out. I was pretty good with computers so I went into customer care for an IT company.

Now I'm left without weed, doing a job I don't want to develop myself in (which makes me feel increasingly unfit for the job, no idea how I made it this far), and feeling like a big failure because I didn't live up to my own and others' expectations, alone in my mundane reality. 

I don't really have friends. I always suspected I was on the Autism Spectrum, never really fitted in anywhere, always had trouble being social and keeping friends. I have my family though, and am on good terms with them. I'm hoping to figure out this autism deal while I'm in therapy for the psychosis. I think it's one of the main reasons why I started smoking after high school.

I already set a long term goal for myself. Get back to university and finish my studies. This however won't be possible until my girlfriend gets a job and she can take over the financial responsibilities of paying the rent and what not. It will take around 2 years before she's done with her studies and will start looking for a job.

I don't know if I'm just experiencing Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome, or what a lot of you guys describe as ""the fog"", whatever that is, but man, this sucks. I don't know if I should be happy at least having a job, while others out there are jobless. I don't know much about anything any more lately, which makes me anxious and depressed simultaneously.

I'm just scraping by, dragging myself out of bed, day by day, hoping I won't fall into a major depression. I need to get my shit together while my girlfriend is gone, but it's so damn hard feeling like I do right now.

Anyway, that's basically where I'm at now.

TL;DR: Since I had my first relapse, I feel like shit about myself, my job and where my life is going."

&gt;Dear Overwatch subreddit,

&gt; I am a high school student in Ontario, Canada, and for a computer science project, we are tasked with contacting someone outside of Canada in the computer science field to ask some questions about what their job entails. I'm hopeful that maybe developers from my favourite games may respond

&gt;If somebody from the Overwatch team, or anybody working in the computer science field, could answer these questions, I would be ecstatic.

&gt;1. What does a typical work day look for you? What responsibilities or roles do you take on? Do you get to play games on the job?

&gt;Thank you so much for your time.

&gt;Yours truly,

&gt;A hopeful high school student

Hey there u/ilovesushisobad (great name)!

I'm a lead software engineer on the Overwatch team. My team is called Reliability Engineering and at a high level we focus on live operations, build systems, and automation. 

As a lead engineer I split my time between individual contribution (like writing code) and managing projects and people. The actual split varies depending on what's going on, I'm the most happy when it's somewhere around 40% coding, 60% managing. 

A typical day for me starts pretty early. I like to be in the office before the rest of the team. This gives me an opportunity to check on things like our morning scheduled builds. The reliability engineering team takes development productivity very seriously, we want to make sure everyone can do their job when they show up. If builds are broken, that can slow everyone down! 

After I drink a coffee and do small things I try to write some code for whatever project I'm working on. Usually I can sneak in a few hours before morning standups. 

Once people arrive in the office, sub teams get together and do a quick standup sync. Talk through what's going on today, what blockers are in the way, etc. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the entire development team meets in our lounge and we show off new art and talk about upcoming milestones. This meeting is actually awesome! It helps connect you with the work that's happening on other teams that you may not get a chance to talk to every day.

We have two scheduled playtest every day, but there are a lot of ad-hoc playtests depending on what developers need. The two scheduled playtests are led by our QA group and they do a great job of focusing the team on the next major milestone, making sure everyone has a chance to share their thoughts on whatever is next for Overwatch. 

As a game developer it's really common for people to ask us if we play games all day, our QA team is especially sensitive to this question. :) Geoff Goodman, our lead hero designer, likes to compare us to a bakery. You probably don't spend all day eating cakes if you work at a bakery! Still, it's absolutely critical to have time for the whole team to play, we're very connected to Overwatch. There are several groups that do competitive games over lunch, our animators are a particularly serious bunch, they're very good at the game!

There was an awesome post on our forums a while ago about a community project called [Ecopoint Brazil](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760907244). The folks who created and participated in this project are amazing individuals, it felt amazing to see Overwatch as a source of inspiration for them.

One of our core values is to embrace your inner geek, it's one of my favorite parts of Blizzard culture. I'm currently traveling, but once I return to the office I'll follow up with our environmental geeks to see what they're most excited about, I'll try to come back here to share.

I've always been passionate about programming. Bulletin boards were popular when I was young (sort of before the internet), and I would work on the software for my friends. I went to school at the University of Minnesota for Computer Science. I think education is important, I love to do events with our university relations teams.

I've been at Blizzard for about 7 years, it felt a bit like coming home. I have a lot of great friends who worked here, they've been around much longer than me! I knew I wanted to work on video games but I wasn't in a hurry. I've worked at a few great companies during my career including Boston Scientific and Electronic Arts. Blizzard is magical though.

Hopefully my flair here will work as proof, cheers!

Hey, everyone. 

A few more developers were kind enough to respond to this question, so I’ve combined their responses into a single post. Enjoy! 

#Howie Yoo [Senior Software Engineer] - u/HowieYoo

**What does a typical work day look for you? What responsibilities or roles do you take on? Do you get to play games on the job?**

I am a software engineer on the engine team and do systems and console related work.  This consists of coding and debugging in C++ to make the game work correctly and efficiently on the wide range of hardware and platforms we support. I also spend a lot of time figuring out why it works on my machine and not yours.

**How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)? What is being done at Blizzard, or your job/company specifically, to help preserve the environment?**

I live 50 miles from the office so my commute has a negative impact on the environment.  Blizzard offers a subsidized van pool as well as incentives for those who car pool.

**What was your academic background? What did you do before working at your company? How did you get your job at your company?**

I was once a high school student from Ontario as well and lived all around the GTA before going to the University of Waterloo for Computer Science back in the late 90s.  As part of Waterloo's co-operative education program, I got a work term at EA and have been in the industry since then.  While attending BlizzCon 2014, the year of the Overwatch announce, I applied for a position and was accepted about three years ago.

#Keith Miron [Lead Software Engineer]

**What does a typical work day look for you?**

Get into work, look over our team’s bugs for the day, review emails from last night, figure out what tasks I need to accomplish that day, attend meetings, do some actual programming, partake in playtests, watch Overwatch League whenever possible. 

**What responsibilities or roles do you take on?**

As a lead for gameplay, most of my responsibilities revolve around working with our awesome engineering team who work on new features for Overwatch. These range from things like adding skin selection to hero select, cool abilities for our latest heroes, or supporting Overwatch League!

**Do you get to play games on the job?**

I would say that most of our time is actually occupied with making the game. That being said we do get to play Overwatch during our internal ‘playtests’ to try out new heroes, maps, features.  This is an important part of development, since we are heavily iteration driven and it can take quite a few playtests to really figure out what needs to be added/removed/changed.   

**How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)?**

It’s hard to gauge, but I would say most of my impact to the environment is negative in that I have about a 20-minute commute to work (by car).  I’m looking to switch over to biking instead, which thankfully Blizzard offers incentives for doing!

**What is being done at Blizzard, or your job/company specifically, to help preserve the environment?**

For the stuff that I know of, we have on-site electric vehicle chargers, recycling bins everywhere, and rideshare programs to promote carpooling/biking to work.

**What was your academic background?**

B.S in Computer Science, and a bunch of programming during my early years and throughout high school.

**What did you do before working at your company?**

Went to school for Computer Science, worked a bunch of odd jobs and did a stint at a different video game company or 5 and a half years, before coming to Blizzard around 2011.

**How did you get your job at your company?**

I had a former co-worker who was already at Blizzard, and he was able to get me a referral to apply.  

#Andrew Wang [Senior Software Engineer]

**What does a typical work day look for you? What responsibilities or roles do you take on? Do you get to play games on the job?**

A typical day as a gameplay programmer usually starts with morning synch-up meetings, catching up on any outstanding email/messages etc. At this point I either continue coding what I left off yesterday or start talking to other engineers and designers about what we should be focusing on next. This might be as simple as checking up on my designers and making sure they have the technology they need to finish their own tasks, or fielding requests from them or other engineers. For example, a designer might say, “I need a way for Doomfist to gain shields whenever he performs a special ability, and these bonus shields need to decay to 0 over time.” I would then sit down with that designer, make sure we talk through all the use cases, talk about how urgent/complex making the change would be, and then give him an estimate as to when I could deliver that code, based on its complexity and urgency and what other work I have to do. 

This is actually one of the most fun parts of my job because I love helping making the building blocks that make our game come to life. Other things I may work on during the day is giving advice to other engineers about how best to solve certain problems they are working on, or asking them for their feedback about something I am working on.

**Do you get to play games on the job?**

Obviously I get to play Overwatch in order to test it, though in that sense we are usually playing it to test something new, whether it’s a new hero, new map, or tweaks to abilities. Every time Blizzard releases a game, we usually take the next day to just sit down and play that game, so that’s fun. Most games though, I play on my own time, both for fun and to see what good ideas other people are coming up with (or in less fun cases, what isn’t working). It’s pretty common for people to say ‘oh you make games, so you must play games all day’. A good way to think about it is that we make games all day in the same way a baker eats cake all day. Eating cake might be part of it (to see if it’s any good), but there’s a lot more to it.

**How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)? What is being done at Blizzard, or your job/company specifically, to help preserve the environment?**

I’m not sure there’s much that I directly affect that then has an impact one way or the other on the environment. We’ve definitely begun focusing on selling our games digitally rather than physical, boxed copies, so that means less physical waste as people continue to move away from buying physical copies. I think that’s got to be a solid plus for the environment, as we go more digital. I do have to confess that I still buy most of my media physically, since I’m a collector/packrat, so if you can avoid it, don’t be like me!

**What was your academic background? What did you do before working at your company? How did you get your job at your company?**

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. I took an ‘introduction to video game programming’ class (kind of by mistake, actually), that really turned me on to making games. I took an internship with a game company that one of the course instructors worked at, and that’s how I ‘broke in’ to the industry. I’ve worked at three other game companies before I came to Blizzard something like 8 years ago. I got the job by applying! We actually have the most reasonable interview process out of any company I’ve interviewed at, in my opinion.

#Stephen Penson [Senior Gameplay Engineer]

**What does a typical work day look for you? What responsibilities or roles do you take on? Do you get to play games on the job?**

I work on the gameplay engineering team. I’m mostly responsible for the Overwatch animation system but also do various gameplay and hero related work.
Depending on the stage of the project, I may be working on a single feature (over days or even weeks) or I may be addressing various bugs or improvements (multiple per day). Currently it's mostly work on new content, workflow improvements and bug fixing. Whatever stage of the project, there’s plenty of collaboration with Game Designers, Producers, Content Creators, QA (and sometimes Customer Service) as well as other engineers from the team or across the company.

**How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)? What is being done at Blizzard, or your job/company specifically, to help preserve the environment?**

I am personally quite concerned about the environment and try and keep my own carbon footprint in check. I cycle to work every day, try and keep appliances off, recycle etc. Blizzard help support this with a 'rideshare' program. We can re-cycle etc. Obviously a large number of PC’s switched on 24/7 would be a negative.

**What was your academic background? What did you do before working at your company? How did you get your job at your company?**

I have a BSc (HONS) Engineering Physics degree from a U.K. university. I‘d been programming games as a hobby throughout my school and college education but didn’t study for a software engineering career. 

My first job in the games industry was after a career change (after 3yrs working as an electronics engineer in Aerospace/Defense). After a year out traveling (and working on my own project/demo) I applied via a recruiting agency to several local games companies. I was fortunate enough to be able to accept an offer with a very friendly group of people at Bizarre Creations. Back then team sizes were still small (I was programmer 30 or something?) so it was usual to be plunged into the deep end, taking ownership of several systems and areas of the game. Over time (and on multiple games) I began to specialize in player character/camera control and animation which I still enjoy working on to this day.

&gt;Dear Overwatch subreddit,

&gt; I am a high school student in Ontario, Canada, and for a computer science project, we are tasked with contacting someone outside of Canada in the computer science field to ask some questions about what their job entails. I'm hopeful that maybe developers from my favourite games may respond

&gt;If somebody from the Overwatch team, or anybody working in the computer science field, could answer these questions, I would be ecstatic.

&gt;1. What does a typical work day look for you? What responsibilities or roles do you take on? Do you get to play games on the job?

&gt;2. How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)? What is being done at Blizzard, or your job/company specifically, to help preserve the environment?

&gt;The project also requires proof that you work in the computer science industry.

&gt;Thank you so much for your time.

&gt;Yours truly,

&gt;A hopeful high school student

Hey there u/ilovesushisobad (great name)!

I'm a lead software engineer on the Overwatch team. My team is called Reliability Engineering and at a high level we focus on live operations, build systems, and automation. 

As a lead engineer I split my time between individual contribution (like writing code) and managing projects and people. The actual split varies depending on what's going on, I'm the most happy when it's somewhere around 40% coding, 60% managing. 

A typical day for me starts pretty early. I like to be in the office before the rest of the team. This gives me an opportunity to check on things like our morning scheduled builds. The reliability engineering team takes development productivity very seriously, we want to make sure everyone can do their job when they show up. If builds are broken, that can slow everyone down! 

After I drink a coffee and do small things I try to write some code for whatever project I'm working on. Usually I can sneak in a few hours before morning standups. 

Once people arrive in the office, sub teams get together and do a quick standup sync. Talk through what's going on today, what blockers are in the way, etc. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the entire development team meets in our lounge and we show off new art and talk about upcoming milestones. This meeting is actually awesome! It helps connect you with the work that's happening on other teams that you may not get a chance to talk to every day.

We have two scheduled playtest every day, but there are a lot of ad-hoc playtests depending on what developers need. The two scheduled playtests are led by our QA group and they do a great job of focusing the team on the next major milestone, making sure everyone has a chance to share their thoughts on whatever is next for Overwatch. 

As a game developer it's really common for people to ask us if we play games all day, our QA team is especially sensitive to this question. :) Geoff Goodman, our lead hero designer, likes to compare us to a bakery. You probably don't spend all day eating cakes if you work at a bakery! Still, it's absolutely critical to have time for the whole team to play, we're very connected to Overwatch. There are several groups that do competitive games over lunch, our animators are a particularly serious bunch, they're very good at the game!

There was an awesome post on our forums a while ago about a community project called [Ecopoint Brazil](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760907244). The folks who created and participated in this project are amazing individuals, it felt amazing to see Overwatch as a source of inspiration for them.

One of our core values is to embrace your inner geek, it's one of my favorite parts of Blizzard culture. I'm currently traveling, but once I return to the office I'll follow up with our environmental geeks to see what they're most excited about, I'll try to come back here to share.

I've always been passionate about programming. Bulletin boards were popular when I was young (sort of before the internet), and I would work on the software for my friends. I went to school at the University of Minnesota for Computer Science. I think education is important, I love to do events with our university relations teams.

I've been at Blizzard for about 7 years, it felt a bit like coming home. I have a lot of great friends who worked here, they've been around much longer than me! I knew I wanted to work on video games but I wasn't in a hurry. I've worked at a few great companies during my career including Boston Scientific and Electronic Arts. Blizzard is magical though.

Hopefully my flair here will work as proof, cheers!

Hey, everyone. 

A few more developers were kind enough to respond to this question, so I’ve combined their responses into a single post. Enjoy! 

#Howie Yoo [Senior Software Engineer] - u/HowieYoo

**What does a typical work day look for you? What responsibilities or roles do you take on? Do you get to play games on the job?**

I am a software engineer on the engine team and do systems and console related work.  This consists of coding and debugging in C++ to make the game work correctly and efficiently on the wide range of hardware and platforms we support. I also spend a lot of time figuring out why it works on my machine and not yours.

**How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)? What is being done at Blizzard, or your job/company specifically, to help preserve the environment?**

I live 50 miles from the office so my commute has a negative impact on the environment.  Blizzard offers a subsidized van pool as well as incentives for those who car pool.

**What was your academic background? What did you do before working at your company? How did you get your job at your company?**

I was once a high school student from Ontario as well and lived all around the GTA before going to the University of Waterloo for Computer Science back in the late 90s.  As part of Waterloo's co-operative education program, I got a work term at EA and have been in the industry since then.  While attending BlizzCon 2014, the year of the Overwatch announce, I applied for a position and was accepted about three years ago.

#Keith Miron [Lead Software Engineer]

**What does a typical work day look for you?**

Get into work, look over our team’s bugs for the day, review emails from last night, figure out what tasks I need to accomplish that day, attend meetings, do some actual programming, partake in playtests, watch Overwatch League whenever possible. 

**What responsibilities or roles do you take on?**

As a lead for gameplay, most of my responsibilities revolve around working with our awesome engineering team who work on new features for Overwatch. These range from things like adding skin selection to hero select, cool abilities for our latest heroes, or supporting Overwatch League!

**Do you get to play games on the job?**

I would say that most of our time is actually occupied with making the game. That being said we do get to play Overwatch during our internal ‘playtests’ to try out new heroes, maps, features.  This is an important part of development, since we are heavily iteration driven and it can take quite a few playtests to really figure out what needs to be added/removed/changed.   

**How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)?**

It’s hard to gauge, but I would say most of my impact to the environment is negative in that I have about a 20-minute commute to work (by car).  I’m looking to switch over to biking instead, which thankfully Blizzard offers incentives for doing!

**What is being done at Blizzard, or your job/company specifically, to help preserve the environment?**

For the stuff that I know of, we have on-site electric vehicle chargers, recycling bins everywhere, and rideshare programs to promote carpooling/biking to work.

**What was your academic background?**

B.S in Computer Science, and a bunch of programming during my early years and throughout high school.

**What did you do before working at your company?**

Went to school for Computer Science, worked a bunch of odd jobs and did a stint at a different video game company or 5 and a half years, before coming to Blizzard around 2011.

**How did you get your job at your company?**

I had a former co-worker who was already at Blizzard, and he was able to get me a referral to apply.  

#Andrew Wang [Senior Software Engineer]

**What does a typical work day look for you? What responsibilities or roles do you take on? Do you get to play games on the job?**

A typical day as a gameplay programmer usually starts with morning synch-up meetings, catching up on any outstanding email/messages etc. At this point I either continue coding what I left off yesterday or start talking to other engineers and designers about what we should be focusing on next. This might be as simple as checking up on my designers and making sure they have the technology they need to finish their own tasks, or fielding requests from them or other engineers. For example, a designer might say, “I need a way for Doomfist to gain shields whenever he performs a special ability, and these bonus shields need to decay to 0 over time.” I would then sit down with that designer, make sure we talk through all the use cases, talk about how urgent/complex making the change would be, and then give him an estimate as to when I could deliver that code, based on its complexity and urgency and what other work I have to do. 

This is actually one of the most fun parts of my job because I love helping making the building blocks that make our game come to life. Other things I may work on during the day is giving advice to other engineers about how best to solve certain problems they are working on, or asking them for their feedback about something I am working on.

**Do you get to play games on the job?**

Obviously I get to play Overwatch in order to test it, though in that sense we are usually playing it to test something new, whether it’s a new hero, new map, or tweaks to abilities. Every time Blizzard releases a game, we usually take the next day to just sit down and play that game, so that’s fun. Most games though, I play on my own time, both for fun and to see what good ideas other people are coming up with (or in less fun cases, what isn’t working). It’s pretty common for people to say ‘oh you make games, so you must play games all day’. A good way to think about it is that we make games all day in the same way a baker eats cake all day. Eating cake might be part of it (to see if it’s any good), but there’s a lot more to it.

**How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)? What is being done at Blizzard, or your job/company specifically, to help preserve the environment?**

I’m not sure there’s much that I directly affect that then has an impact one way or the other on the environment. We’ve definitely begun focusing on selling our games digitally rather than physical, boxed copies, so that means less physical waste as people continue to move away from buying physical copies. I think that’s got to be a solid plus for the environment, as we go more digital. I do have to confess that I still buy most of my media physically, since I’m a collector/packrat, so if you can avoid it, don’t be like me!

**What was your academic background? What did you do before working at your company? How did you get your job at your company?**

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. I took an ‘introduction to video game programming’ class (kind of by mistake, actually), that really turned me on to making games. I took an internship with a game company that one of the course instructors worked at, and that’s how I ‘broke in’ to the industry. I’ve worked at three other game companies before I came to Blizzard something like 8 years ago. I got the job by applying! We actually have the most reasonable interview process out of any company I’ve interviewed at, in my opinion.

#Stephen Penson [Senior Gameplay Engineer]

**What does a typical work day look for you? What responsibilities or roles do you take on? Do you get to play games on the job?**

I work on the gameplay engineering team. I’m mostly responsible for the Overwatch animation system but also do various gameplay and hero related work.
Depending on the stage of the project, I may be working on a single feature (over days or even weeks) or I may be addressing various bugs or improvements (multiple per day). Currently it's mostly work on new content, workflow improvements and bug fixing. Whatever stage of the project, there’s plenty of collaboration with Game Designers, Producers, Content Creators, QA (and sometimes Customer Service) as well as other engineers from the team or across the company.

**How do you think your work impacts the environment (positive, negative)? What is being done at Blizzard, or your job/company specifically, to help preserve the environment?**

I am personally quite concerned about the environment and try and keep my own carbon footprint in check. I cycle to work every day, try and keep appliances off, recycle etc. Blizzard help support this with a 'rideshare' program. We can re-cycle etc. Obviously a large number of PC’s switched on 24/7 would be a negative.

**What was your academic background? What did you do before working at your company? How did you get your job at your company?**

I have a BSc (HONS) Engineering Physics degree from a U.K. university. I‘d been programming games as a hobby throughout my school and college education but didn’t study for a software engineering career. 

My first job in the games industry was after a career change (after 3yrs working as an electronics engineer in Aerospace/Defense). After a year out traveling (and working on my own project/demo) I applied via a recruiting agency to several local games companies. I was fortunate enough to be able to accept an offer with a very friendly group of people at Bizarre Creations. Back then team sizes were still small (I was programmer 30 or something?) so it was usual to be plunged into the deep end, taking ownership of several systems and areas of the game. Over time (and on multiple games) I began to specialize in player character/camera control and animation which I still enjoy working on to this day.

818bqn,0,2018-03-01,Graduate in May - Currently an intern looking for a raise,bails222,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/818bqn/graduate_in_may_currently_an_intern_looking_for_a/,"I landed a Desktop Support Technician role my sophomore year of college at a Fortune 500 company and I have been here ever since. I will be graduating in May with a Bachelor's Degree in Computers and Information Technology. Now, here's what I'm needing help with to negotiate pay for possibly transitioning into a full time employee/contractor. Now take note, my company rarely hires IT staff as full time employees. 90% are contractors. I am okay with this for a little bit granted I am compensated well.

-I'm not your typical intern. I am heavily relied on for our home office working 45-50 hour weeks. I am currently responsible for over 800 employees by myself very rarely getting help. That's an 800 to 1 ratio when the normal is 75 to 1 from what I've researched. I am constantly swamped. There are two other guys in here, but they are mainly responsible for our remote office tickets.

-Current market value for a Tier 2 Desktop Support Technician is $49,000 according to glassdoor.com. I am making $14 an hour and made $31,000 last year (started at $12 sophomore year going up a $1 every year).

-I took a sick day two weeks ago for an interview and was offered a $50,000 salary based job with unlimited time off (as long as it's not abused) and an excellent benefits package.

I do enjoy this job a lot and I love the people I work with as well as the work environment, but if I'm taking on this big of a role, I want to be compensated fairly. What should I expect to be making hourly or salary wise when I go to talk to my manager here in the next week? Any tips for negotiating higher wages are appreciated as well."
818if3,2,2018-03-01,[F4A] Indulgence of Desires,TheNubileNymph,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/818if3/f4a_indulgence_of_desires/,"I’d been called a workaholic throughout my life. Since highschool I’d been working out, constantly running, doing yoga, riding a bike, or playing tennis.  When I wasn’t working out, I was studying. I graduated tied for the top spot in my class, and although I didn’t go out and party as often as other girls, my life had been made difficult – or at least, annoying – by jealous girls who had crushes or boyfriends more interested in me than them.

I hadn’t cared. I’d gone to college, leaving my small town behind, and I’d excelled there too. I found it difficult to multitask: when I did something, I put my full effort into it, and since my full effort was considerable, that meant I was able to get a lot done. I studied, I worked out, I learned how fashion worked so I knew how to dress and avoid nerdy or rural stereotypes, while still being comfortable.  I learned to look good without being scandalous.

With my short, slender frame, narrow waist, flared hips, and round, smooth, thick ass – along with cute perky b-cups (some days closer to a-cups) and my short, dark chocolate hair – sometimes in a bob-cut, sometimes a top knot – I also managed to pull off a mixture of cute and sexy that worked to my advantage. I was pretty, with perpetually tanned skin – it was a fair shade of olive, the result of my part-Hispanic, part-German heritage.  I have huge amber-brown eyes, like some Disney princess, which I often hid behind glasses. I didn’t shy away from using my attractive, petite frame to encourage someone, tacitly, to take out the trash for me.  Perhaps it even helped me get into the schools and internships I had wanted, but I figured I should’ve gotten in anyways based on my grades and skills.

Everything I did, I did using every skill I had.  That included pleasuring myself.  I was settled on my knees, supporting my upper body with my left forearm, while I twisted my upper body and reached back behind me with my right.  In my delicate right hand, I held the plug.  I used my fingers to shift and press the metal point of the plug against my tight little asshole, deep between the thick cheeks of my ass.  I’d already poured a dash of lube against my asshole, and put another dab on the toy before I’d settled onto my knees and arm in front of the tall floor length mirror I had against my bedroom wall.  The metal plug, expensive and luxurious in both appearance and feel, was warm from the heat of my mouth, as I pulled it between my lips and teased my tongue against it.  It had filled my mouth, and I’d only withdrawn it once it was the right heat.  Then the lube, and now the teasing touch. 

I kept a steady pressure against my asshole, felt myself spreading as the plug flared from a narrow tip to its widest point.  It wasn’t difficult at the start – but the plug flared rapidly, and soon I felt my mouth spread wide as I marveled at how *huge* the plug felt against me.  I knew how big it was, had taken it in my mouth, had rubbed it in my hands.  But my ass had never been spread so wide.  I wished I was recording it, watching it slowly spread me as I kept that steady pressure, interspersed with sudden pulses of more force.  My glasses, the lenses themselves only slightly corrective but the frames a classic matte black style, were fogging as my breath grew hot and fast, and I bucked my head to try and nudge them back up my nose.  

I sat back, pushing my hips back as I lowered my ass towards my heels, towards the mirror, towards the *plug*.  Felt myself spreading wider and then–

–there was an audible pop as the plug tapered back to a narrow stem, my asshole immediately gripping it tightly.  Pushing the last centimeter of the stem, and the whole of the plug inside me, until the circular flange of white metal nestled tightly against my asshole.  Fuck.  I felt so full.  I’d been curious about anal for a long time, and I’d slid my fingers, or little safe objects I had on hand when I’d craved it in the past.  But it wasn’t until now, as a graduate student, 25 years old, that I’d bought myself a plug.  I wished I’d figured out a way to do it sooner – I’d let amazon order histories and worries of discovery from roommates or relatives scare me off too long.  

I groaned with pleasure as I felt the plug shifting inside me as I stood, pulling my skin-tight jeggings back up my fit legs.  I was foregoing panties for this date – not something I’d ever actually done before, but another kink I was curious about, one I read of and fantasized about.  It wasn’t like I’d never met my date before – we’d had classes together, and were somewhere between friends and acquaintances.  The jeggings were every bit as tight as yoga pants, but were made of dark quality denim and other more elastic materials in the lining – invisible but ensuring they hugged every curve.  I chose a bralette, lacy and white, without a wire or much in the way of support, to settle over my high perky breasts, then slipped on the blouse I’d hung in the doorway before I’d started my little pleasure session.  

Five minutes later, after I gave myself a once over in the makeup mirror – I practiced the minimal make up look, the look that some men think actually includes *no makeup*, but still has some liner and foundation.  But it was light and breathable and quick to touch up.  I tied my hair up in a topknot, securing it with a navy ribbon, so dark it almost appeared black, matching the color of my jeggings.  

I grabbed my clutch, blushing as I felt the plug shift inside me once I started to move more naturally.  It was too late to rethink my decision – a glance at the little watch on my wrist was confirmation of that.  My heart raced as I left.

------------

My kinks are: uniforms / clothing – I like spending time undressing and revealing each other’s bodies, or having sex with yoga pants at my knees, or a skirt flipped up, etc; booty stuff – I like spanking, but I don’t like bruising or anything like that, and I don’t like scat – mostly playful spanking to turn my cheeks pink and make them sting a little, and if you’re good at it maybe a little harder, as well as just groping, kissing, gently biting; teasing (not verbally, but like stripteases, flashing, masturbating while the other person watches); sex outside of a bedroom (I don’t like being caught but I do like sort of mild exhibition or voyeur I guess – tough one to explain, and I don’t like dirty settings like alleyways); lingerie; D/s (I’m a switch and I don’t like passive partners – we should both be advancing the story); anal (probably could’ve put this with booty stuff – I like semi-realistic anal, with the exception in that I’m not going to write an enema and I’m just always going to be perfectly clean – I mean that working your finger in should take like two posts from both of us, as your knuckles gets stuck and you have to wiggle and pulse and spread me or give me instructions or get lube etc. No just sliding in.)
I have other kinks but since I was explaining the details that’s already pretty long.

 Limits: non-con, heavy pain, scat, gore, watersports. Also, please **don't** tell me your cock is *x* amount of inches long and *x* wide. **Just use adjectives. It's sexier.**

Partners of all genders equally welcome."
818l6j,2,2018-03-01,F4F - Can We Have A Real Celebrity Roleplay?,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/818l6j/f4f_can_we_have_a_real_celebrity_roleplay/,"Celebrity roleplays are really a hot topic here, I think there's a new post coming out about a celeb play about every 20 minutes and for good reason - celebrities are hot, feisty and awesome to fantasise about. A lot of them are sexual icons and crushes to us and it would be a dream come true to even talk to them, let alone getting to *touch* them 

Yet, when it comes to DPP, a lot of the celebrity plays here lack a sense of realism or a sense of the feeling that ""this could happen"". Not to say those ideas are bad or anything, a lot of them are super creative and seem fun, just not for me. 

I would love to do an original, somewhat realistic, scene. Obviously the scene won't be full out ultra realism mainly because this is roleplay and we are playing and acting out as these people but let's try and hit as close to home as can be.

With that, I propose a couple of ideas! They revolve around you playing a celebrity (whom we can discuss on DM's) and me being a fan. I'm a submissive girl, so this would make the best sense for a pairing.

**The Note:** A young, newly legal, fan goes out to meet her favourite star at their new film premiere in the Hollywood Hills with a note in her hands. In a nutshell, the note asks for the amazing actor to show ways of pleasure this girl has never before experienced.

**The Interview:** You're a celebrity. You're also a *giant* pervert behind closed doors. Ever since you've entered the station for your interview, your eyes have been locked on the petit young intern running around the shop. So, when your interview closes out - you find yourself alone with her in a corridor and well... you can't help but get a little touchy feely right?

I would really love to do the Interview, it's my favourite one right now! I'll share kinks and such on DM's. 

Anyway, with that being said - I look forward to talking to you all and would love to get this going! Please put keyword ""Hollywood"" somewhere if you message me so I know you read this far."

81ai6q,0,2018-03-01,A gay club opened beside the only clinic in town.,FreakinFreakinOut,Jokes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/81ai6q/a_gay_club_opened_beside_the_only_clinic_in_town/,"John, a homophobe, strongly hated it. He detested it so much that he would go out of his way to avoid walking near it. Even when he fell ill, he would go out of town to get the medication he required.

One day, John woke up with severe chest pains and a massive headache. While contemplating to drive out of town, his condition worsened and he had no choice but to visit the nearby clinic.

Upon arriving at the clinic, John was immediately brought into the emergency room, to be examined and treated. After the examination, the doctor gave John a hospital gown to wear while he laid down on the bed to await his medical results.

While on the bed, John felt insecure and cautious being right next door to the gay club. He started having weird thoughts that a gay man would walk into the wrong premise and take advantage of him, especially since the hospital gown kept his rear exposed. He swore that if any gay man dared even come close to him, he wouldn't hesitate to beat them up.


Wong, on the other hand, was an intern for the clinic. He was a nervous wreck and had difficulty speaking to patients. Up till now, he had only been helping the doctor with paperwork. 

However, today happened to be day when the doctor decided that Wong had to overcome his social anxiety and learn to speak to patients. 

Upon receiving the medical results, the doctor ushered for Wong to take charge and inform John of the diagnosis. Wong hesitantly refused as he was afraid he would stutter and give the patient a wrong diagnosis.

Thinking of a possible solution, the doctor calmed Wong down and told him to breathe deeply. He then said to his intern, ""Wong, if you're really having difficulty, just say 3 words to the patient. 'HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE'.""

Wong understood this and mustered his courage to approach the patient. Upon reaching the sick bay where John was, Wong started panting and having a nervous breakdown. He had a hard time recalling the 3 words spoken to him by the doctor.

After several minutes, Wong walked into the room. Keeping a straight face, he said with confidence, 


""HI, BUTT PLEASURE""

81b77g,2,2018-03-01,Taking Exam C,RustyShackleford__,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/81b77g/taking_exam_c/,I am thinking about taking exam C before the changes in June. I have an internship starting early May and would not want to study more than 6/hrs a week during my internship. If I start studying now I will be able to get a solid two months of studying in before my internship. I feel it is unusual to almost fully prepare in two months and then the last month only study enough to maintain knowledge and memory. Has anyone done something similar to this? Does this sound like it will work out? Thanks
81bof8,16,2018-03-01,CMV: Illegal Immigrants Don't Deserve the Same Rights as Legal ones but their Children Do,TurdleBoy,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/81bof8/cmv_illegal_immigrants_dont_deserve_the_same/,"I recently have been flipping between the two opinions right now with immigration. Those two being, immigrants who have stayed illegally should be kicked out if they don't obtain their documents and the other being that immigrants are just as much as citizens as legal Americans. Honestly I think that any situation where an immigrant came in and just lived off the land without sowing into it should be forced to either leave or get papers but I'm conflicted with the ones that have families. Should the ones with families be given special privileges because they have now gotten others involved or should they all be thrown in the same basket. I realize that if you born in the U.S. under an illegal immigrant than you have the option of going with your family back to wherever or obtaining citizenship which I think is a very generous thing for Trump (or whoever decides these things; I'm not keen on politics) to do. I just think that yes, there is a lot of news outlets trying to just make Trump look like a bad person by taking the one-out-of-a-hundred heart-breaking cases and using that as representations for the entire face of illegal immigration. I think those few families that we're started in the U.S. illegally could be given special privilege or something compared to the ones who just show up and eat your barley. However, that doesn't seem to be an option so I think that between letting all immigrants do whatever they want without obtaining legal citizenship and deporting them I'd have to go with deportation. I think Dale Tucker made an excellent point when he compared it to companies like Google and colleges like Harvard (who both support are anti-deportation by the way). Google and Harvard use discrimination with every intern, employee, or student they let in. Google is one of the most careful and discriminatory companies and Harvard is one of the most careful and discriminatory college (in the acceptance stage). If they we're to just let everyone in fear of being called discriminatory then they wouldn't be the top-notch company and college that they are. It is the discrimination that makes them who they are because they are selective organization just like every other good company or university. Yet, they expect that America is going to be this great country if we just let whoever is able to get past our borders without even paying taxes or becoming legal. That's my thoughts on this so please feel free to change my view.

81c3vb,9,2018-03-02,Dismissive Avoidant husband...should I quit?,globetrottergirl,Marriage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/81c3vb/dismissive_avoidant_husbandshould_i_quit/,"Hi there. I'm in a really bad place now and I need some perspective.

I've been in a long distance arranged marriage for the last 1.5 years (he proposed to make his dad happy and I eventually broke down and said yes because my mom has cancer and she begged me). I knew he had no interest in marriage from the first moment we met. I could feel it in my gut.

My internship finally ended and it's time to figure out a plan of how to move in together, and it's freaking him out. I asked if he would rather walk away, and he said yes. But then I act very supportive and understanding of his anxiety and he says that he wants to be with me. I feel like I talk him down from divorce every couple of weeks.

I figured out he is Dismissive Avoidant Attachment 100% and he agrees. The thought of connection and being close freaks him out. He is the oldest child in his conservative family and his sister is less than a year younger. So I can see how his parents put him through powerful emotional neglect and rejection, and why he developed this defensive posture of seeing intimacy as a threat. I get that.

But at the same time, the constant distancing and rejection is weighing me down. I can feel my self esteem suffering. And when I see any reminder of a man doting on his wife even in a movie, it really hurts me and makes me feel like I must not be worthy of the same love because my husband doesn't want me.

I don't want to be divorced. My mom is sick, and Im about to go through a lot of disapointment professionally. So, I dont know if I have the emotional energy to withstand the shitstorm of hurt that is this marriage. 

All I want is to be finally loved. 

I'm debating whether to just call it quits right now, or if by some miracle we are still married in a couple months, to try and live together first. I don't know what to do."

It was Saturday 17 January 1998, beyond midnight in Washington where President Clinton had no idea what was about to hit him.

“NEWSWEEK KILLS STORY ON WHITE HOUSE INTERN; BLOCKBUSTER REPORT: 23-YEAR OLD, FORMER WHITE HOUSE INTERN, SEX RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT”

The headline was posted in such small print that, were it not for the capital letters, a reader might have mistaken it for a dispatch on corn prices rather than an avalanche that would propel Bill Clinton all the way to impeachment. But then, Drudge never has run with the typographical crowd.

Two hours later, he followed up with a longer post in which he elaborated that Newsweek had spiked a story from its then investigative reporter Michael Isikoff. Had it been published, Drudge said, the story would have revealed that a young, still anonymous female intern had been a “frequent visitor to a small study just off the Oval Office” where she developed a sexual relationship with the president.

The next day the Drudge Report published her name: Monica Lewinsky.

The storm unleashed that Saturday night was all the more potent for coming from a single individual operating out of a one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood where he lived with a cat named Cat, three TVs, three computers, a satellite dish and a police scanner. Not long before, he had been selling T-shirts in a gift shop at CBS Studios.

Twenty years later, we can now see that Drudge, 51, sparked a revolution – a double one at that. Politically, his Lewinsky scoops heralded a new kind of American conservatism that was devil-may-care, iconoclastic, hyper-aggressive and populist. If that sounds familiar, given the fireworks bursting daily out of today’s White House, then that is no coincidence.


“Looking back, he was the beginning of a cultural revolution which we are still in the midst of right now,” says David Horowitz, a conservative writer who helped to bail out Drudge shortly before the Lewinsky affair broke. At the time Drudge was fighting a $30m lawsuit against the Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal, whom he had falsely accused of abusing his wife – one of the earliest examples in the internet age of rightwing fake news.

The second revolution Drudge sparked was within the media. By exposing not just the president’s tryst with an intern, but the decision by Newsweek to hold off on the story, he planted a bomb under both the presidency and the mainstream media. “Matt Drudge broke the fraternity of the guardians of the culture,” Horowitz says.

The “fraternity” was aghast at Drudge’s rise. CBS’s Face the Nation refused to sully itself by having Drudge on air. When NBC did extend an invitation, Carl Bernstein, of Watergate fame, scoffed: “The notion of a cyber gossip sitting on Meet the Press would have been unthinkable!” Drudge lapped up the opprobrium, trolling his critics with the comment: “I’m not a journalist, I’m a kangaroo.”

Despite the brickbats, Drudge rapidly attracted a large readership with his gregarious mix of aggregated Beltway and Hollywood gossip, news stories drawn from outlets spanning the political range, and headlines that were clickbait before the term had been coined. “There’s a new sex droid in town”, was one of his recent headlines.

Where readers flocked, news editors followed with tails between legs. A skim of the Drudge headlines became an essential start to any TV, press or radio editors’ day, helping to define what was shaping up to be the 24-hour news cycle. And with no legacy overheads and a lean staff, Drudge was soon raking in the money, the proceeds of which he enjoys today in his 10-acre property outside Miami where he moved in the wake of the Lewinsky furore.

While the readership has always leaned heavily male and conservative, his devoted fans include unexpected figures, such as feminist intellectual Camille Paglia. She was one of the first established voices to break ranks and endorse the site at a time when it was still being almost universally derided.

“I saw in Matt Drudge the triumph of the populist tabloids,” says Paglia. “It’s amazing how no one, in all these decades, has been able to imitate, displace, or supplant Drudge – because he is a true American original.”

Paglia is right: it is amazing that the Drudge Report continues to enjoy the influence it does. The point-size of its banner headline has crept up a bit, but otherwise the layout of the site is virtually unchanged from the original design, as though it were stuck in time.

According to analytics company comScore, the Drudge Report had 2.5 million unique visitors in November. That reach is amplified when you consider the strong engagement of readers who tend to return frequently, producing a total 292m page views that month.

While the Drudge Report is a rightwing site true to the libertarian, small government, anti-abortion, climate change-denying world view of its creator, its impact is felt much more widely. When the Guardian – not a natural Drudge ally – broke the story of Steve Bannon’s incendiary remarks in Michael Wolff’s new book Fire and Fury this month, fully a quarter of the vast traffic it generated came through Drudge.

Over the past 20 years, the rightwing megaphone has grown far more sophisticated. Savage Nation (1994), Fox News (1996), InfoWars (1999) and Breitbart (2005) – which was started by Drudge’s first assistant, Andrew Breitbart – have all matured in line with the Drudge Report (1995). But instead of threatening his supremacy, they have provided political ballast to his idiosyncrasies.

Drudge is “the wellspring for the conservative media ecosystem”, wrote the Republican strategist Rick Wilson in the Daily Beast.

The threat to the Drudge Report has come, paradoxically, not so much from rightwing competitors but from the very source of his own success – individualised news born of the internet. When he sent out his first newsletter via email to friends, he issued a genuinely personal take on current affairs, an independent act of defiance that appealed to his libertarian values.

That act has spawned countless imitators, but instead of being truly individualised, they are corralled through the modern monoliths Facebook and Twitter. The development has left Drudge baffled and bemused, judging from recent remarks of this increasingly reclusive man.

In October 2015, Drudge, who now rarely allows himself to be seen or heard in public and who did not respond to a Guardian request for interview, turned up unexpectedly in the Austin, Texas studios of Alex Jones’s InfoWars. He remained unseen and behind camera, but did speak passionately for several minutes.

“Twenty years. I’ve had a hell of a run,” Drudge said to Jones from the shadows, clearly feeling nostalgic. Then he got down to business.

“I don’t do the socials,” he said with a telling linguistic awkwardness. “I’m not on Facebook. I’ve got the Twitter thing, but even that’s disgusting.”

The shift has been stealthy but seismic. The Drudge Report’s legendary ability to dictate the news cycle has been stolen by Twitter, where editors – instead of having to rely on Drudge’s judgment – can exercise their own. “You used to see something go up on Drudge and hear it on cable news an hour later – now it’s all moved over to the Twittersphere,” Wilson says.

That trend was temporarily abated during 2016 when the site enjoyed a revival as cheerleader-in-chief for Donald Trump. As Politico put it, Drudge went “all in on Trump”. He reserved his banner headlines for Trump-friendly subjects such as immigration and trade, while running attack stories on contesting Republican candidates such as Ted Cruz. After Trump won his party’s nomination, Drudge provided the same service in the general election, mocking Hillary Clinton as a “brain in a jar” and accusing the rest of the media of covering-up her hypothyroidism.

Much as a Trump victory was palpably desired by Drudge, you have to wonder whether he will come to regret the outcome, in the manner of Frankenstein and his monster.

Dylan Byers, CNN’s senior reporter on media and politics, points out that, by giving Trump a leg-up into the White House, he has helped to create a media phenomenon that is far more powerful than any Drudge Report. “For 20 years, Drudge set the gold standard for gossip, sensationalism and trolling, making him one of the most influential figures in political media,” Byers says. “But Trump is sui generis. He is his own media outlet. He does his own trolling and creates his own sensationalism. The controversies Trump creates with one tweet make Drudge’s entire homepage feel uninspired.”

Uninspired. That’s a word seldom attached to Matt Drudge. But nothing is safe in the Trump era, it seems. Not even the wellspring of conservative media.

After Trump won his party’s nomination, Drudge provided the same service in the general election, mocking Hillary Clinton as a “brain in a jar” and accusing the rest of the media of covering-up her hypothyroidism.

Much as a Trump victory was palpably desired by Drudge, you have to wonder whether he will come to regret the outcome, in the manner of Frankenstein and his monster.

Dylan Byers, CNN’s senior reporter on media and politics, points out that, by giving Trump a leg-up into the White House, he has helped to create a media phenomenon that is far more powerful than any Drudge Report. “For 20 years, Drudge set the gold standard for gossip, sensationalism and trolling, making him one of the most influential figures in political media,” Byers says. “But Trump is sui generis. He is his own media outlet. He does his own trolling and creates his own sensationalism. The controversies Trump creates with one tweet make Drudge’s entire homepage feel uninspired.”

Uninspired. That’s a word seldom attached to Matt Drudge. But nothing is safe in the Trump era, it seems. Not even the wellspring of conservative media.

81cfig,4,2018-03-02,How the Drudge Report ushered in the age of Trump - by Ed Pilkington (The Guardian) 24 Jan 2018,FinnagainsAwake,altnewz,https://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/81cfig/how_the_drudge_report_ushered_in_the_age_of_trump/,"At precisely 9.32pm and two seconds by his Californian clock, Matt Drudge hit the send button on his home computer and changed the world. It was Saturday 17 January 1998, beyond midnight in Washington where President Clinton had no idea what was about to hit him.

“NEWSWEEK KILLS STORY ON WHITE HOUSE INTERN; BLOCKBUSTER REPORT: 23-YEAR OLD, FORMER WHITE HOUSE INTERN, SEX RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT”

The headline was posted in such small print that, were it not for the capital letters, a reader might have mistaken it for a dispatch on corn prices rather than an avalanche that would propel Bill Clinton all the way to impeachment. But then, Drudge never has run with the typographical crowd.

Two hours later, he followed up with a longer post in which he elaborated that Newsweek had spiked a story from its then investigative reporter Michael Isikoff. Had it been published, Drudge said, the story would have revealed that a young, still anonymous female intern had been a “frequent visitor to a small study just off the Oval Office” where she developed a sexual relationship with the president.

The next day the Drudge Report published her name: Monica Lewinsky.

The storm unleashed that Saturday night was all the more potent for coming from a single individual operating out of a one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood where he lived with a cat named Cat, three TVs, three computers, a satellite dish and a police scanner. Not long before, he had been selling T-shirts in a gift shop at CBS Studios.

Twenty years later, we can now see that Drudge, 51, sparked a revolution – a double one at that. Politically, his Lewinsky scoops heralded a new kind of American conservatism that was devil-may-care, iconoclastic, hyper-aggressive and populist. If that sounds familiar, given the fireworks bursting daily out of today’s White House, then that is no coincidence.

“Looking back, he was the beginning of a cultural revolution which we are still in the midst of right now,” says David Horowitz, a conservative writer who helped to bail out Drudge shortly before the Lewinsky affair broke. At the time Drudge was fighting a $30m lawsuit against the Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal, whom he had falsely accused of abusing his wife – one of the earliest examples in the internet age of rightwing fake news.

The second revolution Drudge sparked was within the media. By exposing not just the president’s tryst with an intern, but the decision by Newsweek to hold off on the story, he planted a bomb under both the presidency and the mainstream media. “Matt Drudge broke the fraternity of the guardians of the culture,” Horowitz says.

The “fraternity” was aghast at Drudge’s rise. CBS’s Face the Nation refused to sully itself by having Drudge on air. When NBC did extend an invitation, Carl Bernstein, of Watergate fame, scoffed: “The notion of a cyber gossip sitting on Meet the Press would have been unthinkable!” Drudge lapped up the opprobrium, trolling his critics with the comment: “I’m not a journalist, I’m a kangaroo.” Sign up to the Media Briefing: news for the news-makers Read more

Despite the brickbats, Drudge rapidly attracted a large readership with his gregarious mix of aggregated Beltway and Hollywood gossip, news stories drawn from outlets spanning the political range, and headlines that were clickbait before the term had been coined. “There’s a new sex droid in town”, was one of his recent headlines.

Where readers flocked, news editors followed with tails between legs. A skim of the Drudge headlines became an essential start to any TV, press or radio editors’ day, helping to define what was shaping up to be the 24-hour news cycle. And with no legacy overheads and a lean staff, Drudge was soon raking in the money, the proceeds of which he enjoys today in his 10-acre property outside Miami where he moved in the wake of the Lewinsky furore.

While the readership has always leaned heavily male and conservative, his devoted fans include unexpected figures, such as feminist intellectual Camille Paglia. She was one of the first established voices to break ranks and endorse the site at a time when it was still being almost universally derided.

“I saw in Matt Drudge the triumph of the populist tabloids,” says Paglia. “It’s amazing how no one, in all these decades, has been able to imitate, displace, or supplant Drudge – because he is a true American original.”

Paglia is right: it is amazing that the Drudge Report continues to enjoy the influence it does. The point-size of its banner headline has crept up a bit, but otherwise the layout of the site is virtually unchanged from the original design, as though it were stuck in time.

According to analytics company comScore, the Drudge Report had 2.5 million unique visitors in November. That reach is amplified when you consider the strong engagement of readers who tend to return frequently, producing a total 292m page views that month.

While the Drudge Report is a rightwing site true to the libertarian, small government, anti-abortion, climate change-denying world view of its creator, its impact is felt much more widely. When the Guardian – not a natural Drudge ally – broke the story of Steve Bannon’s incendiary remarks in Michael Wolff’s new book Fire and Fury this month, fully a quarter of the vast traffic it generated came through Drudge.

Over the past 20 years, the rightwing megaphone has grown far more sophisticated. Savage Nation (1994), Fox News (1996), InfoWars (1999) and Breitbart (2005) – which was started by Drudge’s first assistant, Andrew Breitbart – have all matured in line with the Drudge Report (1995). But instead of threatening his supremacy, they have provided political ballast to his idiosyncrasies.

Drudge is “the wellspring for the conservative media ecosystem”, wrote the Republican strategist Rick Wilson in the Daily Beast.

The threat to the Drudge Report has come, paradoxically, not so much from rightwing competitors but from the very source of his own success – individualised news born of the internet. When he sent out his first newsletter via email to friends, he issued a genuinely personal take on current affairs, an independent act of defiance that appealed to his libertarian values.

That act has spawned countless imitators, but instead of being truly individualised, they are corralled through the modern monoliths Facebook and Twitter. The development has left Drudge baffled and bemused, judging from recent remarks of this increasingly reclusive man.

In October 2015, Drudge, who now rarely allows himself to be seen or heard in public and who did not respond to a Guardian request for interview, turned up unexpectedly in the Austin, Texas studios of Alex Jones’s InfoWars. He remained unseen and behind camera, but did speak passionately for several minutes.

“Twenty years. I’ve had a hell of a run,” Drudge said to Jones from the shadows, clearly feeling nostalgic. Then he got down to business.

“I don’t do the socials,” he said with a telling linguistic awkwardness. “I’m not on Facebook. I’ve got the Twitter thing, but even that’s disgusting.”

The shift has been stealthy but seismic. The Drudge Report’s legendary ability to dictate the news cycle has been stolen by Twitter, where editors – instead of having to rely on Drudge’s judgment – can exercise their own. “You used to see something go up on Drudge and hear it on cable news an hour later – now it’s all moved over to the Twittersphere,” Wilson says.

That trend was temporarily abated during 2016 when the site enjoyed a revival as cheerleader-in-chief for Donald Trump. As Politico put it, Drudge went “all in on Trump”. He reserved his banner headlines for Trump-friendly subjects such as immigration and trade, while running attack stories on contesting Republican candidates such as Ted Cruz. After Trump won his party’s nomination, Drudge provided the same service in the general election, mocking Hillary Clinton as a “brain in a jar” and accusing the rest of the media of covering-up her hypothyroidism.

Much as a Trump victory was palpably desired by Drudge, you have to wonder whether he will come to regret the outcome, in the manner of Frankenstein and his monster.

Dylan Byers, CNN’s senior reporter on media and politics, points out that, by giving Trump a leg-up into the White House, he has helped to create a media phenomenon that is far more powerful than any Drudge Report. “For 20 years, Drudge set the gold standard for gossip, sensationalism and trolling, making him one of the most influential figures in political media,” Byers says. “But Trump is sui generis.

81cg6w,3,2018-03-02,My [21 F] boyfriend [25 M] of a year wants to be famous and that's why he wont get a job. :/,saksaktut,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/81cg6w/my_21_f_boyfriend_25_m_of_a_year_wants_to_be/,"I diagnosed my bf with Putting-All-Eggs-in-One-Basket Syndrome. I coined the term myself, patent pending. I believe that if the Cash Me Osside girl can get famous for being.. the was she is, the days of ""talent=fame"" have passed. I also believe that fame is unlikely for most talented people. For every person that is discovered, there are thousands more who used the same strategy and got nowhere.

He's a great singer, he's great at mastering/mixing tracks, and overall very talented. I believe so, at least. Talent doesn't mean fame, but it does open doors to other opportunities. There was an AV job open for college grads to be trained while working for this small company in a hipster area downtown. It took me a week to get him to apply. He was afraid it would mean he was giving up.

Some context: BF moved out for the first time right before we met (with help from his parents for the better half of the year). During that time, he did Uber and finished about 5(ish) songs. I told him that the music industry has a ladder, like any other career, and that he should work on gaining experience for future employers. I told him that gaining experience and having a backup plan would be smarter than Ubering, smoking weed, playing fifa, staying up until 8am and sleeping until late afternoon, while making music for about 10-15 hrs a week. This was wrong, so he continued making his songs with this justification(from texts):

Context: I showed him an artist that I liked and he made comments about how he was more talented, and how he was the one that deserved to be famous. I confronted him hours later over text and this was his response.

""What you're saying is that I should not project my insecurities onto someone else's success. You're right. Logically, you shouldn't. Morally, you shouldn't. However, music is competitive. Super competitive. Cut throat, actually. Anyone will step on everyone to get to the top. Everyone is jealous of each other and everyone has a reason they think they are better. I like to think I'm not like that...but the truth is ive never really been recognized for my voice. Never been validated, never been told I'm good by anyone but friends and family...I'm the only one who has confidence in me. I'm the only one who defends my talent. So sometimes, when another artist receives praise in front of me, it gets to me. Because I know I could do what they're doing. I know that could just as easily be me if I played my cards right. I've come so close many times to getting that break; big or small. But I never seem to get that break in the end. So you start fishing for answers and reasons. ""Oh, he's just good looking and his voice is ok"" applied to most of the vine singers that blew up; most of them floating on a cloud of teenage fans. And when vine disappeared, a lot of them turned out to be bad in a studio or just plain disappeared (like shilo). But someone like me, who just switched social media accounts, lost all my followers even though I kept my promise of losing all he weight; just because I was ugly, fat and apparently ""didn't deserve to sing on vine"". That's a direct quote from a former follower. ""

Fame is a symbol for this Aha! moment he wants to throw at his family and childhood bullies. Now that he's Somebody he's worth something. That sort of thing.His old therapist said that he has trouble making small goals and mainly focuses on the big idea. I 100% believe that if he were famous tomorrow with adoring fans, he'd be back to feeling sad and hopeless about life with time. I have my own theories about this but if someone else could just unpack this for me that would help^

Fast forward to now. His lease ended and he moved back home so he could easily recover from surgery(skin removal after gastric sleeve). He's not ubering because his car is now too old and he just got let go from a flimsy, but promising, internship. For about 6 months I've been emphasizing the fact that there is enough time in the week to have a full-time, or even part-time, job while still following dreams. He's really upset now because his only real chance at breaking into the business was this internship and he was just let go. I feel bad for hoping that he learns some sort of lesson from this and just does music in his free time. Getting a more realistic job in music or AV doesn't mean giving up. How can I convince him of this?

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: BF wants to be a famous pop singer or producer and he can work at that while still working. "
81cr7u,3,2018-03-02,Is this crazy? (Expensive vs Cheap short lease),rohrohroh,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/81cr7u/is_this_crazy_expensive_vs_cheap_short_lease/,"Hello,

I am a slightly older 25 year old student reaching the final year of school and from the Philadelphia area. I have been fortunate enough to get an exciting co-op job during my school co-op period. However I need to relocate to the suburbs for it as the commute would be about 3 hours every day which is too much for me.

I've done extensive searching for apartments the last few days and visited a couple today. It was very difficult to find a good amount of apartments willing to do a 6 month lease on such short notice since I have to move in a month. Many of them placed a markup due to the short leasing period.

I was disappointed to see that the options were limited and the prices were exorbitant - for reference the average apartment price  was around 1300-1400 WITHOUT any utilities included. Many of these apartments were quite frankly over priced. Not to mention that this past year I've lived in a 2br 1b with a roommate at $625 and some utilities included. Granted, this was an absolute steal even for my area but still the price jump was quite the shock.

After visiting the apartments, my family and I (my mother graciously helped me out by bringing down my car and driving me around. I will be using the car for my commute.) decided that only 2 of the many options looked like viable options. The dilemma is that they are wildly different.

Option 1:

- Cheapest price you can find in the area at $875 + $55 water/heat/gas. Electric/Internet on my own.  +$300 flat miscellaneous fees during application. Small but livable studio.

- No amenities.

- Somewhat ghetto area. Somewhat run down and does not pretend it's anything more than a budget option. The manager seemed aloof and he was the only one in a small dusty office. 

- VERY mixed and limited amount of reviews. Some are positive saying it was an ok budget option while a good amount gave concerning reviews about how the area partnered with city to place, in their words, 'behaviorally challenged peoples' in these apartments. Stories included schizophrenic outbreaks with stabbings, FBI crackdowns on illegal immigrants, ratchet parties thrown in the middle of the night, etc.

So all in all, this option has potential to be a really solid budget option if I don't meet anyone crazy and nothing bad goes down. On the other hand, if things get bad it seems like it'd be awful with no one to really help.


Option 2:

- One of the more expensive options at $1525 + $40 water/heat/gas +$25 parking. Electric/Internet on my own. Flat $250 fee for amenities. Studio is breath taking and looks like a smaller version of those flats you see in movies.

- Insanely luxurious. Has way more amenities than I'd ever use including theater, bar, swimming pool, hot tub/sauna, actual gym, study rooms, daily continental breakfast, etc. The only ones I would probably use extensively are the tub/sauna, breakfast, and the gym.

- Super secure, safe, and professional staff. I knew from my first interaction that these guys took service seriously. This was also the only place that didn't seem to get offended when I tried to negotiate and I got to haggle their 6 month lease mark-up down from $250 to $100. So about $900 overall cheaper than they advertised after 6 months.

- Excellent reviews and has a good amount of them. It's only been around for 3 years but has about ~100 reviews aggregated from different sites and I rarely see anything under 4 stars. No real stand out complaints besides the usual complaint about price.

- Not the biggest deal but the location is conveniently located next to nice grocery stores, a target, and some food joints. Would make it easy for me to grab anything I need.

Overall the best value imo in terms of dollar to quality of life. Given that the average run of the mill apartment I saw was only about $100 -$150 cheaper, it is crazy how $100 a month can convert an average studio into essentially a hotel room.

EDIT: Also want to include that I may or may not have to lease a car since my parents said they might need my car. They did offer to pay for this but since I'm old enough I don't want to burden them with any more costs. I'm thankful enough that they paid for my tuition and housing until 23.


As you can see, the choice is really difficult for me because one is significantly cheaper while the other is very high quality and fairly priced relative to the area. I was leaning towards the more expensive option, especially given the concerns of the first location (my parents really do not want me to go there but it's ultimately my choice) but I can't easily ignore the price difference.

As for my financial status and means, while I am not too concerned about my current and future finances, I would like to make the best life choices, one aspect which includes the financial aspect.

I'll be making $28 per hour as a co-op (intern) and working full time. It's about ~$4500 per month pre-tax. I have left over money from my last job and about $4000 in the bank. I do not have to worry about any other payments at the moment besides normal cost of living and rent. I will be graduating with a little under $20,000 in loans, and will not have to worry about supporting my parents (in the near future at least) and I am single with no kids. I have a strong credit score that wavers between 750-780 and spend very little money on myself. I (hopefully) should be able to secure a decent, stable job outside of college in a strong major (computer science). So essentially the rent for the expensive place is really high compared to my salary, but my impression is that I could take the small 'hit' for 6 months.
I totally could be wrong though.

Do you guys have any thoughts, opinions, advice?


As for why no roommate, I've had a lot of experience living with roommates the past 10 years or so (this includes boarding school in high school, extra years at college, etc.) and I've only had decent roommate experiences with either close friends or people other friends recommended to me. All other roommates found randomly were either bad to downright dangerous. Given that I only accepted the job this past week and have to move within a month, I don't think I will be able to find an adequate roommate for only 6 months in a suburb. I also don't want to deal with anything troublesome during my last year of college as the stress from rooming situations really brought me down my 2nd and part of 3rd year.

Thanks again if you made it through all this and I appreciate any help!"
81dk9i,3,2018-03-02,"Boyfriend's ASMR obsession making me feel unsettled, should I get over it?",khaleesibimbo,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/81dk9i/boyfriends_asmr_obsession_making_me_feel/,"I'm not sure where to start. I've been dating my current boyfriend (off and on) since the start of my transition nearly 3 years ago. I'm pretty much the first and only person he has been in a relationship with/slept with and vice versa. Just to quickly recap, our relationship came about as we were initially acquaintances through being in the same class prior to me transitioning. He had a big crush on another cis female classmate which seemed like a big deal but she friend zoned him to put it lightly and always disregarded his efforts to get close to her intimately. She would date other guys and never gave him a chance as I guess nerdier guys aren't her thing? She did hang out with him though and considered him a close friend (this being over the course of about a year). Soon after I came out, he was always extremely supportive and we started to become closer since we had the same internship site and eventually we decided to date (it was only us 2 from that class assigned to this internship). Looking back, I sometimes under the circumstances we came together, feel like his rebound? Like I was what he needed to move on from his obsession with his crush? Just a tid bit. 


But anyways, I don't always feel like we have always had the healthiest relationship in the past, for reasons I won't delve into entirely, but one thing lately that has really bothered me is him getting into ASMR videos. I don't experience ASMR so it's kind of hard for me to understand it and I understand per how most people explain, it doesn't have to be, nor it is it usually something considered sexual. I just get pretty uncomfortable seeing how the video's that I notice he will watch have a few common denominators (always young attractive cis females whispering). I am not proud to say that I have looked at his video history before but I do have some degree of trust issues. This is one of the video's I've observed he has watched for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3NODHFEVc - It makes me also experience some dysphoria to some degree and kinda like this is some kind of escapism for him with me being a transwoman and not a cis female. Often time, I will wake up to discover him with his back turned, sleeping with headphones in as a video of soft whispering women trying to trigger ASMR plays.. as I just lay there and feel alone (actually just happened which is why I'm up writing this post, I can't get back to sleep thinking about it). It brings out the worst insecurities as I compare myself to these women he'll watch. I don't look like them and I'm not at the point in my transition where I am able to replicate the kind of vocalization they use. 

I've discussed it with him in the past and sort of asked him indirectly why he seems to only prefer the soft female whispering side of ASMR if it's nothing sexual and/or something he's not getting out of being with me but he kind of evaded the question and indicated it's nothing sexual for him and that I was being irrational and unreasonable. Maybe he doesn't get triggers from unintentional ASMR? I'm not sure, I didn't press the issue just to avoid arguing as this was a rough time in our relationship. I'm not sure if I can bare the embarrassment of bringing this up to him again although it might help me to get a better understanding of him. It also doesn't help that around a year ago I discovered he was attempting to find someone to 'exchange virginity' with -*cough r/VirginityExchange*-. Needless to say I did not react well at all to this and felt extremely betrayed. It hurt that he had not considered sex with me a loss of his virginity simply because it wasn't vaginal intercourse. Since having been put through that situation, I haven't asked if he views on it have changed but I feel like it would be a pointless question. Even if he still desired hetero normative sex, I don't expect a candid answer. I broke up with him and eventually accepted him back. I don't think I ever fully regained trust after that situation and the whole ASMR things makes it hard for me to move on with my level of insecurity. 

I don't know if it's right for me to get upset with things that have happened in the past and the fact that ASMR seems to be his new obsession. I mean we ARE both young and have never dated other people or experienced much that life has to offer... but I DO find myself getting upset for some reason which sucks because I love him VERY much . Thinking maybe I need to discard the relationship at this point and we should be friends only :( any thoughts? sorry for the string of text."

I've practically recovered from an eating disorder after being in the hospital for 6 weeks for it. I don't remember the last time I've had binges other than 'almost' ones just a few weeks ago.

As of recently I managed to get my eating back on track primarily by eating at consistent times of the day and being busier and wow... Never would I ever have thought that I'd turn down fast food or not eat a bunch of sugar. It's only been about 20 days and I already have a difference. Less sugar cravings, etc 

I found what really helped, and I've had hflc people try to argue, is reducing my carbs. Not necessarily full blown keto but it worked. Although I didn't focus on that first, I just focused on healthier alternatives and then when I had more control, I stopped eating them as much. But that wasn't so much for weight loss though, it was because almost every time I ate something with a moderate amount of carbs, even complex carbs like people would try to accuse me of not eating, I'd practically fall asleep. I'd get so tired so easily and it is something I couldn't afford being at my new internship, waking up to leave the house at 6am. Absolutely no carbs at breakfast at LEAST, is a must.

(Not saying it's the same for everyone but I'm just explaining that I believe everyone reacts differently to foods)

And I never thought I'd say this because I never believed it... But it does get easier. It really does. And I'm actually losing my weight I gained. I can fit my favourite shorts again and honestly it almost makes me cry out of joy.

I don't know, I just wanted to tell someone. I feel a lot better recently despite other areas of mental health declining. But I'm managing to eat better and eat enough without resorting to food and weight as a coping mechanism. I never thought I'd reach this point.

Keep on trucking everyone. You got this."

81emvv,1,2018-03-02,I [22/F] need advice on how to break-up with my [22/M] boyfriend of 1 year.,rose-colored-girl,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/81emvv/i_22f_need_advice_on_how_to_breakup_with_my_22m/,"(Posting on a throwaway account because my BF is on Reddit and he knows my username to my main account.)

So, as the title goes, I need advice. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year. It's been a very rough year, but we've made it. We've always been big fighters; he and I both deal with insecurities (that I've accumulated because of him, honestly), we both have our tempers, and sometimes it gets the best of us. But lately, our relationship has gotten to a point where I don't know if I can put up with him anymore. And this all started on Valentine's Day. 

So for Valentine's Day, he got me a gift. And I really did love it, but I think the way I expressed my feelings toward it made him think that I didn't like it. Well, he got upset, and he didn't really say anything to me about it, but we were driving home and I could see that he was crying, but I didn't want to make matters worse, so I stayed quiet. The guilt of this has been eating me alive, and last night at dinner, I broke down crying in front of my mom over this (and all the other stress that I've been under). I really wanted to talk to my boyfriend about all of this, and try to tell him that what's been bothering me the last couple of days has been this situation with the gift, but that leads me into the the actual problem of our relationship: I can't talk to him about how I'm feeling. 

Whenever I've brought concerns up to him, or just try to talk to him about the things that are bothering me about our relationship, he becomes very defensive. He's the type of person who jumps to conclusions without hearing the full story (which is one of my biggest pet peeves). It usually always ends up with me getting emotionally wound up because I'm just trying to talk and he just keeps feeling like I'm attacking him. This is why I'm asking for advice on how to end the relationship all together. 

I don't think this is something people can change about themselves. I mean, I've been putting up with it for over a year now and every time we fight, I get these promises of how things will be different, and they never are. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and these situations don't help me at all. I'm currently going through a slew of other issues in my personal life, and my own partner doesn't even help me, it just feels like he hinders me. 

We're both going on separate trips today (we have the same spring break, which is this coming week). I'll be on a cruise and he'll be on a 2 week internship. I think the time apart is going to be really healthy for us (especially for me), because it'll give me the chance to clear my head and have time to myself, but I think I've made up my mind on wanting to end things when we get back. The question is just how. With the way that he acts, I don't want this to turn into a shit show (which I already know it's going to), so any and all advice is welcomed and (highly) appreciated. 

I apologize for the long post, reddit. I just needed to get this off my chest and I don't have people I can talk to about this stuff, so typing this out is letting me air it out into the open and take some weight off of myself. I hope I haven't rambled off too much. 


TLDR; I've been having issues with my boyfriend of one year, and our relationship is just too toxic to put up with anymore. I need advice on how to end things once and for all.

BACKGROUND: 

&amp;nbsp;

I graduated this past May 2017 with a B.S in Chemical Engineering with a 2.99 GPA. I did not get the opportunity to do an internship. It was a struggle to apply for a process engineer position without having any experience in the industry. In addition, the low GPA did not help much either. A fellow redditer suggested based on his experience to work start working as a Lab Technician, as he started off as a lab technician, since it was better than working at Target and not really gaining any valuable experience. As a result, I started applying to every Lab Technician positions in my area. I did not have a specific company in mind, I was going to work for whatever company that offered me a Lab Technician position. Eventually, later that year, in December I was given the job opportunity to work as a Quality Assurance Lab Technician at an ExxonMobil Plant here. I have been working here since. As much as I like the company and the job, I want to grow and move up. My other coworkers here aren't chemical engineers, they are chemists, have been working here for past several years. I don't want to be stagnant in a Lab Technician position and want to be a  process engineer or a position that allows me to designing plant jobs. I truly value the experience that I am gaining here as well as the wonderful people I am working with.

&amp;nbsp;

**LINK :Lab Technician Job Section Information I Want to Add: https://snag.gy/m6tIau.jpg**

That is the resume I used to apply for my lab technician job, so it is out of date. The main issue is space, I don't have enough space to add my current lab technician position information on my resume. I feel like I need to remove something to make space. What suggestion do you guys have on what I should remove? I was thinking of removing my university research section, as well as my past summer jobs (Target, US Bank)? I am not sure if I need to cut down some of the other information as well. I would really appreciate your help if you guys could help me restructure or rephrase my resume. I have posted a link to my resume as well as the information I want to add to my resume. If there are better ways to rephrase the lab technician section information that I posted please let me know and write down how you would phrase or write it.  I also don't know which points are the most important or significant to include from the lab technician job section information, so I included all, so you guys can help me pin point which points are a must and which ones aren't important.

81fjz1,29,2018-03-02,I [23/F] am involved in an affair with a married man [63/M] for more than 4 years,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/81fjz1/i_23f_am_involved_in_an_affair_with_a_married_man/,"I have no excuse. 

The affair started when I was 18. I needed money for college. I was looking for ways how to quickly earn some and in my search, I discovered craigslist. He posted an ad there looking for someone willing to exchange sexual favors for financial assistance. He said he was a businessman travelling most of the time and he wanted a “companion”. He said he preferred a virgin. I responded, thinking if I had to give up my virginity, at least do it for cash and continue my studies. It’s a disguting thought. 

When we met, I really didn’t care that he was old enough to be my father, and neither did he. He told me his wife knew and permitted him to have a sexual partner because his wife was not interested in sex anymore (something about it being painful after reaching menopause stage). He said he’ll pay for my school fees and will give me monthly allowance so long as I didn’t fail school. I agreed. 

After a month, he said he loved me. He loved it that I didn’t drink or party or involved with other men my age. He loved it that I was “loyal” to him. At that time, I just brushed it aside. I only wanted his money. I was in my 3rd year, just 2 more years until I get my degree. I thought that I only needed to stay for a couple of months, save the monthly allowance he gives, then I’ll be set for the next 2 school years. 

But then he started bringing me food. He drove me to school. He asked how I am. He gave me more time and attention beyond the weekly rendezvous in random motels. And before I knew it, I was saying I love you too. We called each other “love”. 

At the early part of the affair, he said he’ll leave his family after I graduated and tookthe licensure board exam. We’ll have kids. He’ll live with us. He said I was his and his alone. I believed him. I started longing for that graduation to be with him permanently. No more occasional out of town trips or drives to nearby motels. He’ll come home to me. 

Then we had a fight and he called me and what we have “temporary”. He said he could not and would not leave his wife. He said if I couldn’t accept that, then we should end it there because “it was okay for him to lose me”. It felt like my world collapsed. 

I should have left. I was stupid and selfish for believing that he’ll choose me. I was too greedy. I wanted to hear beautiful promises and also wanted them to be fulfilled. I forgot thag I wasjust a lowly mistress who doesn’t deserve anything. I was so fooled and thought that I was promoted to the place of his wife. 

But instead of leaving, I made an excuse to stay. I said I had to make a pragmatic choice. I have to stay, at least until I graduated college. I said to myself that I had to prevent feelings from getting involved. What we had is a transaction - I give him sex for school fees. I was his private prostitute. I stopped calling him “love”. I stopped returning the “I love you’s”. I met him to have sex, not to spend intimate times with him. 

He felt the shift. I was cold and aloof. I let him use my body but I had taken my heart back. And it seemed like he didn’t like it. He wanted my body and my love. He wooed me. He started to do things again that made me think that maybe he did love me. He wanted to sweep me off of my feet again. He cooked for me when I was sick. He celebrated my birthday. He’ll pick me up even though it’s raining and traffic is bad. He drove to my internship everyday to bring me lunch despite the 2hr distance he had to travel. 

He said he can’t lose me. He love me so much he does not want to lose me. He said he was sorry. He said he missed me. He said he missed us.  

I was stupid and naive and selfish. The semester before my graduation, we were back again to how we were before. And next thing I knew, I’ve been involved with him for 4 years, almost turning 5 this December. I love him more than ever before. I’m already in too deep. I drowned myself in my own selfishness and insecurity. 

I’m in law school right now because of his urging. He said I’ll be a good CPA-lawyer. I’m struggling. I don’t  want to become a lawyer. But I wanted to have an excuse to be with him. Now I’m in my second semester of first year. 

Law school is hard. It’s a painful experience. It took me this long to question what I really wanted to do with my life. Even though he gives me time and attention, I’m still a “temporary” thing to him. I suddenly realized I’m wasting time. It’s been 2 years since I graduated college and yet I have no work experience while my batchmates already have flourishing careers. I’m stuck in law school trying to be a lawyer I do not want to be. All because I wanted to stretch my time with him. I’m at loss. I know that if I end it now, he’ll move on despite his hundreds of love confession to me. Maybe he’ll find another girl to satisfy his libido. But where would I be then. Just thinking of leaving him breaks my heart. I love him. I don’t care about his money. I want to be with him. I know it’s all my fault. I was greedy and I deserve the pain. But I’m afraid of living life without him, no matter how little the fragments of his time he spends with me. I know I have to end it but how can I survive? 

TL:DR I’ve been involved in an affair for more than 4 years and I need to get out."

##Local election news (Vote March 13)

**[Riviera election could tip balance of power](http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/with-mounting-turmoil-riviera-beach-stability-hangs-the-balance/2OypEoNwkkgt2NI2wWfIdI/)**

Three Riviera Beach city councilors voted in September to fire a popular city manager who was investigating one of them for misspending taxpayer money. On March 13, two of the city's top politicians will be up for reelection: **Dawn Pardo** and **KaShamba Miller-Anderson**. Pardo voted to fire City Manager Johnathan Evans, while Miller-Anderson opposed it. Pardo faces a challenge from **Julia Botel**, a former deputy school superintendent from Pennsylvania. Miller-Anderson's opponent is **Keith Golden**, who sits on local firefighter boards. All registered voters in Riviera Beach can cast ballots in both races.

* **Botel** decided to run after Riviera's top politicians fired Evans, who was trying to cut wasteful spending. Botel wants to hire a city manager without lowering its standards, as councilors recently tried to do. Botel wants to hire a buildings department boss who has passed the licensing test, noting the city has yet to hire one. She wants to cut the red tape and bureaucratic roadblocks that stand in the way of businesses seeking construction permits, but did not name specifics. Botel criticized the council for micromanaging and abusing taxpayer-funded [credit cards](http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/special-report-riviera-leaders-big-credit-cards-cars-hotels/3M5xs3cZj93DTcQfmGnfgI/).
* **Pardo** defended her vote to fire Evans, but refused to state her reasoning until months after the September vote. Evans wanted to propose ""unfair"" taxes and hire 24 workers which the city might not be able to afford, Pardo claimed. She has been accused of being mad at Evans for preventing her from spending taxpayer money on landscaping on private property.
* **Golden** agrees with his opponent, Miller-Anderson, that firing Evans was wrong and un-transparent. He says he wants to get the city's marina redevelopment get back on track. He supports replacing old street lights, roads, sidewalks, landscaping, and sewer and water pipes while lowering the property tax rate. Golden did not elaborate on how he would find money for those programs while lowering taxes. He would donate the $12,000 that councilors get with their salary to local charities, he said.
* **Miller-Anderson** was one of the city's two top politicians to vote against firing Evans. The other was Mayor Thomas Masters. Evans ran the city bureaucracy appropriately, responsibly, and transparently, Miller-Anderson said. She is the only councilor who voted against the $12,000 taxpayer-funded [stipend](http://www.wpbf.com/article/riviera-beach-council-members-rake-in-over-122-000-in-pay-benefits/1327137). She would also consider giving up other tax-funded benefits that only Riviera politicians enjoy, like having a legislative aide, she said. Miller-Anderson wants to build up the Broadway corridor, marina and Port District to help bring in more taxes for the city, but did not give details.

So for my summer internship, I want to learn C# for web development. I've done some research and I understand that I also have to learn the ASP.NET framework.

What I'm wondering is what tools are the best to do code in it. My main development machine is a Macbook, but I also have a Windows 10 desktop. So I guess that my options are:

* VS, VS Code or Rider on my Macbook;
*VS on my desktop.

Which one should I learn C# for web development on? Ideally, I would like to stay on my Macbook if possible for this, but if it's better to go on my Desktop I would do.

Thanks a lot!"

-	I’d like to share what anime is really meaning for me so It’s unavoidable to write down my story without looking back on my life. I’ll try to keep these parts as short as possible and focus on the anime which changed me.
 
-	I’d be really happy to hear what anime means for you as well. How it changed your view on the world or made you better or worse. Everything is fine, if a show made an impact on you somehow I’d be happy to read it.

-	English is not my native language, but hopefully you’ll understand everything by the end.

-	This is a long post with no TLDR, every part is important in order to express my feelings.

-	There are spoilers within, but I tried to use as few as possible.

-	I decided to write down my journey in five parts, rather then one massive text. Hopefully it will be more readable this way and won’t be as overwhelming.


Without further ado let’s start where it all began!

**Part I**

When I was a kid there was a cute girl living in the same street as me. As the time passed by we became inseparable, and she became the best childhood friend I could ever wish for. If my life was based on any mainstream anime story you know she wouldn’t win in the end. But this wasn’t the case here. 
Back in 2010 we started dating, and the happiest years of my life began. After 3 wonderful years together things started to go south. We went to the same university, where she quickly became an exceptional student, working hard and learning as much as she could. I was proud of her, and adored everything she did, but after a while I felt something was not right. I wasn’t improving myself (in the first semester I almost dropped out) and I was nowhere near her in terms of studying or working hard. She started to lose interest in me, and I tried everything in order to keep her, but in the end I failed completely. We started to go to different parties with different people, hurt each other a lot, and slowly we became strangers. At this point it was inevitable that we’d part ways. This was the segment in my life where something broke in me. 

I was so sad that I couldn’t even cry anymore, I felt like a lifeless husk. I started drinking and smoking, but deep down I also wanted to become more, so I started studying really hard to improve myself. By the end of the university I’ve been chosen to take part in an intern program, and after I got my degree I’ve already had a job. I worked a lot of overtime during the night and the weekends and because of this my mental and physical health worsened even more. The constant stress took it’s toll on me, along with the drinking and smoking. Things didn’t look good for me.

**Part II**

This was the time where anime came into my life to change me. I don’t remember exactly, but somehow I stumbled upon one of Makoto Shinkai’s gems: 5 Centimeters Per Second. I smoked on the balcony in the evening all alone after work, and I decided that I’ll give it a try. At this point the only anime I saw were some episodes of Naruto with horrible dub on my native language. I could say that I didn’t have any interest in anime, and I didn’t have plans to change this, but life doesn’t work this way.

After the movie I was sitting in my room speechless. The visuals, the story - and especially the ending - hit me hard. [5 Centimeters Per Second – Minor spoilers](/s "" In the second part of the movie where Takaki is smoking in the balcony, working every day and thinking about how everything turned out was especially hard to watch. It was like I didn’t want to realize that I’m in the same state as the main character. "") 

If you thought that my first encounter with anime would made me feel better, you’ve guessed wrong. However it showed me the harsh reality, and in the end this harshness improved me. The only problem was that I still wasn’t able to feel properly. I had to attend funerals, marriages, family reunions where people close to me would cry out of joy or sadness, and among them I was sitting there without any emotion. The only thing I could feel was the disgust in myself that I’m worthless and I’m not able to express myself even though I really wanted it.

I needed something to cheer me up, and one of my friends suggested Himouto! Umaru-chan. Every day after work I’d watch an episode, and I really started to like the silly characters and the lightheartedness of the show. You could ask what idiot watches a masterpiece like 5 Centimeters Per Second and continues with Umaru-chan? For me Umaru was the perfect show after a workday. I didn’t have to think, I just sat down exhausted, smiled at my screen and went to sleep. I think this part of my life made me like slice of life more than any genre. 

**Part III**

After I finished Umaru, I wanted more, and started watching anime on a regular basis. I started with the popular shounen shows, then ultimately ended up watching slice of life and romance shows which most people consider trash. I slowly started to feel better, and I also got better at my work. I began to meet with my old friends more and I decided that I’ll continue improving myself. Around this time I planned to watch Kimi no Nawa. As I’ve wrote above, my previous experience wasn’t too good with Makoto Shinkai and I still wasn’t feeling well deep inside. The slice of life shows were only made me feel better on the surface. Without any expectations I sat down to watch it, and once again I was blown away. 

I realized that I’m crying, and I couldn’t stop. I was both happy and sad, all of the emotions which were building up inside me for the past 3 years were finally broke out. Words can’t describe when you are able to feel again like before. For most people it’s a regular romance film, but for me it made such an impact that I came back to life. All of this happened last summer, and after I calmed down I re-evaluated my life. I had a great summer, things started to get better, the work wasn’t stressing me out, I’ve got my friends backing me. Everything was fine. Then autumn arrived.

**Part IV**

It was october 23rd last year. I was watching Umaru-Chan Season 2 with chips and cola at my side, but for some reason I wasn’t feeling well, my stomach hurt like hell. The next thing I remember is that my friend came for me and we were rushing towards the hospital. At that moment I thought that the past years of self destructive lifestyle finally got me. I was living on trash food, smoked and drank a lot and my body couldn’t take this anymore. I had a surgery because I started to bleed internally, and I got hospitalised for two weeks. It turned out that I have inflammatory bowel disease, and I’m living on meds since then. It sounds awful, but those two weeks were an important lesson for me. After I got out of hospital I stopped smoking and drinking, and I continued to watch Umaru-Chan again, right where I left off. Without any spoilers, there’s a part where Umaru is going out with her friends, and they are joyful that they have each other. This silly slice of life show made me realize how important your friends and family are. All of my friends and family came to visit me every day in the hospital, and I was really happy, that there are people around me. I always felt that I’m alone, and I have to solve all my problems alone. This particular event in my life showed me that I don’t have to be afraid to rely on others. Needless to say by the end of the episode I was in tears.

**Part V**

It’s funny to think about how shows that mean nothing for someone may have such an important meaning for others. When my friends look at my list on MAL they always say that I only watch trash. When this happens I can only smile, because most of them don’t know the real meaning behind these shows for me. Slice of life carried me through the darkest days of my life, and Shinkai’s works made me to face myself and leave behind the misery I was carrying. Since October I’ve completely stopped my destructive lifestyle and I’ve also changed the pace in my work. Also I haven’t had any health issues since last year. I feel lucky that I found out how meaningful anime can be, and how it can impact one’s life. Anime is truly amazing.

81h7cb,1,2018-03-02,Diary entry of an addict,D-Turbo,decaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/81h7cb/diary_entry_of_an_addict/,"Hey everyone,
I´m a 24 year old guy with several addictions. The last two weeks I discovered how much of a curse caffeine is for me. While averaging on 1-1,5 gramm a day I was a physical and psychological wreck. The following diary entry, I just wrote now. It´s personal but I think it gives great insight in an addicted person. English is not my mother tongue and I would be glad for any corrections. I too have a question for you: I gonna write an exam in five days and I just don´t know, if I should go in withdrawal tommorow or try to power through completely sober. What´s your opinion on this? 

Now to the entry:



03-02 – OMG – 7:27 PM
I´m drinking beer right now. This morning and most of the noon I thought deeply about whether I should drink some Mate Tea. There were several ((reasons)) for it. On the one side I still had left 7 dollars worth of the tea. It would have been a waste to not drink it. On the other side I feared deeply to not being able to learn adequate for the university exam in five days. How should I? Being lethargic and drowsy all day…

Now I bought cigarettes for 7 dollar und beer for two und when going in the club tonight, I´m probably spend 20 dollars more. So much to the financial side. On the health side I´m smoking while having bronchitis. Professional I´m gonna have a hangover tomorrow and I´m just gonna be able to learn suboptimal for the exam. If I learn at all. The following days I ever have to painfully quit everything again or to power (smoke/caffeinate myself/drink?) through. 

Why ain´t I able to play the tape through, when I´m in the heat of my cravings? And to anticipate where the road ends? But, I still can´t grasp how a cup of mate tea ends in 30 dollars lost, cigarettes and binge drinking. 

Shit. I´m feeling like shit. 

Yes, working today was fun caffeinated and I had focus, but everything else? I had  a phone call with the boss of a place where I want to do an internship and I was nervous and my speech was herky-jerky like hell. After some more cups of mate tea I had trouble to proofread my application or to keep focus while concentrating. I was wired and nervous. 

While buying cigarettes in the supermarket a woman looked at me and I was so self-conscious that I couldn´t reciprocate her glance. Not even a minimal comparison to the grounded and calm confidence I felt the last days around other people. This morning, pre caffeine, I had a phone call with a friend of me and I was empathetic, eloquent and calm. Then a friend of me gave me a visit, normally a calm guy. But today his eyes were wide open, his speech was without any real structure and too fast. Is this me, when I´m caffeinated?

Right now, I don´t even wanna go to the club any more. I´m gonna be shy, angsty and self-conscious. Inhibited in the conversations. Yes, even drunk.

Wow, were the 6 dollars of mate tea worth it? Perhaps I´m gonna be even sicker tomorrow and additionally hangover. Perhaps I´m gonna fail the exam (it´s my last chance to pass it). Great.

Wow fuck, I was just going in the courtyard of my tenement and I saw my neighbors and I was so akward! While returning to my room the neighbors door was still open and I had the feeling they watched me behind my back. Great.

I take caffeine and becoming so wired, I absolutely want a cigarette. I smoke a cigarette and want immediately more. But now I´m already a nervous wreck. So, for coming down I need some alcohol. With this wrecked mixture I ain´t gonna have any chances with the women of the club tonight. But hey, why should I need any woman, if I just can masturbate for 3 hours later? Great for the third time.

81htax,7,2018-03-02,Futa4F - Sarah Korhonen: A Monster In Waiting,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/81htax/futa4f_sarah_korhonen_a_monster_in_waiting/,"It is 8PM in the evening, and Sarah Korhonen is doing dishes. There is nothing particularly sinister about this act: Sarah has simply finished a plate of lasagna, and is cleaning up after having put away her leftovers. Nothing terribly unusual, although she ate the meal alone, which one could think of as being a little sad.

Sarah is not particularly unattractive. At the age of 39 - rapidly approaching 40 - her curves have filled out nicely, and only the odd wrinkle has started to show around her eyes. In four years’ time, she will have her first grey hair, but for now it is a dark shade of auburn that contrasts nicely with her pale blue eyes. Her skin - once again, largely bereft of wrinkles - is a delightful shade of light pink, a product of her Finnish ancestry. 

Genetics have also bestowed upon her a reasonably large pair of breasts, but - superficially speaking - her best features occur below the waist. Her ass is round, soft and full, and perfectly complemented by a pair of exceptionally wide hips; “child-birthing” hips, if you will. Indeed, it’s these two locations, along with her thick thighs, that almost all of her body fat settles, which is not to say that she’s *fat*, by any means. “Delightfully plump” might be more apt.

All of that said, it is unlikely that Ms. Korhonen will be putting those “child-birthing” hips to their titular application. This is for a short, but rather critical list of reasons. The first is that, for all intensive purposes, Sarah is not attracted to men. Indeed, Sarah has dedicated an unworldly amount of her time fantasizing about the various women in her life. Coworkers. Retail employees. Neighbours. Strangers. Even - and this in particular she would adamantly deny - some of her younger relatives. So, to phrase it with some degree of vulgarity: Sarah Korhonen has pussy on the brain.

The second reason is, well, rather anatomical. Sarah wasn’t born like most girls. For the most part, she developed like any other woman: she hit puberty at the proper time, her curves developed exceptionally, her voice became musical in tone, if somewhat husky in timbre. All in all, she appeared to be a perfectly normal middle-aged woman. The only exception was the presence of a 9-inch phallus in place of a clitoris and a pair of egg-sized testicles in place of ovaries.

Just how different would Ms Korhonen’s life have been had her parents been a touch more… *accepting* of her gender? As a child she learned that under no circumstance was her penis to be mentioned, within or outside of the house. There were no sleepovers for little Sarah, and in fact there would be no spending time with her friends *at all* outside of school hours. Instead, Sarah read books, listened to music and learned to cook.

Although she was allowed more freedom as she grew older and more “responsible”, Sarah lived in that repressive household until the age of twenty-four, when she went to college to obtain a degree in Business Management. Still, despite her escape, the damage was done. Anything approaching a romantic - or, God forbid, *sexual* - interaction would send waves of anxiety through the poor woman, sinking any and all potential relationships before they had a chance to set sail.

And now, at the age of thirty-nine - almost forty - Sarah Korhonen lives alone in a very nice, very *quaint* two-bedroom condominium in the suburbs. She uses the second bedroom as a home office.

That is not to say that her life has been completely chaste and sterile; Sarah’s sexuality has not been destroyed, it has merely been dormant. For one, she’s become an expert at both manual masturbation and the creation and use of improvised sex toys. More importantly, though, is that she has done far more depraved things than most people have dreamed of. Whips and chains, gags and plugs, ropes and corsets, boots and heels, leashes and collars, leather and latex… These are the things Ms. Korhonen thinks of when her hands dip beneath the sheets.

Still, solitary perversion is not her only area of expertise. Sarah has become quite good at cooking and baking. She has a recipe for chocolate-espresso macaroons that are to *die* for, and she’s the type of person who always brings some to share. Most people agree that she’s a bit of a sweetheart, a *total softie*, really, and now that she’s in middle management she does her best to keep everyone’s lives as stress-free as possible. Truly, she likes it when people are happy.

Which is where you come in. *Why is Sarah Korhonen single?*, you wonder. She’s attractive, kind-hearted, intelligent and friendly. Exactly the kind of person you’ve been looking for in a partner - or a fling.

What could possibly go wrong?

You’ll have your answer in a few months’ time, when you’re bound and gagged, whip marks criss-crossing your back while loud, *angry* grunts echo from behind you. There is an unbearably thick cock burrowed deep inside your pussy, threatening to shoot a hot, creamy wad of white semen directly against your cervix. This could happen at any time; SHE has been edging inside of you for *hours*. Of course, there’s no risk of pregnancy: birth control drugs have been slipped into your meals every day since you came to live here.

And besides, at this moment, pregnancy is the least of your worries. Right now, a rubber-clad *fist* - HER first - is pressing roughly against your lubricated anus. It’s not the first time this has happened, and it certainly won’t be the last.

When that time comes, perhaps Sarah will feel bad about what she’s done to you. After all, she’s not heartless by any means. But she’s spent far too many years holding back, and now that you’ve opened the floodgates, there’s no way in Hell she’ll let them close.

But right now, Sarah Korhonen is doing the dishes.

---

How do you know Ms. Korhonen?

- *The Intern*: You’re new to the company, and you quickly come to appreciate Sarah’s hands-on approach to employee management. She keeps you well-informed on what needs to be done and how to do it, keeps you in the loop on all pertinent information, and insists that if ever you need help or advice, her door is always open. After all, she was the new girl once, and you want to succeed. You know office romance is frowned upon by upper management, but asking her out on a date wouldn’t be *too* scandalous, after all she’s done to help you...

- *The Neighbor Girl*: Ms. Korhonen had been a fixture of the suburb for several years before your family arrived, and was the first to welcome you all to the neighbourhood - with a fantastic fruit arrangement and pastry tray in tow, of course. Soon enough, she and your mother were fast friends, and not long after that you began doing chores around the kindly-natured woman’s house. You certainly couldn’t complain: the pay was exceptional for the kind of menial labor involved, and you never felt so well-fed as you did heading home after a post-lawnmowing ‘snack’ with Sarah. Perhaps - no, almost certainly - because of the hormones running through your adolescent mind - you began to fantasize about the smoking-hot older woman, and soon you began to devise plans to seduce her...

- *The Waitress*: Honestly, you never thought you’d be working at the restaurant long enough to have a favorite customer, but when it came to Sarah, you always knew you would have a pleasant shift. For one, her tips were always exceptional - sometimes going as high as 50%! She would always give it a hand-wave: “Oh, where else am I going to spend it? Besides, you always do *such* a good job…”. Whenever it was a slow shift, you found yourself sitting across from her, chatting sometimes for hours between customers. Talking was always *easy* with her, and sometimes you got the impression that she was a bit lonely. What the hell, maybe it’s about time the two of you eat somewhere *else* for a change...

- *Someone Else:* Surprise me!

---

*Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I’ll be playing a sweet, almost motherly middle-aged futa with one hell of a dark side just waiting to come out. I’d like for the story to start out very lovey-dovey and warm in tone, then gradually have things escalate to an almost nightmarish story of kink gone mad.*

*Despite the 3rd-person perspective of the prompt, I prefer doing the actual RP in 1st person.*

*If you're interested, send me your character's name, appearance, relationship to my character and a few personality traits. Also, your kinks and limits would be helpful.*

*Some of my kinks include oral, anal, petplay, bondage, fisting, dubious consent, impregnation (late-game only), cumplay, sex toys, sweat, spanking, whipping, facesitting, humiliation, domination and body worship. Limits are bestiality, blood, vomit (unless plot-relevant), scat and watersports.*

*I hope to hear back from you soon!*

81i4n3,8,2018-03-02,Disclosing suspension when filling out FCVS for medical licensure,debki,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/81i4n3/disclosing_suspension_when_filling_out_fcvs_for/,"Hi all,

When I was in med school I was suspended for two weeks for what was deemed to be an unprofessional social media post. I am now finishing up intern year and filling out FCVS with the intention of applying for my state medical licensure come July (I’m in psychiatry residency). 

There is one question in FCVS that I feel I must answer “yes” to.  “Were you ever disciplined or placed under investigation?” The other questions are less relevant and if I stated yes it would be to disclose the same story. Once you click yes it asks for a reason. I am wondering if I would need to disclose more than the information I have given in this post. I’m also wondering what I should expect to happen as a result of disclosing this. 

As far as I know, the only place my school disclosed my disciplinary action was in my MMSE (it was a simple one liner, more simple than what I have disclosed in this post). So, I doubt anyone would know about my disciplinary action beyond what I choose to disclose. 

Would appreciate any help I can get. Thanks !"
81iif1,15,2018-03-02,Being an optimistic dumbass,DesparateDolph,unchartedmultiplayer,https://www.reddit.com/r/unchartedmultiplayer/comments/81iif1/being_an_optimistic_dumbass/,"As one of the remaining few people who still play this game and actually enjoy it (through all the eternity we call matchmaking, the facing abusers of broken me hanics and plenty of other shit) and suck at other games and as someone who avidly ridicules any mentions of this game getting any kind of support, I would like to expand my perspective and think along the lines of people still dreaming of a new map or skins for Asav.


So here it goes. This game isn't dead, not completely anyway. Yes it may be the equivalent of a 95 year old grandpa on life support, but in the end thats technically not death. There will still be people who love it and come back to play it occasionally as well as the die hards who are bad at other games and would stick to this game through thick and thin. Its not really dead dead but its dead does that make any sense? Didn't think so.


Anyways, going back to being an optimistic dumbass. I have a few suggestions that make sense but are too farfetched and will probably never happen.


1 - Keep Rank going after season 18. I dont think resetting the season is that difficult. The unpaid intern could probably write up a program that resets it every month. That would be an obvious suggestion. 


But, I remember reading a post recently on this very subreddit of someone suggesting revive packs depleting health of opponents and that kind of creative stupidity inspired me. And so I came up with a few ideas.


1 -Switch the match thpe to Plunder. The OG Uncharted objective mode. It is the perfect mode for great teamwork, map control and gun skill. Unlike cash dripping a Condor and ARX's while camping (sorry I meant to say strategically waiting) in TDM or waiting till Victory Hill and Having a Dorados Shields and Indras battle to determine the winner (KOTH), it will be a better test of which team is better. It is also the most overlooked game mode yet certainly the most fun and objective (again, in my opinion only this is the Internet afterall everyone has one). Tie games may be a big factor in many games and some matches may take too long so maybe have it at 5 caps. I'm already overreaching to the impossible which leads me to my next point.


2 - Rotate the game modes. Again another wishful thinking idea. Have type of matches rotate (they could be daily for example we can have 3 days of TDM, then 3 of KOTH then Plunder for 3 days (total 10 rotations). Heck throw in Classic Mode as well with the demabd it has albeit too small. That way everyone can be happy.


3 - Change the reward system so its more customizable. This is perhaps my strongest point (which is not saying much). And here is what I was thinking. At the beginning of every season let each player choose which customizable item would be the reward for that season and have it plated with the different colors (Gold up to Master). This for a fact I know shouldn't be hard with the ease you made the rewards for seasons 5-9 which were super lazy btw and had 0 thought. I'm sure this a huge stretch but I'm sure its still doable to my poor programming and design knowledge. Just apply the color schemes to the item and it doesnt have to be perfect. I'm sure the other intern can do this too.


4 - Lastly, fix the point system like seriously. You are not good if you spam revives and Staff with Increased duration. Me being consistently a top 10 player last season is proof that points dont mean shit.


5 - Not really Ranked related, but a good idea (for you folks at ND in a last ditch effort to squeeze some pennies for dem coins out of us) and for us as consumers is to cut all prices (relics and UC coins wise) in half and increase the relics earned from daily challenges. Maybe we can finally unlock all the colors for Nadine's skins. Its called extending the product life cycle for all you bachelors degree in Marketing reading this.


Anyways yea thats pretty much it. I legit wrote this whole thing while waiting for a match. None of this will ever happen but it would be cool if it did for the 5 of us who still play.  


Laterz."
81iiou,1,2018-03-02,Need help quoting a medical lab for a data input application.,timmy_tucker,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/81iiou/need_help_quoting_a_medical_lab_for_a_data_input/,"Hello r/freelance, I've been a lurker for a little while, but I was wondering if I might be able to get some help from you fine folks.

TL:DR; Basically, I have been given the opportunity to potentially work with a lab that does analytical work for their clients. Their current workflow involves printing out PDFs for each sample they run and having an intern type them into an excel spreadsheet. What a perfect opportunity for me to offer my programming (Python) services! But at what cost?

For a little bit of background I graduated last May so I don't have a ton of experience to justify a crazy high quote. That being said, I'm confident I can achieve what they need, and I also know that there is software to do exactly what they need for several thousand dollars a year. 

I was looking for general tips as far as how I might want to quote them for something like this, and more generally ways I could provide value for that price. So far I've been thinking of taking a test driven approach for writing the program and ensuring that the program makes less mistakes then a human would (&gt;99% accuracy would be ideal). I've also consider a way of messaging them if the values of a run seem fishy (outside of a given range), but aside from that I can't think of a ton of things as far as features go. For instance should I offer support as part of the price, or at a separate rate?

Any tips (design &amp; send a proposal/specs document, quote based on hourly/a fixed price, etc) would be appreciated at this point as I'm really unsure of how to get started here."
81imlk,1,2018-03-02,I don't know how to proceed with this girl...,Sonic1899,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/81imlk/i_dont_know_how_to_proceed_with_this_girl/,"This is the first time I went out with a girl I met at a bar/restaurant. She seemed generally sweet in person and in text, but after about two weeks of the initial meeting, we only went out once.

On Feb 16th, me and a group of friends went to a restaurant to chill out. There a quite light-skinned girl with curly hair sitting by herself there. She was also curvy, which I like lmao. She was getting ready to leave, but then I went up to her and introduced myself. She mentioned being for Ohio and we both talked about the Black Panther film. She already saw it, but wanted to see it again. So, I got her number and we made plans to see it together.

Texting was okay, but I wanted to avoid giving too much info over text. She wanted to know where I was from, what I liked, and she talked about herself, too. I tried keeping text to a minimum, but she seemed interested to knowing how my day was.

Come the night of the movie, I had to pay for her ticket, since they were running out fast and my pass wouldn't cover it. She said she would be at the theatre at 8:15 for the 8:30 showing, but arrived at 8:35. I was pretty upset about it and she could tell I didn't appreciate it. We watched the film and I let her know I didn't appreciate it. But I let it go, so we could enjoy the film. The film was great and after it was done, we talked about each other more. She mentioned that she has an internship and goes to school, so she's basically a ""young professional."" We both live in Washington DC, where dating in of itself is hard to do. I mentioned I was still job searching, because my lost job closed down. At the end of the night, he hugged goodbye. I wanted to kiss, but wasn't sure if it was too early. Wanted to do it on the 2nd date.

We made plans to meet again next Thursday (the Thursday that JUST passed on March 1st). But on Wednesday on the 28th, I told her where we could meet up. Then, she suddenly replied that she had some hearing to attend on Thursday and couldn't do it. Then she said she said she would make it up for me.

I asked what she had in mind. She said she wasn't sure yet and wanted to do something ""lighthearted and fun."" Her saying that really threw me off. I didn't know if she implied ""you're being a bit too serious, let's slow down"" or ""I just want to be friends."" She said she would send me a list of ideas, which I haven't gotten yet. I sent her a very weak text, saying, 

""Did I come off too serious. I'm all about having fun lol.""

That was last night. Today, she sent me something, saying,

""Yes I definitely think you're a lot of fun.""

""Lol you're a gamer, how can you not be fun?""

I mentioned that I played videogames, but also go to concerts, travel, and meet people (like I did with her). A lot of her text has a positive vibe to them, but I'm hoping it's genuine at this point. So, I don't know what my next move should be, if I should even make one. I want to meet her in person, but idk how I can, if she's that busy. tbh, I just wanted to hook up and have a FWB relationship, but I have no idea how I can transition into that, after the first meeting. I'm also not sure how to tell her that I don't like texting that much, if at all. I'd rather meet people in person, because I find texting shallow. I want to tell her I just want to meet up, do stuff together, and possibly hookup, but I don't want to come off desperate or creepy. I DO like the girl, but hooking up is something I want to do. I'd appreciate any advice, guys"
81j4fx,1,2018-03-02,4 close family members died in the last 4 years,cajopear,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/81j4fx/4_close_family_members_died_in_the_last_4_years/,"Four years ago, I was 21, when I experienced the first death of a beloved one. After a two year struggle against stomach cancer, my godmother - the most religious and the strongest I person I have ever known - lost her battle. Her disease came shortly after the breakup of my first relationship (a two year long relationship of a then closeted boy suffering in silence) to show me that there were more important things in life and that we should stand by the ones we love and fight for happiness while we are healthy and young. So I got myself involved in the whole process she was about to go through; I would drive her to every appointment and chemo session and would be there for seven hours straight by her side, skipping most of my classes as a university sophomore student, to make sure she was not alone and to tell her everything was going to be OK; I was the person who cut her hair short and then - not long after - I was also the person who shaved her head with the biggest smile on for here, while devastated inside crying to the sound of Love by Grace, by Lara Fabian, because I wanted her to understand she was so beautiful and that would be just a reminder of how much of a fighter she is. It was a very tough time, but on the bright side my family became more united. Then, after two years fighting and winning all the small battles, her health started deteriorating and rapidly she became unrecognizable, as all she'd be able to do was to talk gibberish in agony. She died two weeks after and it made me feel so empty, but I decided to stick to the good memories of her saying she loved me and I brought joy to everyone's lives because I always look happy and sing all the time. I love her. She taught me so much and I am so sorry I was never able to tell her that.

By the time of my godmother's death, my godmother's godmother - who was my great aunt - started becoming severely depressed and visiting different doctors every week, not believing them when they all would say she was not sick, because she was so sure she too had stomach cancer. It was sad to see because, even though she was 80, she was very healthy and all of a sudden she would not get out of bed, and she'd cry all the time because of pain doctors insisted didn't exist. She was a very close relative because her longtime husband had died and they had not had any children so she was living alone, so still as a teenager I started sleeping in her house to keep her company through the night in case she needed something. And that made me realize how much of a good person she was - she was elderly but she would always visit every sick person in our village (as we lived in a small village) and would do all she could for them. But the death of my godmother shook her so much that she developed depression and that, somehow, speeded up Alzheimer's appearance and development. So, again, a person I loved started deteriorating so quickly, it was unbelievable. One year after my godmother's passing, we found out she had skin cancer and it wasn't even worth to try any treatment on her as her health was already very much compromised. So all we did was just to make sure she was provided with the best quality of life on her last days, and I am sure my family did their best.

A couple of months after my great aunt's passing, my grandfather (my mother's father) - her brother - who I grew up with (me, my parents, brother, and grandparents always lived all together) and with whom would go for a walk in the city area every Sunday even at my teenage years, not caring if I had to talk very loud to him on the train, because he had a hearing aid, and everybody would stare, went to the hospital and died from pneumonia. This was the most shocking death at the time because unlike the previous two, it was all of a sudden and caught us all off guard. But hey, once again, the family became more united than ever even though things would never be the same again.

Not long before my grandfather's passing, my father had been diagnosed with lung cancer - the same disease his father had died from, so it was very scary. It became even more frightening given the scenario my family was going through. I knew my father was devastated and figured we should start having more family programmes, such as watching a TV show together, for example - we watched Strangers Things together and loved it! Also, we went to a football match (and I hate football) together and I loved the experience. So I knew those kinds of things would make him slightly happier, and I was happier, too, therefore. And a happy person has a greater chance to stand strong through such a harsh fight and come on top of it. By this time I was finishing my master's degree and entering the labor market, and I was even really close to getting a work offer abroad (I was one of the final two candidates when I gave up on the process), in the country I had always dreamed to work in, in the field I had studied for, but I decided to put that dream on hold. I might be about to open a great door to a great professional future, but what would it be if I didn't have really mattered - the people I love around... Anyways, the treatment was going super fine and the tumor started decreasing with chemo, when all of a sudden my father had a seizure and the doctors later found out he had several brain metastasis (though the doctors never said it like that so my parents were not aware of how serious it was, but I was because as a hypochondriac that I am, I can't help but read and try to understand all details about health and the lack of it), but I decided not to tell them and and went through my lowest without them knowing, dealing with constant anxiety - I was aware my father was terribly ill; I was in an internship I hated, where I'd spend most of the time doing nothing because they didn't have any workload for the employers; and I wanted to tell my parents I was gay and that I had a boyfriend but I kept postponing it because they were going through shit already, and I didn't want to feel guilty for potentially putting them in a worse situation. Eventually, after a couple of months of desperation dealing with constant anxiety and panic attacks, I decided to come out to my parents and it was much better than I expected (and I am glad I did come out, otherwise my father would have died without really knowing his son and I would never be able to forgive myself). Anyways, they accepted me and my sexuality, they met my boyfriend and even made him a welcome family member, so I couldn't be happier, except I could, obviously. I kept having those horrible panic attacks - I wanted to quit the internship but I couldn't because I was the only person working - my father was sick, my mother was unemployed and my brother was looking for his first job as a fresh high school graduate. And as I said, I am hypochondriac who is afraid of death and serious diseases, and given what my family has been going through over the last recent years, I couldn't afford to think that ""it only happens to others"", and that I could die soon, too. Anyways, my father was still doing great, but he started having a lot of pain in his leg and all of a sudden, on a normal day, he just passed out, went to the hospital and never woke up the same again - they later found out that cancer had spread out to the bones and since chemo was no longer working, they had better do palliative care instead because he did not have much more time. So his last days on earth were the harshest - he could not talk, walk or even react to anything, and all we wanted to do was to remind him he was very much loved and never alone so he didn't need to be afraid. On the last day, I was on my way to the hospital, when I got the call saying he had passed out. Now I feel terribly sorry because I wanted to be there. I wanted to remind him, just one last time, that I loved him and was there to help him through the hardships; I wanted to be there on the scariest moment of his life. But I was five minutes late. Five minutes! And now I feel terribly sorry because I grew up too late - my father (and my mother) had a miserable life and just when I started being able to provide them with the good things of life and show them the world, this shit happened. And I feel deeply sorry! But I promise I will still make it up to my mother.

My father passed away almost three weeks ago but I am emotionally exhausted. I am doing psychotherapy and taking antidepressants, because of those panic attacks - which I have not been feeling lately. But I still feel numb! Sometimes I wonder what is the purpose of life because it can be so short and all you do and are can be gone in a blink of an eye, and I feel stuck to this feeling. Besides all these sad things I described, I have all it takes to be the happiest person - finally got a good job, recognized in the market; have a very dedicated boyfriend; have a family I love - especially my 2-year-old godson!; and could not have better friends. But still feel very pessimistic about life sometimes, and overall tired."

I’m pretty sure the investigation is going well since I haven’t heard anything bad (nor do I have anything bad in my history).  I got a call today from an investigator to set up an interview. 

She stated that we would be discussing some questions that would be sent to her from D.C. regarding my security clearance package, but she doesn’t have exact details about it and would like to ask me some questions. She says the meeting would take roughly 2 hours maybe more.

I did not know this was a part of the process for the job?  Does anyone know if this meeting would help indicate a start date? Thanks."

81kfp8,2,2018-03-02,Full-time job: NASA vs Google. How would you decide?,AutismAmmo,nasa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/81kfp8/fulltime_job_nasa_vs_google_how_would_you_decide/,"I am a computer engineering student at a state school in the midwest and I was extremely fortunate to get both of these two offers. I am having an incredibly hard time deciding.


I interned at both NASA and Google while doing my undergrad and I loved working at both but they were very different experiences. The google internship was definitely more fun and exciting (tons of company sponsored events, freebies, etc), but the work at NASA was more interesting for sure. I loved my coworkers at both and I honestly believe I would be happy at either. How would you make this decision? 


As far as I can see, here are the pros/cons of each.


Google

Pros

 * Very high compensation (~200k / year (salary, stock, bonus))
 * I like the location (sf bay area, CA)
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Amazing perks (Free breakfast/lunch/dinner, free shuttle to work, gym, misc benefits)
 * High prestige if I want to move
 * Good work-life balance (at least for my team)
 * Better Software engineering practices


Cons

 * Very expensive location (I would pay ~2k/month rent for a studio)
 * Specific project isn't very exciting to me
 * Not advancing humanity
 * All software (no hardware which I'm interested in)
 * Most people leave after a few years


NASA

Pros:

 * Very cool project/team (Robotics/Avionics)
 * Good Benefits
 * Cheap Location for living (~800 for a 1BR apartment)
 * Mixture of hardware and software
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Very good work-life balance
 * High Prestige
 * Advancing Humanity
 * Many people stay for life


Cons

 * Not a location I want to live in (very hot + humid)
 * Low compensation (starting around ~45k but likely to increase in the future. Will never match Google though)
 * Poorer software engineering practices
 * No real perks besides benefits
 * Government bureaucracy
 * Unsure what will happen under current administration / future administrations


So what do you guys think? I understand this is a very good problem to have, but I am having a really hard time deciding. I know money shouldn't be the biggest factor in my decision but after receiving the Google offer it is hard to imagine accepting ~4-5x less. On the other hand, it's been a dream of mine to work for NASA and while I've already accomplished that in a way through my internships, I now have the option to continue with it. How would you decide?"
81klsm,270,2018-03-02,“And now I’m stuck with YOU!” Enabline &amp; narc sister’s death,esotericshy,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/81klsm/and_now_im_stuck_with_you_enabline_narc_sisters/,"A lot of my Enabline stories are hard to post because my sister is so entwined with them. Having it meet the criteria for this sub is complicated, and I never really saw them as separate people. I felt that narc sister was 50% my mom, and my mom was 75% my sister. You know how some people believe that they are mediums who channel ancient spirits? It was like that, but they both had bodies. 

**TL/DR** My sister passed away &amp; Enabline was stuck with me. That was terribly sucky of me. You know: not dying instead. Lots of background.

Enabline &amp; my sister never lived more than 10 miles apart, with the exception of the time in my previous post. Before that, narc sister, BIL1 (her pretty boy, idiot first husband), and the girls lived with my mom. After that trial with independent living when I reported my sister to CPS, they moved close together again, in an extreme southeastern state in the US. I believe that Enabline did this because I had reported narc sister to CPS, Enabline knew I was telling the truth, and she wanted to keep an eye on the girls. If you recall, Enabline was also paying the bills. Generally, she could not say no to my sister, but I believe she forced the issue of them living close together. She probably needed to protect narc sister from me.

I was NC with Enabline for 5 years following the CPS episode and with my sister for 7. Eventually I ended the NC due to interference from my dad’s domestic partner, whom I will refer to as SM (stepmom) which is how I view her. She is mostly JustYes, with periodic JESUS FUCKING JUST NO episodes, maybe 5 times in 20 years. This is by way of background, so I apologize for all the info.

When my sister and I tentatively ended the NC, it was for a family reunion on the beach, where dad &amp; SM rented both sides of a duplex for a week. Narc sister stayed in one side, and I stayed in the other, which would have been a great plan, except my sister was mostly MIA, and I again ended up watching my nieces, since they were the same age as my boys. It was rough because they were young &amp; responding to their mother’s manipulation and poison. It was an issue because my sister was unavailable to care for them due to her prescription drug use.

Her drug use was brushed off as, “Well, the doctor prescribed it,” or, “Poor dear is sooo exhausted from being a single mom!” She got more assistance from my mom than I got from DH (Joyous Ex’s son), and I had one disabled kid &amp; was commuting 152 mi per day to get my degree. But I wasn’t that tired because I wasn’t a single mom. Riiight. 

Jumping forward about 4 years, my sister’s second marriage was ending, she had a law degree &amp; passed the bar exam. She was unemployed, and other than having completed an internship &amp; working at Barnes &amp; Noble for 4 months, she had never been self supporting in her 33 years. My mom cashed out her entire retirement &amp; paid the tax penalty and gave it to my sister. $750K was gone in 6 months on absolutely nothing. No house. Nothing of real value. 

At this point my sister was (to me) clearly addicted to multiple substances, and she had been to rehab. She was an alcoholic. She was also diagnosed bipolar &amp; with fibromyalgia. 

I do not want to doubt or raise concerns that anyone with fibromyalgia doesn’t really have it, or that it isn’t a thing. Likewise with the bipolar diagnosis. My sister was abusing a lot of drugs, including opioids, and opioid withdrawal looks a lot like fibromyalgia plus some other stuff. No fibromyalgia treatments, other than strong opioids, worked for her pain. You also cannot really diagnose bipolar until the person is off drugs. My sister wasn’t ever off drugs. Those are my issues in this particular case, and that has nothing to do with anyone else’s diagnoses. 

Really, narc sister was at the end of her battle with drugs. My dad was angry with her because she wouldn’t respond to email. She cc’d me on an email response blaming me for her lack of responsiveness. I got an angry phone call from my mom about getting my sister in trouble with my dad (who was the only person left with money to give her), but dad sent her a Howler email telling her to grow up &amp; be responsible. (That elicited another screaming phone call from Enabline, as she was cc’d on that email as well. I was to call my dad, confess, and explain why I was ruining narc sister’s life. I think I went &amp; bought fabric instead.) 

About 36 hours before my sister’s death, I spoke with her on the phone. Over the course of the one hour conversation, my sister said, “Hang on! I haven’t taken my pain meds all day, and I’m in a lot of pain (gulp, gulp),” three times.  I was through grad school, where I specialized in psychopharmacology, so I started asking specific questions about what she was taking. Every drug she took had a side effect of respiratory depression, and several are super-additive. 

Then I got a call early in the morning from Enabline that my sister was dead. I was deeply concerned for my nieces and my mother. I didn’t think Enabline could survive without my sister. I called my dad &amp; he bought me a plane ticket out to where she lived. 

Enabline picked me up from the airport, and immediately launched into a thing about suing my sister’s doctors. I did research on psychotropic meds, and I knew something about the regulations. I had just asked my sister about those meds. No doctor knowingly prescribed those drugs together, and no pharmacy was knowingly filling them. No insurance would pay for it. She *had* to be running scripts, doctor &amp; pharmacy shopping, and paying out of pocket for the drugs. 

I gently explained this to Enabline, and recounted my last conversation with narc sister. My mom immediately decided that my sister was too drugged to remember that she’d taken drugs. I have some sympathy for this argument, but that is how addiction works. I had 2 kids at this point &amp; was pregnant with DS3. The thought of burying one of my kids makes my soul shudder. I haven’t pushed it with Enabline, as long as she didn’t sue anyone. 

I was (of course) the bad guy for this period. Narc sister’s in laws yelled at me about not offering her estranged husband enough support. I wasn’t there for them; I was there for my parents &amp; my nieces. My dad was in a lot of pain, but he was okay. 

In the end, about 5 days after my sister died, Enabline screamed at me, “I have spent my entire life investing my time and my resources in narc sister. Now she’s dead &amp; I’m broke, and I’m stuck with you! My life is ruined!”

Yeah. So that is a thing? I ruined Enabline’s life by living when my sister didn’t."

I wasnt expecting a FT offer until late this year at which point I would decline and probably quit after. But now I only have 2 weeks to let them know.

We are both seniors in college about to graduate in May. 

When we first started dating, lasting for probably the first year and a half, we were that couple who were always together and never got sick of each other. We wanted to do everything together because the other one being there made the most mundane things better. The past 2 summers and winter breaks, including this winter break, we spent living 2 hours away from each other but other than that have never gone a day without each other.

This semester, my only ""class"" is a full-time internship. I'm usually gone from 7am-5pm, Monday through Friday. It's a lot different from having only a couple classes a day randomly throughout the week. My boyfriend works Monday evenings, Thursday evenings, Friday usually 9am-9pm, and all day Sunday. Tuesday and Wednesday night he is usually doing school work so we see each other significantly less than we used to.

For reasons I have no idea about though, ever since this schedule change, I don't feel the same as I used to. I don't miss him when I'm at work anymore. I hate coming home and having to make the bed and pick up after him knowing that he slept in until noon that day and did nothing. We used to have sex at least once a day, now we're lucky if it's once a week because I just don't want to. Even simple things like kissing are lacking. I still love him and care about him but I've never felt this disconnected from him before. I find myself not rushing home to see him after work anymore. I've tried more dates, forcing myself to be more touchy-feely, going to bed earlier so I'm not tired, trying to go back to old date spots and nothing is bringing that feeling back.

At first I thought maybe I was having a hard time adjusting to a full time schedule and I was only sleeping around 5 hours a night and was overtired, but its been almost 2 months now and it's getting worse. I've love him and want a future with him, and have fought so hard for this to work in the past that I can't fathom the fact nothing is wrong and we might break up. He told me last night he's noticed how different I'm acting but I just don't know anymore. Is this just growing pains or if it's really starting to end. I want to save it but I'm running out ideas and don't know what else to do...

tldr: Schedules and lives changed and now I don't feel in love with bf anymore, unsure how to fix or what to do"

Recently I asked for feedback as to why I wasn’t considered and they told me that they chose to hire one of their student interns. I am not wanting to stay where I am completing clinicals, so I am extremely nervous that graduation will come and I won’t have a job because all of the places I am applying have students as well that likely want jobs on top of there not being that many positions open.  

What do I do if I can’t find work? Lab assistant work? Just do nothing and wait for a position to open? I can’t move too far away as I’m trying going back to school within a year or two and it doesn’t make sense to move cross country. Plus, I miss my family horribly and I know staying where I am isn’t going to be good for me. 

I’m beyond frustrated at my school for leading us into believing finding work would be easy, jobs would be numerous, and pay would be good. All of it has turned out to be a lie.

I am a long time lurker on this sub and have a question noted on the title.

I am currently in college with an internship who really needed a new car. My parents forced me to get a new car with low mileage since my last car broke down at 125k miles. On this car I paid 5k down payment and 7.5k on loan for 5 years at 7.89% interest rate.

I have no other debts or anything. I have the cash to pay off the car right now. But will it affect my credit score alot for only having the car loan for 3 months? I did not have the 7.5k a month ago. This was a gift from my father for getting good grades. He advised me to pay off my loan. Since i just moved in the US from canada, i have no credit history and this car loan has bumped my credit from 680 to 730 in two months. 

Question is, how much will it affect my credit, because if i pay off the loan, ive paid about 100 in interest instead of 1500 that it would charge me in interest over the years.

I want to know the best suggestion.

This is also my first time posting on reddit, so go easy on me.

I’m a recent grad with a Marketing major and Creative Writing minor. I’ve had two internships where the majority of my responsibilities were writing for social media, blogs, and website content writing. I have some SEO experience as well. So problem is that I’m not finding any job opportunities to put my writing skills to use.

I’m thinking about starting a blog to not only keep myself in practice but to show employers what I can do as a writer. I do have some samples already, but maybe it’d be more impressive if I keep an active feed of my writing. Right now I work at an event marketing company where I promote products at Sam’s Clubs and Costcos so my current job doesn’t give me any opportunity to write. Just wondering if I’m on the right track to pursuing a career in content writing.

If starting a blog is a way to go, should I make it about any specific topics, current events, write reviews, or about marketing in particular?

Thanks!"
81mr2h,2,2018-03-02,Killer/Chapter Concept: Making a Deal with the Entity,Famotill,deadbydaylight,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/81mr2h/killerchapter_concept_making_a_deal_with_the/,"So I know the Doppelganger concept has been done before, but I just wanted to try my hand at it. Would love to hear others thoughts and ideas about this as I think a doppelganger character could be super interesting. I made some perks which I'll include in the comments, but I'm unsure about most of this. Just wanted to get the idea out there! 
-

“*There was a cold logic to him. The Entity and its creatures certainly offered him more than we could. He fed us falsehoods and in exchange, he survived another night.  I saw it consume him; rip flesh and time from his bones. He is of the fog now, but he was one of us. Our tricks won’t work on him.*” 

**Connor Mercer (The Doppelgänger)**

For Connor Mercer life had been a game. A con man from youth Mercer was used to getting what he wanted through his deception. His greatest lie was framing an innocent man for the murders he’d committed. He lived a life of luxury and excess until the truth finally caught up to him. A grizzled attorney was determined to make Mercer answer for his crimes. He fled to the forests hoping to allude prosecution. 
 
While Mercer entered The Entity's realm a survivor he’d soon find his higher purpose. Selling out fellow survivors for the chance at escape had become routine for Mercer, but with each lie he felt a piece of himself touched by the Entity’s almighty grasp. It wasn’t long before Mercer was no more. Instead the fog twisted and corrupted Mercer. The Entity exposed Mercer for what he was in the same way the attorney had tried to. Facing only the truth now Mercer submitted, and to that The Entity granted him a chance at something greater. The Fog held many secrets, but none knew how to exploit them in the ways that Mercer could. 
 
Broken and more monster, now, than man did Connor Mercer become The Doppleganger. For he’d known the rules now, and he’d make sure to break every last one. 
 
**Weapon:** Barbwire Bat. Normal attack = horizontal swipe. Lunge attack = larger swing.
 
**Memento Mori:** After pushing the survivor to the ground, The Doppelganger pummels them repeatedly with his bat before himself shifting shape into the now dead survivor. 
 
**Power: The Greatest Deception:** The Doppelganger takes pleasure in outsmarting his prey. He has grown accustomed to the ways of The Fog, and hunts survivors accordingly. The Doppelganger has four traps with which to do one of the following:
 
 Traps can be consumed to create a  “false survivor” at generators or at chests where they will perform repair/search animations. These illusions will not take the shape of hooked survivors. An injured doppelganger will take priority in the conjuring process, and will cease animation to be ‘healed’ if a survivor is within 8m.  The survivor will be alerted of the trap upon having fully healed the illusion. Survivor’s auras are revealed to you upon entering 8m of the false survivor. 
 
A trap can be consumed upon carrying a downed survivor. The Doppleganger can use his power to create a false version of himself. This shadow will carry a victim to the nearest hook while the Doppleganger continues his hunt. The trap is returned one minute after the survivor is hooked. This ability cannot be used when another survivor is already hooked. 

**Survivor: Emelia Cruz**
She’d dealt with monsters her entire life. She’d known that most were made to be that way by circumstance, but not Connor Mercer. She’d spent years studying his evasion from prosecution in her years at law school. Seeking to make a name for herself, and provide justice to those he’d wronged Cruz pursued any and all leads she could find. As it turns out, years of deception hadn’t earned the con man any friends. 
 
With a hard-drive of incriminating evidence Cruz, only an intern at the Attorney General’s office, brought the information to light. She was horrified to learn that Mercer had learned of her snooping, and had already went off grid. 
 
Outsmarted like so many before her Cruz was emboldened to bring justice to Mercer. She managed to track him down to a forest. She knew it was dangerous to pursue him herself, but she needed answers. She wandered the forest for what felt like days. Each passing moment felt more foreign than the last until Cruz was wandering, instead, through a most horrific dwelling. 
 
The Entity fed on Cruz’ selfishness. It knows that for her the pleasure is not in helping others, but in outsmarting her opponent. 
 

**Map - The Courthouse**
For Cruz and for Mercer the Courthouse was a game room. For so many others it meant life or death. The Entity has twisted this place to suit its needs. Remnants of a more just and civil realm taunt the survivors, and further motivate the fog’s creatures. What once felt safe for some now feels all the more imposing and domineering. This place is much larger than it once was.

We started off as friends but it was clearly something more for both of us, so after a few months of my denial about my feelings I finally realized that I wanted to be with her.

We are in different parts of life: I am still in university and trying to figure out what my technical career will follow, and she lives 6 hours away but can visit about once a month due to her work schedule and her commitment to me. Her career already has its roots where she lives, and she is establishing herself well (something I'm very proud of.) Over the summer, I have an internship near her so that we can be in the same place and spend time together. This is something I deliberately chose, and I ignored applying for some other internships in order to be near her. I didn't mind too much ignoring some internships, because I still don't know what I want to do and none of these were dream internships.

Recently, I brought up a conversation I'd had about a young couple who were doing distance because they were both starting their careers in separate locations and didn't want to detract from each other's life paths. To me, this seemed reasonable, as jumping into one's career straight out of university (especially if you're receiving a good offer) is pretty important, especially since it's difficult to explain any types of employment gaps. This is also something that has the potential of happening. (Mind you, I don't know exactly what path I want to follow, but I was thinking about this with the context of I'd know then and might have an opportunity that lead me away from her.)

The fact that I was telling her about the couple with this seeming to be a potential possibility for our future upset her, because she didn't want to do any more distance after college and felt like I was choosing my career over her and that she wasn't a priority. She asked if I would even consider spending time living with her for a year or so after college and then switching to another job that I might like more (which, I'm pretty sure, is not good in the industry). This threw me, as it made me feel like she was giving me an ultimatum on our relationship and that I had to prioritize her over my career. When we were talking, I said I would consider it, but later I thought about how there is also the hypothetical case where that would be a bad move.

She said part of the reason she was hurt was becuase she made sacrifices with her work, like taking the time to come visit me and keeping days open so that she could visit me, and that it hurt her to think that I might not make the same sacrifices later. All this time, I've said I felt bad about the fact that she drives so much to see me, but she says it's for her good too so it's not like it's just for me. And it wasn't framed as a sacrifice before, so now I feel like it's being belatedly framed as that. I think it's valid for her to be upset, but I feel like she wasn't clear about these expectations beforehand.

She also thinks that this means I feel like she might be weighing her down. I told her that I don't, because she's thought this about a lot of things -- being in a relationship with her long-distance instead of living the normal college lifestyle, hooking up with people whenever I wanted to, and all that. She's very strictly monogamous and I'm fine with that right now, but before her I liked the idea of having an open relationship in order to really figure out myself and experience a lot of things/people, but now I don't know how I feel. I'm worried that I DO feel likes she's weighing me down, but this is not something I'd want to tell her because it's one of her insecurities and it would lead to us breaking up. 

Again, I really don't know what I want long term. She's a wonderful person who makes me really happy, but this is my first relationship and I had basically sworn off the idea of love in my life plan before this, and she also found me when I was in a bit of a dark time, so I keep questioning if it's real and if I'm just fooling myself and her and leading her on -- because sometimes she makes me feel like that's what I'm doing, even though I would never want to do such a thing.

She asks me some about what I want from her, and where I see our future going. I feel like I'm not ready to make these decisions/commitments. I definitely see snippets of our future sometimes when I get the time to daydream (which I don't have much time to do), and sometimes I think about what we'd wear getting married or how it would be to raise kids together. I don't know if this is a normal fantasy or if it's a sign of something greater, and I'm just afraid of commitment.

The problem with all this is that she seems to know what she wants because she is in the place in her life where she is thinking about her job and her future and me being a significant portion of her life. I'm certain she wants to marry me when I'm out of university but forever is a big commitment and I feel like I don't know enough to be sure about it. She is also such an important person in my life I feel like I currently don't have the frame of mind to think about things like she is, since I am also trying to figure out what I want in life in general and how to exist as a person. 

I am also worried we are fostering a codependent relationship in an unhealthy way, because I have been in one of those before but in a different context, but I also don't know what a healthy relationship looks like. She wants me to tell her a lot of what I am doing and be the first one I tell things (which she generally is, but she gets insecure if she's not and there are some things she just cannot relate to). I said something about wanting to figure out how to exist as an individual, and she said why not do that while sharing a life together? She already seems to feel that what's mine is hers is mine. But: what does a codependent relationship look like? what's a healthy amount of codependency, but what goes too far? How much can she expect me to commit to?

And the question I don't want to ask - if I'm still spending so much time just figuring it out, would it be better for her if I broke up with her? I don't want to do that because it would upset her and me so much, and I would be devastated to lose her both as a partner and friend.

I'm sorry that this is all over the place. I don't have anyone to talk to about this and think it out with.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My long-distance, slightly older girlfriend is thinking about the future and and asking me big questions about priorities and plans, but I don't know how to respond, how to think about them, or how to proceed. Can you give me advice on this relationship? Is it unhealthy? How do I know if it's unhealthily codependent?"
81p3au,37,2018-03-03,Fired from another job today - finally coming to accept maybe I can't run from autism,ThomasHobbesROK,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/81p3au/fired_from_another_job_today_finally_coming_to/,"Might need some help here Reddit.

So I'm 24. Last year, after finally finishing uni. I spent months fulfilling a years long dream to travel and work overseas. I applied for a job teaching English in Shenzhen, China (for EF English First - one of the largest companies that does this).

Today I'm about 6 weeks in and was informed that I was going to be dismissed (finish on Monday - 2 days away). I'm writing this still sitting here in the office surrounded by oblivious co-workers as I have to stay a few more hours...To me, it was completely out of the blue with no warning, though I really blame myself for not 'meeting the expectations' of the job.

My whole plan for this year has been derailed (and this was after last year was largely derailed as well - there was an 8 month gap between finishing uni and getting my graduate certificate which I needed to get this job - completely unforeseen by me).

The thing is there's starting to be a trend. Last year I worked at a school back in Australia and was fired there after 7 weeks (almost the exact same period?) for similar reasons of failing to perform adequately/navigate the workplace environment. 

Before that, I actually failed the CELTA the first time through. Again, I thought I was doing ok, then in the final week they took me aside and informed me I just hadn't met the requirements (had failed a couple of lessons) so I had to withdraw and do it again the next month (and blew another $3k on it - but at least I passed this time).

Before THAT - well I did ok in uni overall. Had to repeat a few subjects (but 2 out of 40 seems pretty normal) and actually ended up getting honors for law (I did double degree - law/arts). 

High School though much the same thing happened at least once. I was in the army cadets for 4 years (may not sound that important but was a big part of my life then) and during this big promotions course one summer I might have imploded a bit under the pressure and was the only one (out of about 10) not promoted - a bitter failure at this point in my life. I suspected at the time that the moment I set foot out of an academic-type environment I would implode again, and now seem to have repeated confirmations of that hypothesis :(

The patterns are consistent - and reading online about other people it seems to match up perfectly. At first things are ok, I have the rough scripts in my head of how conversations are meant to go, how to be (or at least 'imitate' being) friendly and get on with the job, prioritizing what I think are the important parts (I have never been close to late for an actual lesson for instance). 

But after a few weeks the little things begin to add up. The boss listed about a dozen things - including (what I thought was) mild lateness. I realized this was a problem but to me it seemed minor. It didn't make sense to me that I had to turn up at 9am when my first lesson was at 10:30. I came in at 9:10 this morning (and then sat around doing nothing for an hour as I had prepared for the lesson the day before) and apparently as this has happened at least twice now, it was a big strike against me. He listed other things that were much the same - boxes we're meant to tick but not directly related to teaching lessons (which I feel I have worked hard on and performed quite well given I'm a new teacher).

The longest job I've held down (by far) was delivering pizzas part-time during uni. In hindsight I rather enjoyed that job, and I think it fit well with my personality. It was mostly solitary, in the evenings (I have always had problems with sleeping and getting up early), I like driving and interactions with customers were generally short and scripted - after a while I could handle them easily.

So I know I can hold down a menial/solitary-type job (even if it was boring after a while) and I'm sure I can perform as a teacher or in other roles (I did a 4-month law internship at uni I quite enjoyed, also worked for the electoral commission for a bit counting ballots for a local election) but navigating the workplace environment, and prioritizing what really matters and what doesn't, really escapes me. A hundred little social interactions just drain me after a while, as well as the dozens of little things which don't make much inherent sense but we're meant to do anyway?

I basically know what my problem is, but am at a loss now how to fix it. People are completely blank to me, they might as well be wearing masks. Maybe there were some hints of things I was doing wrong, but if the critique is not direct I will not pick up on it (and generally people are far too polite and will not be too direct in their criticism - which actually drives me insane as I have no idea at what level I'm performing until suddenly the shoe drops and I'm fired)

I was diagnosed with autism by a doctor at 22, and although I have tried really hard to overcome it (hell if you look at my history, a lot of my posts are even in r/theredpill. The only thing I'm worse at then holding down a full time office-type job is relationships - half the reason I came to Asia. I never even went out with a girl until I was in my 20s. I've actually dated half a dozen girls by this point via Tinder - more than the past 5 years in Australia and my only real success story here so far...At least I can fall back on being a 6'1"" gym-dwelling white guy...)

But I'm starting to accept that, even with years of dedicated efforts to be more social, I can't quite escape this diagnosis. The plan was to teach English for a year, maybe travel a bit, then go back to Australia and do practical legal training and work as a lawyer, but I've even more serious doubts about this path now. I suspect that, even if by some miracle I land a job (there's way too many graduates these days) I'm only going to last a few months before I slip up and inevitably get fired, then the same cycle will begin anew. 

Hell it was probably a mistake to do law in the first place, as it is inevitably a field with a lot of social pressure. Maybe I should have just done something science-related where I could end up in some solitary research position, even if the job is not as well paying/prestigious. Again, I'm an idiot (and may have been bowing to family pressure - my dad was a barrister).

So I'm at a bit of a loss now. I'm here in China, with my year-long visa just sorted out (got my passport back like 3 days ago), a 12 month apartment contract I can't break without losing a $1200 bond, two parents back in Australia I'll eventually have to break this news to (they're very supporting and loving but, god bless them, have always utterly dismissed any talk of autism and insist I'm going to establish a real career) and the freshly dawning realization I might always fundamentally struggle with any job more socially intense than pizza delivery boy.

Academically I know I can do very well (though distractions are a problem). At age 7 my IQ was professionally tested and scored 134. I have done some creative things (I write scifi articles for a magazine here in Australia for $40 apiece - but can only submit a few a year) and still dream of being a scifi author of some kind. Maybe I can achieve success in more solitary-type jobs (including writing) but the office/corporate environment just seems too hostile to me, so I'm starting to lose faith in it all :(

My boss at least said I have the options of applying for other schools here in Shenzhen (and there are lots of them - Wall Street English/Gold Star Teachers/a university or other school) but I suspect even if I go to all the trouble of applying, I'll face the same issues after a few weeks.

I could sign up to do tutoring locally (there are websites online I've checked out) which would at least allow me to pick my hours and hopefully make enough money to pay the rent and maybe even save up this year like I intended (goal was to save at least $10k which I was on track for). 

Other options would be either to leave China and just travel elsewhere (maybe backpack through SEA for a few months?) or turn tail and head back to Australia. I want to travel more, but losing the $1200 bond seems reason enough to stick this out somehow. Besides, China is honestly fascinating. 

Already I think tutoring might be the best option. I've seen people saying they were getting 300RMB/hr ($60AUD or so). 12 hours a week and I'd already be making the current salary. I just hope there aren't legal issues (with visa/tax etc.) if that's my only occupation here, EF was at least good with handling these things since I arrived.

Anyway, thanks for the confessional internet, open to advice."

&amp;nbsp;

Been thinking on this trip for years and finally planning it for the last few months. 


&amp;nbsp;

24M - First time traveller - Backpacking/Hitchhiking 6,000+ Kilometers from *Singapore* to *Hanoi*, *Vietnam* over roughly 4 months.



&amp;nbsp;


I'm incredibly excited as I have never been outside of *New Zealand/Australia* and have only done trips between *Brisbane* - *Sydney* - *Melbourne* and so on with some bush camping interspersed in these little trips.


&amp;nbsp;


**20^th April to Early-September**

&amp;nbsp;

Mid-April I will be flying to *Auckland*, *NZ* to visit family for a week, then flying back to the *Gold Coast*, *Brisbane*. Having a night layover at a friends place and then the 8^hr flight straight on to *Singapore*.



&amp;nbsp;

* **Singapore**: 2/3 Days -&gt; Definitely visiting the **""Gardens By The Bay""**




* **Malaysia**: 1/2 Weeks (Visiting friends of a friend, Cameron Highlands/Taman Negara, Langkawi) Malaysian BFF was originally planning on coming with me and fattening me up here but alas, Uni internships have stolen him from me -&gt;



* **Thailand** -&gt; ? No plan, just enjoy travelling through, seeing sites, eating food, staying in hostels and just generally going with the flow :)


* **Cambodia** -&gt; Similarly no plan, pop into Phnom Penh and see what people are planning in Hostels and maybe tag along.


* **Vietnam** -&gt; ? Same thing again, except this time I'll head up the coast (I'm also taking a Hammock, so heaps of beach naps)


* **Laos** -&gt; Vinh, Vietnam to Vientiane up to Luang Prabang then up to Hanoi. 

* **Vietnam** -&gt; Now we're at Hanoi! We survived! The major part of the trip done, hopefully by this point it'll be reasonably close to September and the start of Uni in Shanghai.


&amp;nbsp;

                                  **And now that it's September!**

&amp;nbsp;


I plan to spend a year studying Mandarin at Uni and seeing what China has to offer as my final destination!

And at this point it's most likely train to Hong Kong for a few days and visit some friends. And seeing how time permits I'll have to get to Shanghai for the beginning of the semester.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm in my last year of college, doing my internship at a mobile dev company. My project consist of making a digital receptionist app in react native. I don't have any experience in react-native so i'm doing 2 weeks analysis first.

Some functionalities i need in my app: 

- overview of meetings (list)
- Live chat
- push notifications
- map of location to put custom markers on
- integration with firebase
- geofencing

So i've been looking around how to implement these things. And most seem pretty well documented , but map of location with groundplan and markers.
I'd like to be able to show a groundplan of the company area (it is pretty big with 20+ building). So when the visitors open the map on that spot, it show a sort of ground plan, with markings where each building and hotspots are etc. And it should be possible to put custom markers on this map.

I've looked at mapbox, react-native map and google map.
But i don't find much info on what is within the limit of each.

It'd be even more perfect if the one i use for the groundplan would also give the possibility to use Geofencing.

Leave a message if you have any insight what would be best to use, or how this is done. "

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

81rjt7,2,2018-03-03,IJW: Call Me By Your Name (2017),CulturalHater,Ijustwatched,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/81rjt7/ijw_call_me_by_your_name_2017/,"**Luca Guadagnino has directed a film that perfectly matches the tastes of modern indie moviegoers.**

Elio (Timothee Chalamet) stays for the summer with his parents in a charming Italian town. Each year, his father (Michael Stuhlbarg) invites a student for an internship to help out in a study. When newly chosen student Oliver (Armie Hammer) arrives, Elio becomes fascinated with him in a more than just-a-friend manner.

Homosexualism in cinema has been mostly portrayed within the frame of social intolerance, where the temptation needed to be covered by a cape of an everyday routine. This is what happened in Ang Lee’s “The Brokeback Mountain”, Todd Haynes’ “Carol” and most recently – Barry Jenkins’ Oscar-winning “Moonlight”. Considering such approach, Guadagnino’s idea to adapt a book that rids its protagonists of such social burden is not only refreshing, but mostly bold.

However, the Italian director did not predict that disposing of such background can also simply lead to a less emotionally engaging film. It omits the cliches related to social lack of tolerance and breaking the taboo, but at the cost of dynamics resulting from such background. The family of Elio is perfectly understanding (which derives from its multi-nationality) and the only real limitations are the intensifying teases between Elio and Oliver. Whilst both pretend on the outside to be interested in women, they look for signs in each other’s behavior as to obtain proof of interest. It’s a kind of masochistic game that the viewer was supposed to follow with flushed cheeks.

Albeit it certainly avoids the homosexual-themed cliches, “Call Me By Your Name” plays the exact same chords as many other romances – better or worse than Guadagnino’s effort. The blossoming mutual entanglement of Elio and Oliver follows the most obvious path that it possibly could have followed. It begs for bringing up “Carol” again, as Haynes’ film suffered from the same kind of melancholic dysfunction. Whilst “Call Me By Your Name” is played on a more cheerful and light note, Guadagnino can mostly charm with anything but the story. Even when the director tried to be adroit with the symbolism of a sculpture – strongly reminiscing the cherubic Elio – it did ring a bell (just take a look at the party scene from Xavier Dolan’s “Heartbeats”).

On the bright side, The Italian filmmaker proves to be a gifted visual artist. The camera work is very smooth and intelligent – it never becomes a character of the film, as it often happens in the Instagram era of filmmaking. It remains a tool to tell the story, just like the cunningly used soundtrack, which often breaks the silence gently or emphasizes the butterflies-in-the-stomach atmosphere with a Sufjan Stevens’ delicate voice. The acting is also more than solid, with Michael Stuhlbarg stealing the show in the climax scene and two equally polished performances from Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet.

Luca Guadagnino’s film is neither a disappointment, nor a masterpiece. At times, it reminds a bit of “American Honey” – a kind of love story that we all know, but buy it nevertheless. It tried to take a different angle on a concept of a romance, but sadly, most of the film’s charm is not relying on the plot or its meaning.

81rtla,7,2018-03-03,0 Big Four Interviews,mikescott9909,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/81rtla/0_big_four_interviews/,"Hey all, 

I'm a senior accounting and management information systems double major at a private university in Texas. I just went through recruiting and was a little disappointed to get the news that I did not receive any interviews with the Big 4. 

Now, I know the reason that I didn't get the interviews...my overall GPA is a 2.97 and major is a 3.10.  The majority of accounting students at my school have way above 3.0's. So of course the firms are going to rather have someone with above a 3.0 than below. As a senior there is not much I can do to change my gpa, so that's just something I have to deal with. I also probably didn't network as best as I could have during the process. 

Either way, that's in the past and there is nothing I can do about it now. I did receive two interviews with mid-range firms in Dallas, which is where I want to end up residing in the future.  

 I switched into a double major of MIS because I enjoy the IT side of business a little better. I also realized that I wasn't as excited as my peers to do 55+ hours of accounting work a week. From my overall experience it seems like the Big 4 is kind of like a sweatshop where you have a super small chance at making parter.  I understand that most don't make partner and go on to work for their clients in an accounting role, my father did the same thing.

I guess my question here is more for career advice. Depending on how these interviews go, I will  have to make a decision to either; 
1: take an internship at a mid range firm and postpone grad school or, 
2: skip the internship and go straight into grad school for maybe an MSIS degree ( I also haven't completely ruled out trying for a CPA ) or, 
3: say fuck it and move to Bozeman Montana to live a simple life doing accounting work for a small company while I fish, ski, and climb on the weekends and holidays. ( my dream ) 

What do y'all think? Have any of you been in my position? Is there any advice you would give me as I move forward? 

Thanks!

Me reading Mineta's one-liner: ""haha, yeah Mineta would say that. Not sure I care for that kind of introduction, though""

Subreddit: ""Literally die in a fire""

Never before have I seen the anti-Mineta this reflexive, all from one line in one panel! I mean, it's not like Mineta made any actions. He literally stood there and said his one-liner. It would be perfect if he was looking directly at the reader and smirking, knowing some veins would pop. 

Never before have I thought that this subreddit behaved so much like ants in a colony until now. The amount of aka-chans in the discussion thread upvoting ""Mineta should die"" was shocking. (In Japanese, aka-chan means ""baby"", due to babies turning red in the face when they cry.) Never before have I thought this subreddit was irrational, until now. I actually saw a post that took Mineta's line ""I'm looking forward to seeing you in 10 years"", used the cogs in his/her brain, and reasoned it to imply ""I'm gonna bang you non-consentually in 10 years"". Can you believe this?

&gt;inb4 ""Freakenstein condones child perversion and sexual harrassment

At the time of writing this, 12:50 on 3/2/18 (I have to wait a day to post independent spoiler threads), there are *1801* upvotes in favor of ""Mineta is a piece of shit"", ""Mineta should die"", ""Mineta being compared to Donald Trump"", ""Mineta should be removed from the anime"", and ""Horikoshi is setting up Mineta to be bad so that it would finally be a good character to die"". I did not count any upvotes from comments that were reasonable, such as ""Mineta saying that was inappropriate for a first introduction"". There was also a comment chain that had over 56 replies, so I skipped over that.

People on this subreddit keep saying Mineta fails as a comedic hero and they would like to see comedy from Mineta, so it would obviously show up in the discussion thread with aplomb if he was really funny like last week, right? Let's check. The thread was on the 23rd of February, so obviously an older thread would accrue more upvotes, and we have to keep in mind multiple upvotes can come from one user. There are *900* upvotes praising Mineta's fourth wall break, while there are *1911* upvotes enjoying Mineta's suffering. In short, while there are some upvotes that were like ""YES! Comedy gold!"" others are like ""Mineta's suffering is my sustenance, he deserves it"". In other words, quite a bit of bias we have here, with just a dash of hypocrisy a week later. 

I'm not going into detail as to how and why this subreddit is irrational towards Mineta; I've already done so with my first thread (which was a hoot might I add! The thread had people successfully persuaded, while others buried their heads in the sand). I just want to explain how hilarious it is, yet alarming how people throw temper tantrums over a joke character, which is thus: You are angry. Over a joke character. So much so that harmless dialogue makes you livid, and times where Mineta shines are ignored or converted into more Mineta punchee bag. SMH.

&gt;inb4 ""Mineta has no redeeming qualities""

I hate to compare this subreddit to Tumblr right now, but Chapter 173 was truly an example of Triggering for these people. Relax. Going off my first thread, it's evident that the same people who bash Mineta give a pass to Meliodas, Jiraiya, and Muten Roshi. Perverts, yes. Old perverts, oh yes. Ah, but Mineta is not a key character and isn't cool looking, so we get to bash him! 

&gt;inb4 ""actually, you're more triggered than us because you made this thread""

For the manga speedreaders in the subreddit, Mineta was out of the loop when it came to the Yakuza raid. So obviously he had no idea what went down, other than Eri was recovered from the HQ, someone died, and the interns had a hard time. So the comments basing their Mineta hate this chapter on Eri's misfortunes should spend a little more time reading from now on. Meanwhile, some artists went ahead and drew MirioXEri (current Eri) ecchi, while canon Mineta is like ""nah brah, I'll wait til you're older because I'm not about that"". This subreddit posts art all the time, so quite a few people must know about this; I wonder where the diffusion of anger went to? Anybody go after *that*? No?

I want Horikoshi to make Mineta Gaiden just so all the aka-chans in the subreddit have a cow (and then Mineta milks the cow because he breaks 4th walls).

tl;dr Mineta makes a Mineta-like one-liner introduction to Eri, subreddit lays eggs and clucks. Wake me when Mineta actually is perverted again, like the Summer Camp arc. This exact behavior is how Twitter vultures swarm creative MHA artists and cry until companies destroy their works.

Specific, short, and to the point.  The other day as I was wrapping up at work I fired up the app and saw that a reasonable-looking 25yr old had sent me a pic and an offer.  Since I have found myself short of male partners of late, I eagerly responded...  And found out that this guy lives maybe 5 minutes from the office. Score!

So I went down the road, knocked on the door, and there he was.  I was here for exactly one reason; so inside of a minute, I was on my knees, and deepthroating him.  The cock was a little smaller than reported (they always are) so it was not difficult at all.  I lost myself in the sensations, just worshipping this cock, alternating between long slow moves and rapid sucking and shoving him down my throat.  After not too long, I felt him start to pulse, so I locked my lips around his dick and just sucked it all down.  Mmmmm... Nice.  

So then I stood up and looked around as he pulled up his pants.  And I notice that he's... Maybe a little younger than 25.  Not a whole lot, but a little...

And he's got a very nice mousepad.  

With my company logo on it.

The mousepad we give away to our interns.

...shit.

At least our intern program has a 21yr old age requirement....

Now I gotta make sure that I have minimal contact with the intern group the rest of this semester."

Where have alumni found employment with that degree?
Are there internship opportunities in the area?

81tmmn,8,2018-03-03,I regret being a cynical leftist asshole in college and missing out on the joy of being more involved (long),regretti_spaghetti34,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/81tmmn/i_regret_being_a_cynical_leftist_asshole_in/,"I'm writing this in an empty lecture hall the day of a university-wide day where kids and high schoolers can come and tour campus. I didn't mean to be here except that I have homework due that requires me to be physically close to the class network. So, I ended up here on the worst possible day to try to do my homework in peace. 

I’m writing this after everyone has left the room for a modern web applications mini-lecture hosted by volunteer students from my department- my classmates in computer science. Seeing the handful of kids who genuinely seemed to be interested and passionate into going into CS and the enthusiasm and joy for computer science that the presenters had gave me this uneasy, horrible feeling that needs to be expressed. 

I regret not taking fuller advantage of the opportunities I had here. I’m in my final semester as a computer science undergrad in one of the country’s top cs departments and am starting to reflect in horror on how I wasted the privilege of being here. 

Why? Cynicism. I was cynical about the clean, gleaming halls of the building filled with upper-middle class students who seemingly were as informed as the average South Park fan. I felt that my personality didn’t “click”. Most people were woefuly socially unaware of apartheid, the history of racism, injustice, and the such. Even those who earnestly were oriented towards social justice, like the womens’ organization or various ethnic groups seemed just so **backwards**, like someone who had just discovered social justice tumblr for the first time. Not “sophisticated” enough. Their takes weren’t hot enough, deep enough, literary and revolutionary and “real” enough. Nobody seemed to reflect on the evils of diving headfirst into lulls of making six figures while contributing to gentrification and inequality, meanwhile voting for ineffective “democratic” politicians like some kind of bought moron. Implicitly, to me, everyone was a sheep and just disappointed me. As a result, I shied away from involvement in computer science organizations and events. 

I don’t regret all of my decisions at university. Joining the radio station, finding my local LGBT friend group, and taking up skateboarding have all been some of the best decisions I made to enrich my life and make me happier. But if I had to change one thing, it would be to have stopped myself from joining one particular radical leftist group on campus. After Trump’s election, I felt a stirring within me more powerful and angry and full of despair and resolve than I had ever felt before. So, I joined the most radical, revolutionary group that I could. After a series of major personal events that utterly shattered my faith in not just the group but in my political worldviews as a whole, I look back with some regret. 

This is not to say that I’m a libertarian or right winger now. I’m still a leftist of some sort, but probably just a lost or more “centrist” one. If anyone reading this recognizes who I am, they may accuse me of being a revisionist or having gone “liberal”. Well, it’s just them and their tiny, ineffective, hypocritical, insulated community(s). I am, for now, putting my pride away and walking amongst the “general” masses of progressive people who are opening up their views a bit more. I wish I had done this earlier and stopped viewing my classmates as uneducated, hopeless nerdbros the equivalent of frat dudes in technology and the cock-suckers of Elon Musk. I wish I just had more good faith in people. I was so utterly caught in my own whirlpool of despair and cynicism that it made me become depressed and despondent on and off throughout college, when I was already depressed since high school! Worse, it made me blind to the humanity of the individuals in my classes. Although some really were 21-year-olds who still watched South Park, most people had nuance and complexity and interestingness that I didn’t see because I painted them all as techbros. I refused to connect with my classmates.

I wish I engaged more with my professors and classmates and made more techie friends. I wish I got involved in organizations and stuck with them. I wish I got cool internships, job offers, got to go to hackathons, events, and just really get back into that almost childlike, fresh joy of just loving computers and programming like when I was as old as the kids walking around as I type this. I wish I had group of friends I could just code with and play video games with. I wish that I could feel good and have fun about the future and finding jobs and learning new technologies and tools and concepts and show off personal projects or just to engage in the community more, as toxic as it can be sometimes. 
 
I’m tired of trying to be as right as possible. Although the past me would be horrified, I’m thinking about owning land/real estate or even a company when I’m a bit older. I’ve already got a tiny stock portfolio. If there’s any way to really do right in this world, to do real, true, compassionate, and radical RIGHT, it’s not going to be with a bunch of bickering college communists. It won’t be through the corporate tech world either, but at least I’ll be happier and be able to support my mom better.

We are both young students who do not depend on money from our parents. While our stipend from our university is enough to cover basic expenses, I found an internship that gives me some extra income, and although he worked for one year he seems to have no savings left over. 
While I do know he loves me and tries to make me happy, I feel bitter every time I have to cancel plans to accommodate his lack of money. Every time we make some plans that involves a little more money that we are used to spending, I have to spend for both of us. Sometimes I feel he is also intellectually inadequate for me to have a stimulating discussion with him. Often, he fails to understand my sarcasm or puns.
I know that he tries to make me happy, but I find myself unhappy more often. But we have been together for about two years and he has always been there for me in my emotionally stressful times. He is a nice person who loves me and I do not want to hurt him, neither am I sure about losing a caring loving person from my life. 
Yet, I feel bitter and unsatisfied with him on various levels.

During my bachelor I’ve worked very hard, trying to build a great cv: I’ve opened a startup, done two internship, went abroad for an exchange semester.. but I’ve always wanted to go out with my friends, partying and stuff, always trying to know new people.

I’ve always liked to party, I had the time of my life during high school: I was always appreciated by other people, in fact I’ve dated few guys, but never had a relationship, while all of my friends had one. 
When I’ve started college I though that I could have known someone during those three years, the exchange and so on.. but no, nothing, nada. 
I’ve never had a date, never. I had few one night stands and I was totally ok with them, but no dates. 
Now it’s not high school anymore, not uni, it’s just me, working 12h a day and trying to don’t give up on the possibility to be appreciated by someone.

I’m seriously wondering what’s wrong with me. Cause now I just think its about me, even if all my friends say that I’m just unlucky. 
Everyone says I’m extremely smart, that I’m beautiful, that I always think about other people, that I’m generous and careful.. but I never get the chance to have a date with someone. 
And yes, I’ve asked few guys out.. of course you know the answer was no.

What should I do? Any suggestions? Someone in the same situation?

My medication has allowed me to build stable relationships, get good grades again, hold down an internship and part time job, and start my job search for when I graduate in a few months. While there are hiccups, I am grateful for the progress I’ve made. I’ve even been able to get back to the weight I was before my psychotic break (have always struggled with eating but my weight fluctuates extreme amounts and then just steadily gained. This is a big deal to me because I’ve always had eating disorder issues in correlation with my moods and never been able to simply eat the right amount every day and get a moderate amount of excercise. I feel totally okay most of the time, and ignore the brain fog. 

But then, depression starts to creep in again. I can usually tolerate it unless I’m going through more stress than normal. It just builds and builds until I’m taking naps in my car because I can’t handle actually going out for a lunch break. Avoiding and becoming suspicious of people, and not eating. 

I recently had a suicidal episode that was worse than others I’ve had, and the questions that came with it haven’t totally left me. Thanks to being able to sleep at my boyfriends and him being a super understanding and nice human I didn’t act, but it left me with questions for people who may have dealt with this longer than me. 

A few of my questions:

Main Q: How do I convince myself that being bipolar is worth enduring for the rest of my natural life?

If I don’t kill myself now, I will continue forming meaningful friendships, get married, have children, and have a true responsibility to others. As much I want this lifestyle, how can I do it in good conscious knowing I’ll most likely kill myself in the future and hurt them?

Once I kill myself I don’t even get the satisfaction of being free of this. So what’s the point of doing it... where is relief?

Must I accept that I will have to take medications my whole life in order to live the normal life I want? 

Knowing the diagnosis sometimes seems to be an issue. How do I let go of these labels?

Thank you to anyone who has input on this. And for reading it haha. The turbulence of moods is just so horrible and terrible and I hate it. Any comfort is more than welcome, or any brutal honesty as well.

81w9iu,55,2018-03-04,As a recent undergrad in 2016... here's some advice to prep yourself for the college afterlife,seancd,CSULB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSULB/comments/81w9iu/as_a_recent_undergrad_in_2016_heres_some_advice/,"I've been searching for a new job and learned a few things I wish someone told me while I was in college. Aside from the fact that I miss being in school so much, you need to certainly prepare for life after college once you reach your upper division courses. Getting out there and finding a new job after college is a huge rollercoaster in itself that will take a toll on you, so preparing for failure/rejection will be very key to your your success. This advice might sound like a broken record you've heard before, but YES, this is what you need to do to succeed.

Searching for a job is not an easy task. Frankly, job hunting is a job in itself. However, the most important thing is to always give each and every opportunity your undivided attention. You are competing with perhaps hundreds of applicants for every job you are applying for, so you need to play your A-game. Every application should be carefully crafted as if it were your last.This brings me to my next point. Applying for new jobs is exhausting, so it's okay to be selective! 

LinkedIn premium $30/month is worth every penny. Directly contacting recruiters for these jobs will give you access to the people who are responsible for carefully crafting that dream team of a company you are looking to apply for. They're the gate keepers who are hungry for fresh talent that fits the company's culture.

Look at your prospective company's culture. What do the former and existing employees think about the company? Is there a good amount of growth to move up? I found Glassdoor to be invaluable in deciding which company to apply for. Do you value you value work-from-home and unlimited vacation time(proceed with caution) over a bigger salary? Working for a company is a mutually symbiotic relationship, so make sure you feel that position is going to benefit you as much as it is for them. 

You'll face rejection many times over for so many different reasons without notice. Failure is perhaps the one aspect we're not trained to cope with at school, but just remember that many of these no's will eventually turn into a yes.  However, be reminded to learn from the no's and adjust your approach for the next employer accordingly. Make sure to think about how you will make your prospects say yes. 

The Career Center is an extremely effective way to prepare for your departure from CSULB. One of the more important things you should take a look at is your resume. This will be the quintessential piece of paper that your employer will look at, so every single word counts. A good friend of mine revived my resume from what was a piece of trash to a sheet of gold. Please take some time to get your resume doctored by the resume-reviewers at the Career Center. You certainly need feedback from someone who looks at resumes for a living.

Make sure your professors know who you are, specifically those with industry experience, as they will be amazing references for your employers. Get to know them by dropping in on office hours. You certainly don't have to be the smartest person in the class, but if they know that you care about your grades, which is essentially their class, they will most likely help you along the way with career advice and possibly become a reference for previous contacts that they may have in the industry. It's happened to me, and getting vouched by a veteran of the game is a HUGE step above applying to a company with no contacts. 

Get involved in club organizations, because how else will the employer know that you're well-rounded in a sea of recent graduates? It's a great way to meet students within your major, who may also possibly give you a leg up in the hiring process within their company once you all spread out from graduation. Again, the concept of connections is a major consideration for employers. If they said yes to your connection, they'll be more inclined to say yes to you. Be reminded that your connections are sticking their neck out for you, so by any means, please don't make them look bad.


INTERNSHIPS!!! This is is an absolute must for everyone reading this. Obtaining professional experience while in college is extremely beneficial for your future prospects. Many of these internships are offered to students only, so take advantage of them while you can. Having a solid work history related to your major before graduation will pay off immensely. Preferably take these during the summer, so you know what it really feels like to work 40 hours full-time in your field. Fit these internship courses into your schedule as much and as many times as you can before graduating. Why not work and get paid in a job that you're studying for?

You might have the perception that everything you're studying in college will be thrown out the window once you graduate. I can't say that's not true, but more importantly you need to think about how college made you think more critically, or how it made you evolve. Are you more inclined to work in teams? How well can you work under pressure? Are you more proficient in time management than before? There's a multitude of skills you've picked up under the surface, which contributed to writing those papers and studying for exams. Just like everything else in life, your college education is what you make of it. 

That's pretty much it. I just wanted to pay it forward by offering some advice, since I'm looking for a new job myself. These are some of the things that I took advantage of while in college, and thought this might help a bit.  CSULB is a great school, but it won't help you land a great job just by going to class. ***Go that extra mile by taking advantage of these opportunities, since you're paying for it already!***


I wish you all good luck.

* If you are a current student, what would you rate the program on a scale of 1 (shitty) to 10 (amazing)? What are the pros and cons?

I'm just a curious student. With decisions coming day after tomorrow, I am just really excited.


Also, I made this post a few days back: https://redd.it/7yv800 and the person who commented said that Virginia Tech mainly has in-state students. Not that it matters or anything (in fact, your answer to this question won't affect whether I decide to attend or not), but what percent of students at VT are in-state vs OOS? How many are from the East Coast vs the rest of the US (esp. West Coast) and International applicants?

Just genuinely curious, and I am more than ready to study with a bunch of Virginians if I get accepted (which I hope I do!) and decide to become a Hokie.

I have concerns... need advice,samm_eng,MechanicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/81wkl4/meeting_with_head_manager_of_a_company_i_did_an/,"I am graduating in May 2018 as a Mechanical Engineer (yay!). I did an internship last summer in a mid-size company in another state and I did well. I worked close to other engineers and I was mentored closely by a engineer who became a good friend. I have a good relationship with the head manager (even tho he is pretty busy, so we didn't talk as much) and I got to meet the owner of the company. Anyway, I contacted the head manager asking o apply for a full-time position there. He sent me a email back asking when I could come to visit them to talk. I have a meeting with him in two weeks. Right now this is my only solid lead to a full-time job...

My concern: When I came to school after the summer, my supervisor wrote me a senior project proposal (which he invested some time doing), however due to the division of senior projects at school and the fact I didn't want to do a project by myself (I was kind of scared...) I was not able to do their senior project proposed. I did another one, which was proposed by my professor. I sent a text to my supervisor and explained. Before I left, some engineers at the company were kind of excited with what I would come up with the project. So now, I am kind of going back there empty handed... I sent a text to my supervisor and he told me to take time and come up with at least a some solid ideas about their project so I can impress the head manager, which I am trying to find time to do it among school and my other senior project(I will do it in these next two weeks)

Also, my GPA is not great. 2.7. I tried to improve in this last year but it didn't work out well... but my head manager already knew that even tho I think he expected I would raise it to a 3.0 or so

I would like some advice in how to approach this meeting with my head manager. How to reassure him, I would be the best fit for the company. I did work really hard over the summer, sometimes 50 hours a week (I was getting paid for that extra effort tho).

Thank you!"

81zyu9,3,2018-03-04,I [21M] have wanted to split with [22F] for a couple months. I'm tired of feeling like a phony but I'm stuck.,campfiresquaredance,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/81zyu9/i_21m_have_wanted_to_split_with_22f_for_a_couple/,"*throwaway account*

My girlfriend and I are in the same year in school, live together with another roommate [25M], and have been together for 2.5 years. I still care about her deeply; she is beautiful and very kind and sweet, but I'm afraid we are fundamentally different and do not have a sustainable future together. 

We've known each other for nearly 10 years now. We went to high school together, ended up at the same university, and, without going into too much detail, have been involved with a lot of the same activities over the years. Needless to say, we have a tremendous amount of history and a wide range of experiences with each other, much more so than a lot of other couples we know. At this point, our lives are so intimately intertwined and integrated that it makes this whole process that much more difficult. She moved in with me and my roommate a year and a half ago out of necessity, after a different plan of hers fell through with a friend. She is set to graduate in May, but I am taking an additional year to complete an internship. 

I began having doubts after a weekend of bad weather a couple months ago that caused us to be stuck inside for a few days. I had a sudden realization that we weren't the right fit for each other. Thinking back to before this epiphany, I feel that I was in denial of our problems. She would always tell me, ""If you love someone, you make it work,"" and I believed that. A wave of clarity came crashing into my awareness that weekend and it was very overwhelming. She picked up on my anxiety and I have forced myself to lie about how I feel ever since. 

She is very insecure, emotionally sensitive, and needs a lot of validation. I have tried my best to accommodate her during our time together, but I don't want to any longer. She's very affectionate and sweet, sometimes too much to the point where it's obtrusive and a hindrance. I had a period of intense anxiety and emptiness after my mother's suicide a year and a half ago and my girlfriend's love and affection was vital to my grieving process. Since then, I've grown tremendously, learned to manage my anxiety, become more independent, etc. I feel that I've outgrown the person I used to be and the sheer amount of physical affection has become annoying. I also notice myself finding other people attractive and it pains me that I don't feel the same about her anymore.

Her major involves working on 3-4 active projects at a time and I've watched her many times fall short of a deadline or leave for class in the morning with incomplete work. This has become a very unattractive pattern and makes me question her reliability and ability to just get things done. I believe that she allows her emotions to affect her productivity and effort too much. 

We often have problems communicating. We often have misunderstandings– a lot of ""what's *that* supposed to mean?"" Essentially, we assume too much about what the other intended, react instinctively and emotionally– argument ensues. I don't believe it should be this difficult to love each other. When I try to talk to her about the problems I have with our relationship, she gets defensive and upset. I think she bottles away a lot of her flaws, almost as if she ignores them, and doesn't seem to want to work to improve herself. It's unhealthy for her and our relationship. I hate hurting her and it's become very difficult to resolve anything. 

I suppose I (and her, for that matter) felt obligated to make it work considering our history and how much I wanted to be with her (we spent a year prior to our relationship in an awkward limbo, mainly due to her unsure feelings about a relationship together). I think I took the ""just make it work"" attitude to heart and, as a result, was blind to many of the issues for a long time. I am at a loss with how to proceed. My concerns:

* We live together, she's on the apartment lease
* She has very few friends who she could stay with and parents live an hour from campus
* I'm afraid our breakup will affect her ability to graduate
* We have a couple classes together

My main concern lies with how impactful this breakup will be on her mind and heart. When she was 16, she had a 9-month relationship that continues to impact her insecurity today. I want to do this in the best way. I don't cannot berate her with ""I think your insecurity, immaturity, unreliability, clinginess, etc. are unattractive and I can't do this anymore."" I have so much anxiety surrounding how much I can negatively shape her ability to have a healthy relationship in the future if I approach this the wrong way. She hardly has any close friends where we go to school that could support her after the breakup. I know that there is a line where I must stop worrying about how this will impact her and begin to prioritize my own needs and desire to be alone. I know that I can't come out of this being a saintly, divine hero. I just don't want to do more damage than I have to. Do I wait until school is over? Do I tell her now?

**tl;dr** Relationship is dissolving with an insecure and needy, yet very sweet girl. It's just not the right fit and I'm ready to move on. She lives with me and roommate [25M], graduates in two months, and has very little emotional support due to lack of friends, but parents live an hour away. I'm afraid the reasons for which I want to end the relationship will amplify her insecurity and will have negative effects on her ability to have a healthy relationship in the future. I don't know how to proceed– many thanks in advance.

Or am I exaggerating,Cansomensa,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/820b1u/is_my_boyfriends_26m_behavior_to_me_22f_out_of/,"My boyfriend and I have been having a lot of issues honestly since the beginning. Im Just wondering, because it’s been years since I’ve been with him, if this type of relationship is normal when you’ve been together for awhile? I’m embarrassed to talk to my family about it and my close friends so I want to be anonymous.

This is what happened this afternoon: He stood up really late the night before and slept in until 1:30pm. I woke up at 8:30-9am ish. I was watching tv and I ate a little bit and tidied up (not much though) and then I washed the grapes we had. He woke up and was happy and then started playing this game. I didn’t notice (usually I don’t bother him when he’s gaming on his pc or phone) and I bothered him and he yelled at me to stop so I stopped. I went to heat myself up some food and he looked at me angrily when I ate it. I didn’t hear him anything up so he got mad. He was in the kitchen saying under his breath (but loud enough for me to hear): 

A useless bitch.

Cunt

I hate her

How the duck did I get so unlucky with this bitch

Look at that garbage sitting right there

What does she fucking do

She couldn’t even wash this (this was the bowl I washed the grapes in. I forgot to wash it)

I want to kill her

And sometimes he sings to himself that I’m fucking garbage and a waste of air

He says all this and never ever apologizes. Just acts like normal after awhile. I am so torn apart right now, guys. I feel so sad. I don’t want to kill myself but I wouldn’t care if I did.

Idk what to do. Idk if I’m overreacting to everything or if I’m not. I’m embarrassed. I moved in with him across the country from my family and I’m stuck at this internship... idek what my question is, I just want to vent "

This is my second degree, so I already have all of my options and almost all of my minor taken care of. That means I just have to do CMPT courses (besides one random science course I need to take). I was thinking of getting most of them out of the way, and the way I have it planned out is that I would only need 3 more CMPT courses and a random science course after the Winter 2019 semester (jan-apr of next year).

My Fall 2018 semester:   
CMPT 201 - Programming Methodology (has a lab)   
CMPT 204 - Algorithms (has a seminar)   
CMPT 220 - Unix, Scripting &amp; Other tools (has a lab)   
CMPT 250 - Human-Computer Interaction I (has a lab)   
HIST 301 - Topics in World History   

My Winter 2019 semester:    
CMPT 229 - Computer Org &amp; Arch (has a lab)   
CMPT 230 - Introduction to Computer Games   
CMPT 220 - Intro to Relational Databases (has a lab)    
CMPT 250 - Intro to Software Engineering (has a lab)    
HIST 352 - The U.S. in World Affairs   

So, this seems like a lot. Personally I think I can handle it, though I'd like another opinion. I don't have to work while doing it though, and I've had rough semesters before, so I think I can handle it.

Like I said before, I've got most of my options and minors done from my prior degree, so taking these 10 courses means I only need 4 more after this time next year and I'll be done. I would have liked to save some easy ones for the end (and HIST is easy for me), but that's not the way it turned out. Plus, most of the courses don't open up until you take CMPT 101, 103, then 200, which eats up 3 semesters of time I could have used! lol
It seems like this would get me a good step forward to finishing my degree sooner, though.

We don't have internships here, but I'm in the process of studying web dev while taking my current semester and over the spring summer, so that I can be in a better position with personal projects to get hired when my degree is finished.

Any thoughts?"

823cbe,129,2018-03-04,"Made a deposit, got accused of bank robbery",CatL0v3r127,TalesFromTheCustomer,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/823cbe/made_a_deposit_got_accused_of_bank_robbery/,"FTP - been lurking on this sub all day and had to post my experience with a certain retail bank as a cathartic release. Sorry it's long, it's fueled by two-years of grudgingly driving past and wishful thoughts of what could have been. 


To set the scene, this took place a couple years ago when I was living at home for a summer internship in a major city. We live in a pretty nice area along a main road which has your typical suburban amenities: pharmacy, grocery store, library, banks, etc. On this particular day, I figure I'll run to the bank quickly to make a deposit, and then continue on with my other chores. 


There are two bank branches close to me. I usually head to the branch down by the affluent waterfront area since its nice and usually empty, but it takes about 15 minutes. There is a closer one that is in a slightly rundown area between my home and the waterfront. I've had a couple poor customer service experiences there before, but figure I'll shave off ~10 minutes. Boy, oh boy, I was wrong. 

I head into the bank and do the typical retail banking deal: wait in line, get to the counter, push my debit card and deposit form (thank god for mobile banking now) under the 1 inch plexiglass window and talk to the teller through the poorly orchestrated speaker system. Even if I wanted to, there's no way I could have reached anything on the teller's side of the wall. Since its a rundown area, there's also security guards at the ATM area who I passed on the way out. 


I head to the library and as I'm parking, see a call coming through. Don't answer since I don't recognize the number. I knew something was up when the voicemail notification came through. Turns out, its the bank teller who looked up my profile information, stating he's instigated a police investigation as I've stolen $2,300 from him. He's yelling to come back to the branch immediately so they can search me. 


At this point, I wasn't jaded from living in the city and dealing with boneheads on a regular basis. I'm working for a certain 3-letter agency which required a background check, and am probably about the most honest and usually friendly person a customer service rep could hope to encounter on a given day. I call the number back and attempt to reason with him about how this must be a mistake. 


He's irate, screaming about how I need to drive back immediately with every penny of the money, and how the police are on the way to arrest me. Looking back, none of this checks out, and I should have immediately escalated to a branch manager and asked them to review their video tapes. Lucky for this asshole, I was kind enough to drive the five or so minutes back, super stressed that I might be on the hook for something I clearly didn't do. 


Keep in mind this has all taken about 10 minutes at this point. I pull up and hop out of my car, noting that there is no police presence at the bank. I walk in and make a beeline for this teller. Somehow in the 5 minutes since our call, he's cooled off and looks calm as a cucumber. I'm freaking the f out, and start in on him, like ""Hey, there must be a mistake, I've come all the way back. Here's my receipt from my transaction, etc."" 


The asshole has the audacity to look me in the eye and shrugs, ""Oh, I found the money. My coworker moved it under a piece of paper while I was doing your deposit.""


Turns out, instead of using any rationale or logic, he just assumed I'd stolen the money and called me up with threats before even doing a prelim search. He didn't even bother to apologize for accusing me of robbing the place, threatening me, or for making me drive back. I was so shaken and upset I just retreated back to my car. I can only hope he's done something similarly idiotic again and lost his job/gotten a firm reprimand. Last time I visited the nicer branch, I commiserated with the branch manager about how shitty the tellers are at the other branch (not super professional of that guy either, but at least he's not accusing me of felonies!). 


TL;DR went to the bank to make a deposit, was accused of robbing the bank by a teller who hadn't even done a prelim search to see where he'd put it. "

submitted 13 minutes ago * by RyderSU

Should be ME [21 M] My fault fellas.

Hey guys and girls, So I have a situation which I need help with.

When I was a freshman/sophomore in High school, I met this girl which I connected with really well. We had a great friendship and she was my first kiss etc. We kinda distanced ourselves during senior year of high school and into college. (She didn't go to college). Anyway, no one ever understood me like she did as I'm not the most normal individual. Anytime we talked over the past 7 years, it felt like we always started talking right where we left off even though we only talk maybe 2-3 times a year.

So, one day she had a gorgeous picture on instagram and I decided to text her and tell her. After I did this, we just caught up like we normally do, how are things etc. After this, about 24-48 hours later, I felt really bad because I could never tell her she's the love of my life and I wanted to be with her. So roughly 2 days after, I decided to tell her because I had nothing to lose. So I told her ""You're the love of my life, and I've known this for a while, no one I've ever been with felt like it was when I was with you. I don't really know how to describe it, but I'd do anything for you.""

So a couple hours later she responded. ""I know you can't describe it because I can't either. Ever since we talked in high school and became such great friends I've loved you. I would do things for you I wouldn't anyone else no matter what it is.""

So, at this point, I didn't know she had a boyfriend of 3 years. She told me that and I felt terrible because I don't wanna possibly ruin something she has going for her. So, I said sorry and I was gonna go on my way. She said she just needs some time to think about everything. Also, her boyfriend is very controlling and in that case, we can only text like 2-3 times a week right now so he can't find out right now or she'll probably get kicked out of their apartment.

So I get a text a day later. She said ""I thought about everything and I know what I want to do, in roughly 4-5 months when I pay my boyfriend back (from rent and shit he paid), I'm going to leave him and I want to pursue something with you because I know it would work out perfectly as I always hoped it would.""

At this point, I'm so happy and can't believe this is happening. But then more variables came into play. She used to live in my area and her family is in my area, but she currently lives in California, and I live in Florida. I wanna move out to cali after college (1 1/2 years from graduating).

So we came up with 2-3 solutions.

    After college, I move out there and we start our lives together.
    She moves home, then we both move out to Cali or Texas together after college.
    I move out there now and finish college in California.

Also, money isn't an issue, I'm in a very fortunate family that has plenty of it and I personally have over 7 figures.

So now, I have an internship with Google this summer in California as a back-end software developer. This would be major because of seeing her while I'm out there, we'd be about 2 hours apart from each other.

I'm not sure what to do, or what the right thing is to do. I've loved her ever since we were younger and could only imagine what could be the outcome. At the same time, am I being too hopeful? I would trust this girl with my life and that's why I trust everything she is saying.

Just need some opinions on what I should do or exactly how I should do it.

tl;dr:

We live on opposite sides of the country, we both said we love eachother for 5-6 years, what do I do. I'm in college.

I spent years feeling bad about myself, and in these past months. That has gotten worse. Much worse. I can't even get through the day without feeling sad or depressed. I'm fucking done with it though. Why should I have to feel like this for any longer? I gotta get the hell over myself and work on a better me. In order to do that I do need you guys though, you with experience. What is a way you would suggest to me? Ask my friends if they know anyone/could get me into contact with someone they think would be a good fit? Online dating? How? I wouldn't know how to approach anyone.. tinder is definitely not my thing, that is way too popular and I wouldn't be able to handle that kind of thing. Go meet people some other way? I'm going to start a new internship soon, maybe there? Who knows? Any tips would be great.

Maybe relevant: 26 turning 27 this month, straight, Netherlands.

Any help to get my life back together greatly appreciated. I'm gonna have to give this thing a go, if I don't. I'll be helpless for years to come. I'm going to live a shitty lonely life which I am now noticing for the first time in my life… I can't handle. Being alone even when surrounded by friends just is too painful and stressful."

Hello everyone!





At r/SubredditOfTheDay, we are constantly on the lookout for new talent. We take in many writers each year, some pass the trials, and prove themselves worthy of the prestigious title ""writer"". Others, bless their souls of green, are unable to make it, and are left to abide in the mundane of the site: The default subreddits. I shudder at the thought.

I'm not angry at him, just sad that it took him 2 years to realize that he just wasn't that into me. I might've been an important part of his life, a best friend, a good supporter, and a wonderful girlfriend, but he just wasn't in love with me, even if he loved me. You know? 

This is not my first breakup, and maybe it's not my last. But what I do know is that I am incredibly lucky for all my friends. I always kept in contact with and hung out with my friends, even when dating. And now here they all are, rallying around to make sure I'm okay. My friends. The friends I made through him. His sister. And so, at least I am loved. 

I'm going on a girls roadtrip with my very good friend (and best friend's girlfriend); we're going to eat and shop my feelings away in a city I am not familiar with. My best friend is not very good with comforting people, but he bought me a great gift, and he is letting me take his girlfriend for a weekend. 

My other best friend knows what to do like clockwork. He's been through every breakup since college with me, and damnit, he's wonderful. I hope one day, when he finds someone for him, she and I can be as close and I am with my other best friend's girl. 

And life keeps going forward. I'm busting my ass for a second degree, applying to internships, studying for midterms, phone interviewing... And though sometimes, when left alone in those quiet moments, I still cry and miss him, at least I know that I am still loved, cared for, and appreciated. 

This sub, and Reddit in general, has been so helpful in the healing process so far, and I hope you guys can remember that you also have friends and family and a whole support group who still love you. If not, I am also around for a supportive ear if you ever want to talk (PM, comment on the post, whatever).

Good luck, and always rally the support group, wherever you can find it and whoever it may be. "
827feh,3,2018-03-05,Internship or Co-op opportunities?,AcidTitration,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/827feh/internship_or_coop_opportunities/,"Hello. It's my first time in this sub, so I'm not sure if this has been asked earlier. But I'm just going to ask again.


I'm a sophomore studying ChE at top 10 US university. I know having internships/coops is really important in this field, so I've started applying to internships in any industry since last summer. (Probably more than 140+) I've attended all career fairs and social events that were hosted by companies, but no luck so far. I have 3.5+ gpa, 1+ year of research experience, 4 leadership positions and otehr extracurricular, so I thought I would be competitive for many internship positions, but I guess I wasn't. So far I've gotten about 10 interviews, which is not great but I'm well aware of that it's very competitive. All of the interviews went well, but the recruiters wanted upperclassman for the positions they offered. I understood the competition, so I kept applying. 


Two months ago, a company, which I talked to them last fall career fair, contacted me if I'm still available, and I said yes. They wanted me to update my resume, and the recruiter said it will take a few weeks for hiring process. A week after, I got a phone call from the plant manager and talked about the job responsibilities and such, and he said it will take another few weeks. Two weeks after, I have not heard anything from that company, so I emailed to both HR and the plant manager for follow up. No response. While I've been waiting for their response, I still applied to many companies, and it's not likely that I'm going to land an internship. Should I just give up for this company?


I know that getting an internship or co-op position as a sophomore is difficult, but I really want to get one. What can I do at this point? I just wanted to rant. This job market sucks.


tl;dr: I've tried so hard to land an internsip or co-op, but no luck. Are companies still hiring for internship positions?"

I was thinking, if Don was voiced by Terry McGurrin, then Don is the Chris McLean to TDRR. In his way, he can eliminate anyone he wants and start uproars between contestants.

Story:
Duncan had quit TDWT and Don did not forget about this. After numerous search parties arranged by Don, the two teams leftover in TDWT go on a hunt to find Jack the Ripper. Noah and Owen did the challenge correctly, but Don gave the point to Team Amazon after Courtney and Gwen found Duncan, whom Don was looking for.

Moments after Noah was eliminated, Duncan enters on Gwen's confessional and they kiss. Tyler peeks in and gets shocked. It was revealed that Don broke the lock to start the drama.

At the Greek tiebreaker, Alejandro uses Tyler to reveal the kiss of Duncan and Gwen. This starts a fight between Courtney, Duncan, and Gwen. Cody wins for Team Amazon, and Team Don is Really (x4) Hot needs to eliminate a player.

Just as one of the remaining four boys on Team DRRRRH is about to sent home, Don deliberately pushes an intern out of the plane, explaining why he would send Duncan home if the love triangle drama is about to begin. Likewise, had the Amazon's lost, Gwen would be spared from elimination.

I wrote this, comparing McGurrin sparing Chris from a comeuppance in the TDPI finale to Don sparing a cheater (Duncan) in Greece."

I hope I am following the etiquete

So my current issue is on how to ""sell myself"" to a new place. I am a first year planning student on the east coast, in a pretty prestigious school. Now, I know the whole saying about ""go to school where you think you'd want to work"". I kept that in mind and applied to lots of places, but this is a good program in an area I was familiar with and they gave me a solid aid offer.

Thing is, a lot about me has changed since I started applying to schools way back in 2016, and I am thinking now I would at least like to try to start my career in the southwest, specifically deep SoCal New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, or West Texas.

This is because:

I have worked in megacities, and like the idea of medium-small cities to work in instead.
I like the idea of working in areas with significant Latino populations. My Spanish is intermediate and I would like to be fluent before 30 (am 26.)
I am interested in planning in regards to water management and infrastructure, as time goes on. I know that is way more pressing out there than here.
I am expected to have a summer internship, and would like to try one of those states.

But....I've never visited any of these places! Minus Arizona for about a week since I was 6.

My resume is pretty solid. I had a year and a half experience with a major state agency on the east coast using CDBG funds. I also have non-profit experience, and, again, my planning program is pretty good. But for all of that the fact remains, I have very little skin in the game or knowledge for these new places I am interested in. I don't know how to sell myself, except show I am a reasonably experienced young professional.

Thanks in advance for your help and advice"

Forgive me if this is wrong place for some of my questions but I decided to lump the together since they are all related. I’d like to finish this preface by acknowledging my younger self was a stupid idiot and did not make educated financial decisions.

Back story: 

Around the turn of the century, I had just graduated high school, was accepted to my first choice school (a local state university about an hours drive north of home), received Hope scholarship, and had a plan. I was gonna go to college for computer engineering and figure it out along the way. First mistake. First semester went well, I kept Hope, 3.2 gpa, and got an internship working with a local systems installer. While working mornings and studying evenings, my mental health quickly began to deteriorate as I saw the zombies surround me. Lifeless shells completing tasks all day to go home and play video games to forget the time they’ve wasted. Being surrounded by these depressing souls brought me down, as well as my gpa, leading me to lose Hope. School was now my financial burden, so I took out a private student loan to help complete my education.  By the fourth semester of school I was completely broken, I couldn’t sleep, didn’t want to eat, didn’t go out... then one night, in a stunning turn of events, the police showed up at my campus apartment claim someone reported the smell of marijuana in the hall. ‘Its a college campus, the whole dorm reeks of reefer!’ I exclaimed to the officer, and after keeping them outside for 15 mins, the RA shows up and informs me that they’re allowed to come in, regardless of my objections since it was campus property. After some hard talking to, searches of the common area and bed room, they find some beer bottles in common area, and having not found any marijuana, they pinned minor in possession of alcohol on me (even though it wasn’t actually mine and two of my roommates were of age) and within a week I was evicted and placed on academic probation. And with that I was defeated. Lawyers, probation, and the stress ruined me. I left my internship and went back to my previous job as a school photographer. And stayed afloat for a year or two, I don’t really remember; I worked security at a nightclub and moonlit as a bartender some weekends. Completely ignoring my financial obligations, I ended up defaulting on my student loans. The calls and letters never stopped until I got on a cruise ship and traveled the world two years. (I’m sure the calls continued but being on a remote island in southern pacific, the reception was a little shotty). But through my travels I learned a lot, become a manager after one contract, and meet my future wife, who I followed to Thailand, and proposed to at beach during the sunset with a $100 tanzanite and sliver ring. Fast forward a year and we’re back in the USA, building a future together. 

Issue I: School

Yep, I’m an idiot, I defaulted on student loan but am currently in a forgiveness program that will finish up in September 2018 at which point I can renegotiate the terms and hopefully get that settled. I wonder what my options for consolidation or whatever might be after I finish the forgiveness plan. Total debts are in three loans of 3k, 5k, and 9k. 

I recently have returned to school, albeit with the blessing of my fathers checkbook this time. Thankfully my credits transferred in and I am about to complete my sophomore level classes this fall, but the checks are not unlimited and I’ll need to be looking at scholarship options for my senior year, however I’ve already started employment with school as a part time video production assistant and I’m working towards my goal of becoming a flight instructor to continue my education with master degree. (Which the school will pay for if i work for them full time)

Issue II: IRA

During my tour as a elementary and middle school photographer, I participated in my company’s employee stock ownership program, and accumulated a holding of just over 4k. However, recently this company was bought and my holdings were transferred to IRA with ‘principal bank’. I currently have a Roth IRA with my credit union, but being a young, dumb kid in rough times, I drained that one of all but $100 a few years back. So now I have two IRAs and I’m wondering what is the best place for this money?

Issue III: Personal Business

This post was prompted by a post submitted a few days ago detailing an employee who was added to a personal account of their employer and their credit was negatively affected. My wife and I operate a business buying luxury goods (coach, Kate spade, Nike, Gucci, Burberry) and selling online overseas. In January 2017, it was a hobby running $3000 in revenue a month, but by October 2017, we were spending $20,000 a month and when my father saw the credit card bills, he had a mini heart attack. Since then I’ve been trying to ween ourselves off his 2 high limit cards onto my own personal cards with $1000-5000 limits. Needless to say, the high utilization and new cards has wrecked my already shitty credit score down to a low 600. We need to solidify the business (I’ve already established a federal tax ID and prepared last years taxes) I want to work with a bank, but with my complete lack of knowledge, I just have a feeling I’m going to get bent over barrel by any bank I go to. We don’t need loans, we just need an account to receive our collections from Overseas and lines of credit to make larger purchases (we want to get into watches and more expensive shoes but with limits of $1000, we’d be able to buy one pair of shoes at time when we’re currently shipping 90lbs of shoes and purses every other day....) 

TL;DR got kicked out of school, defaulted on my private student loans, drained my savings and IRA account to get out of trouble and survive for a few years. Now I’m married and we’re building a business with a first year revenue of ~$120,000 on personal credit cards (paid off weekly), my ESOP program was paid out to a holding IRA when my pervious employer was recently bought out, and I’m studying to be a pilot at a stupidly expensive university with enough money set aside for two out of three years."
829p3l,2,2018-03-05,Success Story: I Landed an Interview,misterchief10,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/829p3l/success_story_i_landed_an_interview/,"A week ago, I was in a pretty bad place. I failed a standardized assessment for an internship I wanted, and I figured an interview I was planning was off the table. 

Well, now the person I was in contact with at this company said he still wants an interview with me. It feels amazing. I’m really anxious about it, because I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I have really bad social anxiety. And this is really the first interview I’ve had. The one for my previous internship was a friend of a friend at a small publication. This is a formal company interview.

I’ve been studying the possible questions on Glassdoor and prepping mentally, now I just to wait.

But I have to say, it at least feels great to be this far. I never thought I would get this far. My horrible social anxiety made me fear I would never have what it takes to even get an interview with a big company. I’m not outgoing and my last internship was something that sort of came to me. Even if I don’t get the job, I will still feel proud of myself for the first time in a while, because I’ve proved to myself that I can do it, I can get myself out there. And that’s great. Now, obviously I’d be disappointed if I don’t get it, but this is still a victory for me. 

Now to try to make sure my anxiety doesn’t shut my brain off during the interview and turn me into a quiet, stuttering mess..."

I keep forgetting my things in places. Not doing so well in my classes this semester,etc.. ALSO, i chose my roommate this year which was a terrible mistake, BUT i signed a lease with him and that disciplined friend, and a few other friends/people to live in a house next year. I really don't know...

-My family is relying on me. My dad keeps calling me to say like he failed me and that he needs me to take him out of this hole, etc.. but I can't bear to tell him whats been going on with me. He thinks everything is fine. My mom has been through so much and supports me and she knows but I can tell her patience is running out on me.

I see this kind of post here often, and have felt the same feelings myself. I wrote a decent response, but the original post was deleted shortly thereafter. However, I figure that given the frequency this question comes up and the fact that I had taken a decent amount of time to write a response, that maybe I ought to make a totally separate post where I and others can share their experiences.

________________________________________________

Does it get better after freshman year? Short answer: **hell yes.**

Some people love their freshman year, some hate it. However, you will never know the difference because everyone will act like they love it in order to fit in. Know that you’re not alone and that countless other freshman at this school feel the same way. School is stressful. Trying to find good friends is stressful, especially when it seems like EVERYONE around you already has (spoiler: not true).

The first half of my freshman year was spent mostly with people I didn’t like and had nothing in common with, but I continued to hang out with them to feel like I had friends. I realized by the end of first semester that this strategy was not working, and I was feeling more lonely than ever. Around the beginning of second semester, I “ripped the band-aid” off, so to speak, and stopped hanging around with this group of people. I had some incredibly lonely days, but this drove me to become far more involved with a club I had been active with the first semester. This club opened me up to several different friend groups and I’ve been able to make a pretty great network of friends around school (many of them are friends of friends in that club). It takes time, but there are other people like you at this school.

Moving on to academic concerns, one great thing about becoming an upperclassmen is that your classes start to get major specific. I loved the classes I took Fall of sophomore year - they were incredibly interesting, fun, and extremely challenging. I cursed those classes on many days, but going through co-op will make you feel like everything was worth it. When you take classes related to your real intention for attending a university, you’ll get more engaged in the work and oftentimes you’ll see your grades go up.

Regardless of the cause of your anxiety—social, academic, or other—know that it gets better. A lot of people at this school have gone through this. Here are some pieces of advice that definitely helped me overcome my anxieties.

- Study in the library. You will make friends and it’s a great way to get out of the whole “freshman dorm” mindset
- Join a non-academic student group. Interested in music and concerts? There's like 3 groups that do music publications and organize concerts. Like politics? We've got several groups, both liberal and conservative. There's a film club, tons of athletics, clubs for makers, pretty sure there's a crypto club. 
- Make friends with upperclassmen. Maybe there’s a third year in one of your classes. Befriend him/her. They are great people to know, have great advice, and if you drink, they will be very excited to get you beer.
- Try to make what you are learning relevant. Maybe see if your professors have some research positions. Make an effort to speak to them after classes. Some professors suck, but you only need one to professor who believes in you and challenges you in order to boost your confidence
- Get a job - it will give you a sense of satisfaction and it’s really nice to have money (also an opportunity to meet new people). Another more “out there” suggestion - find an off campus job in Boston. I know a couple people who swear it was the best thing they've ever done
- Ditch fake friends. They are negative and will make you feel bad about yourself.
- If you smoke a lot of marijuana, you should stop. I have a lot of friends who got carried away with smoking Freshman year and ended up feeling anxious/shitty all the time. Most of them quit or seriously reduced their consumption
- Eat good food. I hated the dining halls, but finding something I liked or going out would help if I was feeling down
- Get excited about the future. There’s so much great stuff ahead. Co-op is great. You still get to be a kid and go home for breaks. People at home will be blown away when you’re pulling $20+/hr at co-op and they’re still scooping FroYo.
- Start planning for the future. Family friend works at an awesome company that you want to co-op or intern at? Send them one of your write-ups for a Cornerstone of Engineering project and a nice email asking about internships! Maybe you're CCIS—send them that cool script you wrote to automate some pain in the ass task. CSSH or CAMD—send a piece of your writing or an art project. There are tons of possibilities 

If you have any other advice, suggestions, or just want to plug your student org, PLEASE DO SO!!"

82ac9a,1,2018-03-05,[22M] My Semi-Long-Distance Girlfriend [25F] of 7 years needs constant attention and I feel like I need to get away.,3858701,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/82ac9a/22m_my_semilongdistance_girlfriend_25f_of_7_years/,"tl;dr my girlfriend needs to be in constant contact with me over phonecall, email, or skype from 6AM to 2AM every day, and won't listen to me when I tell her I need just a little space. I think I need to break up with her because she has refused to see counselling for her chronic mental issues for the past few years. Is it okay to give an ultimatum? ie; seek help or I need to leave



Throwaway. For background, we have been together 7 years and went to the same high school, saw each other in class every day, talked daily over skype, etc. I'm very happy in all parts of our relationship besides how clingy she is... For the past few years, we went from talking for a few hours a day over skype after school, playing video games, hanging out in person, etc, from needing to be in contact with me every waking moment of her life, regardless of what I'm doing. I go to school in the next state over, about 4 hours away, and I'm in my 4th year. 

She leaves for school at around 6:00 AM every day and takes the bus from a rural area into the city (about an hour and a half commute) and calls me and wakes me up so she can talk or complain, or sometimes just sit in silence of the phone so she isn't lonely. She does this on the commute home as well. I have severe social anxiety and can't talk on the phone (but I'm seeing a therapist about it) I tell her at least once a week that I don't like talking for so long every day but she guilts me back into it saying shes so bored and feels like shes wasting the time if shes not doing something (even though she can write, draw (her two hobbies), do homework, play a handheld console, etc). She constantly apologizes for calling and says she wont and then every day calls until I wake up to the phone ringing and then apologizes profusely saying shes really bored and just needs to talk.

 My classes start around 9. Once she gets to school, she texts me constantly about how lonely and weird she is because she has no friends in class and everyone hates her because shes too quiet? But desperately wants friends. Any time anyone initiates conversations with her she automatically assumes they are pitying her and wont keep up the relationship or let herself have fun. She's 100% convinced everyone hates her and thinks she has (imaginary) disabilities and are pitying her. The texts continue nonstop through the day and will send 30-50 in a row if I dont respond, asking what I'm up to and wondering why im not responding, and apologizing for ""bothering me"" when she knows my schedule and I'm in classes. I usually talk to he throughout the day becuse she will immedeately assume I'm mad at her if I don't repsond at least every 30 minutes. After classes I go to my full-time job (she is unemployed) and she continues to text me with the same apologetic attitude but still sending up to 50 texts in a row complaining about her class and her day and wondering what I'm up to and why I'm not responding. 

I get out of work and we do the phonecall on the way home from work, which just about drains me of all the rest of my energy for the day. Once she hangs up and gets in the door, she immedeately logs into Skype and begins messaging me. We probably exchange upwards of 5-10,000 texts and skype messages a day because she needs to narrate her life, tell me about how shes going to plan the rest of her night down to the minute, ask me what im eating, doing, etc, and asking just to chat or ask for reminders for her homework schedule. She also lives with her father who doesn't get along with her very well, so she complains about him a lot. Like, multiple 2,000-3,000 word messages a night about how he makes her want to kill herself and how she wished he loved her and what a terrible daughter she is. These messages continue until about midnight, and if I leave for more than a few minutes at a time she starts sending 50+ messages in rapid succession about where I might be and that I'm not paying attention to her, and that she feels disconnected and maybe we need to talk about it, etc. This happens literally every day. 

Most days, I'm happy to talk to her, spend time with her, play games over call, etc, but it's been a few years of this schedule and its only getting worse. After she logs off of the computer at midnight to go to bed, she texts me from her phone in bed for another two hours or so because she cant sleep, just isn't tired yet, cant stop thinking about the homework she didnt get done, thinking about her father, or death, or something very dismal which always ends in suicide threats or at least going into explicit detail about self harm and wanting to die. If I fall asleep from exhaustion of only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night all work-week, she texts and calls until the ringing wakes me up or she decides to just go to bed without me, often hours later into the night. She regularly hides self harm from me, and I feel like the only way I know how to help her is to keep in contact with her, because she tells me thats the only thing that stops her from self harming and killing herself and that it distracts her from her problems.... 24/7. 

She suffers from pretty severe depression, and some other? mental illensses that she won't get diagnosed. She has paranoia about medication, and would say she would much rather kill herself than need to be reliant on medicine, especially since she doesnt drink and refuses to alter her mind in any way. Medication to her is like poison and changing the way her head works to make her feel better would be like changing who she is, I guess. Which is fine, I can't force her to take medicine and she might not need it. But she won't even go to counselling for ADVICE. Her school offers free walk-in, no commitment, unlimited counselling from physiologists at her college. She has this intense paranoia/fear about having records made and refuses to even talk to someone out of fear of them writing down her name or entering her into a patient database, or remembering her name the next time she goes there. This fear is so severe she goes by a different name than her birth name except on absolutely mandatory documents like school applications, and doesn't have any social media that might identify her in some way. She won't go to counselling because she has this crippling fear of telling them her name and being permanently on their record that one say someone will hack, find her personal information, and come and rape/kill her unprovoked.

 We talk about this every day, about different coping mechanisms she can use, I counsel her every day, and it has gotten to the point where she said theres nothing I can do to make her feel better or stop her from killing herself, besides not leaving her. I just need to stick around and listen to her tell me how much she wants to die 24/7 and never have a moment of free time to myself to recuperate. She has had suicidal ideations for the past 3 or so years, but everything is getting to be too much for me to handle. 


I have anxiety and depression and she constantly pulls me down. I feel like I'm going to lose my mind, she has stopped me from succeeding in school and at work, and I can't apply to jobs and internships too far away or that would require me to be away from my phone for more than 10 minutes at a time. I know that I need to demand free space and stop answering, picking up the phone, etc to stop making her dependent, but i cant. I've tried in the past, and every time she either blames me later for how horrible she feels all the time because i didnt pick up, or just complains about me being distant and not caring about her, and/or sends hundreds of texts. 


I feel like I need to break up with her, but I'm her full financial support, her car, and the only thing stopping her from killing herself. If I leave, she will have no one because of her paranoia. She won't go see a psychologist or a doctor. I don't believe she would really kill herself, as she threatens it every day and has never attempted in the past 3-4 years, but her life would essentially be over/a husk without me and I don't see her getting better. 


I want to break up with her very badly, but I feel too guilty. I still love her, and she loves me. We have very similar interests and get along very well besides this. Some of those messages are still fun, and I want to believe its salvageable. She's the only person that (somewhat) understands my anxiety. But I'm at the end of my wits. Is it okay to give her an ultimatum in this situation? She refuses to change with or without me and I would be losing someone I really really love/see a future with if she could just get help...."

I currently am pursuing a internship as a data engineer and on the application it asks for me to enter a ""desired salary expectation"" and I really have no clue what to put here.



*Why I don't know what to put*


1. This is my first go at internships in the Computer Science field which means I have never had an internship before.


2. My previous work experience is at a convenience store and not related to the field.


3. I did a quick online search and saw that data engineer interns on average make [$107,000](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-engineer-intern-salary-SRCH_KO0,20.htm) I also have seen on here that these websites are not always accurate and that seems extremely high.


*But what have done to look into this question outside of this post?*


1. Contacted someone I know in the field (they told me for software engineers, which is different tasks then a data engineer, it is normal for companies to pay $70,000-$80,000 dependent on company size and location)


2. Attempted to reach out to people I could find who are ex-employees of that company who I do not know for any tips they could offer me. 



This internship is located in Philadelphia, PA 


What do I put for my desired salary? The work experience and getting the internship is more important then the compensation but that does not mean I want to be underpaid in this situation as it will help pay for school.

EDIT: Forgot to add my question..."

My shitty school has a requirement that all students study abroad, and I decided that their programs left a lot to be desired, so I paid for one of those internship companies. Same price, but it makes the job finding process easier after school.

I decide on hong kong because fuck yeah, cyberpunk vibezz

Fast forward to today, when I've got my first interview. Interviewer asks ""So why did you choose anti counterfeit hybrid cyber-security in hong kong? what do you know about it?""

And fam I literally said ""well I think taobao is super interesting""

And then I realized I just referenced buying things off of their major competitors' site

So I immediately started backpedaling, saying ""my girlfriend buys a lot of dresses on there"" and ""a lot of stuff gets flagged and doesn't make it back to the US"" and shit like that

there's a beat, and then the interviewers just start rolling

""I guess we can't hire your girlfriend then""

Aced the rest of the interview

82bxma,3,2018-03-05,Were seasons 5/6 the last of the best? The last of the CORE characters? The last of MAGIC?,GreenAwareness,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/82bxma/were_seasons_56_the_last_of_the_best_the_last_of/,"I am going to start binge watching the show from season 1 again, I just got up to date and even though they were episodes after S5/6 that were amazing, I feel like that's when the show started going downhill (at least for me).

For me, the core characters of this show were actually the 5 original interns (MAGIC). Meredith, Alex, George, Izzie and Christina. 

For me the core characters were: Meredith, Alex, George, Izzie, Christina.

Since this show is suppposed to be aboutGrey, I would have to add Richard. Bailey, of course since she's MAGIC's boss (mom). Then there were the complementary characters who were also an integral part of the core: Derek, Mark, Ellis, Callie and Lexie. There are also some notable love interests: Burke, Owen, Addison and Arizona.

For me, that's where I stopped caring.

Those were the characters I cared about. As much as I really do love Jackson/April, when the merger happened and we lost Izzie and George it almost felt like the show became a spinoff of itself.

Provided there were moments (and still are) that feel like vintage Grey's, that's when the show really lost the complete MAGIC.

I know SO many hate George and Izzie, the 5 interns just worked together really well. It was such a nice blend of actors/characters that has never been replicated. Characters like Derek, Mark, Lexie and Callie have not been able to be replicated either. Not to mention Christina.

I just wish Shonda/the actors would have worked a way to keep the core cast. I know it's 14 seasons but Grey's is such an awesome show that I wish it would have worked out.

I enjoyed some of Maggie's storyline (her mom centric episodes made me cry) but it just doesn't feel like Grey's. I loved Jackson and April. Heck, I love Amelia and Owen. I really enjoyed Steph's journey last season. I even liked some of what Jo represents to the show. Still, it doesn't feel like there was ever a better core cast than in season 1-6. 

I wish right now we'd have:

Meredith: Chief of General, Alex: Chief of Peds, George: Chief of Trauma, Izzie: Chief of Neuro, Christina: Supreme Chief of Cardio.

Even with all the flaws in some of the orginal five's characters, I wish I could have follow them until now. I wish they kept MAGIC as the core of this show, because, at least for me, they were."
82bzpq,2,2018-03-05,I pray to die everyday.,MyNameIsNotRight,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/82bzpq/i_pray_to_die_everyday/,"I can't stand living anymore. I don't remember a time when I was really happy in my life. Not even as a child. I grew up with a schizophrenic father who would abuse my mother. I convinced her to leave him and at first she didn't want to leave me with him since he had custody of me. 

Then one day while I was sleep in my room she slept alongside me that night. I knew that she was going to leave then, but not when. Then during the middle of the night i fell off of the bed where she was sleeping and then I knew she was gone. I cried the rest of the night and couldn't sleep. 

I remember, since then I wen't through my life not able to look forward to anything. The worst days where when it was just me and my dad. There were always long periods of time when we didn't have any contact. We just sat there watching tv... My mom would visit during the holidays sometimes, when my dad made me beg her to come back. Since then I was never really able to enjoy a holiday.

Then during one of my moms visits, I asked her to stay for my birthday, because she missed my birthday last year. She didn't have the money to come back since she was living out of state. She did and when she left back to where she was staying my brother died of cancer. 

My brother was the one who initially got me out of my shell. He was the first person who made me feel like I mattered. And once he died my mother did come back to stay. She told me about how he wished that he was able to grow up with me and how he wanted to go to college. She also blamed herself for his death. I told her if that was the case then it was mostly my fault for asking her to stay for my birthday. He died 8 days after. Another day that I would hate in the future. I still don't celebrate my birthday even though its been over 10 years now.

Since then the abuse stopped immediately. My dad apologized and tries to make up for it now. But I can't forget. I can't get closure now. I couldn't have friends. No one liked me at school because I was the ""weird guy"". I've never been happy, I didn't have anything to look forward to in life. 

I didn't think I would make it to 18. But I did. I also got scholarships. I raised the most money out of everyone in my school although it still wasn't a full ride. My next step was to reluctantly go to college. I was told by the school counselor, the teachers, and by my parents that I would get a good job after graduating and have a better life. 

During my time in college I tried my best to get out of my shell on my own. I made a few friends. It was a very small number but they were still friends. I'm doing well in my mind and i'm catching on faster than people who were even a year ahead of me. Sophomore year comes around and I start applying for internships. Didn't get any. Neither did I in my Junior year. Then in my Senior year I was crushed. I lost the little hope that I had gained. Everything was hopeless again. I started to skip my calculus III class and failed it. I didn't like math and though I sucked at it. Then I had to go to summer school. I lied to my family because they had a lot of faith in me.

During the summer I was back in my dorm. I didn't have to go back home. I knew that as soon as I went back home i'd be in hell again. Not a hell caused by my father, mother, or anyone else. A hell that just happened because it happened. It is because it is. I start skipping class again. I gave up. I couldn't go on. But I remembered that my nephew said that he wanted to be like me and go to college. So did my nieces. I remembered my brother that died and how he wanted to go to college too. I thought that it would  be unfair to them if I just gave up. I didn't care what happened to myself because I had already given up on myself. I asked the professor the grade that I needed to pass and he said that I need at least a 93. So before the finals I studied. For 3 days straight I studied. I even asked the professor for help. Then the final day came and I got a 97 somehow. I still think its a mistake somehow but I took it. 

Then I came back home. Immediately I started applying for jobs. days go by, weeks, and then months. I don't get any interviews. Except from a few recruiting companies. They would always say that they had an interview for me but none of them fell through. I'd try to get in touch with them for months but they would all ghost me. Its like I was cursed.

I am 25 now. and I am still not working in my field. during the 3 years after I graduated I've worked as a security job and as a cable guy. I don't even want to mention the hard time I had working those jobs. A friend I used to help in class all the time got a job programming a year after we graduated. I was happy for him, but I stopped talking to him for a while. I felt terrible about myself. But I force myself to keep talking to him. Its unfair to try to punish him because of my own shortcomings. 

Now i'm just trying to pick up the pieces and start all over again. I am in the same place, in the same house, the same lost and powerless situation, and the same hopelessness. I'm supposed to be applying for jobs but I can't anymore. I can't take another ""no thank you"" letter. I was never given a chance so why would I get one now?

I just pray desperately to die. It seems like the only way out of me. I just want this to end. I can't even face myself anymore. I want a future. I desperately want something to look forward to for once..."

TL;DR - When I took my Hyundai for a speaker repair at the dealership it was returned to me with Bent Rims, A Leaking Brake Caliper, and Chopped Tires. After a month of dealing with Hyundai Corporate they told me they couldn't help me (by sending me a letter telling me to stop calling them basically) and told me to go to the dealership to get the damage covered. The Service Manager told me that he knew for a fact that they didn't do anything to my vehicle, and refused to pay for anything... the worst part is, it's happening all over again. Details below:

During the month I dealt with Corporate, my case manager stopped answering me for two weeks. So I called them and ask to speak to her manager as I had not heard from her. They told me they would send me an email, all I had to do was reply to it and it would go to her manager. So I wrote the following email that contains the whole story. (Guess who the email didn't go to? Her manager)

To whom it may concern:

I am writing to you today, concerned about my vehicle, and about the level of service I have received thus far from Hyundai. I am highly disappointed as a customer, I feel like your company does not care about what is happening to their customers. I worked for Apple in customer service and have since moved to California to work in the engineering, thus giving me true insight to know what it is like dealing with customers who are upset, irate, etc. But I would never tell anyone that there is nothing I could do for them. 

My car has been un-safe to drive for almost a month now, and I still have no resolution as to what to do next. There are two parts that have really disappointed me, the service department at one of your dealerships and your consumer affairs department

In the past, I’ve had poor experiences at one of your locations in Albany: Lia Hyundai. The most recent time is when I brought my car in to Lia Hyundai in Albany, NY in April of this year (2017), because I believed my right passenger speaker had blown out. My car at the time was in the upper 50k mile range, I believe somewhere around 58.5k miles. After diagnosis they deemed it was warranty issue and told me they would order a new speaker for me and call me when it was in to bring my car in. At the time I was trying to get my car fixed before I moved across the country for 5 months to California as an intern for an engineering team on June 4th. During the last week of May, and shortly after my vehicle had crossed the 60k mile threshold, I still had not heard from Lia Hyundai so I called them to find out where my speaker was. They told me it had been there and when I asked why they didn’t call me, they said one of their managers had left and they had been really busy, but that I could bring my car in anytime that week.

Unfortunately, I was unable to bring my car in between packing, and getting ready to leave for 5 months. So I brought the car to my parents house downstate about 100 miles away in Fishkill, NY. It stayed there over the summer and over the past 6 months, being driven sparsely only to keep fluids moving and keep the battery charged. A week before I came back to New York, I called Lia Hyundai to schedule an appointment to get my speaker fixed, after being transferred from department to department while I had to personally make sure that they had a speaker in stock, and then ask to get transferred to service to schedule an appointment. The service consultant that picked up the phone was rude and was trying to avoid making me an appointment to get my speaker fixed, claiming they would need to diagnose the issue to make sure that it was under warranty, and they needed to make sure they had the part in stock. I explained to him that I already had it diagnosed, and I had already ensured the part was in stock and reserved. Finally, he said “Ok… I’ll make you an appointment”

The appointment was scheduled for October 31st at 9 am. I arrived at my appointment and pulled up to the service station, which had a service consultant named Frank, whom I had always had positive experiences with. Instead, a consultant named Daryl came up to me. Daryl and I had a history before this where we argued a couple of years back. At the time I spoke with the service manager Carmon Carnibucci and he assigned me to Frank. Since then I had dealt with Frank and never experienced any issues. 

After explaining the situation to Daryl, (I will be paraphrasing here) he said that since the car was at 62k miles, it was no longer covered under warranty. I explained to Daryl that the speaker was the same broken speaker that I had originally brought in, and that it didn’t make sense that it was no longer covered, especially after the reason I couldn’t bring it in under 60k miles was because I never got told my part was in back in April. He made it clear he wasn’t willing to help, and ended up telling me that this wasn’t something that was going to be covered and “Hyundai” wouldn’t cover it, not him.

It was then that I asked him if there was a corporate number or a customer service number that I could call, as I didn’t believe that I was out of options at that point. I dialed the number while still working with him, and when he saw me call, he also picked up the phone and called the warranty department which I didn’t know until he was off the phone. I was still on hold when he got off the phone and that’s when he told me that they could do something called a “PA Form” in order to get “Prior Approval” and get my speaker covered. He told me to remain on the line with customer care to see if “there was anything else they can do for you”. I spoke with customer care, and the first gentleman I spoke with, if you can find out who he was, I would like to thank him. He exemplified what customer service should look like. He sounded concerned and I felt like he really put himself in my shoes and did the best he could to find out more about the situation, including calling the dealership. Eventually he came on the line, and told me that the dealership was going to do what he was going to suggest, the “PA Form”. He gave me my case number and told me if I had any further issues to call back.

As I approached Daryl again he kind of chuckled to himself and told me that he was trying to help me out. Even though he wasn’t originally willing to help me, I thanked Daryl and asked if he thought my vehicle would be ready by 1pm as thats when I had scheduled a taxi to come drop me off at the dealership. He replied and said that he only needed to send a few emails so it should be no problem.

I returned at 12:45 pm, most of the service consultants were at lunch, including Daryl. I assumed my car was finished and headed to the counter to pick up my keys and sign the paperwork. After about 5 minutes the lady behind the counter, nor any of the service people could find my vehicle or any paperwork. Frank (the consultant who I’ve never had a problem with) decided to call Daryl to see what was going on. He came back to me and told me that Daryl said that I could take my vehicle home now, and that he would call me when I could drop it off to get it repaired. I was dumbfounded as to why he let me leave my car there for 4 hours, schedule drop-offs and pick-ups at my appointment time and when the car would be finished, and not have done any work or at least called me to tell me it was taking longer than he thought. So I took my car home after they brought it around from the back lot. I had no issues with my car at this point, including during the 100 mile drive up to Albany, and all of the time my parents had driven the car.

Daryl called me and left a voicemail around 3:45 pm that same day saying he had gotten approval and I needed to bring my car in to the dealership ASAP and mentioned something about expiration. I called him back at 4 pm and he asked what was the soonest I could bring the vehicle in, to which I answered “Right now.” He responded saying that they close at 5pm so to just bring my car in the following morning. At this point I had to find a friend that was willing to let me spend the night.

I brought my car in the following day Wednesday, Nov 1 2017 around 11am. Daryl called me around 12:15pm and told me it was done, and I went to pick up my car around 1 pm. When I signed off on the paperwork I noticed they did a “Multi-point inspection” along with my rear speaker. I drove in the city of Albany to my friends house, where I said my goodbyes and thank-yous, and started my 100 mile trip back to my parents house. When I got on the highway, I immediately noticed a high-pitched screeching noise that went away after about 10-15 minutes. It came back the next day and I was able to capture it on video, which I can send you via USPS. I also noticed that my car had a very prominent vibration throughout the vehicle but I felt it mainly in my steering column. At this point is when I lost all faith in Lia Hyundai and decided I would call customer care again to file a complaint and figure out next steps. 

I called Customer Care again and explained the situation to them. As I hadn’t heard from my case manager, I coined the idea of possibly taking it to a 3rd party mechanic so he could look over the vehicle and tell me if there was anything slightly misaligned or out of place that could have happened during the repair, to which the representative answered that I should wait for my case manager, as they would probably want me to get the car checked by Hyundai, and I agreed.

Katelin Randall called me a few times, as I didn’t know who was calling, I let it go to voicemail. After calling customer care the previous day, they had told me Katelin had been trying to reach me, so I was finally able to get in touch with Katelin the following morning.

Katelin also sounded concerned at first, and told me she would approve an hours worth of diagnostic time at the closest Hyundai (Healy Hyundai, where I bought the vehicle). I asked her what would happen if Hyundai deemed it wear and tear even though I had no prior issues to bringing it to Lia Hyundai. She told me that normally mistakes are obvious, but if it wasn’t we would cross that bridge when we got there. I thanked her and let her know that since I was flying back to California, my parents would most likely be the ones taking my vehicle to the service center.

After they took it, it took 12 hours for the service consultant there to reach out to me. I missed his call and called him the following morning. He started telling me the issues that he found with my vehicle that could cause the screeching and the vibration: 1. Chopped Tires 2. Leaking Caliper which seized and now the rotor needed to be resurfaced 3. Bent passenger-side-only wheels.

I asked him how Lia Hyundai could have missed those three things since they had performed a “Multi-point inspection”. He said he wasn’t sure how they performed inspections at that dealership, but he began rattling off what he normally does during a similar inspection at Healy Hyundai. I had to cut him short due to the number of things that they check and asked him “So if I’m understanding you correctly, you do your due diligence” to which he answered yes. I told him the fact that Lia Hyundai missed all of those things and let me drive at highway speeds for 100 miles was probably very unsafe, and he agreed. He also stated that he had sent the information that he told me to an email thread between Katelin and other people whose names I did not recognize. This was on Thursday November 9th.

The following day I called Katelin to ask what the next steps were. She didn’t pick up and called me back the following Monday morning. I asked Katelin what she thought, and expressed my concerns that I have all of these issues and I had no idea where they came from, as I didn’t have a screeching noise or a vibration the day before the speaker got repaired, or prior. She told me she would reach out to her Regional Management and call me back by the end of the day. She called me back the following day Tuesday Nov 14th, and I missed her call. She left me a voicemail saying it was all due to wear and tear, would all be out-of-pocket, and to call her if I had other questions or concerns. I called her back about an hour later and left her a voicemail asking her to call me back. I hadn’t heard from her by Thursday Nov 16th, so I called her again and again left another voicemail asking her to call me back.

By yesterday Monday Nov 27th I still had not heard back from her so I called Customer Care again, and asked for my case to get transferred to her supervisor, or her peers, as I found it unprofessional for someone to not return phone calls. They told me they couldn’t guarantee I would get someone else, but if Katelin got my case again, I would have to ask her to give my case to someone else or her supervisor.

A few hours later, I received an email from Katelin stating the following: 
~~~
“Hello,

I have received your case again. I did leave you a voicemail on 11/14/2017 explaining that the repairs would be an out of pocket expense. I also sent a follow up email 11/15/17 inquiring if you had any further questions to which I received no response. Maybe we just had a communication break down. Please let me know what else I can do to assist you.

Thank you,

“Katelin,

Thanks for the reply. I called customer care again and looks like they had the wrong email on file- again. I also called you back on 11/14/17 and left a voicemail, and called again on 11/16/17 and left another voicemail after not hearing from you.

At this point I think it’s best if I can deal with your supervisor, if not then maybe one of your peers.

Please forward my contact information which should be up to date as of this morning, and have them call me as soon as possible, as this has been on-going for nearly a month now. Thanks for all your help.

What struck me about her response is that she didn’t even acknowledge the fact that she didn’t return my phone calls, as well as the fact that she didn’t give me an option to talk to her supervisor in any way shape or form.
I thought it would be best if I could speak to her on the phone to express my concerns finally, so I replied: 

~~~
“Katelin,


Are you available this afternoon for a phone call?

A very simple question just asking generally if she would be available for a phone call. She replied to me the following morning Tuesday Nov 28th with:

“Hello,

I can not guarantee I will be available at any specific time. What is your concern?

Thank you,

At this point I thought it’d be best to just keep working with Katelin as she had the back story. This is where I shared my concerns with her:

~~~
“Katelin,

I just want to address the issues with my car and tell you what I'm concerned about. I will address each issue individually.

1. Chopped Tires- 

These were just bought from Firestone at the same time I got my rear brakes done the second time, and I will have them warrantied so this is a non-issue.

2. Leaking Brake Caliper/Resurfacing of Rotor- 

I got my brakes done at Firestone back in mid-to-late 2016. In March of this year I was having a problem were my rotors became scarred and scorched. I took them to Firestone who told me that since the rotors were just replaced, it was most likely bad calipers. After doing some research, I found that the previous year model of my car had a recall on the calipers. I took my car in to the same Lia Hyundai, who charged me $100 to tell me that it was in fact not the calipers that the calipers were fine and my car didn't qualify for recall, that they were most likely bad rotors. As a matter of fact they insinuated that Firestone had maybe never even replaced the rotors to begin with, and charged me for doing nothing, being that they were in such bad shape. So I took them back to Firestone fuming at what the dealership had told me and after going back and forth with them, they agreed to replace them under warranty at no cost to me. They replaced the rear rotors, and pads. They told me if the rotors got scorched again, they would not cover them any longer as that indicates bad calipers. Keep in mind, I drove the car after that from April, until June 4th. So I put maybe 5k miles on the rotors, and I brought the calipers in to Hyundai while they were under warranty, and they told me everything was fine. 

In addition, like I told you, the car drove fine up to Albany for the 100 mile trip. In the past during service visits not one person made any mention of any leaking calipers or any of that. Then after I picked up my car from the dealership, all of a sudden I have a vibration through my car, and a screeching noise coming from my rotors- after they conveniently took off all 4 wheels and put them back on during the ""Multi-point inspection"".

3. Bent Wheels-

This also seems unlikely as well. If you can pull up my service records, I was involved in an accident back in 2015 where I got my car repaired at Carbone Hyundai in Utica, NY. During that time I had crashed the front passenger side of my vehicle, and they replaced the wheel. Since then, I have been involved in no accidents, or had any other damage to my vehicle that would have posed a threat to the wheels. The amount of force required to bend the alloy is significant and it's not something that I would forget.

Regardless on if this is due to wear and tear, I wasn't having a vibration issue before bringing the car in to Lia Hyundai, and I did after. If the wheels were bent the entire time, how come I've never experienced any of the symptoms?

In summary, I've had a very bad experience with Hyundai, specifically Lia Hyundai to the point where I am afraid to drive my car anywhere, as I feel it is unsafe. The fact that Lia Hyundai performed a ""Multi-Point inspection"" and didn't find any of the other issues it took another mechanic 1 hour to find, and then let me drive off in an unsafe vehicle could be considered neglect. I asked you when we first started dealing with each other, what would happen if something was wrong and if it wasn't obvious and deemed wear and tear what would happen. You said we would cross that bridge when it came, and here it is. I'm not trying to point any fingers, or cause trouble in anyones lives. I am a customer. Who has spent money at your dealerships, at your service centers, etc. and yet when clearly something happened at the service center that is now causing me all these problems, I feel as if I'm not getting any support. Imagine if you were in my shoes, and your car was fine one day and after a speaker repair it now has some serious issues that are due to ""wear and tear"".

As a solution, here is what I propose; if you look at service records you'll see I brought my car in for $100 brake diagnostics to Lia Hyundai. I've gotten the rotors and pads replaced twice, and if you know about cars; those don't just ""go bad"". So this is something I think should be covered under warranty, as I first reported this back when the car had just broken 50k miles if my memory serves me correct. The tires like I said, are a non-issue, those I bought elsewhere and if they are failing, those are no ones fault. The wheels, I feel should also be covered, as I didn't have a vibration before the dealership, and I did after, and they let me go driving an unsafe vehicle. I would be willing to compromise and pay for 1 wheel, if you cover the other. Even though I think they should also be covered I'm willing to work with you here.

Thanks for your time, and please let me know your thoughts.

Regards,

Omar”

To which she replied:

~~~
“Hello,

I understand all of your concerns.

The tires
Break and rotors
Bent wheels

However, at this point this is a dealership complaint and you will need to speak directly to the dealership to work this out. The dealerships are independently owned and operated so if you are claiming they caused damage to your vehicle then they are the one who will assist you and pay to repair it.

My job is to assist you with warranty repairs. As I have stated before, I have already brought this to the attention of my regional management and made you aware that Hyundai Motor America is unable to provide any further assistance at this time.

I have attached an official determination letter to this email for you. If you feel this is unfair I have provided the Better Business Bureau contact information in the letter.

Thank you,

At this point I figured out that Katelin doesn’t have my best interest at heart. She basically told me she’s not going to help me, and instead asked me to go back to a dealership that potentially damaged my vehicle (which they would never admit) which caused me to lose faith in that dealer. This would also require having my mother or step-father drive an un-safe vehicle 100 miles to the dealer and put them in a potentially fatal situation if something in the vehicle fails.

I am very shocked that I had to escalate this situation this high. Katelin states that her job is to assist me for warranty repairs which as I had stated- I believe the Calipers/Rotors are. Regardless, she is a Consumer Affairs Case Manager, not a Warranty Department person so I’m not sure why she said that.

I have never been rude or irate with any representative. I am frustrated but anyone in my position would be as well. I have maintained professionalism and a positive attitude to everyone, despite the lack of support I’ve gotten from Hyundai. At this point, as I stated to Katelin, I believe the rear brake calipers and rotors should be covered under warranty, the tires I will replace myself and I would like to know what can be done about the wheels. I will attach scanned images of my work that was done at Lia Hyundai as well as the work I had done at firestone. I am currently missing the last piece which is where Firestone reluctantly replaced my rotors for the second time for free under warranty. Working on getting that, but obviously they have been replaced as they are no longer scorched. I do not feel it is safe to send my mother or step-father on a 100-mile drive, nor do I want to deal with Lia Hyundai anymore as I don’t believe in the work that they do, as I don’t feel they represent Hyundai, or what Hyundai stands for as a company.

Kind Regards,

Omar Arellano

After this, I called the Dealership who originally broke my car. The service manager Carmon, denied that his dealership did anything to my car. He said he knew for a fact that the dealership didn't cause my issues. I questioned and asked, ""I had no issues driving the 100 miles to your dealership, only when I picked up the car. So youre telling me my brake calipers started leaking, my rims got bent, and my tires got chopped, after your techs performed an ""inspection"" and let me drive off with a broken and dangerous car"" 

I recorded this conversion as in New York only party needs to know the conversation is being recorded. I will send to anyone interested it is 18 minutes long. At the end he hung up on me.

Since then, I failed a claim against that dealership thru the New York State DMV, my case has since gotten escalated and they told me it could take up to a year to resolve. I had recently moved to California and couldn't wait a year for it to be resolved, so I paid about $1000 for the repairs out of my own pocket, hoping I might get reimbursed later, and then shipped my car to California after the repairs were done. I had my car for 5 days before I noticed that something was still wrong with my brakes.

I just picked up my vehicle again today from the Hyundai Dealership in Santa Clara, CA. They told me that the repair was done improperly, that the bracket for my emergency brake was installed incorrectly, and after putting only 250 miles on the brand new rotors and pads, I would have them replaced AGAIN. They quoted me $320 for the rotors and pads, and they wanted me to pay another $160 for fixing the bracket today. I called Hyundai customer care again, against my better judgement. They told me they would look into it. They called and left me a voicemail later saying to call back with my case number and they would tell me next steps. When I called the person said he couldn't help me because the original person I spoke with had to be the one to tell me next steps. I asked how I could get in touch with her and he said I would have to get her if I called back, or he could transfer the case back to her and ""hopefully"" she'll get back to me tomorrow.

When I picked up my car at the dealership I refused to pay the $160 ""diagnostic fee"" for them to tell me it was the bracket. I told them I didn't think it was fair to pay for brakes that I didn't break, specially when they are 250 miles old (500 miles now). The service manager Mike, threatened to take me to small claims court if I didn't pay him and took my car home.

The only person at Hyundai who has helped me was Mike, as he later changed his tune and allowed me to take my car home if I gave him a Credit Card number and promised to call him tomorrow.


Not sure where I can post attachments on reddit, but will provide service records, recorded phone call upon request.

TL;DR - When I took my Hyundai for a speaker repair at the dealership it was returned to me with Bent Rims, A Leaking Brake Caliper, and Chopped Tires. After a month of dealing with Hyundai Corporate they told me they couldn't help me (by sending me a letter telling me to stop calling them basically) and told me to go to the dealership to get the damage covered. The Service Manager told me that he knew for a fact that they didn't do anything to my vehicle, and refused to pay for anything... the worst part is, it's happening all over again.

82d9wm,1,2018-03-06,[M4F] Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/82d9wm/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."

For almost all my life, as far as I can remember, I have serious problems being away from home and family for too long, mainly if it’s routine (I don’t have problems like this when going out for fun, like traveling). 

This is causing me work problems, since I can’t be at work because I start to feel desperate (I can’t eat, think, I hyperventilate and want to cry all the time). It’s been one and a half years since I’m unemployed.  

At the same time I want I job to have my own money, I feel super anxious about the fact I’ll have to stay away from home for too long everyday. 



Edit: I had the same problem when I went to university. The first one I went was too far from home, so, after panicking everyday, I decided to change. The new one was close to home, but I remember having problems when I started a internship. The problems stop for two reasons: I was taking meds at the time and my boss allowed me to leave early if I get all my work done. "
82e1fx,192,2018-03-06,[Discussion] Let's Talk About Eclipse X,GMoran,jailbreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/82e1fx/discussion_lets_talk_about_eclipse_x/,"Hi everyone! GMoran ([@fr0st](https://twitter.com/fr0st)) here, bringing you an update on Eclipse X.

For those of you that are new to the jailbreak community, Eclipse X is a tweak that I've been developing and maintaining since iOS 7 was jailbroken in 2013. Since then, I've been working on maintaining this tweak for all iOS releases up to iOS 11. It's my pet project, and although I've found myself with less time on my hands to work on it (due to school and a newly-obtained internship), I've always been happy to provide updates.


I've gotten a lot of feedback for EclipseX, so I thought I'd make this post and answer a lot of frequently asked questions. 


If you don't see your question answered below, comment it. I'll try to get to everybody!

**Beta 8 Changelog?**

* Temporary hacky fix for music search bar (until I actually fix it)
* Fix the AppStore search bar
* Fix a crash inside Safari when typing certain queries
* Support for Notes.app
* Support for Snapchat text chat
* Better night mode support for Cydia
* Completely refactored Eclipse for better performance/usage
* Rewrote my initializer code for better stability 

**When is [common issue] going to be fixed?**

* Many issues with third party apps. Many apps don't adhere to Apple's UIKit design. Support must be explicitly written for these apps. I promise to work on more third party app support in the very near future!

* Some people report a camera glitch. I cannot seem to replicate this. If you are experiencing this bug, please contact me via Twitter DM. I'm determined to solve this issue ASAP.

* Some system app glitches. I promise I'm working really hard on those. Apple made a lot of changes in iOS 11.

**NoctisXI Support?**

* I'm not particularly happy with people trying to decide whether NoctisXI or EclipseX is better. Nor am I happy to have this be turned into a competition. My intention is not to compete with LaughingQuoll, which is why we originally agreed to not interfere with each other's work. However, it's a free market, and I have no resentment towards him. 

* Regardless, LQ and I are working together to make sure EclipseX and NoctisXI are fully compatible with each other, simply because it is in the best interest of the community. 

**Why isn't there a whitelist?**

* AppList has not been updated to support iOS 11. Therefore, I cannot enable that feature for you guys. Once AppList is updated, I promise I will enable the feature.

**Why don't you respond to my tweet/email/DM?** 

* I see all your messages, but I don't have time to respond to everyone. Sorry :(

**I donated. When am I going to get my complementary copy?**

* First of all, thanks for your generous support! I promised all my donors a copy of EclipseX upon release, and I will come through! 

Here's how it'll go down:

* Once Cydia Store purchases are enabled on iOS 11, I will promptly email every single one of my donors and request their Cydia ID#. The email will explain how to get a Cydia ID, in case you don't know how.

* Once you respond with your Cydia ID, I will credit your account with a copy of EclipseX in roughly 24 hours or less (I will be doing gifting in waves). 

**Is EclipseX going to be a free update?**

* A lot of work has gone into Eclipse X. For the past 4 years, I've been bundling Eclipse 1-4 (four years!) for a one-time fee of $0.99. 

* With that said - EclipseX will more than likely be an entirely new package, at the low price of $0.99. 

**Conclusion**

* That's all from me for tonight. I'll try to get back to any additional comments, and as always, thanks for your support! The community has always treated me well (for the most part) - something 16 year-old me could've never imagined when developing Eclipse 1.

I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid."

I'm finishing my BA in networking with some c and Java programming experience (i don't have a favourite between the two as of now) and I'm looking for a place to start looking for career paths that would involve programming ,I didn't think id like to code as much as I do now.

My only fear is that the projects that I did in college feel very easy(reading ASCII images, decrypting/encrypting data and programming TCP sockets) and that I will really struggle with commercial programming once I find a coding related career.

I have worked for 7 months as a net engineer intern in an ISP but I didn't program at all, I was just updating an already existing PHP(as far as I was told it was in PHP) database and logging into routers and checking up IP addresses onsite and later from home via a company laptop.

My question is what are some careers or places i could look for a career that would suit someone with my networking/programming skill set

82g5qe,2,2018-03-06,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/82g5qe/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door.

Hey there, DPP! In this prompt, I'm looking to play a campaign staffer who ends up sleeping with the politician he's campaigning for. It's pretty open-ended, so you could play a variety of character personalities. My kinks include oral, anal, passionate but ""fun"" sex, young love, light teasing, facials, creampies, and deep throating."
82gior,1,2018-03-06,Antwoord op vragen van het lid Jasper van Dijk over de veranderde situatie in Turkije en vluchtelingen in Turkije,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/82gior/antwoord_op_vragen_van_het_lid_jasper_van_dijk/,"^(Vragen van het lid Jasper van Dijk &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; aan de staatssecretaris van Justitie en Veiligheid over de veranderde situatie in Turkije en vluchtelingen in Turkije. &amp;#40;ingezonden 8 februari 2018, nr. 2018Z02189&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke invloed heeft het bevriezen van de relatie met Turkije op het voortduren van de Turkijedeal? Op welke manier kan Nederland nog eisen stellen aan de uitvoering daarvan teneinde deze in Turkije in overeenstemming met de mensenrechten is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
De pauze in de bilaterale gesprekken met Turkije is specifiek gericht op het onderwerp normalisatie van de bilaterale betrekkingen en is niet van invloed op de uitvoering van de Verklaring van de EU-Lidstaten en Turkije over migratie. De Europese Commissie ziet toe op de uitvoering van de Verklaring en rapporteert daar ook met regelmaat over. Op basis van de uitvoering van de Verklaring in de afgelopen twee jaar is er geen reden om aan te nemen dat de verslechterde relatie tussen Turkije en een individuele EU-lidstaat consequenties zal hebben voor de uitvoering van de EU-Turkije Verklaring.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat heeft de recente inval van Turkije in Afrin voor vluchtelingen betekend? Hoeveel vluchtelingen en intern ontheemden heeft deze aanval tot dusverre opgeleverd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Naar schatting zijn tenminste 5.000 personen sinds het begin van Operatie Olijftak gevlucht naar regeringsgebied in Syrië. Daarnaast is een onbekend aantal mensen ontheemd geraakt, maar in het district Afrin gebleven. De inval heeft geen consequenties gehad voor de situatie van vluchtelingen in Turkije.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is uw reactie op het bericht dat de Turkse grenswacht op Syrische vluchtelingen schiet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals vaker met uw Kamer gewisseld, vindt het kabinet berichten over dit soort incidenten zorgelijk. Hoewel het kabinet vaststelt dat Turkije een zeer lange grens bewaakt die grenst aan een gebied in oorlogssituatie, is het neerschieten van een vluchteling evident onacceptabel. Uit eerdere vergelijkbare berichtgeving en de wijze waarop deze is uitgezocht, o.a. door de Europese Commissie, blijkt dat er geen sprake is van instructies dat Turkse grenswachten gericht moeten schieten op mensen die illegaal de grens proberen over te steken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat, aangezien er sinds het sluiten van de Turkijedeal stelselmatig berichten verschijnen over mensenrechtenschendingen door de Turken richting Syrische vluchtelingen, dit goed onderzocht en veroordeeld moet worden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Dergelijke berichten dienen serieus te worden genomen en goed onderzocht. Het is primair aan de Europese Commissie, samen met UNHCR om hierop toe te zien. De regering heeft hierover het nodige met uw Kamer uitgewisseld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het een verantwoordelijkheid is van de Europese Unie &amp;#40;EU&amp;#41; om zoveel mogelijk te garanderen dat er geen mensenrechtenschendingen richting vluchtelingen in Turkije plaatsvinden? Zo ja, deelt u de mening dat de EU zélf onderzoek moet doen naar de situatie daar en niet enkel mag vertrouwen op berichten vanuit de Turkse overheid? Zo nee, hoe strookt deze opvatting met de stelling uit het Regeerakkoord dat migratiedeals in overeenstemming met het internationaal recht moeten zijn?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke mogelijkheden ziet u om deze praktijken te onderzoeken en veroordelen? Bent u bereid dit in Europees verband te doen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 5 en 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de eerste plaats is een land verantwoordelijk voor de wijze waarop het omgaat met mensen op zijn grondgebied. Dit geldt in het bijzonder voor kwetsbare personen zoals vluchtelingen. Op grond van het VN Vluchtelingenverdrag  en de eigen nationale wetgeving, geldt dit ook voor Turkije. Het is dan ook niet aan de Europese Unie om hier garanties op te bieden. Wel ziet de Europese Commissie toe op de uitvoering van de EU-Turkije Verklaring. Zij baseert zich daarbij niet alleen op verklaringen van de Turkse overheid. Net als de Nederlandse overheid, laat ook de Europese Commissie zich breed informeren: naast de autoriteiten door politieke partijen, IOM en UNCHR, lokale NGO’s, academici, denktanks en diverse &amp;#40;andere&amp;#41; waarnemers. Uiteraard dient de samenwerking met derde landen op het gebied van migratie in lijn te zijn met internationaal recht. Dat geldt ook voor de EU-Turkije Verklaring.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe ziet u de werkwijze van de EU in de toekomst voor zich indien nieuwe migratiedeals gesloten worden? Wie zou verantwoordelijk moeten zijn voor de uitvoering en monitoring op mensenrechtenschendingen om ons ervan te vergewissen dat landen waarmee de deals gesloten worden zich niet schuldig maken aan mensenrechtenschendingen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals uw Kamer bekend, werkt de EU al langer aan migratie partnerschappen met derde landen. Deze omvatten onder andere afspraken over de aanpak van grondoorzaken en mensensmokkel en het verbeteren van opvang in de regio en terugkeersamenwerking. In het geval dat afspraken, vergelijkbaar met de EU-Turkije Verklaring, in Europees verband zouden worden gemaakt, moeten deze in overeenstemming zijn met het internationaal recht. Het zou wat het kabinet betreft in de rede liggen dat de Europese Commissie toeziet op de wijze waarop de afspraken worden toegepast en dat UNHCR, zoals deel is van zijn mandaat, toeziet op de behandeling van vluchtelingen. Het staande kabinetsbeleid om mensenrechtenschendingen te voorkomen zou uiteraard van toepassing blijven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het ambtsbericht uit 2013 nog altijd toereikend, gezien de veranderde omstandigheden in Turkije? Zo nee, wanneer komt u met een vernieuwd ambtsbericht?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op dit moment wordt het vanwege de steeds veranderende situatie in Turkije niet behulpzaam geacht om een nieuw algemeen ambtsbericht op te stellen. Het kabinet volgt de ontwikkelingen op de voet. Om een beslissing te kunnen nemen op asielaanvragen, maakt de IND naast ambtsberichten ook gebruik van andere  bronnen, bijvoorbeeld van openbare rapporten van andere landen en van internationale organisaties als de EU, de Raad van Europa en VN-organisaties. Ook maakt de IND gebruik van rapporten van mensenrechtenorganisaties als Human Rights Watch en Amnesty International, en informatie afkomstig van de Nederlandse ambassade in Turkije.

( Also, this is not a requirement for the company i´m working at, i think using linux i will improve my typing / coding skills and completely get away from gaming ) What you guys think?

What you guys think should i completely remove windows and 
install Arch on SSD or should i Dual Boot?

Career prospects?,searedd21,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/82hcpo/rising_3l_summer_and_not_at_a_firm_career/,"So, it's fair to say your rising 3L summer is pretty important for your next possible job. I've applied to countless firms, organizations, agencies, and departments. I need to make my decision soon, and it looks like I will not be working at a firm this summer. I have an offer with my City's (it's one of Americas 15 largest cities) legal department, a local civil rights non-profit organization, and I have a interview coming up with my States department of homeland security chapter. 

I need to make a decision, but I want to be in an internship that would help me get a career. I'm currently a 2L and this upcoming summer is very important. Thoughts? 

I have an interest in working in politics and all of these routes could lead to future political work.. But which internship would mostly likely give me a career as an attorney after I graduate ? "

We added a section of this post where we explain how the chart works since some people thought the chart would be based on individual streams or plays of the people who signed up for our charts. This is not the case. 

We established the rules already when we first debuted the Hot 50 (back then, it was Hot 40). But we decided to add this section of the post every week to prevent any further confusion about how our chart works.

Hope we made everything clear!

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

82i5nu,7,2018-03-06,I just joined the SAHM club and I’m both thankful and excited.. Simutaneously being a walking anxiety attack... Desperate for 💰 advice!,Metacognitivee,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/82i5nu/i_just_joined_the_sahm_club_and_im_both_thankful/,"Hello! 

I just signed up for Reddit less than an hour ago. With that, please excuse any obvious noob-ness. My writing skills are intermittently good and usually really bad. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I say this, because the writing on here is so articulate, and very inspiring. Reddit is fucking awesome. The community and support is one of a kind. I’m so happy to have found it in the midst of a identity crisis.. I wish I found it sooner!

I’m twenty-three years old, mom to my five month old DD. She makes my heart feel likes it’s going to burst open from the love and warmth every day.  I’m married to my DH, who is an awesome partner. We live on the same property of my MIL and FIL, I have so many good stories I can’t wait to share.😈 

(I really like emojis.)

What I currently need to get out into the internet universe is how desperate I am trying to find a way to make money while also being a stay at home mom. I bet so many women know this struggle. 

I always thought I would be a working mom. That’s the thing! Everything I thought motherhood would be completely changed the second I got pregnant. People who don’t have kids, or have never been pregnant, are absolutely-fucking-clueless. I graduated high school early because I attended a cool independent study program. I will give a little background info later about why I didn’t go to a normal high school. I enrolled into a private college immediately for an accelerated program to get my associates in veterinary technology, to then go on and become a licensed medical professional about a year later. Twenty years old, and I worked my ass off with school and internships to get a decent 9-5 job. I was totally a workaholic.. until I was three years into my job, had a huge workload, and a skill set that made my boss up to $10,000 in revenue a month (that didn’t cost the practice anything) and i couldn’t make more than the In-N-Out employees in the same town. I made $22,000 that year. While still owing $28,000 in student loans. WTF. I was livid, I was mad that not just myself was paid this shitty but EVERYONE was paid shit. My mentor had worked for that practice 16 years, taught me the skills that could make the practice up to $10,000 monthly, and she took home 30,000 that year. I was to young and naive to stick my nose in it, everyone else just stood by and took it. It wasn’t right, so I presented the owner the data on appropriate pay wages based on clinic size, benefits, etc. I had two veterinarians to write letters to back me up. I was just asking for a raise for myself and the other technician. I showed them how our skills that no one else in the practice offers, was so profitable. They were not happy... 

I turned in my notice and got a job with a 60 minute commute to make more money.. but they were worse. I got pregnant. And what transpired at this terrible place is for another post.. Let’s just say the manager at this practice was a technician but only managerial experience is owning and a cupcake business. She put my unborn baby at serious risk when it came to gas anesthetic in the practice. She reprimanded me for keeping my baby safe. I ran and never looked back after that day. Putting my baby at serious risk was the last straw following various illegal encounters with that manager.. But I got a job working from home! Utilizing my license! Perfect! 

Until I got laid off about a month ago. Fuck... 

My DH is an amazing mechanic, seriously he blows my mind. He is a genius is my eyes and his knowledge is so rare around here honestly. This skill and his values are so admiral. It makes up for him being quite the pain the ass. He works for the school district as a mechanic but his job alone can not pay for our bills, because we use to make $60,000 annually together!! We have car payments, credit cards, student loans, and then all other living necessities... 

Can the Reddit community offer any advice on what I can do to stay at home with my baby but help provide? I can’t return to the veterinary medical field, the pay is shit and an ugly abusive field in my opinion. There are some great practices out there, but a lot treat their employees like shit, just saying. 

I have Major Depressive Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. It has been really severe at certain times in my life, but since I was 13 years old (due to childhood trauma) my life has been an up and down rollercoaster struggling with mental illness.. But these days due to working everyday and having a great psychiatrist, my mental health is good when it comes to my depression. But my anxiety has never been so bad. I’ve never been unemployed. I have the best baby in the world not to brag. But we need money. But my illness makes it ten times harder to go out and get a job anywhere, especially new. I try not to make excuses but recovery is also being honest with yourself. I want to work but I know this will not be good. I need to make it work another way. 

Gawd this is long, if you’re here. Bravo. And thank you.  Any support or advice is welcome. I’m going to end here cause my baby is whining at me to entertain her, but she’s cute and I bend at her every whim. "
82if3u,1,2018-03-06,[Budgeting] I am a 20 year old student trying to develop a budget due to high tax return and high salary for upcoming internship,urmomdotgov,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/82if3u/budgeting_i_am_a_20_year_old_student_trying_to/,"Hello! I am a 20 year old college student studying Computer Science. I am trying to develop a monthly budget.
My current income is $132/ week, for a monthly income of approximately $528.
I am covered under my parent's health insurance, and my rent is covered as well, so my expenses for the most part are groceries, dog supplies (just food and treats mostly), and miscellaneous expenses such as coffee/eating out on dates/etc.
I created a budget on Mint for monthly expenses, but could use input on it.
The budget is as follows:

Coffe Shops: $50 (I know this is high but I am on campus usually at least 8 to 10 hours a day without the opportunity to go home and without a meal plan, so this covers coffee as well as food if I am really hungry)

Groceries: $200 (Also includes other necessities like toiletries, cleaning supplies for apartment, etc)

Other Food &amp; Dining: $40

Pet Food and Supplies: $60

Gas money and Mscellaneous car needs: $90

Lyfts and that sort of thing when needed: $40

Mscellaneous other or savings: $48

I could use insight on how to tighten my budget to save more. 

Additionally, in terms of long term budgeting, I am expecting a tax return of approximately $900. I also have a 10 week summer internship this summer (40 hours per week), paying $35/hour, with a $1000 signing bonus, 401k with employer matching up to 4% (if I contribute 6%), and paid sick days. This is a lot of money coming in and I could use long term budgeting advice on how to handle that money. I plan to keep the same budget for the summer as I use right now, with possibly more budgeted for gas as my commute will be 15 minutes each way.

I also have student loans to pay for college:

Federal Loans totaling $19500

Salle Mae student loans totalling $20,228

Discover student  loans totaling $21,866

(I know this is a lot of loans =/. I was not accepted to my state's state school, and my current schools program was really good for what I wanted to do). I am a Junior so I only have 1 more year, and I do not expect to need to take out a very high loan for my final year.

Any advice on monthly as well as long term budgeting would be appreciated.
Should I be investing some of my summer money into retirement? Building savings? Putting it toward student loans? I am lost and I did find the sidebar information particularly helpful in figuring out what to prioritize. Any insight is greatly appreciated."

82ip3b,89,2018-03-06,How Living With An Overly Judgmental Person Can Cause Suicidal Ideation,workerdaemon,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/82ip3b/how_living_with_an_overly_judgmental_person_can/,"In my last post I mentioned my FILs patronizing nature over tea, something he was clearly overlooking was a passion of mine. I mentioned how I had become suicidal during my time living with him and someone had posted a dismissive comment regarding it. Although I didn't read the comment because the mods removed it, it got me thinking: I really don't blame anyone not understanding how one could develop suicidal ideation while living with such a person as my FIL.

Let me try to explain it to you.

From my understanding, suicidal ideation comes from two paths: 1) extreme pain, and 2) depleted self worth. When pain becomes so extreme, suicide can seem like the only way to make the pain stop. I think this is the type of suicidal ideation that most people are familiar with. Suicide is more understandable for a person in a physically injuring situation who is fearing of future injuries. It makes more sense for that person to consider suicide as they are attempting to escape actual physical pain.

The depletion of self worth and the suicidal ideation that comes along with it is much more difficult to understand. We like to think that our self worth is completely within our own control, and the idea that someone else can effect that in any significant way is difficult to comprehend. But, its true. One's self worth can regularly fluctuate and it can be directly influenced by those who surround us and how often we come in contact with these self-worth-draining people.

Defining our value in society is not clear cut. There are such a huge plethora of different ways to bring positive value to society; many of which are incredibly difficult, if not downright impossible to quantify. We therefore have a tendency to fall back upon a few objective traits you ""must have"" in order to be a ""worthwhile member of society."" This post will focus on the dynamics of living with people, and the traits you ""must have"" in order to be a ""worthwhile member of this household.""

# Sharing a household

Maintaining a house and living together is a group project. Entropy is inevitable so things need to be cleaned and repaired. People need to eat. Food and household supplies need to be purchase. Additionally, people live their lives in this space. People watch TV. They walk around. They work on projects. They listen to music. They figure out the ideal temperature for themselves.

In a group of healthy people with a respect for sharing living space with each other, this isn't much of a problem. They figure out how to share household maintenance, cooking, and shopping. They figure out how to share the living spaces so everyone can peacefully enjoy their lives. They figure out how to share the temperature so everyone can be comfortable. The default appears to be to try to share everything equally: everyone does each chore in rotation; they agree how to split up and share the living spaces, and have noisy hours and quiet hours; they have a discussion about temperature management. Others do things more organically, just automatically evaluating each person's strengths and weaknesses. One person does more shopping and cooking, another person more cleaning, and while another person still may have much fewer duties because they are sick or in school or struggling with an important project at work. Generally these people are flexible and sympathetic for each other and automatically adjust around each other's needs. When someone feels overly burdened or things are unfair, they'll speak up and have a rational conversation about it.

When an equilibrium *cannot* be found, the problems maintaining one's self worth abound. One way this can happen is when one or more people are inflexible, don't have the capacity to understand other people as unique individuals, and/or inflate their own experiences as more important than others. In this case, the inflexible person (or people) have a rigid idea of how household maintenance and living spaces should be done, and any deviation to that means you're not pulling in your fair share.

Not pulling in your fair share means *you are a drain on this household community.* You are not giving enough to be worth the imbalance. No matter the reason why this imbalance occurred, you are, right off the bat *worth less* than the inflexible person dictating the rules. It's a shot against you, it's a piece of damage against your psyche and now you have to repair it. You have to take some time to repair that damage. *Time* that an inflexible person likely doesn't comprehend that you need. They'll just shoot you again before you've repaired the prior damage.

The problem is when these inflexible people don't have the capacity to see *why* you aren't ""doing your fair share."" It could be because:

* **Their expectations are impossible for even above average people to achieve.** My FIL believes the primary woman (first my MIL, and now me as the wife of the youngest son) must do all cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, laundry, plant maintenance, and clothe alterations (e.g.: woman servant). The cleaning responsibility is especially high for him because he had a ridiculously energetic bored wife who fastidiously cleaned every corner of the house constantly. My go-to example of this extreme cleanliness is that he expects *all garbage cans to be cleaned every 6 weeks.* He has a 5 bedroom, 2 livingroom, 2 dining room, 2 car garage house. Its fucking huge. That's a lot to clean.

* **There isn't enough time.** Everyone has their own life and responsibilities that are separate from the household. We all have our own things we need to get done to maintain our life, which my FIL doesn't quite grasp. His wife had *nothing* to do but to cook and clean, so he doesn't understand how I could have any responsibilities outside of cooking and cleaning since I don't have a job.   My husband's office is a 90 minute commute from FILs house. There isn't much more that can be done in the day. We basically only have the weekends to get anything done, and there just isn't enough time! Especially when we add in the fact that FIL expects us to take him out on a date and entertain him every weekend -- that leaves even LESS time.

* **You don't have enough energy.** Some people have an almost never ending supply of energy, and they just don't understand people who have a finite supply. They don't understand why you can't go straight into the kitchen after commuting for 90 minutes and cook a meal and then do all the dishes afterwards and have enough energy to then also do another chore. My FIL doesn't nap and sleeps only a few hours a night, while both my husband and I regularly take naps after any significant activity. He just doesn't grasp that activities can be physically draining and require more time recuperating. He also doesn't understand introversion and that we can't go out and do things every day because it's just too exhausting. Sometimes things are stressful in life outside of the home which just saps all your reserves making it more difficult for you to find the energy to contribute to the household.

* **You're sick.** This is the problem FIL has with me. I have an invisible illness. The easiest summary is ""trigeminal neuralgia"", but I've also got diagnoses on my file for New Daily Persistent Headache, Status Migrainosus, Chronic Daily Migraine, and Fibromyalgia, plus every symptom where I could probably be diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Sjogren's Syndrome. I'm just fucking sick as a dog. But they're all invisible illnesses and my FIL doesn't grasp one iota of my health problems. He seriously thinks I should just buck it up and get over it and do my womanly duties to be the woman servant of the household.

Remember, whenever I wrote ""he doesn't understand"" that means ""he gets irritated at us."" We did something wrong. We didn't meet his expectations. We're at fault. Something is wrong with us. We're flawed. We are worth less.

Every time he points out that I'm not being a woman servant wears down my self worth. Every time he points out that I am not holding up 1/3 of the household duties is like a slice against my self worth. Every time this happens I need to take time to repair my self worth -- but when you're living with such an inflexible person, it is very easy for the damage to outpace the repairs. Once self worth becomes too damaged, suicidal ideation starts up. Once one's self worth has been completely depleted, death occurs. Humans are social creatures. Why exist if one cannot be a net positive to society?

Another form of damage to self worth is the inability to share living spaces. It's exposing how much of a burden your existence is to another person. My FIL cannot share the living spaces of the household.

* **No noise.** He has an open air office that sits above the entire house. It's a panopticon. He can see and hear all. He *hates* noise. He watches TV on silent. He also doesn't like to wear noise cancelling headphones. He doesn't like to hear doors open and closing. He doesn't like to hear people in the kitchen. He wants it to be *fucking quiet.* That means walking around the house, living, doing things is a burden upon him. He's like ""read a book"", but reading books triggers migraines. He's like ""wear headphones"", but the weight of headphones on my head triggers migraines.  I would like to be able to rest and recuperate watching TV. But nope, not in the living room. So, we put a TV in my room. But... you know... relaxing in the same position that you sleep in is actually really draining. It just makes me feel in a funk. I therefore, just can't be the healthiest I can be with his rules. He's so inflexible he refuses to try to figure out how we can live together. No, he must sit in his panopticon all day. He must never experience the irritation of noise. I must make sure he is never uncomfortable. Therefore, since it's inevitable to make noise, walking around the house is very stressful because I know any false step will irritate him. Existing is starting me off on a net-negative on my self worth.

* **Must be hot.** It's been a constant struggle with the heat. Even during the record breaking heat over labor day where it was 88F in the house he refused to allow me to put the AC on. On top of that, this inflexibility on temperature has brought to light that I have serious problem self regulating my body temperature (I'm seeing a doctor who is investigating the problem). I never noticed it before because *no one* has ever been so inflexible on temperature. I have always worn layers and I take them off and put them on constantly. I am frequently opening and closing windows. This has always worked for me. But, nope. Not with FIL. After struggling with the thermostat and him putting his foot down that I'm not allowed to touch it, I started opening windows and running a fan. The fan actually aggravates my trigeminal neuralgia, so this has been a huge struggle and directly contributed to me being more sick than I needed to be (and therefore less able to contribute to housework, and therefore worth less). We tried opening up more widows in other rooms around my bedroom to set up a cross breeze, but he forbid it because it made him too cold. I seriously don't understand why he can't put on a sweater. He actually got mad at us once because he had to put on a sweater. But when I overheat, I get *really fucking sick.* I get dark on my peripheral vision, feel faint and unbalanced, and need to strip off all of my clothing and sprawl out on the floor until I cool off. I've even had to go through periods of carrying around bags of ice in order to be cool enough to prevent fainting. He expects me to do all of the housework, but won't allow me to set a temperature so I am *physically able* to do the housework! I'm just a failure of a human being. Nothing about me works properly.

It is a very rare household where everyone can live their lives without disturbing another person at all. Therefore, households generally figure out how to minimize irritating each other so they can all live their lives. If there is a conflict, they gauge the harmfulness and/or helpfulness of the action between each effected person and figure out a solution. Sometimes it's limiting activities to certain times, or the effected person removing themselves during the activity, or even banning the activity because it is deemed the harmfulness greatly outweighs the helpfulness.  For the inflexible person, however, especially one with difficulty grasping the experiences of others, there is no discussion. The action is wrong, their experience regarding the action is all that matters, and therefore you are at fault. You are flawed. You are worth less.

# Socializing with members of the household

Judgmental people can also have problems with just normal socializing. The same inflexibility in managing a household can often appear when socializing.  They may have more likelihood to outright state what they think is wrong about you. This can be additionally harmful to your self worth because you are in frequent contact with the people you are living with.

 In the example of my FIL:

* **My tea is automatically crappy.** I'm white, therefore I must drink English Breakfast tea (I don't, and this is really offensive for Gong Fu Tea enthusiasts). The tea he himself gave me, telling me its good tea, becomes automatically crappy tea just because it's mine and he had forgotten he gave it to me. Picking up every canister of tea and saying it's bad one by one by one is very demoralizing in the face of a hobby you're passionate about.

* **He must tell me I'm wrong frequently.** Even on topics I objectively know more about than he. One classic example is our argument about internships for an architecture career track. *I went to school for architecture* and they *drilled it into our brains the process to earn an architect's license.* But my FIL had to know more than me about business *in general* and insist that I was incorrect. He'll even go so far as to [deny my own experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/6q01d8/fil_denies_my_experiences_happened/).

* **He doesn't allow me to contribute to the conversation**, preventing me from earning some social recognition. [He will literally talk for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/82hyly/fil_talks_for_me/), or flat out not react to the fact that I've said anything at all while simultaneously blocking any one else from being able to react to my statements.

So not only am I worth less because I don't take on an appropriate load of the household, I am also worth less because nothing I do has any value. I am both objectively and subjectively lacking in value.

Unfortunately, these types of people are much less likely to actually demonstrate praise. It's all about what you do *wrong*. Those random receipts of praise are critical for building and healing up someone's self worth.

My FIL treats my AIL mostly the same as me, so the question came up ""Why am I more hurt by FIL than AIL is?"" The answer is because we're different people with different capabilities and different reasons for our limitations.

Lets say the dishes need to be washed. FIL looks at AIL and says, ""You're a woman, you do the dishes."" This is offensive to AIL because being a woman shouldn't mean she has to do the dishes. She can then evaluate the situation and herself:

* She can say, ""No, I don't feel like it. Just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I have to do the dishes."" She will build the fortitude to withstand the onslaught of FIL getting angry with her.
* She can say, ""No, my hips hurt."" and FIL will totally understand because she's 75 years old and has developed normal aging-related arthritis.
* She can just shrug her shoulders, take the emotional hit of being smooshed into a sexist position and just do the dishes.

To her, none of these choices are too difficult for her. She has the emotional fortitude to stand up to her brother or to accept being pushed into a sexist position, she has socially acceptable health problems, and she generally has the health to just go ahead and do the dishes to avoid causing any conflict.

Now, lets say the dishes need to be washed, and this time FIL looks at me and says, ""You're a woman, you do the dishes."" Again, this is offensive because being a woman shouldn't mean I have to do the dishes. But my choices have a different burden on them: my invisible illness.

* I can say, ""No, I don't feel like it. Just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I have to do the dishes."" FIL would just blow up and counter with how I don't keep up with my fair share of the house work, which I'm only lacking because I'm too sick to keep up, and his expectations are enormously too high. My self worth takes massive damage.
* I can say, ""No, my left hand isn't working."" FIL won't say anything but will get pissed off at me for feigning this ""fake"" illness, because he's an old man, he's automatically sicker than me, and because I'm a young woman I should just suck it up, do my duty and force my way through my problems for the good of the household. I'm not strong enough to be a woman of any value. My self worth takes a hit.
* I can shrug my shoulders and take the emotional hit of being smooshed into a sexist position and just do the dishes. But my hand doesn't work. It feels like lava. I can't hold more than one dish at a time. I become upset that my body doesn't work. I become upset that I am a failure as a woman for not being able to contribute to the household. I become so exhausted from doing the dishes that I am unable to do any more chores for the day. I'm a failure. I lay in bed afterwards and consider death.

The biggest problem I have, then, is having a limiting condition that no one sympathies with. My condition prevents me from contributing to my objective duties of the household. If I am so ill, so sick, that I cannot be an objective contributing member of the household *why should I be alive at all?* My self worth gets rubbed away with power sander.

# How does self worth work?

We are social creatures, so *of course* our self worth will be modified by those around us. When we are children, growing up and learning about the world, the definition of our self worth is directly created by the people who are around us. As we get older we learn to take on stewardship of our own self worth, but it will always have an opening to be modified by others in the outside world. Apple can't completely secure the iPhone from hacking, and we sure as hell can't completely secure our self worth from being poked and prodded by others.

We experience injuries to our self worth on a regular basis. This is *healthy* and *necessary* in order to grow and become the best contributors to society as we possibly can.  We make mistakes. We break things. We hurt people. We do this all the time, and *we feel bad about it.* This shame is a major driving force to make us all in a society work together.

Our self worth gets injured, we take some time to fix it, and we take some time to figure out how to be better next time so our self worth doesn't get hurt again. Then we move on. This is a healthy and necessary part of living in society. This is how we become better people.

The problem comes when the injuries to our self worth come at us faster than we are able to repair or defend it. When you're living with a particularly judgmental inflexible person these injuries can be flying at us constantly. Even when the person isn't around, the injuries can keep piling on; their words linger in our thoughts. Our self worth wears thin, and we begin to seriously question, ""Why am I alive right now? I am a net drain on society. I am hurting people by being here. I am suffering from a shame attack by being here. Maybe I should just die.""

There are objective and subjective values people have that define their self worth. Subjective ones are impossible to quantify or measure, and can even be difficult to truly grasp and understand. Objective values are much easier -- they can be measured and counted and their values compared more easily. People have a tendency to cling to these objective values as all important and even go so far as to completely reject subjective measures of value.  My FIL is one of those people who have completely rejected subjective value. He sees *only* objective measurements of contribution as a measure of one's worth (He actively prevented his children from socializing or playing games because he saw no value in it).

Objectively, I have very little value. I can barely take care of myself. I will be dependent upon other people to help me survive unless medical science can finally figure out what's wrong with me and cure it. Because of this severe dearth of objective value, I need to heal my self worth by focusing on my subjective value:

* I'm supportive. I can quickly identify when people need support and figure out the best way to help them. I help other people to heal and grow their own self worth, enabling *them* to go out and create more objective value in the world.
* I'm helpful. I try to spread my knowledge whenever I can. I take time to explain things and teach people. I continue to learn things so I have more information to spread. I believe in Open Source and Open Documentation so anyone can access anything I learn or do and use it for themselves. This helps me to enable *other people* to create more objective value in the world.
* I'm creative. I love making things, everything. Art helps make the world a better place.

These seem like small things, but I truly believe they make huge impacts. My husband is basically my care taker, but I think he's OK with it because he values so much the support, helpfulness and creativity I bring in to his life. I open a doorway to joy. To him, cooking my meals and cleaning dishes is a small thing for him to have a *subjectively* better life.

I'm on Reddit and I send off these little messages here and there because maybe, somewhere, some person, even just one person, might do a little better for having read something I wrote.

These small, yet powerful, values I offer are difficult to keep tangible and within my grasp of understanding.  It is so easy when living with FIL and getting flooded with reminders of how objectively worthless I am for me to completely forget that I can provide any value at all. It makes it so easy to get lost in the din and start to truly believe that perhaps I have no worth left and perhaps it would be better to die.

DH, FIL, AIL, AIL2, they all wish I could just withstand the barrage of damage to my self worth just to make FIL feel better. Perhaps none of them understand how difficult it is because none of them are dealing with the extra burden of my illness. I already face the fundamental question of why do I bother to exist if I can't even be self reliant. It's already a struggle to remember I have value other than what I can cook and clean. I just simply cannot withstand the additional burden FIL lays upon me.

So I needed to move out or else I may have died. I left right before Christmas, and I am doing so much better. I'm doing better enough to write a post like this, which was unheard of just a couple weeks ago. My mind is clearing and opening up.

It's OK to be different. It's OK to live life a little differently. It's OK to have different needs. FIL is the one who is providing negative value to the world, not I."

* I love the way Callie interacts with George’s family.  Also, Geroge’s family in general.  That scene where Jerry farts in the hall is hilarious.  I actually find them more likeable than George.
* MerDer – I’m enjoying how Shonda shows that relationships aren’t always sunshine and flowers.  Derek and Meredith dealing with the snoring and the bad breath issues is just hilarious and so true to life.  It reminded me of my husband and me.
* Ugh….Derek being mad at Meredith for telling Mark that the chief was resigning is beyond stupid.
* Man….f*ck Addison for “You would have made a terrible father, Mark.  And I did want a baby just not with you.”
* Ugh….Callie…..asking a man if he remembers birthdays and anniversaries IS NOT an indication of if someone would be a good father.  Want to know what a terrible father is?  Thatcher Grey was a horrible father to Meredith in that he didn’t fight to know her growing up.  
* The whole Burke/Cristina silent treatment battle is so annoying and unnecessary.
* Yay Alex for putting Addison in her place.  “You think I want to be just another intern sleeping with an attending?” 
* The fight for chief starting in Episode 13 is an enjoyable little plot device that I had forgotten about.

I can attain a job, I can work harder than ever before, I can stand in front of crowds and do what I need to do. I have anxiety over everything I do. I work my heart and soul to rid my addiction and fight my inner self that seems to remember every bad thing I have done in my life. From fighting more than one demon, I try to stop everything that gives unhealthy troubles and be perfect all the time. But every time I try, I become egar to jump right off.

82kjt3,1,2018-03-06,I just feel.......awful.,arealcatch,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/82kjt3/i_just_feelawful/,"Since this is a throwaway, i want to get a lot off my chest.

I might as well start from the beginning with what i feel. As a kid, i never really was able to enjoy it fully. I was molested by a cousin of mine around the time i was 7, and it was multiple times. I'm 23 now and have dealt with most of it, but it has taken a real heavy toll on myself and my family, and while i never really enjoyed my family, it feels like the people i could really care about has dropped. My father and mother divorced when i was very young, and that in it self doesnt mean too much to me because i grew up with that fact, and it was normal to me, if anything it meant more to my sister who is 10 years older than i am. What does mean more to me is that i was alone a lot, my mom was working full time and while i appreciate everything she has done for me, i still was alone. my sister was on her own path in life, and while we are very close now, growing up she didnt really think too much of her younger brother. and my dad at first tried to be a parent and a part of my life, but it became too often he wouldnt keep his promises of showing up to spend time with me, and even if i called sometimes i just wouldnt get through to him. it jsut made the loneliness worse. i had some friends around that time, but nothing too substantial, i still felt like there was no one i could i could really be friends with. im good with meeting new people, and i am genuinely want to be a nice person to everyone so its easy to make a connection with someone, but obviously no one is going to be friends with everyone, thats ok now but it wasnt the best feeling growing up. school was never really something i enjoyed, i wasnt bullied or anything but the way we do education just never stuck with me, so college now even is still something i struggle to care for. but that decision was made for me when i needed to work to pay for college. i worked a retail job, made money and went back, but then i needed to make money to support myself and my mom. she couldnt afford to pay the rent and bills herself, so about 2-3 years ago i got a paid internship so i could help pay bills and save money so i could buy and car and all that. things were going fine, i even got promoted to a full time position and made decent money for my age with no degree. but then last august (august 2017) the company i worked for was bought out by one of our competitors and everyone was let go. it was such a hard blow, but i thought i could at least enjoy a small bit of time since i have been working for almost 2 years there with no vacation taken. so September i take off, and October i get a job offer that blew my mind, it paid really well, and had amazing benefits and potential to make a career there, did an interview for it and all went well, but they denied me because i didnt have a 4 year degree and it was a requirement for the job. im now in the position where i have the experience but no degree, but i wouldnt have been offered the job ever if i was in college without the work experience. and since then ive applied to job after job after job, from anything ranging to desk jobs like i had to starbucks and sprint retail. nothing has come up even after interviews and such, and it feels like im just screwed when even sprint denies me but in the email says ""Although we were impressed with your background and experience, we wanted to let you know that this position has been filled with another candidate."" so now i feel like im just plain fucked. im almost out of my savings which i have been living off of to pay rent and bills and do anything else. most recently i was offered a job by a recruiter i knew for the same company that denied me for not having a degree. it was for a position that i didnt need a degree for, and i thought being recommended by a recruiter would mean something, but i didnt even get the courtesy of being told the position was filled. i had to email them and ask just for them to tell me they went with someone else. And to top it all off, the person i started dating was told me today she has feelings for someone else. she says im a sweet guy, she respects me and doesnt want to lead me on. now ill say this, im not nice to people thinking ill get something out of it, im not owed anything in life but i want to be nice to anyone because i think its what people need, and i dont care about people just for a profit, i do it because i believe in people. that said, this is the 5th or 6th person now ive been interested in that has said those same things to me, and that im ""a real catch for someone."" ive been trying to find someone for a long time now, and not just someone to have sex with, i tried that and it is not for me. i want something real, someone i can build something with. but nothing has worked, and honestly out of the dozens of times i tried to date, this was the first real date i went on. im being told im worth it to someone but it doesnt feel like it, like the next person will somehow be better, and i know i shouldnt think like that but i cant help it, i value myself a bit, but i cant come to truly love myself. feeling like im worth something to someone made me feel like it all was worth it, like things really will be ok. Its not right now, and im sure like most people will say it will get better eventually but the loneliness i feel is dragging me down, the anxiety i feel is keeping me at a distance, the bouts of depression i feel hold me down, guilt, so much. i have been seeing a therapist to help get through my past and deal with things now, and it has helped immensely, i really do want people to know its ok to get help, man or woman or whatever, its ok and it can really make a difference. but its when im talking to him and he just gives me a look, not just as my therapist but as a person and says""that is rough, and im sorry"" i just cant help but feel thankful he is helping and sad because of it all. i do try to stay positive, i do try to look for the future and make something for myself, but its a lot, even with help and good friends and my sister to lean on, its still a lot. one thing i can say though, is that i at least am happy with my sense of humor i have from all of this, and my ability to understand people has grown. comedy especially has helped, and i want to try stand up, i have told a lot of stories to people and given some short impromptu stand up to uber drivers, friends, different people. i like it, and it personally making others feel good and laugh not only boosts my ego a bit, but makes me feel good. there is so much more i could talk about, positive and negative, but i am just trying my best, and its hard living sometimes. i know this is all some scrambled feelings and not all of what i want to say will go in here, but i just needed to put this out there. i know it doesnt make sense for some of it and a lot more too. so to anyone who reads my awfully put together train of thought, thanks. and i hope youre doing well and if not, i hope you will be soon. we all need hope, and although im losing that now, it will get better, and i hope you dont lose yours the way i am now. we can all be better."

82kwr5,1,2018-03-06,Questions about Ryerson Engineering!,wantphysique,ryerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/ryerson/comments/82kwr5/questions_about_ryerson_engineering/,"Hello, a Prospective first-year student here who has just been admitted to Mechanical Engineering!


I have some questions about Ryerson's Engineering program and faculty in General. I understand there is always

Biased involved in these answers so I will, of course, get as many perspectives as possible


First, I understand that Engineering is a Rigid Cohort program. 

Is there restrictions on Double Majoring/double degree, and if so, what would 

an engineering program be limited to in terms of double majoring?


For example, What if I wanted to say:


I would like to double major in Mechanical Engineering while doing a part-time computer science degree. How achievable is this and would it be possible?


Or If I were to switch that a bit by changing that to a Bcomm program, then, how achievable and easy is that? What if I also considered something like Mathematics and Its applications?


To add to this as well, what If I wanted to pair 2 engineering majors, such as Biomedical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering? Would this be possible?


Second, I am curious as to how many internships and career resources are out there for students. For a student in Mechanical Engineering, I'm aware it comes with the IIP option. 


How much guidance does the school give in helping students find work? What about internships that are outside of the IIP program in Engineering? 


Are separate internships completely self-guided or does the school also help with that? 

(such as Resumes, career fairs, conferences/learning opportunities, career action and general direction for the major)


Third, I would like to ask about design teams. For a given engineering discipline (like mechanical Engineering) how many unique design teams can they participate in?


As well as, how much are employers involved in this? Is there a range of serious competitions to fun design teams? And will that be recognized?


I'd also like to add the question; would I be able to participate in competitions/design teams in other schools too?


Fourth, How flexible is it to switch in and out of Engineering programs?

What would happen if I, for example, wanted to move from Mechanical Engineering to

Electrical Engineering? Is this difficult?


Fifth, What about the policies on failing courses, redoing courses and semester repeats?

Are there any consequences there?


Sixth, I am also curious about the research opportunities. Generally, out of a student population out of 100, how many students are likely to land a research opportunity, and If so, how achievable is this? (In regards to year, grades, and experience)


Seventh, What kind of electives are out there? I understand that it does follow a curriculum,

but how flexible is that?


To add to that question, what are the breadth and depth of the general courses, as well as the electives?


Eighth, and last, where do many of your Engineering graduates go? Where do they work, and how many of them graduate with a good experience? (internships, IIP, and research opportunities)


Thank you very much for taking your time with this!"

so my question is do they know the difference in letter grade in bcit or do i need to specifically tell them so. also how does my part time study grade factor into my admission if it does at all, it feels really weird if it doesnt, but BCIT...

also since i am doing direct entry, thus ineligible for applying coop, i want to know how much does it hurt to not being able to find an intern upon graduation

any graduates experience on finding jobs are also very appreciated

thank you so much"

We used to work together, and yes, I did develop feelings for you, but I buried them and moved past it once it came to light that you had a boyfriend. You’ve helped me through a few rough patches. I told you how I was molested, how I was screwed with by many others. You enabled me to look past those failings, and because of that I met C*, my girlfriend.

You spurred it on, and reinforced my faith in her. You were excited for me, and I could tell. I know it’s only been three days and 2 weeks before that, and that you work ~33 hours a week, an internship, two cats and a few roommates, but I worry about you. You’ve been a great friend to me, and I care about you deeply because of that.

T, I know you’re quite busy, but I hope all is well, and I hope that you round off your degree and get a great job afterward. So proud of you. In the meantime, I’ve got goals to work toward of my own. You’ll always be venerated and respected by me. - T

P.S., C is proud of you too. She can’t wait to meet you. "

My question is if I am going for a position on the Overwatch team should a focus on making an FPS?

82lmcc,9,2018-03-06,I thought it was easy to be me in love,nayrgnahz,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/82lmcc/i_thought_it_was_easy_to_be_me_in_love/,"It’s my 8th month in Canada so far and recently I started an internship in a small town near Toronto. Part of me was excited about the opportunity of starting a new life there when I made the decision. The first day I moved in, I reinstalled grindr, looking around to see if there’s anyone interesting. I personally don’t have any strong opinion on grindr and to be honest, regardless of the fact that the majority of users merely hopes to have fun, I have met some nice guys there and we ended up being friends. It’s all about how do you use it. 

However, two months passed by like a finger snap and this time, I am shocked by the people I met on grindr. In total, I met like 3 guys, and normally while we talk, I’ll state clearly I wish to meet and talk as friends, and if anything comes up, I’d go with the flow. Among those 3 guys, one was so desperate to get a head that he literally asked me what is the PROCEDURE for me to suck people; one was ridiculously obsessed with whining about his life; one invited me over for a drink but when I got there, the entire house stood in darkness and he opened the side door to lead me in and as I entered the house, he almost dragged me to his bedroom, throwing himself on me and poking his dicks around before I figured out what’s going on. 

The last guy I met really freaked me out, yet I still don’t know his face or if he’s a living person or just a piece of lump. I then wrote in my grindr profile : I just need you to be NORMAL, thank you. Maybe NORMAL is the magical word in the town I live coz after the change of words, more people started to chat with me. I guess THE NORMAL GUY represents the ultimate mating goal of all gay men in this cute weird little town. 

That’s when I met D. We started the conversation not in a way that we feel we’d ever click. He replied slow and I was still traumatized by my last client so I was not in the mood to talk so soon. After several awkward silent moments, he apologized that he was walking the dog so he couldn’t reply on time and he sent a picture of his dog. The dog brought the conversation to a whole new level that both of us felt nicer. We ended up exchanging phone number and we called each other later that day. Everything went on well and as a smooth operator, I suggested that we meet if we have time. IF WE HAVE TIME turned out to be just that night. After work I went to his place. He welcomed me outside of his front door with his German breed super cute dog and a hug, and he led me to sit on his sofa. We talked over so much in life, found not a lot in common but we view things in a similar way. He’s well established and excellently educated, which combine to be deadly attractive to me and it was the first time for me to convince myself to go home after he offered me to stay the night.

I still remember before I finally left for home at round 3 am, he kissed me gently like he’s afraid to hurt me already, interlocked our hands on the wall and sniffed my neck, saying you smell like a baby. I know those are like very cliché but they got me all sold out. He held my hand without saying a thing, introducing me to his bedroom like what do people do after they finally let their guard down and open up to each other in the movies. I followed through with all my heart singing you and I by lady gaga. We lied down on his bed, hugging each other tightly. His hands swam around my body, but above my waist. Kisses dropped every now and then… I thought I was drunk. We did nothing more that night. It’s all about talking, hugging and kissing. Before I left, he whispered that he likes me.

I almost replied I love you like Ted Mosby did in How I met your mother season 1 episode 1 but fortunately I am significantly younger and less desperate than Ted is so I successfully stopped myself. I went home having one of the most beautiful sleep I’ve ever had in years.

The next day, he asked me when can he see me again, which proved last night was not a dream. We scheduled a day to stay the night. I can believe any detail about this: from all three dick-speaking guys to a guy with cute dog, nice house, descent job and a cute face? Too good to be true. I cant help texting to him all the time, asking stupid questions like all men in love would do. I started to be over-polite or you could say sensitive about all my behaviors towards him. I unconsciously played oh-no-that’s-not-what-i-mean-but actually-it-is. Sounds hopeless I know.

Then it was the night we planned to stay the night. Everything was so romantic and sensual. We then got on bed, started kissing. He got a little carried away that he pulled me under him, licking everything I thought I have and everything I thought I don’t. I blew him as well but I am not very skillful at giving heads. We didn’t do anal… coz I thought his was too thick and I was not prepared that night. I cumed really quick and he jerked himself out on me and we then cuddled and slept.We then did that a couple of time. I noticed the frequency of we talking has been decreasing as time goes by. Without being aware of it, I grow very needy and clingy. I am less and less of myself and I cant control. I don’t know if his “ I like you” is still there but my “I love you” is wearing off. 

I start to have doubts that do being lonely and meeting all weird unwanted guys in the town amplify my need of companion so a normal guy being nice to me is taken incorrectly as a sign of him loving me?  Or maybe this is how grindr works and no exception for me. Confused.

Yesterday we spent night together. We hugged the whole night, no kiss. I can feel his boner the entire night and I even tried to touch his junk, trying to trigger his desire to go wild but it didn’t work. I started to have fears in my mind of him getting tired of me and all that stuff like a fxxking teenage girl. I thought it was easy to be me in love, but it’s proved to be the hardest quest ever.

Or is it love? Probably not.

82luex,8,2018-03-07,Quick Rice [MF],itstartstodayxx,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/82luex/quick_rice_mf/,"“That noise, that incessant noise, I recognize it, but from where?” RRRRRIIIINNNNGGGGG!!!!!! I finally figure out it’s the phone, the old school land line style with the ever popular ringtone, Lullaby of the Banshees, on high. My mind was foggy, the room was dark, my senses were non existent, my memory was fuzzy, the few bits I could recall were….mayhem. I shook my head, reached for the Banshee mumbling something along the lines of “mmljioyhelmmcjdhfkj , can you lmahfoeij a;lkjthal;jr, or hfaoiufaj;la ;, what? nlahfopehalkth;ljlnlm……” My good friend EL was on the other line rapidly relating some story about something and someone and and and and and and, you get the idea. Somewhere in this mess of a story I heard Rosarito, Free, your name is gonna be _______. My mind snapped to. I had been on a 3 month + party tour with no end in sight, Rosarito might just be a good place to rest, or die, same thing to me at this point. 

“EL, EL….EL!” I yelled in to the receiver, “What’s this about Rosarito, me, a fake name?” EL burps into the phone, cause he’s a dick, then tells me how we are posing as interns to audit a vacation package for a fictional Company he created our Senior Year of High School (roughly 18 months prior). We were getting a 2 week, all expenses paid vacation to Rosarito, Mexico with a Freshman College party group of 40 students, 85% female at that. I had some ridiculous name like Neal Antakeit (Neal and Take it, get it, so clever, man we were stupid shits as kids). What could go wrong? Did I mention my tendency to incite Mayhem? It’s a gift. 

I packed my party kit (emergency bribe money/condoms) I was wearing board shorts, a hat, sun glasses, a T shirt with my lucky gemstone necklace. I travel light, tend to buy what I need as I go. I was ready to go, helpful, since we had to be in San Diego in less than 2 hours or we would miss the bus to the Tijuana Airport (yes, we flew Tijuana Air, utterly terrifying). Traffic laws were broken, a passenger (EL) might have dribbled in his shorts a lil’ at one particularly hairy overtake. We got on and got in, as they say. 

We were the last ones to the arrive, which was my style a the time. Make a grand entrance, meet everyone in one shot while surveying the landscape. Today was no different, EL stepped aside to let me enter the bus first, knowing my style. I waited till everyone was looking at us (after about 30 seconds of just standing still smiling) I launched into my introduction, telling the group a little about EL and myself, then followed by going around the bus meeting everyone all the while cracking jokes, not to mention flirting heavily, heavily I say. EL jumped into the act now and again to flirt here and there to establish himself as an Alpha Male (we were into this nonsense back then). It worked, what can I say, we were all young. 

We walked to the back of the bus, while I made sure to pay extra attention to the ladies who had caught my eye during the introduction. We sat in the back, alone along the long bench, just EL and I. EL proceeded to stretch out across the bench and go to sleep. I slid to the window on the opposite side to get ready for my nap. About 20 minutes into the ride, this sexy human nervously sat next to me introducing herself as Quick Rice, I started laughing immediately (she was Filipino) and I found this hilariously offensive, she told me how it was due to her introducing herself on the first day of College by saying her favorite food was Quick Rice,bam, nickname bestowed. 

Quick Rice was about 5’ with medium jet black thick hair, soft caramel skin and a voluptuous body. She was a student athlete and it showed in her toned legs, and especially her calves. Her lips looked soft and inviting, plump, I felt like satisfaction was guaranteed if I ever got the opportunity to experience a blow job from her. Her demeanor was shy and naive, with some repressed Catholic School Girl thrown in. Th this moment her face was flush, her eyes wide and sexy as hell. They were a deep dark chocolate brown, I pictured them looking up at me from between my legs, I shuddered a little. I smiled, she leaned in. ""Can I ask you a personal question?"" I smiled, figuring it would be something lame, she looked around leaning into me, she whispered. “How big is your dick?” I smiled,let the fun begin. “How deep is your pussy?” was my quick reply. She blushed, stammering, “No, really, how big?” big smile, “You can measure it if you want.” Her eyes got BIG. “How?” I leaned in close and whispered “With your hand.” Long pause. “Or mouth.” I leaned back, her face was a mix of curiosity, lust and fear. The sexual tension was enveloping us, the rest of the world disappeared. She looked around and licked her lips, unintentionally turning me on further. I raised an eyebrow gesturing at my lap with a sly head nod. She looked at my lap, then my face, then around the bus, I gently placed my hand over hers and lifted it slowly, letting her guide the direction, as I moved our hands up, she moved them towards my zipper, my heart started pounding, was she gonna do it right here? Let the mayhem begin I thought! Her hand was over my zipper, just grazing the material, just far enough to feel my heat but not actually touch my now throbbing member. She kept her eyes glued to my lap, watching my shorts jump and twitch, she was fascinated. I was ready to explode. 

The heat was radiating from her body, I swear I could smell her scent, sweet and musky. It was driving me nuts, I had to know what she tasted like, what her lips would feel like on me. My brain was frantically trying to figure out how not to fuck this up (remember the mayhem I mentioned earlier?) suddenly she moved her hand away, my heart sank, was this it? She looked around, then took my hand in hers, gently placing it between her legs, Her leggings were soaking wet and volcanic. At this point my erection was achingly painful, I needed relief and her hotness/intoxicating smell where not helping. She rubbed my fingers up and down, soaking them, letting me feel her lips through the material, the folds, the heat, each touch made her body tingle, her eyes were glassy, skin soaking with sweat, her heartbeat was visible under her neon tube top (I loved her style) her round perky breasts heaving, her nipples trying desperately to cut through the material. My fingers became slick, I started to take over, slowly circling her lips, applying pressure here, there, using my thumb to tickle her, watching her melt in front of me. It was ecstasy. Just when I thought it was gonna get out of control, she moved my hand, telling me she’d get an extra room key and give it to me when we checked in, then she got up leaving me sitting there with an uncomfortable erection and some serious fantasies. I was sure of it now, this trip was going to be epic. 

Part 2 Coming soon. "
82m5n7,6,2018-03-07,Falling back into old patterns at a critical junction in life,throwaway842902,INTP,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/82m5n7/falling_back_into_old_patterns_at_a_critical/,"I feel like everyone I know has only seen, to varying degrees, a superficial front of who I am. I don’t think anyone I know, even my mom, understands the debilitating anxiety that I spent pretty much the entirety of my life from 6th grade on getting over. I was always viewed as the quiet but generally happy kid when in reality I was just hiding my inner mental anguish. I’ve gotten over it to a large extent, but now I’m at this point in my life where everyone I know is getting ready to move on to the next stage of their lives and I’m only just now getting comfortable with the stage I’m in. I have a good amount of friends in college but while they were all spending their time joining clubs and making their resumes look good, I was just reading books, pursuing my own personal hobbies, and trying to overcome a lifetime of of anxiety and depression issues. 

Now I’m in this situation where everyone I know, especially my family, thinks of me as this very intelligent person who’s got his shit together and has a big future in front of him but in reality I have no idea what I’m doing. My resume is shitty, all I have is two summer jobs and some other largely inconsequential stuff. I can’t find an internship and without an internship I have no idea how I’ll get a job related to my degree (finance) out of college. I’m awful at selling myself to people and I’m realizing that 80% of the business world is just a function of who you know and your ability to impress people with pointless conversation. 
The realization that I’ve painted myself into a corner is only causing my anxiety and depression to return. I’m avoiding my problems again even though I know it’ll only make it worse. I don’t even know why I’m typing this right now or what I expect in response. The only solution to my problems is to stop thinking and take action, but that’s easier said than done. My greatest skill is compartmentalizing my emotions and problems and forgetting they exist until they smacks me in the face. 

I guess what I’m struggling most with is the dichotomy between the actual state of my life, and how my family and friends see it from the outside. It’s not so much an issue of living up to expectations (although definitely a little bit) but of feeling so incredibly alone. I’ve projected this false self to the world for so long that I have no idea how to talk about it with anyone (hell I don’t know how to talk about far less personal issues than this). 
Tldr; I’m supposed to be moving on with my life and becoming an adult but my INTPness is holding me back."
82m9b7,3,2018-03-07,Understanding The Significance Of Internship For Engineering Students | MITAOE,mitengg,EngineeringCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringCareers/comments/82m9b7/understanding_the_significance_of_internship_for/,"Do you know what is the biggest issue with present day engineers, they all face a dire demand of experience to get more experience. Anyone who needs to join the workforce must have some experience before they become a part of corporate crowd. But how can you have experience for something that is being taught to you in class theoretically but least significance is given to practical application of what is being taught. A practical work backdrop has huge significance as you are trying to get into job market. It is more about the cutthroat competition that is existent in all parts of the world. It is not only businesses that are standing against each other need an edge but also professionals working in same field.

Even the best friend who graduated with you will turn into a stiff competition for being in same market with you. So, where should you look for gaining experience even before you are paid for earning some. The simplest way is to go for internships. It is for this reason, all engineering colleges in India have mandated professional internship for graduating students. There are several benefits of joining a firm as an intern, for engineering students it can make a huge difference in winning or losing a job opportunity. Here are some more add ons to this argument:

Firstly, a good internship session opens you up to excellent exposure and reality of market. You will get to know how real world is different from the world of books. You will harness some knowledge, skills and how to deal with everyday problems. It will teach you the challenges that are presently harassing the complete market. Every new thing that you learn in this aspect will be highly useful and worth treasuring for a lifetime. There are so many people out there who stuck with their regular routines, need to stick to their town and attend the same things again and again. An internship can easily take you to new places and help you meet new people. An internship exposes you to a more stable and controlled atmosphere that helps one understand dynamics of market and profession.

The experience you gain while working as an intern helps shaping your professional opinions about things. It will encourage your personal growth and development proving a stepping stone for the professional inside you. It will expose you to the ins and outs of the world you will be working in  and explore what kind of career lines are available for a person of your kind. 

A good internship experience would also help in building your network  and getting in touch with other professionals in your line of work. You may give a counter argument by attending a networking event eliminating the need for internship, but it would severely restrict your chances of personally interacting with others. Participation in an internship would allow in establishing more personal relationships than the ones that will be formed at an event. Internships also provide one with multiple opportunities for building connections with professionals that can really benefit your career in coming years. 

Lastly, a job interview may provide you with chances for facing someone one-to-one but your resume will be devoid of that chance. An internship with some good firm can always provide you with some perks over those who never had the chance to do that. It can also land you an interview in your dream firm which otherwise wouldn’t be possible.

82n5xa,1,2018-03-07,Unemployment is a horrible cycle of depression and failure,MinistryOfComplaints,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/82n5xa/unemployment_is_a_horrible_cycle_of_depression/,"It starts with not knowing what you want to do after graduation. You had spent years studying a subject you don’t understand, but you try to like what you study, and hope for the best. You had tried to apply for internships, but you’re never good enough to be shortlisted. You give up, and focus on your studies. But you never do well enough to catch up with your Honours bound peers. You leave Uni earlier, with a simple Bachelor’s in hand and no idea what you want to do. 

You think you can find a decent job; low paying but with opportunity to grow. But you have no idea what field. Your Degree is so general as to be pointless, and there is simply no market for your interests. You apply for anything and everything but you dont get a reply for weeks until one day your aunt hooks you up with a friend of hers. She gets you a low paying contract job for six months, covering for an elderly woman who is dying of brain cancer. Six months later she is back on the job, tumor removed and as spry as ever. You’re happy for the old bat, but this means you’re back on the hunt for a new job, having learned nothing of use in the last six months. 

Now you’re sending out dozens of applications a day, nearly a hundred a week. You get a few replies; mostly sales positions hawking insurance or real estate. You don’t want to do that: their tactics and culture seem gross and cult-like, talking about “growing the team” and “dynamism” and “wonderful atmosphere” rather than the actual job itself. You feel disgusted during interviews at the smarmy gits, so you politely decline.

So you narrow the search to filter out these hucksters. But its been a few months and the openings start drying up, and the replies are fewer and fewer, and your temper gets shorter and shorter. Your mother says you hardly smile anymore, and the disappointment in your father’s eyes grows ever more apparent. Your siblings avoid you, not knowing if they might set you off inadvertently. You breakdown; you cry at the helplessness. 

Its been a year since you last had a job. 

You go see a doctor; you get the pills to make you feel better, at least for awhile. You take a break for a few days, which become weeks, whichc become a couple of months. Now your family is angry for a different reason. You fight and shout, but in your more quiet moments you know they are right. 

So you restart the job search, and this time you lower the bar because you are desperate. Its been a year since you worked. You see if you can get a lower end job to build your resume. You get a few hits here and there. 

You go for interviews; every interview seems to go well, but you never get a callback for a second round. A few say you are underqualified in terms of experience, even though you insist that you are willing to learn. Even more say that you are overqualified; why would a degree holder want to work in admin, or in operations? You point out that you’re looking to enter the industry first to gain experience, and most smile and nod. One interviewer speaks out: “Isn’t it too late for that?”

You try the insurance positions again; maybe its time to bow to the inevitable and become one of them slimy fucks. But they don’t want you anymore. You’ve lost the confidence needed. You’ve gained weight, you look a mess, you speak with a stutter. No you wouldnt fit in with them. They dont want you. 

You look for help with your job search, but your friends are too busy with their lives, and you havent met with acquaintances in years. You look for advice online about polishing your CV, but you cant polish nothing. You look for advice on escaping unemployability, but it only tells you what you should not have done in the first place. You look for a job coach at a job office, and she costs more than your monthly bills. You look for pro bono services, but they are fully booked till next year. You ask your local fast food restaurant if they are hiring; they say yes, but only teenagers and the elderly. Besides you have a degree don’t you?

You shrug. 

But its been two years since you’ve had a job."
82nm1o,6,2018-03-07,Two and a bit years on,polgtur,dpdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/82nm1o/two_and_a_bit_years_on/,"I feel great. I made a post around a year ago that outlined my journey and how things were going and so this is my second update that reaffirms my progress.

Basic facts:
- No childhood trauma or anything, just smoked weed in an unfamiliar environment and fucked out
- 19 years old at the time, 21 now
- Several months of sleepless nights, constant anxiety, a feeling that nothing was real, head pressure, brain fog, emotionless 
- Became entirely detached to all friends and family 
- Life sucked 

Now I can barely remember the first six months after I got dpdr. They seem like some hellish nightmare. I have no idea how I maintained the facade that I was alright. I mean, I was upfront to everyone I talked to about what was going on with my brain, but it was very hard to convey just how messed up it was. People don't understand it when you talk to them and say ""I kinda don't think you're real, and I'm currently zoned out so far I'm not sure how my husk of a body is conversing with you."" I tried all sorts of supplements, tested my blood and health way too much to try and find physical symptoms, and basically tried anything that was suggested on this subreddit. I was on here everyday, and was also on various other medical websites. Dpdr consumed my thoughts at all times. Regardless, I kept on living my life as I would have otherwise. 

In peak brain fog/head pressure months I had my first university test of the year, a 35% accounting test. I studied even though I could barely process any information. I ended up walking out of that test with an A+. That was a big moment for me. At that point I thought alright I guess that even though I feel horrific, I can still make this work, I don't have to give up on life just yet. I still did worse overall at uni that semester but I made it through nevertheless.

I had three things that helped me through those trying times. One, living my life as normally as I could. Two, keeping a detailed daily journal, which I did for 8-9 months. That was great because I had about two months without the journal where I couldn't remember the previous days lunch. Time became a weird concept, and this journal reinforced that time was passing and I was doing things. Three, I would shoot hoops for an hour or so every night with a guy I had recently befriended. This was my meditation. Also, forming a strong bond with this guy whilst I felt so detached reinforced my ability to connect with people, and made others feel more real.

The next phase, once the aforementioned activities got rid of the majority of my mental fog and head pressure + a bit of anxiety, was also aided by three things. These things were one, pushing myself and seizing opportunity. Once I realized that I could continue my life as normal I then tried to push myself, running for president of the commerce society at my uni, a pretty major responsibility. I got the role and the extra stress that came with it was more natural, real stress, taking my minds focus off of my inner battles. Two, striking up a relationship with my current girlfriend. The start of the relationship was so strange to me, I had no time for feelings of love and was not ready mentally to make a connection that deep, but I just acted how I would have normally and after a few months feelings developed and now we are incredibly close and she is my outlet to talk to about anything. Three, giving up alcohol for many months. Alcohol was my escape from the brain hell, and I would drink 3+ times a week at first. The hangovers left me feeling like a zombie, and I also started to have internal conflicts about the nature of relationships formed through alcohol. I also gave up all drugs but that was a given. Taking several months off alcohol gave me a chance to develop these drunken friendships while sober, and not having to deal with hangovers. Here's another bonus life change - I stopped reading r/dpdr and any other forums. Not focusing on dpdr 24/7 helped me out of it. It was great to have a community network to start, but not so great to become consumed by it.

So now here we are 2 years 1 month into dpdr and I feel a better person for it. I've traveled Malaysia, Vietnam, and China in this time, been president of a 700+ member commerce society, started in a relationship with a wonderful girl, enhanced my relationships with my friends, and earned an internship at a top bank. Two years ago I never would have thought this was possible.

Am I 100% ""cured""? No, probably not. I no longer have any anxiety, questions of the nature of my reality, or any physical symptoms, but I still zone out occasionally and feel the slightest visual disconnect when I notice it. Weirdly one of the most annoying things now is noticing my nose in my peripheral vision. But is dpdr holding me back? No, it is not. I have done everything I could have possibly wanted to achieve. I always thought that if my dpdr didn't get any better I would do something radical like move to Africa to be an aid worker because then at least my body husk could have positively contributed to the world, but in the end it didn't come down to that. No dramatic life changes were needed, I just needed to keep on trucking.

Now my biggest wonder is how would I feel right now if I had never smoked on that fateful day. I think I'd be a lot more oblivious to the finer details of life, and to the details of my own being. I would love to see the world through the lens of someone unaffected because I genuinely might be 100% better but I just forgot how my vision used to be. But at the end of the day I feel the spark is back in my life and I'm so happy I managed to find the light at the end of the tunnel.

I like writing these every now and then, outlines to myself how things have changed and I find it quite meditational. I also know that I was on here searching everyday for positive stories, so if my story gives anyone a sliver of hope I'm so very pleased. Also feel free to pm me if you need any advice or reassurance. 

Best of luck to you all.
Cheers"

82p036,2,2018-03-07,"Me [21 F] with my parents [50s M/F], trying to communicate desire to work further away/abroad",Miss_Pandora,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/82p036/me_21_f_with_my_parents_50s_mf_trying_to/,"Hello, /r/relationships!

Hopefully, this is a minor issue, but I hope to improve my relationship and communication with my parents a bit. I'll try to describe the situation the best I can and will answer questions if I can. Not a native english speaker, so please excuse mistakes. Sorry for the length, and thanks in advance for any advice. 

I'm a German student and will graduate by the end of this year. I'm absolutely not sure what I'm going to do after, whether to work or to keep studying, and there is a good chance I'm going to be get a job as research associate at my university. I would still like to have some back-up plans, in case this doesn't work out. Obviously, I'm going to apply to some other universities for research associate positions and to some jobs in my field (STEM) in Germany. However, I can also see myself working/studying abroad. 

Half a year ago, I finally applied to a job I've kept an eye on for two years. To me, this was a dream job. Sadly, it's located outside of Germany. The chances on getting it without any real working experience in that sectors were slim, but I tried anyway - can't get a job you don't apply for, right? As expected, I was declined. The real part of my application process for after graduation will start in a few months, I'm planning to send out applications in multiple directions: for research associate positions, for jobs in companies, for internships, maybe for aid organizations.

The real issue here: I don't feel like my parents, especially my mum, are very supportive with this. Usually, they gladly look over my applications and homework assignments (looking for spelling errors etc, not doing the actual work). I could barely get them to look at my application for that job, even less so to bring any actual help. I didn't mind, because that's not their job, but they didn't give me any emotional support either. E.g. when I was declined, my mum replied to my text informing her about this with ""Well, at least now this is over"". Comparison: When I got a good grade (which is not really counting towards my final grade though, so it wasn't really important to me) a few weeks ago, they got really excited and were happy for me. 

I've mentioned studying abroad or at different universities in Germany a few times (with a few certain universities in mind) and they were always quick to change the topic. A few days ago, we were talking about my mum's job before I was born and she talked about a colleague still working in that company, but having transfered to England. When she told us they were still in contact occassionally, I brought up the idea to intern there (which I had for a while before, nothing spontaneous), and asked her to ask him about the possibilities there. Before, she was really happy to tell us about this for more than an hour, but as soon as I mentioned that, she got very vague about it and switched the topic.

* I understand that they would like to keep me close.
* I realize that I am still quite young too move further away, but I've been studying here for almost 5 years now, and I think it's time for something new. For the exact same reason I feel like I have good chances of getting ahead careerwise before really having to settle down. 
* I also get that they think I'd really profit from staying at university to put focus on further education. I am considering this, and it's the most likely outcome, but I want to explore other options. 
* I'm aware that they are also worrying about me.

But that shouldn't keep me from looking for (and taking) opportunities, right? They are actively supporting anything I plan on doing at my current university (research associate / further studying) and are glad to talk about any ideas in that regard. They don't mind helping me with ideas concerning working in the area as well, are a little more reserved about that though. But as soon as I mention working or studying somewhere else (even within Germany) they don't seem to like the idea. I've briefly told them about not really feeling supported with other ideas than staying here, but nothing really changed. 

I value my parents' opinion a lot, and therefore this is impacting how I assess jobs and opportunities. If they like a plan I'm making, I'm more likely to follow through with it. If they don't really support it like they usually do or even try to talk me out of it, I will rethink it and most likely end up not doing it, so this may really impact where I end up working after graduation.

About me: I've moved out from my parents' place two years ago to a room in the same city (I study here because I started really young and had to live with them back then, and the faculty is really good), but come back every other weekend to do laundry. They are paying for my room, I'm paying everything else from my side job. I am really looking forward to being less (financially) dependant on them and also get some distance between them and me. I'm not looking to work abroad to get away from them, most of the time we're getting along really well and they are really supportive.

Some family background here *(in case this is somehow relevant)* : My parents are both academics in STEM field, so this is not an issue with understanding what I'm doing. They don't mind me going on holiday abroad for a week, so this is not an issue with them wanting me around all the time, either. Before I was born, my mother was working at a big company and they planned to send her to a big branch abroad. She decided to stay in Germany to be with my father and have a family (and because that job was too stressful long-term). My father stayed at university. Nowadays, they are both teaching. I'm their oldest child and have two siblings at 19 years old.

Is there any way to communicate to them that I'd like to receive more (mostly emotional) support for plans not involving staying close to them? How can I warm them up to the idea of working abroad (even just for a limited amount of time, like an internship)?

---   
 tl;dr: My parents are only really supporting post-graduation plans involving me staying near them. I'm sure they only want the best for me and I understand where they're coming from, but I'd like them to be as supportive for ideas that include me moving further away."

I am 20 and looking back I have 99% of the blue pill shit which is in the book. Everything was going fine. Till did something which RP always tells me not to do.. like someone in your workplace.

This was my first job, I joined for an internship. How irony is it did not even start as a completely blue pill but it progressed there. Actually started as fairly red pill. Saw this dumb girl who is super rich. From day one she seems to trust me. I got horny and started to touch and asked her out. She said not ready for it. Later she got interested we went out and that lead to us having a relationship. I did not have any sexual experience before. Initially what I had was to gold dig her money and use her.

We started to make out more and more I was growing addicted to her. First 3 months were horrible why? we make out and she spends a lot on me. I feel great and then the next day she breaks up with saying she is not ready and again she gets back together says she misses me. Actually, this situation got so worse her bipolar issues inside 3 months it happened like 10 times. Each time like a doormat when she wanted me back I went. This all because it was so easy for me. The first time my sexual experience. Later we both left work and currenly home studying for the degree.

That was passed, from January after 3 months she promised she wants me in her life, she loves me and will never do it again. Till now never pulled the break up thing again with next 14th it's 6 months. But that does not stop her. Things only got worse, she made me feel like ""she cares and will be there for me"" so whenever I feel sad I talk to her and rant and she comes to see me. She flakes like all the fucking time. Flaked even next week's plan. We fight and argue and then meet. Yesterday she said I am not her priority and she does not want to see me often becz then she will miss me more. I whine and tell I feel sad I need her now and come see me. I took her virginity last week. I am sick of this shit, but I too horny to leave since sex is easy.

No matter how many times I read the sidebar or anything I keep on going in the same cycle. Should I start somewhere else?

I am too turned on and the sexual part is keeping me from breaking the circle. I sometimes lose interesting other things I do such as hang out with male friends, gym and even watching a movie.

How to get detached from this slowly?

82r31e,2,2018-03-07,Problematic supervisor,Cykeee42,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/82r31e/problematic_supervisor/,"I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I am hoping for some words of wisdom from those who have gone before me.

My supervisor and I are cordial to one another, yet I am experiencing such a deep dislike for this person that I feel it on a visceral level. This individual is at best a bad therapist and supervisor. At worst, unethical, or bordering on it.

It has taken me some time to get to this point, as I have slowly put pieces together... I have witnessed unprofessional behaviors, been negatively affected by decisions and seen my clients negatively affected by interaction with this person. I have also come across information in the office that has lead me to these feelings.

So it has been a slow boil (or I am slow to see). In fact, it has taken me so long to figure out what is going on that I am nearly done with my hours and can soon be free of this person.

However, I do not feel good about my time as an intern (I have learned next to nothing aside from how ""not"" to be) and I am concerned about future association with this person. While I question some ethics, there is nothing so glaringly obvious that a board report would be warranted, or taken seriously. 

I have seriously considered taking my hours and switching to someone else, but I am not sure if it's worth it this late in the game, and I am aware there is no guarantee the next person will be better. Also, I work in a ""Big"" small town, so finding a supervisor who is not connected with mine is unlikely. Crossing my supervisor will also result in vindictive behavior towards me in the future; I have seen this happen to others.

My lack of respect for this person is beginning to show through my facade, and I am not sure how much longer I can keep it up.

Should I just suck it up and see it through? Or does anyone see anything I am missing?   I have all my hours and will be testing soon, so I am 6 months or less from licensure.

Thanks!"

I really did. I tried to do practice books, I tried to do exercises. But I hate these goddamn things. I'm not the kind of person who instantly thinks of the most efficient algorithm when I have only 30 minutes to code it. And it feels like no matter how comfortable I am with Java, as soon as I have to do it in such an environment, I choke and I'm googling basic ArrayList methods. I don't like having to vocalize my thought process every step of the way, as distracts me and stresses me out. I work best when I can sit and draw things out for a bit. I had one over the phone for the first time today, and somehow it was even worse than the other ones I've had, because the guy wouldn't shut the fuck up. If I didn't make a move for two seconds, he started blabbering on about what he would do.  I'm sure it was meant to be helpful, but few things stress me out as much as people talking at me when I'm trying to focus. And it frustrates the hell out of me, because otherwise I think I was perfect for this company. Except now they think I can't code. 

I had one technical interview where they just asked us to code a quick web application and present it to them at the interview. It was so much better as I was actually able to take time to think, and I even learned new concepts to fit the prompt. I understand the worry that people will just copy code, but it was so much infinitely better than the monstrosity that is a traditional technical interview. The technical interview does not test whether we can code. It doesn't even test if we function under stress, because when the fuck will we be writing an algorithm on a 30 minute time limit with another person breathing down our shoulder or waiting on the other side of the phone? 

The only other jobs that I know of that don't require these technical interviews are in government labs, which I am deathly trying to stay out of (did two internships in military labs, was not a good experience, and they have done little to help me get into the area of the industry that I even want to be in). At this point, I'm seriously worried that my inability to do these interviews will keep me out of jobs period. I don't know what to do. So many people tell me ""practice!"" but I barely have time as it is. Maybe, just maybe, an interview style that requires us to do hours and hours of practice in order to fit this very specific, unrealistic scenario is a *bad interview style*.

82s6im,5,2018-03-07,"Depressed, from a poor family and in debt and studying in the mental health field.",eatmenlikeair,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/82s6im/depressed_from_a_poor_family_and_in_debt_and/,"I just want to start off that I have been struggling with depression most of my adolescence and adult life. It's always in the back of my mind, like this black cloud that follows me everywhere. I try to support my parents by doing things like getting an education and trying to move up in my school. I chose the mental health field (Social Work) and knew that it doesn't pay well, but I wanted to help others. However, the more I wake up every morning and running numbers with my parents about what they owe on credit cards and debts they have, the more I become pessimistic. I know how to cope with these feelings of sadness and depression every day, but its a fight that I am always fighting and I am scared one day I am going to be tired, and I will give up. I try to reach out to friends and try to engage with them daily because I know socialization is an essential factor in dealing with the loneliness but most of them either are with their boyfriends, finances and just too busy to talk to me. I feel so utterly alone on days like this. It's snowing out, and it's very dreary. I often feel like the more I try, the harder things become. I haven't felt this helplessness in a very long time, and I am worried. I intern at a hospital with adolescents that just came out of inpatient hospitalization and are receiving intensive outpatient therapy. I hear their stories, and I want to tell them that sometimes things do get better, but sometimes they don't. Friends will fail you. The love of your life will hurt you. You will see your parents broken beyond measure. The things that you once love look so bleak. Just waking up today was such a dread. I wrote suicide notes to friends and family about six years ago. I have them in my box of letters, and I just have some comfort knowing that at least people know if things do get tough and if  I do something, that they will understand. Thank you for reading. Any words or comments would be greatly appreciated. "

I have a MA degree in International Development and a strong background in M&amp;E, data analysis and visualization and am looking for long term volunteer / intern opportunities in Colombia. I speak conversational Spanish at a high level but am not fluent.

82t3d9,263,2018-03-07,Collegiate Star League Dota 2 Admin Unfair Ruling,ThisThatSlimeShit,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/82t3d9/collegiate_star_league_dota_2_admin_unfair_ruling/,"Hey guys, Im not sure if you all know about Collegiate Star League, they host a dota 2 league for college students. I am the coordinator for the UMass Amherst team and we are being disqualified for an unfair technicality. I'm not really sure where to go since the main admin at this point is just ignoring me, which is completely unprofessional btw, I should also point out that this league is not for free. In addition to the amount of time our team put into practicing and playing in the league, it does cost 100 dollars to enter the league. If you don't know how CSL works, there are two seasons before playoffs. One seeding season in the fall, one qualifying season in the spring and then playoffs. 


Over the summer I was doing an internship abroad, an internship I should mention that was not directly connected to my University. In August I was offered to extend the internship for another 3 months, which I accepted. I emailed my Dean and she approved it and gave me academic leave. The technical term for this however is not academic leave since it was not directly connected to my University. CSL's first season came up and I played in it since we couldn't find a 5th to take my place. 


Fast forward to this semester, I am back at my university and my team, UMass Amherst, has done extremely well. We beat the last year's champion, University of British Columbia and end the group stages 5-2 in overall series. Today I go on my PC, look at the standings and we are 2-5. I check my email and the admins have reversed every single match that I participated in, even the matches this season where I was fully registered student and had a fully registered course load. When I message the main admin, nxr who's name is Ben I believe, he just says the same thing over and over again. 'You are an ineligible player, you cannot play in CSL, your team isn't disqualified we are just reversing every match you participated in'. This wouldn't hurt so much if this was not my last last year of Uni and we hadn't put so much energy into qualifying. 


Reading the rules for player eligibility, which can be found here: https://cstarleague.com/dota2/rules There is no direct rules for this case. The admins says I was on a leave of absence and this rule takes place: ""Player Eligibility"" : ""Each player must be enrolled as a full time student"" ; additionally: ""Players must be in ""good standing"" as defined by their university/program to be eligible to participate; students on academic probation/leave of absence/etc are unable to play in CSL"". However I was not on academic probation and I was not on a leave of absence, I was on a Dean approved academic leave. Something the rules have nothing to say about. It also says in the rules: ""Some exceptions to this rule are possible"" but when I tried reasoning with the admin, same response, ""player eligibility rules that were violated by your participation in matches throughout the Fall half of the season. Those violations have resulted in the enacted penalties."" In this case the penalty being complete match reversal for every match I did participate in, even the matches this semester where I was a full time student. When I ask for a refund I just get ""I cannot issue a refund, but as I said any concerns regarding your registration fee may be directed to admin@cstarleague.com. Again, I am sorry that this situation has affected your team, but I am only enforcing the rules as were agreed upon when all teams signed up for the league.""

Reddit I have no idea what to do, I feel completely cheated and the admin is no help. Its clear he doesn't want to change his decision and that they won't even refund us. I would understand if my internship was not approved by my Dean or if my internship was during this semester, the semester where games actually matter, but nope the admin has made his decision. No playoffs for my team and no refund. Thanks CSL!"
82t3f4,8,2018-03-07,Is it too early to start a third language?,eddiesoft,languagelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/82t3f4/is_it_too_early_to_start_a_third_language/,"Hi everybody, 

I'm currently studying Spanish in my free time (level B2 as of July 2017) and I am hoping to reach C1 sometime in the relatively near future. 

However being a Canadian medical student I would like to learn French to create more job opportunities both at home and abroad. I currently speak 0 French. 

This summer im doing an internship in Ecuador for a month and my original plan was to go early to brush up my Spanish to take advantage of this unique language learning opportunity. However, I recently found out about an intensive five week French immersion program in Canada called Explore that has piqued my interest. 

Is it too early to make such a big commitment to French if I haven't reached my desired level of Spanish? (Ideally I could continue practicing Spanish a few hours a week in Quebec). 

How much (if any) will Spanish facilitate my acquisition of French? Will I begin to mix French into my Spanish? 

What techniques do you suggest for simultaneously improving two languages at the same time? 

What resources do you recommend for beginning French completely from scratch? 

Cheers, 

eddiesoft

82t5d0,11,2018-03-07,I need your help,FapEnergy,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/82t5d0/i_need_your_help/,"Hi r/antiMLM,

First of all, I just want to thank anybody who takes the time to read this! Thank you!

I'm kinda of in a situation and I would really appreciate if anybody has a bit of insight on what I should do. 

So to begin: some backstory.

I once did an internship at a business. I was mentored by this really amazingly nice lady, she taught me so much and really helped me with my goals. She was selfless and humble and just an overall great person. 

However, recently I saw on her snapchat that she posted something about a special brand of makeup called Aloette? I was suspicious so I immediately searched it in the subreddit and sure enough it is an MLM. 

We haven't been in contact for a while, but I really liked her as a mentor and I would really hate for her to go down a bad road. I'm also quite close with the owner of the business's family so I don't want to brute force the truth or anything because that might mean burning bridges.

Additionally, I don't even live in the same city that I interned in so I can't have a face to face conversation with her, which is what I likely would have done. 

I want to say something, but I don't know how. I've thought about it and I wanna try having a conversation with her. I want to try and direct her in a way to critically think about what she really is doing and whether it's the best for her. I don't wanna just straight up tell her she's being scammed because I feel like most people would reject such a harsh statement. But perhaps hint at it. 

I don't want to go after her, I want to help her. And frankly I'm quite stumped on what I should do. The stuff I said above is mostly just some mental vomit so I could be approaching this totally wrong. 

If anyone on here would like to provide some of their own insight, I would really gladly appreciate it.

Thanks guys. 

EDIT: I am in Canada if that helps, idk if Aloette is in the US as well?"

I've been lurking on this subreddit for several months now, and you all are the way I relax and seek advice from each day. I finally created an account to share with you all and seek some advice of my own. I am getting married in a couple months, so this is my fiancé's FMIL, but my mother. I apologize for the long post ahead, but I've got a lot weighing on my heart I want to share with you.

A little vague back ground- my mom was adopted and her parents made her the SC- her brother was the GC for sure. She got married super young, he was embezzling from his job, they divorced, she met my biological father and he said ""It's okay, we can have sex because we're gonna get married"" (She's religious) then when she got pregnant with me he abandoned her (but he is still a part of my life... long story). She spent the first three years of my life a single mother struggling through college before my BioDad and his new(now ex) wife wanted to try to get custody of me. My Dad (Man who raised me) proposed to her in the midst of this in order help her and protect me. So that's all the background info I think is necessary!

So growing up we were pretty poor, but I got to do everything that I dreamed of, whether that be activities, learning abilities. etc. My parents really believed in my dreams. My mom told me all the time growing up that I was really special and she felt that God had a great purpose for me. I have four younger siblings, but they are all products of my parents, while I am the only one who is not. Other siblings also got great opportunities, but when they did not exhibit the same passion for them as I did, my mom would get very upset. She definitely conforms her personality to whatever her children are being successful in (More on that later.) 

So I think the main reason I am different than other GC talked about here is that I rebelled- in small ways, but I certainly challenged authority. I would continuously be out from 7 am-10pm going from before school rehearsals, school, after school play rehearsals, then to ballet rehearsals, I don't know how I made it through high school honestly. But I was expected to text my mom every time I left and arrived anywhere. Something so simple, but I HATED it. I am a very individual person and I do not like having my privacy invaded. I don't like being pestered about my life. So this would cause small fights every so often. She would also want to read my texts, and this infuriated me because I don't do anything that would warrant investigation (She has recently admitted to me that it was unwarranted because I was a good kid and didn't give her reason... so progress?). Even she would tell you that the most recent worst thing I've ever done is when I told a lie to get someone else in trouble in the second grade. She was very supportive of me however in everything I did, even when I moved churches on my own to a church that better suited me. Our old church was terrible, and they ended up moving to my church two years later. By comparison, my younger sister right below me is the SC. YS1 is always doing something wrong. Always a habitual liar, fooling around with boys, you name it. YB1 is very intelligent and recently has been making a lot of bad choices and its been a very traumatic time dealing with those things. It breaks my heart because he is the sibling I'm closest to and I can't be there to help him. YB2 and YS2 will come into play later. So anyway, back to my independence...

I went away to college, and it was hard on my mom understandably. Luckily I was going to school an hour and a half away, and this allowed for controlled damage to an extent. But she was texting me every single day wanting to talk about my day, hear about what I was doing, and we would get into fights on the phone every single Monday because I wasn't talking to her like she wanted me to. It was a really tough time in my life personally outside of this, and I really distanced myself. At the time I could say it was probably just LC. But the real tears came a year later when I participated in an internship that was halfway across the country. She was happy for me, but she sobbed as I was packing up my car and leaving. I didn't have a care in the world. I did the internship, came back and finished my last two years of college (Picking up D(ear)F along the way!), and for the most part have been able to avoid family drama. However this is where my GC-ness comes into play...

I am told by my siblings that the house was even more toxic than it was when I was living there. My mom struggles with anxiety and depression, my dad got cancer (He's all clear and okay now!), my mom was so afraid he was going to die, and she would shut herself in her room and lay in bed for days. Couldn't be convinced to do anything. I feel like my YS1 got more and more grief, and she kept making bad decisions that would feed into that grief. My mom really takes things out on her. Things were so bad at home for a while that my dad confessed to me that if things stayed like they were, once my siblings were out of the house he wouldn't stay with her anymore. I am knowledgable about my absence in the family dynamic really affected my siblings, and it hurts me honestly to even think about it, so sometimes I just try not to at all costs. I know, this isn't always the right choice, but its hard.

Recently the things I mentioned with my YB1 came to a point that he had to get professional help. With that came counseling. This was a HUGE help in the family atmosphere and my parents are doing so much better. However, my YB1 went cold to my mom and I later found out this was because at the end of their therapy where they owned their mistakes and apologized for them, she didn't take accountability for her behavior and responsibility in the families problems (I think when my dad started to discover in therapy about his anger issues and really began discovering, confessing and owning his flaws my mom latched onto that as THAT was what the problem was while being afraid to accept her responsibility). 

In our sibling only counseling session, it was pretty much a bash mom fest. My siblings certainly had a lot to say, and they told me this frequently throughout the past five years and also in this counseling session, ""You weren't home. You don't know what it was like."" But my siblings all love me, and don't have distain for me as a person, if they have disdain for the way my mom treats me. One thing that was brought up in the counseling session is YS2 is the do-over me. She is interested in a different activity than me, one that my mom previously had no interest in. However, my mom is now a number one fan. Very supportive, making my sister eat super healthy to stay in best shape, helping her succeed in any way she can. She definitely thrives off her children success. At the end of the day, my mom isn't as bad as many JNs on this subreddit. But my position as GC makes things particularly hard to deal with sometimes. 

I mentioned I'm getting married in a couple months. I am wildly behind on planning, living 1000 miles from my DF because he's finishing school, planning a long distance wedding from my location back home, and I am dealing with so much grief of not including my mom more. They are paying for it which I am immensely grateful, but my mom is the kind of person who just kind of wants to sit there and watch the fun stuff happen, instead of volunteering to do work. After my most recent ""In trouble"" Conversation which led to me sobbing in DFs arms from the stress, I asked my mom to help come up with what to say for the invitations. She said she would love to do that. 18 days later when I needed to get that info to the designer, I texted her and asked her if there was anything specific she wanted said and she said she didn't care, so I did it myself. I am doing every single thing planning this long distance wedding by myself while working a full time job and I am expected to communicate every detail to a passive person who pouts when they are not reaching out to me to help. I would LOVE help honestly. (DF helps as much as he can, but he's been truly too busy I don't hold it against him) But I'm not great at asking for help. The other day I was talking to my dad about the invitations deal when including them was mentioned, but my mom joined the conversation and conveyed that she didn't understand that I was asking her to come up with the words (Clearly conveyed, but ok). I have struggled with depression this year enough being on my own and I just want my wedding to be a nice fun event where I don't have to feel like I'm being guilted for not being inclusive enough of anyone, or have to worry about a big sob fest when I get married. My dad is a Justyes, so I am wondering if I should talk to him about these concerns. 

You all are the wisest people I know in regards to these situations, and I welcome any advice. I apologize this is so long, I tried to cut out as much as possible to keep it shorter, but I guess I needed vent therapy more than I realized. Apologies to your llamas as well that it's not the juiciest drama.

Edit for clarities sake: I am not wishing my mom specifically would help with the wedding planning. That was more so me just wishing I wasn't doing it alone, so my apologies since it was kind of off topic. "
82u968,4,2018-03-07,"Growth Potential (Unofficial, Fanfic)",Kings_Rook,PhoenixPoint,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixPoint/comments/82u968/growth_potential_unofficial_fanfic/,"Doctor Larissia Lazlow looked through the checklist on her clipboard.  It was filled with growth statistics and botanical data.  She flipped through a few of the pages before looking out over the balcony high above the main column of the hydroponics building.

The main column actually consisted of the aeroponics section.  Large trays of plants were connected to a vertical lift mechanism that cycled the plants from the ground floor, up to the roof, and back down again.  The ground floor was where the inspecting, pruning, harvesting and planting was done.  After a tray was inspected, the mechanism moved it the next tray into position.  There were 12 lifts spaced three wide and four deep to cover the square room.

The roof of the building was thick glass with grow lights suspended from a gantry just below it to allow plants to be grown year round.  The exact height of the lifts had been calculated so that it was a reasonable approximation of the temperate summer day-night cycle with regards light access on the lifts.

The lifts contained eight separate species of plants at the moment: wheat, oats, barley, peas, corn, leeks, peanuts, and potatoes.  There was debate amongst the agriculture section of the haven on whether to increase variety for better morale, or to try to increase the yields so people could eat more.  As head botanist Larissia was on the fence.

Satisfied with the way the growth and maintenance of the aeroponics bay, Larissia moved on to inspect the hydroponics areas.  Though technically aquaponics, everyone just called it hydroponics.  The hydroponics areas were maintained on the top three floors of the building.  They all had glass windows and grow lights to provide the needed light in all seasons.

A further twenty species of plants were grown there, along with four species of aquatic life and eight marine species, again for variety.  The marine species needed the most tank space, and were the hardest to maintain, but were very much a favourite amongst the residents.  It helped that they were pretty to look at.

On the ground floor and in the basements were the old school agriculture.  It was mostly mushrooms and other plants that couldn't be grown hydroponically or aeroponically.  The livestock also lived there, a few cows, horses, pigs, as well as numerous sheep.  The livestock were feed the inedible portions of the plants and any produce that was no longer fit for human consumption.

Half farm, half greenhouse, the building never ceased to amaze Larissia.  The only reason it was as productive and efficient as it was, was the state of agricultural technology prior to the world collapsing.  Though not operating a peak capacity, they didn't have enough workers for that, the building still easily feed the entire haven, the dependent havens, and had a little left over trade with.  Food variety was a very valuable commodity these days.

Just as Larissia was about to move on to the last stop of her inspection, she spotted Senja on her rounds.  Larissia waved to her.  The lack of cheer in Senja's step concerned Larissia

“Morning Senja.  Is everything alright?”

“Hey doc.  Been better, to be honest.”

“Oh what's wrong?”

Senja frowned.

“I cannot say actually.  You'll learn about it during the council meeting.”

Something was clearly wrong in the world at large.  If Larissia was to learn about it in the council meeting, The Commander obviously did not want to spook the population as a whole.  Not that it would last.  With so few people living in the haven, gossip spread like wildfire.

“Indeed,” she finally replied.  “Also, the repaired grow lamps are working quite well.  Please pass along my regards to the technicians.”

“I shall.  You need help with anything?”

“Not as far as I know.  Things appear to be running smoothly.  Where you off to now?”

“Target practice.”

“In that case, I shall not keep you waiting any longer. Have a good day.”

“You too doc.”

Larissia smiled as Senja left.  In Larissia's opinion, Senja had her head screwed on remarkably well for someone so young and with her history.  With her skills she'd have made an excellent scientist, if only there was a university for her to study at.

Maybe she could convince Senja to intern at the botanical labs.  Larissia could use the help.  Unlikely though, Senja was very much a woman of action.

Pushing the thoughts aside, Larissia headed for the last stop of her inspection: the secure lab.  Situated in the basement, under the main column, this specialised greenhouse was the haven's true treasure trove, with the vault being sealed.  It contained are the pharmaceutical plants.  It was also guarded.

She nodded to the guards as she passed them.  Her progress through the retinal and fingerprint scanners was trouble free, as was the key card scanner.  The final barrier was a door and a key.  She had no idea how the key worked but it was supposedly unpickable.  Loosing the key just wasn't an option, so it was strung around her neck, 24/7.

Unlocking the door, she entered a small airlock.  If one door was open, the other couldn't be opened.  Behind the inner door was a two story tall enclosure of ploycarbonate and titanium.  Vents circulated air and keep the temperature and humidity correct in the various enclosed glove boxes, each with a different extremely rare and valuable plant.

The upper floor was dedicated lab space for refining the plants into their medicines, and working the bacteria that produced certain other drugs.  It also had the freezer that contained the seed stockpile.  Larissia walked across the walkway and entered the lab via the decontamination booth.

Already inside was Naroosh, who'd been a biochem major before the collapse.  He was currently handling an opium pod.  She waited for him to put down the scoring blade before speaking.

“Morning Naroosh.”

“Good morning Doctor Lazlow.”

“How goes the harvest?”

“Very well.  The latex is flowing well. Yesterday's harvest has already been prepared.  If this keeps up, we should end up with enough to last the year before the week is out.”

“Excellent.”

Larissia walked over to a specific glovebox.  Inside was the plant that had allowed such rapid advancements in indoor agriculture: marijuana.  There were several plants at various stages of its growth cycle.  Satisfied, she visually inspected the other boxes.

“Very good,” she said to herself as she finished her inspection.

“Okay Naroosh, I'm off to harvest the beets.  Have a good day.”

“You too Doctor Lazlow.”"
82ucgx,2,2018-03-07,I just had to tell my boss that I wasn't good enough to finish a project...,PiPstein,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/82ucgx/i_just_had_to_tell_my_boss_that_i_wasnt_good/,"So, a little backstory: about a month back, someone in the Comp Sci department at my college was asking around for some help developing a website. I got the job, I thought all would be fine, etc...

My first inkling that things might go wrong was that he put me on backend design (PHP, SQL) when I told him in the interview that I wasn't very good at those things and far preferred front end design. Even so, I thought I'd give it the old college try.

I've been running into so many roadblocks, and the complexity of the website he originally asked for got a lot bigger as he added more ideas. On top of that, I have (basically) three jobs right now and coursework on top of it, while also looking for internships, as I'm a senior.

Here I was thinking he wanted a simple image submit, gallery, some extra info, etc... site for historical purposes and now he wants one that has an admin panel, social media integration, a user dashboard that shows newest submitted images, a ""liking"" system... so many to count.

Well, I struggled with it for weeks and feel bad that I was paid to do the little I could. I finally just emailed him a few minutes ago and said, ""Hey, I'm really sorry, but this is a lot more complex than I thought and I want to make sure that the school's grant money is well spent.""

He's also been really distant as a boss, skipping meetings and not offering any help. I thought this would be a mentorship type deal where he would help us, as we're still college students, but it's not. My partner on the project also hasn't been doing anything. I've literally been the only person to do anything so far.

UGH... console me, Reddit. Console my weak ass, useless heart."

82vfst,25,2018-03-08,At what point do you throw in the towel? Where do I go from here?,mimi0972,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/82vfst/at_what_point_do_you_throw_in_the_towel_where_do/,"This is gonna be long. I tried to keep it to just the ‘highlights’ (how is that the right word?) but, it’s still lengthy. I was going to post this in r/divorce - but thought you ladies would be more understanding/relatable/helpful. If this truly belongs over there, please let me know. 

I met my husband in college. We were pretty different, but I fell in love instantly. It was something I can’t really explain. When I graduated college he still had a few years left. I told him I’d be happy to continue our relationship, but I was going to be moving a couple hours away. I wasn’t going to live with someone without more of a commitment. We agreed, he understood, he proposed. Long engagement, big wedding. 

We now have 2 kids (oldest is 2 years, youngest is 9 months). We’ve now been married 3.5 years, together 6.5 years. Both of us are late 20s. 

In that time it’s become pretty obvious that a few things he said wouldn’t continue, have. I’m not into weed. I don’t like to be around it, don’t like to deal with him when he’s high. I knew he smoked when we met, but I thought he would outgrow it and he assured me it wouldn’t continue when we moved from college - and especially not when we had kids. It has. Not all the time, and I’m super thankful for that. (Also - it’s still illegal in every sense where we live.) But any time he’s with his buddies he’s high. It’s annoying and extremely frustrating. He’s an absolute IDIOT while high. Like, too stupid to function? I’m of the position, how can we teach our children not to behave that way if he continues it? He even told me that smoking weed in high school is why he tried all the other drugs he did. (I know this isn’t the case for everyone. I’m not against weed for other people/families, but I don’t like it for me and mine. Same as cigarettes honestly.) He’s now told me he isn’t changing it and I need to get over it. 

That’s just a note. This is the real story/situation/issue. 

3 years ago he was still in school and got an internship in the city we now live in. 5 hours from where he was going to school and I worked full time supporting us. He had a part time job that helped a little, but mostly on me. He spent the summer away. 

I traveled to visit him, which is when I got pregnant with our first. I’m positive down to the exact date. When he moved home in sept. I was looking through pictures on his phone. I found a picture of his dick and was sooooo confused! He never ever sends me dick pics. I went through everything. Texts, Facebook, Instagram, email. And found my worst nightmare... He had been emailing from a craigslist posting he created wanting a guy to suck his dick/let him suck theirs. I was MORTIFIED. Then I looked at the date of the picture. It was while I was visiting. He got out of bed (where I was naked asleep and unknowingly just pregnant) and went and took pictures to send to a man. I was beside myself. But at this point nearing 3 months pregnant. I put it behind me and tried everything I could to make him only interested in me. Could I be sexier (ha! As I’m getting fatter by the day growing a baby...)? How could I be more adventurous in bed? What could I do different so he didn’t feel the need to look elsewhere? My sex drive (always much higher than his - he would turn me down somewhat regularly) plummeted. I blamed hormones. I had the baby, breastfed, eventually weaned her. We had sex twice that whole time. 

We moved when our first child was a few months old and after graduation he got the job where he had interned. We decided I would be a SAHM for the time being. I’d just left a career that I was loving, but wanted to focus on my baby. We also knew we would want another right away. 

After a few months I had a feeling. I read through his phone and found that while on a work trip he had posted another craigslist ad looking for a guy. He received a response and swears up and down he chickened out. I believed him again. I think I still want to because I’m extremely repulsed at the thought that it could be true. 

I was ready to quit then. I wanted to leave. He convinced me to stay and it would be different and better. And things did improve. We had sex twice and I was again pregnant. 

We started counseling very shortly after I found out about the second infedlity. I decided I’d wait on it and see what happens. He seemed to be making a lot of strides with the counselor and I thought life was getting better. 

He had a work trip to San Diego last spring. He didn’t want me to go, but I was pretty insistent and the hotel was paid for. I went and he was so rude to me. He screamed at me in the middle of the street as I was pushing our almost 1 year old daughter in a stroller. People walking by literally turned their heads to stare. Then he left me. In a city I didn’t know wandering around, pregnant, pushing our daughter in a stroller. 

We got back and talked about it with our counselor and he profusely apologized. I forgave and moved on. 

Our fights have been getting worse. Meaner more awful things said to one another. He broke down the bthroom door the other day when I tried to lock myself and the babies in there for bath time. Trying to give us both the space to cool off. 

Now he’s in San Diego again. He told me about the trip a few months ago, plans were for both of us to go. (He works and travels with his dad. His mom was on the San Diego trip last year) He then told me it was just him and his dad going, no wives. Okay. Fine. Bummer, but I made the trip to visit my family with my kids instead. 

Found out last week his mom was going. He acted surprised. But I feel I was lied to. He says no, he didn’t know. Then I think well my MIL or FIL lied... and I’m not okay with that either. Someone was deceitful to get us not on this trip. And not once had my husband said he wishes we were there. There are so many things he could have said that would have made me feel like he felt bad, or missed us, or anything. And it boils down to he wanted a trip without us. That just doesn’t feel okay with me. 

I feel like I’ve just been putting up with all this shit and it’s sort of the straw that broke the camel’s back...? I think I’ve hit the major things, I know I’ve left a bit out. I just don’t even know. Someone once told me they can only hurt you until it doesn’t hurt anymore. And I’m at a point where I don’t feel hurt. I feel annoyed and frustrated and mad but, hurt isn’t there. Maybe I’m just used to it? 

But I don’t know where to go from here. How do I put my kids through a divorce? How do I deal with the potential of being stuck somewhere I have little to no support? What are my first steps or options? 

I have no friends to talk about this with and just don’t know where to turn... Everyone thinks he is just such a great guy. And in some ways he is. But, there are these terrible things that I’m keeping mostly to myself. 

Honestly, as I type this out, I think what I would say to a woman posting this. I would be reading it and saying ‘how stupid is she?! Does she really think he is going to change? Poor girl has no self confidence and just isn’t very smart...’ 

I don’t even know what I’m looking for. Advice? Help? Stories of how this gets better? Or how much better life is away from this person? 

Anyway. Thanks for reading this novel... "

First things first. I am super sick and my head is a bit foggy. I'm sure if I stood on this problem long enough, I could figure it out. But I only have 1 day left to try and solve it before I have to settle with my less-than-ideal solution.

For simplicity's sake, I'm making a script that compares what meals employees eat on a monthly basis to determine popularity. Not every employee eats at the cafeteria every day, sometimes there are guests or interns that show up for a day or sometimes stay for months.

I have two dictionaries. The first is our MasterDict. The second is our ToAddDict. They share the same keys between them.

The fields are as such:

""Employee ID"" &lt;-- Must be Unique

""Choice A""

""Choice B""


So data would look like:

Employee ID: 1234567890

Choice A: 75

Choice B: 32


There are 100,000s of entries so iteration is painfully slow.

Goals:
See if Employee ID is already in MasterDict
--if so, add AddToDict[""Choice A""] to MasterDict[""Choice A""]
--if not, append Employee ID and Choices to MasterDict.

I know there's a way to use Set() to make this faster but I'm braindead.

Also it just occurred to me that the indexes in the dictionary might not match up as they are arbitrary in python...so Sally might have Stew's results... please correct me if I'm wrong in this assumption.

All results are outputted to a file (which is read to re-pop the dict each time we run the script).

Thank you for your patience. I'll just kindly step aside and see if sleep takes me."

As the title says, I'm considering heading over to Denmark so I can do an AP degree in either CS or IT technology. I know I can do the same thing in Belgium but I just don't see myself stay in Belgium for the rest of my life and after a lot of extended traveling and research I have decided that Denmark is the place I want to be, and getting an education in the country you want to move to seems like a perfect way to kick things off. I'll have a budget of approx 186,000 DKK (25k euros) which I hope will be enough to cover the costs for two years. Regardless of that I'd like to not be fully reliant on my savings so I was wondering what the possibilities are of finding any work as an English speaker? Obviously I will try to learn Danish as well as I can but it will probably take a while before I can speak it at a working level. Also I saw that these AP courses come with a 4 month internship during the 4th semester, do interns get payed in Denmark and if so how much can be expected? Also how hard will it be for me to find an internship at a Danish company as a foreigner who (hopefully by then) speaks some Danish? Now my biggest concern is if I will be admitted, I have found 5 different schools who offer courses I like in English but I have no idea how competitive they are to get into. I will probably end up applying to all of them. I have an upper secondary school diploma that grants me access to higher education in Belgium but my grades have always been low and I got held back one year. I'm considering doing an A level in math through the British consulate where I currently live in Guangzhou (China) to improve my chances of getting in. Any advice on how I can improve my chances would be greatly appreciated! (I'm hoping to start in the Fall of 2019 btw, so I still have some time to prepare.) Now as a final thought, say I successfully complete the degree and internship and I learn how to speak Danish somewhat proficiently, can this realistically lead to finding a decent job and permanent residence in Denmark or would I struggle? Sorry for this long and slightly incoherent rant, I guess I'm just looking for some advice and a possible reality check. I know that a lot of what I'm asking can be found on Google and I have already done plenty of online research but it is always great to hear what the locals think and that is what makes this sub so awesome.

I've done this in java with a data access layer, presentation layer and business layer. But is this actually possible in react native and javascript?

Kind regards

over de YouTube-film «Vacature Politievlieger» &amp;#40;ingezonden 19 januari 2018&amp;#41;.   
Antwoord van Minister Grapperhaus &amp;#40;Justitie en Veiligheid&amp;#41; &amp;#40;ontvangen   
7 maart 2018&amp;#41;. Zie ook Aanhangsel Handelingen, vergaderjaar 2017–2018, nr.   
1159.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1    
Bent u bekend met het op 22 december 2017 door de Politie Afdeling   
Luchtvaart op YouTube geplaatste filmpje «Vacature Politievlieger»?1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2    
Kunt u bevestigen dat momenteel binnen de politie twee vacatures zijn   
opengesteld voor de functie politievlieger &amp;#40;schaal 11 Bbp&amp;#41; en dat voor deze   
vacatures specifiek kandidaten geworven worden die thans werkzaam zijn bij   
de politie en die &amp;#40;nog&amp;#41; niet beschikken over een vliegbrevet en/of ervaring om   
een politiehelikopter te kunnen besturen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2    
Er zijn vier vacatures voor de functie van politievlieger, waarvan twee intern   
en twee extern zijn opengesteld. De twee vacatures voor politievlieger die   
intern zijn opengesteld, zijn expliciet gericht op executieve politiemedewer-  
kers.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3    
Deelt u de mening dat er in Nederland voldoende aanbod aan ervaren   
helikopterpiloten is – veelal met een fors aantal jaren militaire ervaring   
binnen en buiten Nederland – en dat de politie ook voor deze vliegers een   
aantrekkelijke werkgever lijkt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3    
De ervaring leert dat in Nederland een beperkt aanbod van ervaren helikop-  
terpiloren voor deze specifieke politietaak is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPHH-9-lG3Q  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Is het waar dat de politie momenteel ook buiten de eigen organisatie   
politievliegers werft?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4    
Ja. Zie ook het antwoord op vraag 2.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5    
Is het waar dat onlangs een wervingsbijeenkomst heeft plaatsgevonden voor   
twee vacatures en dat ongeveer twintig reeds opgeleide en ervaren helikop-  
terpiloten aanwezig zijn geweest en &amp;#40;daarmee&amp;#41; hun interesse hebben   
getoond?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5    
Ja. Deze bijeenkomst was gericht op de twee vacatures die extern zijn   
opengesteld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6 t/m 10    
Kunt u aangeven welk opleidingstraject gemiddeld genomen nodig is om een   
politieman zonder eigen vliegervaring op te leiden tot een volledig inzetbaar   
politievlieger, inclusief de vaardigheid om in de nacht te vliegen? Wordt deze   
opleiding door de politie zelf verzorgd of wordt deze door de Luchtmacht dan   
wel een particuliere instelling verzorgd?   
Kunt u aangeven hoe lang zo’n opleiding duurt en hoeveel zo’n opleidingstra-  
ject in totaal kost per op te leiden vlieger?   
Kunt u uitleggen waarom de politie ervoor kiest om zelf uit eigen gelederen,   
tegen zeer hoge kosten, vliegers op te leiden, terwijl op de arbeidsmarkt in   
voldoende mate ervaren vliegers met relevante werkervaring beschikbaar   
zijn?   
Is hier niet – tegen de achtergrond van de enorme uitdaging waarvoor de   
politie thans op het vlak van het werven en opleiden van nieuw personeel in   
zijn algemeenheid staat – sprake van een merkwaardige keuze? Deelt u de   
mening dat dit een verkeerde besteding van politiebudget is?   
Deelt u de mening dat dit opleidingsbudget beter besteed kan worden aan   
het snel en met extra capaciteit opleiden van nieuwe politiemensen voor de   
basisteams op straat in plaats van in de lucht?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6 t/m 10    
Een politiemedewerker zonder enige vliegervaring volgt eerst de opleiding tot   
basis helikoptervlieger, die door een particuliere instelling wordt verzorgd.   
Vervolgens wordt een aanvullende opleiding tot politievlieger intern verzorgd   
en is er een «training on the job». De duur van dit totale opleidingstraject tot   
politievlieger voor een executieve politiemedewerker zonder eigen vliegerer-  
varing duurt ongeveer 36 maanden en kost &amp;#40;inclusief salariskosten gedurende   
de opleiding&amp;#41; ongeveer € 400.000.   
De politie kiest ervoor om twee vliegers uit eigen gelederen op te leiden,   
omdat hun executieve achtergrond de kwaliteit van de werkzaamheden   
vergroot. Bij de steun vanuit de lucht aan agenten op de grond heeft de   
executieve achtergrond van politievliegers meerwaarde vanwege hun kennis   
en ervaring in het operationele werk. Een civiele piloot dient echter eerst de   
politieopleiding te doorlopen.)

by Greenpeace International 5 March 2018

Hi, this is greenpeace, your granddas environmental org!

We at greenpeace have based our respected decade-long strategy on the well known fact that animals are not part of the environment. (Also known as the ""Clark and Dawe doctrine"") 

There is us humans, there is the amazonas, and there is stuff that doesn't matter. To sum it up with our catchy slogan: _""If it doesn't hurt a tree, it's no big deal for me""_

---

Also, we have a long tradition explaining why veganism is nonsense with nobel-worthy micro-economic insights 

&gt; But we've never solely advocated boycotts or veganism. Voting with your money (not buying meat/fish) is great, but it gives the most power to those with the most money. (1)

Clearly, if you don't consume meat, it doesn't matter, because rich people consume meat. Makes sense, right? 

But times are changing, and so are the challenges. It appears that by now everyone and their niece is sharing vegan-memes on facebook, and vegan orgs are growing like crazy, and we aren't doing shit, so our board decided we should do ""something with this vegan thing"".

So in case there was a little misunderstanding, let's repeat what I just said:

&gt;“What we decide to eat, as individuals and as a global society, is one of the most powerful tools we have in the fight against climate change and environmental destruction,” added McDiarmid.  (2)

---

We aim to create a new unheard-of movement, and so we came up with an exciting, bold idea: 

_CAN YOU IMAGINE A WORLD…_ in which we let our strategy be defined by an intern and the CEO of KYC?

We can, and we did! 

1. The intern found this really cool mission of some crazypeople called proveg: ""Reducing the global consumption of animals by 50% by the year 2040."" So we copy &amp; pasted it. But to not get crazy, we added 10 years. You know, to make it less extreme. Half of our donors will be dead in 30 years, and the other half will be in retired, so don't panic. 
But, wow - _those grandchildren of the millenials will be super-vegan_!  We are not sure on the day yet, but we'll probably have April 12 or April 17 2050 as the cutoff date when everybody will reduce to 50%. 
	
2. The CEO of KYC came up with suggestions for immediate action you can take: 
	
	&gt;Here is what you can do: ""Share plant-based recipes and cook together. Tweet @Greenpeace with your favourite plant-based recipes. How many meat and dairy-free meals can you commit to each week. One? Two? All of them? Set a goal. Once you’ve achieved it, see if you can step it up."" (3)

BOOM - this is going to transform the world. Set a goal. One nomeat/nodairy meal each week. Then eat only one other meal that week -&gt; 50% reduction DONE &amp; DONE.


---
TLDR: We does vegan now. Jk, in 30+ years, lol. Please share and send money #onenomeatnodairydishaweekmaybe. #fuckchickensthough.

82xa5z,0,2018-03-08,"Millennials vs. Gen X, a retrospective look",IAmTheParamedic,survivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/82xa5z/millennials_vs_gen_x_a_retrospective_look/,"I will say that I am not a fan of Survivor themes. I roll my eyes every time Jeff says, ""now Zeke, as a millennial..."" I know that Millennials vs. Gen X was just a season-long commercial for some TV show that I don't remember the name of. But if you look hard enough at the ink blot, you're bound to come up with something...

During the pre-swap, the Millennials are all extremely proactive and dynamic, as millennials are wont to be, pulling off an early blindside of a character who is the embodiment of a generation that grew up with online video games and doesn't know how to deal with real people.

Comparatively, Gen X seems much more stagnant. Even though their episodes feature seemingly interesting generation X past times like getting rid of abrasive women, straightforward feminist uprisings against the powers that be, and trying to get rid of an abrasive woman before an idol takes out a different abrasive woman, this group of disinterested slackers in their 40s couldn't carry an episode if they tried. Watching their half-baked tribe dynamics is like watching an ex-rocker on life support, if you know what I mean.

At the swap, the least apathetic members of Gen X (not exactly a ringing endorsement, considering it includes a grumpy football champion-turned-lawyer on a revenge mission) are stuck together as managers in a strategy-heavy boardroom of a tribe, and they decide to just fire one of their own instead of taking out the starry-eyed evangelical Christian intern.

Meanwhile, at Takali, the Gen X-ers are heavily critical of the puppy love of the vapid millennial couple who—fortunately for the story—managed to stay together after the swap. ""When I was a kid, boys were boys and u was spelled y-o-u"" they cry. Luckily for the Gen X pair, they have a brown-nosing teacher's pet to break up the star-crossed lovers of 18 days.

Then at Ikabua, all hell breaks loose when millennials run the show. The youth pastor and the gay cop are uninterested in the numbers disadvantage though, since they know the maverick and neurotic youngsters will make some needless power play that will save them. ""You fucked up something good, bro"" is the most scathing insult the displaced millennial can muster as she's shown the door.

At the merge, a group of three from Gen X is still set on their revenge mission against the woman who toppled their leader 13 days prior. No strangers to procrastination though, they use the first few merge votes to instead just take out the millennials who won't kowtow to the power structure, including a stoner whose marijuana use left him ""good with mason jars."" They remain politically uninterested long enough to end up on the wrong side of history in a 7-4 vote, and they become cynical and skeptical of the majority alliance's rhetoric. ""There's no clusters or musters,"" they say, ""knock that crap off!""

By a stroke of poetic luck, each original tribe’s LGBT members end up bonding in one of the least exhausting looks at the difference between the generations the show has to offer. ""Why haven’t you told anyone you’re gay?"" asks the millennial to the Gen X, ""I’d never think of hiding something like that."" This bond allows the group from Gen X to cling to their last few moments of power to force the woman who betrayed them weeks prior to leave in the most heart-wrenching way imaginable by drawing the black rock.

At this point, the youngest millennial, constantly needing to prove himself in a society that apparently discriminates against him based on his age, decides to nonsensically betray the person he just drew a rock to protect. His fatal flaw is not his youth; it's his robotic mimicry of a previous winner's game and failure to realize that networking is more important than one's resume. In his mind, as in the mind of many millennials, he does everything right, but he still can't get ahead.

Then the game comes to its end. The Gen X cynics are finally given the heave ho. Some millennials bond over missing their mothers. The constantly triggered millennial gets her very own slacker to vote out his best friend, the nervous and physically weak CEO who somehow controlled the whole game. The most competent person remaining after all the dust settles wins, as the jury hates slack-jawed Gen X-ers no matter how much they claim they had a plan and neurotic millennials who earn no sympathy by hyperventilating all the time."

82z3wp,14,2018-03-08,"Not sure if CSEC is right for me, I have a few questions for other CSEC majors.",wwwwrrrrtttt,rit,https://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/82z3wp/not_sure_if_csec_is_right_for_me_i_have_a_few/,"I'm a second year computing security major, but recently I've been having some second thoughts about my major. I'm going to go over a few things for the sake of clarity, **TLDR &amp; Questions at the bottom.**


Since I still have quite a few prerequisite classes to go before I'll be able to take any CSEC classes, I figured it would be a good idea to try doing some cybersecurity related personal projects in my spare time. Reverse engineering sounded the most interesting, so I gave that a try. I tried a few different tutorials, put a few hours into each one, but I found the material didn't stick with me and I didn't feel motivated to come back to it. I wasn't sure what area to try next from there, so I figured it'd be a good idea to go to RC3. However I've found that every time I've been there, I have to force myself to pay attention, and in general just don't find it very interesting. I concluded that doing cybersecurity in my spare time just isn't my thing, so I put it out of my mind for a while.


A few months later, when I was looking for internships I decided to do a little research into how I can improve my resume. While looking at hiring advice for cybersecurity positions, a large amount of the advice I read emphasized that personal projects and time spent learning cybersecurity outside of class/work is extremely important for getting hired as well as doing well in the field. 


This worried me a little bit, so I talked to my advisor about it, expressing concern with my lack of motivation to do cybersecurity projects/research in my spare time. They agreed that side projects were indeed important, but not every RIT CSEC student has to spend a significant amount of their spare time learning cybersecurity in order to get hired. They then went on to say that while my lack of side projects may hurt my employability, I would still be able to get a decent job because RIT's cybersecurity program is highly respected. 


That left me with a lot of uncertainties, I get the impression that cybersecurity is a field where you need to be really passionate in order to succeed and not be miserable, and I'm not sure if I feel that way about it. If anything, I feel myself leaning more towards programming (Despite everyone's complaints about mechanics of programming, I found it really enjoyable!).


I figured it'd be a good idea to ask some of the students here about their own experiences, so here I am.


**TLDR: Having difficulties finding interest in doing cybersecurity projects/research in my spare time, not sure if CSEC is the right major for me. If you're a CSEC student could you answer these questions?**

How much time do you spend out of class working on personal projects and research related to cybersecurity?

If you're someone who spent little to no time on personal projects, have you experienced difficulty getting a job?

Did it take you a while to find the area in cybersecurity you enjoy? What did it feel like when you found it?"
82z7qf,1,2018-03-08,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/82z7qf/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door.

What I have found during my time in medical school is people don’t like to talk about when they have failed or felt very isolated when they were going through it.

I have friends who have scored a 16 on the MCAT and then ended up getting a 30 on their third try.

I have friends who have applied to multiple cycles and matched into a highly ranked academic program during their late 30’s.

I have friends who have failed classes during medical school, matched, and became great interns and residents.

I have friends who have either or a combination of Step 1, Step2 CK or CS and became great interns, residents and chief residents.

Med school is hard, tough, and sometimes it doesn’t go your way. I have been blessed that every step of the way I have had friends who have supported me and shared their journey with me so I have never felt alone.

They have been my crutch, my shoulder to lean on, rock, and family in so many ways.

I just wanted to share that with everyone, that if there are times when you have struggled, It’s okay.

I KNOW AMAZING DOCTORS WHO HAVE AND THEY WILL ALL SAY IT WAS ALL WORTH IT

It is an amazing time we are leaving in.

We have a TV star who is our president and NBA Basketball Players being social advocates including mental health most recently.

I just thought I do my part to help with anyone’s anxiety or other mental health issues due to the pressures of applying to medical school or being in medical school.

I always wanted to play in the NBA but now it seems like it seems like they want to be more like the social advocates that we are.

TL;DR: Need help finding my next Junior UX Researcher position. I have been hustling and networking a lot. What else should I be doing?

I need some advice looking for my next UX Researcher opportunity. I will break it down as follows: My Work Experience So Far, My Current Situation, and What I Have Been Doing So Far.

My Work Experience So Far:
So I have been in the UX field for about roughly 3 years (it will be 4 by June). My past experience so far has been as follows: started as a UX Architect Intern for a digital marketing firm building wireframes and sitemaps. Then while finishing up my Masters in HCI I was working part-time for a startup on a one year contract serving as a hybrid UX Researcher (survey design, secondary research, personas, and journey mapping) and Chatbot Designer (Conversation Maps and Content Strategy without realizing it at the time). After that, I worked as Contract UX Researcher for startup design agency working on a 3-month contract conducting generative research and synthesis for a client. Once that was over, after about 6 months I worked as Contract UX Researcher for a 3 month contract remote position that involved conducting unmoderated usability testing.

My Current Situation

Now here I am currently on the hunt for my next UX Researcher opportunity and it has been the third month. I have been rejected by three companies so far since January and it has been a real test of my patience. Responses I get are usually along the lines of while we were impressed and showed great promise, we wanted someone who is more senior. It has been a bit of a conundrum with the whole to get an experience you need experience.

What I Have Been Doing So Far

So here is what I have been doing so far:

i. Strengthening My Skills Through Side Projects - I have been working on strengthening my skills on quantitative UX Research by brushing up on my statistics and research methods I learned from my undergrad and masters years as well as what I learned from my previous job. I am doing so by reading Quantifying The User Experience by Jeff Sauro, brushing up and strengthening my skills in R, Python, and Excel, and Google Analytics Certificate. In addition, I have been doing more practice with conducting usability testing guerilla style with this side project. Ultimately, my goal is to not only add this project as a portfolio piece but also publish it on Medium as well.

ii. Medium Articles - I have published two Medium articles so far that have been well received. However, I am hoping to step up my game even more.

iii. Networking - In addition to building and strengthening my skills, I have been actively networking and building connections. So before applying for positions, I reach out to people via LinkedIn and ask them about the opportunities and let them know I am interested. In addition, I head the UX Book Club under my UXPA Chapter and people really enjoy these events and the board members of my UXPA Chapter really love how dedicated I am. I am also part of the OpenIDEO Chapter and am working on another side project through it.

The point is I am really, really trying, but I am still having trouble landing my next job. Not to brag, but on my LinkedIn I have gotten 9 recommendations from all the people I have worked under. Besides the typical advice of this is a numbers game, is there anything else I should do to make myself more competitive and stand out? I don't understand what's wrong with me.

I would really appreciate any advice on how I should move forward. Thank You!"
82zs9x,1,2018-03-08,My insecurities make me jealous and anxious in my Long Distance,Rocket_King,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/82zs9x/my_insecurities_make_me_jealous_and_anxious_in_my/,"Im currently in a long distance relationship with a beautiful girl. We're both 20, full tim college students n part time workers. We do our best to see each other every weekend since it's a 3 hr drive. We've been together for almost 6 months but we clicked right away. We met at a summer internship working for a educational program helping students transition to college. 

I've only been in two relationship including ours. My first one only lasted a month. This one however, we both are very understanding, supportive, n very loving to each other in every way possible. When we're together, time flies. The thing that I seem to lack, not her, is trust. She has NEVER done anything to inspire any sort of anxiety of intentional jealousy do I know the problem derives back to my low self esteem and insecurities. 

I get jealous really easily n recently, a guy she casually talked to in her class who rode the same bus n front door neighbors are becoming friends. Very innocent indeed, i just got a hunch that I didn't like him from the things she told me. He knows of me n asked my girl to go to a movie with her to watch Black Panther. My gf texted me n told me to not overreact but that the ""bio guy"" invited her to see a movie. I didn't know his name or ver met him. I told her no I was uncomfortable n just out of respect, I didn't appreciate him asking her out even though she saw it very friendly. Of course, i don't know if o should have let her because I was just being protective or because I don't know his intentions. Either way, even though i don't trust him, i need to trust her that she will prevent from anything ever happening. 

Also, turns out the guy has never mentioned his gf either which seems odd to me n makes me question his motives- My gf told me she overheard him talking about his gf in their group discussion. 
Anyways, I came back from her place n not a min of being there I see she got a text notification from him n she told me they been texting about the test they recently took n told me I was more than happy to look at their text but I declined. Yesterday, she FaceTimed me after work and told me that they both had gone to Target n grocery shop. I didn't overreact but my heart sunk. I know, this is how you make friends but ugh I don't Know why it bothers me so much. I even go to counseling every 2 weeks and tell her about my problem but had to cancel yesterday since I couldn't make it

I know she isn't the problem but myself. I don't know at what point is it okay for me to say ""I'm uncomfortable""or ""I don't like the fact that you hang out with him"" due to the right reasoning n not my insecurities. She told me she was going to make contact n convo as minimum. I try my best to understand her n be supportive of her decision n not let my insecurities create problems but I can't help myself not liking the guy since I've never met him, never talks about his relationship, n wanted to go to the movies fully aware of her relationship n would his gf even be okay with him asking a girl out? Like out of respect I personally have never asked a girl out if she had a bf. anyways, any advice is welcomed! 

Tl:DR I get jealousy easily n there's a guy I don't like even though I've never met him. He has a gf n asked my girl out to the movies knowing about me n they went grocery shopping at target yesterday with her. She has never done to anything to inspire any anxiety or insecurity.   I don't know at what point is it okay for me to say ""I'm uncomfortable""or ""I don't like the fact that you hang out with him"" due to the right reasoning n not my insecurities. I can't stop her from hanging out with anybody n I'm doing my best to work on myself by constantly communicating with her and going to counseling. How can i build more trust or what exercises can you guys recommend? Thank you "
82zxes,10,2018-03-08,What sort of jobs could I be looking for as a student who needs at least $400/week?,ConvictDev,kansascity,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/82zxes/what_sort_of_jobs_could_i_be_looking_for_as_a/,"I’m in school for CS. While I would love an internship as soon as possible, it’s not likely to happen for another year or so. 

I currently work full time making 400-450 a week. This pays for everything I need paid for, but the scheduling is very rigid and it makes balancing school and other things fairly difficult. In a perfect world, I could make that amount without having to work full time, or having a flexible schedule, or being able to study some on the job, etc.  

For what it’s worth my current job is just driving a forklift at a granite warehouse. It’s simply a means to get by.  

I’m wondering if anyone has any ideas at other potential jobs I could look at around the city that might fill some of the criteria above? Or is this just wishful thinking? "
8300zs,1,2018-03-08,M4M - The Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8300zs/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"I hope you can tell from my sparkling prose that I'm an adult. I'm also only looking for adult partners for roleplay - its like let's pretend only stickier

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

Other kinks! https://m.imgur.com/MTINyO2"

I'm currently a third year CS major (technically sophomore level still because behind on classes). I currently have a 2.7 GPA and I know I could have worked harder in the past, but right now I'm finding it almost impossible to find an internship or any type of clerical job . I honestly seem to have lost motivation for CS and I'm pretty mediocre at coding and I don't really practice programming or have any experience outside of what we do in our classes. 

I honestly have no idea what I want to do with my life, I just want to graduate college and get a desk job that pays at least $50k a year or at least enough so that I can move out and take care of myself. I feel like if I changed my major I could do better than a 2.7, but I'm just concerned about how hard it will be to find a job outside of STEM.

Should I just push through with CS even though its making me miserable and I'm struggling or should I change my major now? "

This was working fine, and then a few weeks ago, the intern reported that the images weren't joining to the domain. I got time this week to finally look into it, and I discovered that it was because the drivers weren't getting loaded. They weren't getting loaded because of the ""Failed to pass arguments. Code 0x80070057"" error in the log on the client machine. 

So with that error I found the page that I linked to. In there, people are talking about updating the boot image. And one of them talk about moving some files around. But I'm not sure exactly what needs to happen here. 

We are using the Dell boot image. I think that it's from [this site[(http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/enterprise-client/w/wiki/2065.dell-command-deploy-driver-packs-for-enterprise-client-os-deployment), but a much older version. Is that what I need to update? Or are they just saying I need to right-click on the boot image and click 'update distribution points'?

I just want to make sure I don't screw something up. Any help would be appreciated.  "

The scene is somewhat based in reality too. Claim either role, I don't mind which, gender unimportant, and let's see how quickly we can make bad things happen here?)

She noticed the clock turn 9pm, and still no word from her husband, John, since his drunken nonsense an hour ago. He's out catching up with his old friend, Lucy, whom she despises. It's not that she doesn't trust him, exactly, it's that woman, she's a terrible flirt and she just knows something must have happened that last time.

She sits there angrily picturing that slut sitting on her husband's lap, tight short skirt riding up, him too stupid, drunk and entranced to do anything but stare, and probably touch. That's when she notices the intern, [Luke](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/4f/d0/68/4fd068f40d6116b18a82c3b6a14b51e5--mens-sweater-outfits-skinny-ties.jpg), is the only other person in the office this late.

He's always tried it on with her. It'd be sweet if he wasn't so persistent. Typical cocky, college jock, privileged upbringing, well-educated, truly believes that even a married, successful, older woman like Rose is incapable of resisting his perfect cock.

That's when an evil grin comes over her face. A smart girl wouldn't sit here getting mad and jealous while he's out having fun, probably of the worst kind, protected by the benefit of the doubt. No, she'd get even, and there's a sure thing right in front of her...
She bites her lip, looks across at him with a sly, slow, wink and opens an instant message window..."
830osf,5,2018-03-08,Surprise bridal shower for my coworker/friend [28F] - not sure if she will appreciate it.,workbachelorette,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/830osf/surprise_bridal_shower_for_my_coworkerfriend_28f/,"Names have been changed for the purposes of this post.

Amy and I have been working at the same company for almost 7 years now. We both entered the company through an internship from the same school and have been friends ever since. Although we don't work in the same department, we've become fairly good friends over the years and I can say that I know her personality and character pretty well.

Amy is getting married in a few months and Mary, one of our coworkers from her department, contacted me to coordinate for a surprise bridal shower with a small group of people from work. To be honest, I don't know why Mary is planning this as I know she's not close with Amy but they do work with each other a lot. I see two potential issues with this plan:

* Mary gave me the preliminary guest list and I know for a fact that Amy doesn't like some of the people on her guest list (including Mary...)

* Amy hates surprises. Period. Full stop.

The bridal shower is a nice gesture and I am happy to help coordinate, but I can't help but feel that this might go down poorly because of the two issues. Should I just go along with this? Or secretly tell Amy that this is being planned so she can at least prepare for it? Any suggestions will be helpful. Thanks!

**TL;DR:** I have been asked to participate in a surprise bridal shower for my friend at work and I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

**EDIT:** I talked to Mary and convinced her to tell Amy about this bridal shower the week leading up to it. I'll talk to Amy afterwards to see if she's still up for this shower. Thanks everyone for your suggestions!"

I'll be around WTC, but my friend is in Midtown. Walking distance to PATH is pretty key (JSQ or Grove St. should be fine).
I've been looking around on the typical leasing sites, but short-term rentals are tougher to come by.  We're trying to keep it around $2000 a month.

Anyone ever had a short-term lease in the area?  Any sites I should check out or areas I should limit my search to?"
83211y,17,2018-03-08,"My first NOFAP attemt, 76 days report/story",smokepurplee,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/83211y/my_first_nofap_attemt_76_days_reportstory/,"Posts like this really helped me so I tought I will share my experience with you guys, hope you like it! 20 years old, life was good when I was fapping but I gave NoFAP a try and it become even better.

When my friend told me about NoFap back in december I was after break up with my ex. The ammount of fapping was all time high at that moment. I missed her and stuff.. Anyway, he told me about the benefits and I stopped fapping instantly and managed to reach 76 days. So lets start with most interesting part.

**Benefits:**

* Sleeping habits fixed by itself - I started to become sleepy at 10pm and wake up at 6am with no effort.

* Insane eye contact

* When you enter the room or any place you get ""who is that guy"" look from other people, they really notice something that stands out about you

* People want to talk/hang out with you

* Girls notice you and there is no problem to get the conversation going. Its like you have a script in you mind and you know what to say.

* High motivation to do things that needs to be done

* Motivation to improve yourself

* Started to feel emotions again, like I even cryed while waching some movies, used to be numb to everyting

* ED symtoms gone

* Increased confidence

* Got my first wet dream in my life

* People start respect you

**Before starting NoFAP I made some rules for my self:**

1)Relapse is not an option

2)No tinder or any dating until day 90

3)No edging and peeking

4)cold showers every morning

5)reading before sleep

**Stages of nofap from my experience:**

Days 0-7: At begining it wasn't really hard, because I was super motivated, faced some benefits like perfect sleep, huge energy and motivation levels, rock hard erections everymorning.

Days 7-21: Fun begins - confidence is all the way up. And at this time I got super motivated to do stuff: joined gym again, cold showers, reading, managed to get very seriuos internship and so on. Forgot about my ex, all the focus on my self improvement.

Days 21-50: I got used to all the benefits, less motivation but I still maintained my good routine and things were moving forward. Then once I got drunk and ended up in seriuos street fight(about day 50), got my ass kicked for the first time in my life(did competitive boxing for 5 years before) So it was shock that some random guy knocked me out, my confidence went down, because of injuries I could'nt go to gym for month, so I gave up on all the cold showers and all the good habits..

Days 50-70: When I stopped my perfect routine I felt what flatlines is.. nothing arouses me, no interest in girls, same bad habits again, increased lazines, bad sleep and so on.. 

Days 70-76: It was the time when flat line stopped I think, all the benefits came back. Wood hard erections 24/7 again :D, pictures of girls triggers so hard, and it was the time when stupid me started peeking, did it once, next day it turned into edging, and here I am relapsed at day 76.

**Some Insights about No fap:**

1)My best friend who is god with girls, like all the girls want his dick, he nevert MO'd In his life, he have some issue that he cant cum from masturbation, Its strange, but I know that guy all my life and it's true.

2)When I met my last gf last spring and I started dating her, I was almost on no fap, had sex occasionaly and I didnt even wanted to PMO, And she was all crazy about me. But at semptember we both had to go to schools and work, I replaced Lack of sex with PMO, she started to like me less and less. And some time after we broke up. Im sure that PMO did huge part in that.

3)No fap alone won’t do much, but when you do stuff on Nofap you do it way better, it doesnt matter if its school, sports, girls or anything you do everything better. So guys, do something! dont procrastinate.

Im not sad about relapsing, after that I was laughing, because I was only watching nsfw pictures and touching for too long, and I came unexpected, whole situation is funny but it still is relapse. I think one time wont do much damage, but im afraid some chaser effect might hit me next days, but I am not going to do that again. Lesson learned: never peek.

So It was my first attemt on NOFAP, Now it is my lifestyle, all the benefints and feeling good all the time is really worth it, Im not sure how I will feel tommorow, because of the incident. Righ now I am going to continue my No Fap jurney, but a I’m gonna start dating/hooking up again and get back to cold showers/reading/gym routine this relapse reminded me how MO is shit compared to sex.

Thats the end and I am supposed to say something smart. So my advice is to make some rules for yourself, dont break them, like I did. Keep improving yourself, have a strick routine and follow it and you will forget about fapping. And I'm not the first to say this but **Never peek!** . It's not about the number of your badge, the thing is to make the days on your badge count! Good luck guys!"
8322sp,1,2018-03-08,How to talk to my [19M] parents [50F/48M] about wanting to go away for college instead of staying home?,welchie98,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8322sp/how_to_talk_to_my_19m_parents_50f48m_about/,"I want to go away to another college that is ultimately better than the college that my parents want me to go. I believe that the only reason that my parents want me to go to the college by my house because it is close to home, and I will be staying home. 

Regardless of staying home or going away, I will be taking out student loans and be paying for my own college. While the college at home does have my major, which is Computer Science, it really isn't as good as the one that I want to go to which is away from home. Yes, I will have to borrow more money (roughly around $20k a year if I go away, excluding my grandfather's contribution which I can assume he will regardless where I go). 

The school my parents want me to go to doesn't have all that of a computer science department unlike the college I wanna go to. The college I want to go to also has really good companies scouting for jobs and is really good for the computer science field plus many more internship opportunities. The college at home lacks all of that, and ultimately I will not have any internships when I am at the college my parents want me to go to.

Don't get me wrong, I love my parents to death. But I feel that they are being a bit ignorant in this matter and are completely closed about me going to any college but this one, despite the fact that they are not contributing towards any of my college. How do I talk to my parents about this?

TL;DR: My parents are very closed off about me going away from home to college. How do I talk to them about this?"

832pm3,2,2018-03-08,Hatred,unhappypatient,u_unhappypatient,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_unhappypatient/comments/832pm3/hatred/,"8 years has led me to hate every single office I've been in - my coworkers - my bosses, the the sorts of people they are - my friends, who escaped with their own shitty liberal arts degree and got publishing jobs, social media jobs, and we're taken into industries that now want a master's, 4 years of experience at a huge name company, and some extras (graphic design, coding)..and can get it - and of course, most of all, I hate myself. 


It's a process - I browse the linkedins of the vps of companies where I temp (or rather, phone interview to temp, and am then chosen to be fired) and my supervisors (who are inevitably 25, have probably been coding or winning finance rewards or just been winners since high school) to get some idea who I work for, and want to die inside when I look at who actually gets hired in the company. Get some idea of what's expected of interns and entry level employees and see the resumes of their midlevel employees - engineers, choice internships, marketing, accounting and finance managers at 25. 

I have come to hate my friends, who got into media roles through networks and jobs at the UN or with my city's mayor or with white shoe lawfirms or blogs - astounding jobs, jobs that only seem to hire the cream of the crop currently but were more open in, say, 2012 - 

Excel workshops. Sql workshops; python workshops, where I am the stupidest most confused person there. 
I watched the president of my department at the largest job that fired me and kept the other temp have an exchange about birthdays and children and chatter. 

It is exactly like a dorm. There are people that are chosen to be friends, people that are liked and can speak freely with their bosses, people that can joke about mistakes and anything else - and those that aren't. People who are thanked for their work.

I had a nice day yesterday.

I woke up, kinda groggy, made myself a some coffee whilst I started to adjust to the day. I thought to myself that I've been getting a bit worried about where my life is going. I've been kinda thinking about my ex a lot recently. We broke up like a year and a half ago but it ended so horribly. I was worrying a bit about how I feel like I cant go anywhere in my current situation. My internship is kinda on hold at the moment and my other job doesn't give me enough hours, and the past few weeks I've been just lounging around all day and doing absolutely nothing productive. 

Then I sorta sat up and said no, I'm not gonna start being negative about things. Today's gonna be a really fuckin' great day. 

So I sent off a job application I've been dithering around for a couple days, got changed, lookin' all nice, feelin' all cute[**SHAMELESS INSTA PLUG**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgB1gO7lv1Z/?taken-by=louie.94)sent a cute text to a boy I've been chatting to for a while (He's called Jack and he's gorgeous). I grabbed my headphones and my jacket, went outside and walked to the shop.  *[Cue Mr. Blue Sky by ELO]*. I bought myself some ingredients for a really healthy wrap and a smoothie for breakfast. Got a flirty text back from Jack. We've been talking for like 2 months but haven't met yet due to being busy or too poor or whatever. We talk like were a full on couple. We wanna design a house together and visit Canada. But tbh even if me and him don't go anywhere, I really like how it feels when someone shows genuine interest in you. I spent a bit more time at home looking for jobs online, then went to my best friend in the entire world's [Dan's] last volleyball game for this team and the season. 

They won by an absolute mile. Wasn't even close. I got some good photos of Dan absolutely killing it. Dan is my absolute #1. We met when we were dumped in the same student flat together 4 years ago. Tall sporty lads lad Dan and quiet shy queer arty me. We've done so much growing up as people together. He was there when my last relationship ended, even though he'd just come out of an even longer relationship. He's beyond best friend, he's a brother. He helped me set my last relationship public on facebook- effectively coming out to my entire family. He persuaded his entire team to wear rainbow armbands for a game during some sort of pride week. Apparently he got into an argument with a foreign guy on the team who said it was gross that he was best friends with a gay guy. The whole team backed Dan. He's coming with us on our family trip to India in November for my Dad's surprise 60th Birthday. He knows we're going (Mum, dad, me Dan my sis and her bf), but he doesn't know we're flying out loads of his other family and friends with us to surprise him on his birthday. I cannot wait. I'm so gonna cry.

I met up with a couple of the boys from the team after the game and we went back to Dan's house for a drink and chilled at his house in the sun, even though it wasn't that warm. Typical British. Just enjoying the time together, no talk of anything negative, just good music and best mates. Texting Jack non stop all day. Dan went off on a date, I helped him pick his outfit. I grab my headphones, put on an American Football album, got my Ray - Ban's and my Dad's old Levi's jacket on and went for a long walk around Newcastle enjoying the sun and the people watching. I helped a couple from a different city find the place they were looking for. I walked with them a bit. He's a fresh graduate from St Andrews uni, and is setting up a small company, and she's a masters student. They seemed like a lovely couple. The kinda people I'd be friends with. I went back past the shop to get some food for dinner. Made myself some toasted sourdough bread with some pesto, feta cheese and roasted tomato on it, topped with pomegranate seeds, black pepper and a squeese of lime. Had a tall glass of the smoothie I got earlier. Mikey soon came back with 2 of his friends. Mikey also won his game he also had that day, he has a new gf and they're cute as hell together. We just spend more time relaxing, had a game of Scrabble (I lost, low point of the day), Dan came round after his really successful first date, and we half-watched a Seth Rogen film. They all left around 10, and I went back to my room and did some work on one of the tracks for an EP I'm co-writing and producing for another one of my best mates. (It's on [Spotify check it out. EP out this summer)](https://open.spotify.com/track/6wQrEhKXQXyyO43P0kt0Yq?si=k6EJyhFYSte83RSYsgmK8A)

I went to bed thinking that although there was nothing in particular that made it a great day, but I'm gonna remember today for a long time, and how much I enjoyed it. This morning I woke up and had myself another awesome day. As I'm writing this, I'm sitting in my room that I spent an hour cleaning and making really neat. I've got the fairy lights on and I'm listening to some Bob Marley. Gonna get some scented candles and a houseplant tomorrow to make it even nicer in here. I just walked back from Dan's house cause I was hanging out there for a bit. I mentioned to him and the other two people there how nice yesterday was. Literally the saddest part of my day was that I lost scrabble even though I played the word *grandfather* over a triple word. We all realised that so far, 2018 has been really good for all of us, and things have been going well.

Whilst I as walking back, I thought to myself- Nothing is worth more than surrounding yourself with and attracting and spreading good energy, and just appreciating life. What's the point of letting myself have another shit day? It's worth the effort, and it's not even effort when I'm feeling good about it. Negativity? Nah mate I don't do that drug. 

I think I'm gonna do this tomorrow too."

I came home from my internship today and stepped into the elevator of my building, along with a really cute girl..

I was listening to music through my earbuds. Apparently she could hear the music and askes me if it was ""panic! At the disco"". I told her it was and we talked about the song untill I had to get off the elevator. 

I've been living here for about a year and this was the first time I've ran into this girl. Hindsight I felt I should've asked here for a drink or something because I think she's really cute.. 

So here I am shooting myself in the foot.. chances are I won't run into here again for another year.

I do know her name but I don't wanna creep her out by randomly adding her on Facebook.. 

Does anybody have any advice for me?

&gt; 
&gt; I am 20 and looking back I have 99% of the blue pill shit which is in the book. Everything was going fine. Till did something which RP always tells me not to do.. like someone in your workplace.
&gt; 
&gt; This was my first job, I joined for an internship. How irony is it did not even start as a completely blue pill but it progressed there. Actually started as fairly red pill. Saw this dumb girl who is super rich. From day one she seems to trust me. I got horny and started to touch and asked her out. She said not ready for it. Later she got interested we went out and that lead to us having a relationship. I did not have any sexual experience before. Initially what I had was to gold dig her money and use her.
&gt; 
&gt; We started to make out more and more I was growing addicted to her. First 3 months were horrible why? we make out and she spends a lot on me. I feel great and then the next day she breaks up with saying she is not ready and again she gets back together says she misses me. Actually, this situation got so worse her bipolar issues inside 3 months it happened like 10 times. Each time like a doormat when she wanted me back I went. This all because it was so easy for me. The first time my sexual experience. Later we both left work and currenly home studying for the degree.
&gt; 
&gt; That was passed, from January after 3 months she promised she wants me in her life, she loves me and will never do it again. Till now never pulled the break up thing again with next 14th it's 6 months. But that does not stop her. Things only got worse, she made me feel like ""she cares and will be there for me"" so whenever I feel sad I talk to her and rant and she comes to see me. She flakes like all the fucking time. Flaked even next week's plan. We fight and argue and then meet. Yesterday she said I am not her priority and she does not want to see me often becz then she will miss me more. I whine and tell I feel sad I need her now and come see me. I took her virginity last week. I am sick of this shit, but I too horny to leave since sex is easy.

How come she change so quickly? before the fight a few hours ago she wanted to see me and then suddenly after the fight she went totally. I noticed changes like she acting up like she got feelings for me.

Last night I asked her why what's wrong I notice something is up. She said she needed a break from us. Then she was asking am I okay. I said no I am not. Then she said why have this relationship if it's one-sided then let's break up.

I said okay this time without arguing. I deleted her number. We usually text from WhatsApp but I deleted it. We were texting from telegram. She said she will delete that

I have a few questions relating to this

* Last night I was sick of it. However I am still having dreams of her. I can't seem to sleep in peace without getting some fucking dream what to do?

* She gave me some cards and a card copy photo, I thought of burning it. You think that is a good idea? 

* Even though I know the relationship was horrible I still feel horrible and miss her because we had some good memories too and she had sexual experience. Is there any way to forget his? 

* I still lowkey hope she texts me and gets back with me. Because sex with her is so easy. I wanna stop this can't seem to help myself.

2. What avrg is required to get into SE after 1st year? What avrg did you have? Please tell me in % not GPA.

3. What is the coop/internship like? Is it easy to find a job 2nd year or do I need to get my hands dirty and apply outside the posting on the Uni (i dont mind)? Do these internships actually let you code or just make you fetch coffee? 

4. Do I need to do 'side projects' in order to get hired or does the uni teach enough programming/coding so that I'll have a good understanding of it? I currently do some web development, so would I add all my projects to my github which will go on my resume?

5. After SE, what kind of jobs did you get?

I'm an economics major. Did reasonably well throughout uni and had a couple of pretty decent internships in the finance sector. Could have probably get well-paying, prestigious jobs if I want to...

The thing is, I don't know what to do besides working in finance. But from my previous internship experiences I know that it's something that I'd tolerate but am not particularly passionate about. So this lack of ""passion"" is reflected in my effort for job-hunting...have applied for a few positions without any success so far. I know that I should have been more aggressive in finding one, but...it's just that I'm not really excited about finance jobs...

I've been trying to expand my horizon and consider postgraduate in areas as diverse as development studies and english. Have secured an acceptance from one pretty good university for a course in economics. Honestly, though I know that the degree will be useful, I know that it would not be something that I would particularly enjoy... So I've been applying for other ""less practical"" subjects but I'm pretty concerned with the kind of careers that I can have with these degrees. And financial independence is a huge thing for me.

So I guess the question is, should I take this chance to explore, roam around, and get lost... or, stick to what I know and don't particularly enjoy? I know that the choices can be not either/or and job transition can be very fluid.

But every time I think about maybe sticking to finance first, I thought: Why waste two years doing something you don't want.

And when I think about trying out new things I thought: What if this is just a temporary interest? What if I can't go back to finance if I want to? Then all that would be just a waste of time, and I won't be going anywhere when my peers are steadily getting ahead with their jobs.

It seems like any choice that I make, I'll always be preoccupied with the downside. I'm stuck in this frustrating limbo of analysis without any hope of finding an answer.

In my current state, I'm not confident of any choice that I'm gonna make. I know life has so much potential and opportunities but I'm pretty scared (by the possibility of failure and economic hardship, and the possibility that I'd never amount to anything in life). I want to take the bull by the horns. But it's...hard...

Due to a lot of help from this sub reddit and r/progresspics I was able to chart out a workout and diet plan. I also started intermittent fasting then.

My goal was to reach 70kgs before New Year's Eve. I stuck to 1500 calories, IF and my gym routine and reached it! My BP and cholesterol was normal after a very long time and I looked and felt better.

However my university exams came up in January and I reduced my working out and almost completely gave up on my diet. Was about 74 when January ended. In February I was doing one of my toughest and tiring internships - which left me with no time to workout. And I was eating unhealthy street food like a garbage can. I checked my weight on March 4th, it was 77.5Kgs. 

I have essentially gained back all my weight and feel like shit. On top of that I'm a stress eater. I tried sticking to my calories  and IF again, but I don't have the mental discipline anymore. I don't even feel like going to the gym. I really need help. I end up eating food even when I know I'm full. On almost all nights I'll end up eating some not night snack or the other (usually a couple of chocolate sauce sandwiches). It feels like I have lost control.  I need to lose this again by April start. Want to be at least 72 Kgs by then. It's just that my job interviews are going to start on April 3rd and I just know that I'll end up stress eating. And I know that this is a mental game and most of what I have said are excuses but I  needed to put it out here. Hopefully I'll be able to hold myself accountable."
8352rj,1,2018-03-09,SSA overpayment and zero response to any requests or forms,Mechcondrid,SocialSecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialSecurity/comments/8352rj/ssa_overpayment_and_zero_response_to_any_requests/," i'm at a loss here with the SSA and i don't know if anyone has any experience with this or not or can suggest anything

first just some back history; i am and always have been diagnosed with asperger's syndrome and some other mental disorders (ADD, mild depression, ODD and mild OCD) 
i was first diagnosed and started seeing a psychiatrist in elementary school around the age of 5 and i had been seeing him every other month until his death about 2 years ago.
during all this time i had (through my mother as a custodial account) been receiving some form or another of assistance from SSA or DSS. all the way up until the year before last (2015) when i got a letter saying that they are reviewing my eligibility. i had (after many 1 year jobs or paid internships due to my disabilities and many companies not wanting to deal with any of the issues arising from them) gotten a job the year before this letter at a local casino; literally my first full time job in my life and i am currently 29 years old. all of which was to my knowledge reported to both the DSS and SSA, who did their eligibility determination and the corresponding form (which i filled out completely and sent back, multiple times in some cases due to them ""never receiving them"" even though i had usps tracking saying they were in fact delivered) and they always asked if my reported employment history was correct (Also with the current wages they have in a little summary; which also was always correct) and then usually 2 months later or so i'd get a letter saying that they determined i was still eligible and would continue to get payments.

up until this last year where i got the evaluation notice.

then i got two overpayment notices which said two conflicting sets of information, one saying i was overpaid about $7000 and another that said i owed over $18k on the way to $19k both with my name and the same social security information on them.
i went to the local SSA office and they said that i had to put in a request to have the overpayment waived, which i did and sent back in. when i asked why i was getting this i was told that i must have not reported something to which i replied that i reported everything that i had and i had always gotten information in the evaluation notices that was accurate and current; even my (At the time) new 1 year old job at the casino. they said well that must be it,i should have reported that change. which i told them there wasn't any change, there hasn't been any change to my employment status or income for over a year.
and then they told me that the pamphlet i get in the evaluation notices says that i need to report my wages, which i looked in the one i just got handed and it does not say that, it says that i have to report any changes; and there were none and the info they were sending me on my wages was correct and current so why would i think i have to report what they already know?
so after putting in this request for a waiver i stop getting the overpayment notices for a while but no notice or decision ever came on the status of the waiver request. and now this last week i get another two notices again with conflicting information saying i have to pay back the almost $6k and almost $19k amounts.
i dont know what else to do here, i was getting almost 1200 a month after they took out money for my health insurance, i dont even make $450 a paycheck here so they took almost an entire third of my income and now my health insurance, after my living expenses not including food i have about $120 or a little less with which to get groceries with.
i rent an apartment from my mother in what is our family home (until almost 2 years ago it was me, my mother and my 94 year old grandmother who i helped take care of as far as day to day tasks or if she fell and needed help getting up; my grandmother has since died and it is now just me and my mother)
i have now gotten a letter saying to call the ""debt management department"" or some such and a phone number for them; and after literally 3 solid weeks of trying to call and getting put on hold then it ringing and then on hold again over and over for 45 minutes a stretch until their system just hangs up on me and i have to call back and start all over.
i tried this every day for 3 weeks to call at varying times of the day from mid morning to late afternoon and everything in between and i have never once gotten through.
i have done everything i have been told by SSA to try and resolve this and it has gotten me not only no resolution but not even a response to any of my requests and the local office just tells me to follow my last received notice and that i ""should keep trying to call"" the number that just keeps hanging up on me. when i asked if there is anything that could be done other than that since it obviously is an exercise in futility they said no that i can only ""keep trying and wait until i get someone on the phone""


really at my wits end here and now (which is what prompted posting this on a public forum) have gotten notification on my credit report that these idiots who don't answer the phone have reported a $5300 and change collection against me which doesn't even match anything i've received previously but is now pretty much public record as i understand it.

any help or advice would be appreciated "

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
 
Open to either short or long-term scenes, so feel free to PM me anytime you see this."

About two-thirds of the jetty is submerged right now. We have no geotechnical reports, no coastal wave analysis, and no previous stone size/weight calculations. So, I'm wondering has it sunk because of natural degradation, sea level rise, or sinking because it was placed on clay or soft mud. Probably a combination of all of that.

Can anyone explain to me what [these](https://imgur.com/a/9Nsqo) percentages mean in terms of diameter of stone to be used?
 Everything I've found so far uses similar percentages, but I haven't seen an explanation as to what they refer to. For example, are they trying to say for QA purposes your primary cover layer (Armor Stone) can be any size that is at least 1.25 -.75 times the design weight? or do they refer to diameter?

I've also found a reference saying that there are equivalent diameter ratios for cover layer (D) and core layer (d), and as long as (D/d)&lt;6 your core material cannot escape from the cover layer, but that reference did not provide any sources, so I didn't feel comfortable using this as a guide.

As I understand it, I need average wave height information in order to determine weight. I don't have that information, so am I just out here without a paddle, or are there typical weights and diameters I can use? Or maybe a quick way to ballpark wave height/power?

Any information is helpful, thanks!  "
8377n3,2,2018-03-09,We should end poverty,SuhailSheik,poverty,https://www.reddit.com/r/poverty/comments/8377n3/we_should_end_poverty/,"By Suhail Sheik
In Pakistan over 60% of the population live under $2 a day www.heritage.org . Life of a poor person is hard struggling everyday to find food, clothing and shelter. The average American would spend around $100.00 a day.  When you see a poor person on the streets what do you do in this situation there are three different types of people. The first person has hateful thoughts against the poor person such as “why don't you just get a job?”  The second person shows pity but decides to do nothing and finally there the person who goes out of there way to do something and better the situation to the people who was not as fortunate as themselves. I noticed the level of sympathy and empathy for the poor is decreasing at a steady rate. There should be more people who care about the poor and give them more support. Firstly we should think about their situation secondly we should help them out.

We should think about the poor people situation, it's not their fault. People might say “why don't they just get a job.” The top bar shows that 35.2 percent of the poor between the ages of 18 and 64 in 2013 were considered not currently eligible to work because they are retired, going to school, or disabled. The other 64.8 percent of working-age poor are currently eligible to work. The second bar shows us that among these currently-eligible workers, 62.6 percent are working and 44.3 percent are working full-time. Of the working-age poor eligible for employment, 37.4 percent are not working—a share that includes the 3.3 million unemployed poor people currently seeking a job www.globalissues.org.  This shows that more than half of the poor people have jobs but are not getting paid enough. They would be getting paid enough if their parents were wealthy enough to put them through college.good Under the right conditions, our brains are capable of unparalleled levels of abstract thought, such as imagining a future goal and making detailed plans about how to get there. But under adverse conditions, our brains have evolved to cut down on the flourishes and focus in on the basics of survival in the here and now. And in our society, hardly anything is more adverse to survival than poverty. It would be foolish to spend precious metal resources thinking about solving a problem that won’t occur for a month when you can’t afford dinner tonight. A series of studies in 2013 on scarcity among people in the lab and farmers in the real world found that being deprived of money caused the equivalent of a 13-point drop in IQ. That kind of a handicap will make it hard for anyone to engage in the high-level thinking required for self-control.

    The greatest form of wealth is human connection and human interaction. It's one of the most influential currencies in the world. Besides, you never know if the next great is waiting on the streets, homeless but doing something extraordinary. If you never help these people, you may never see the great value that some could bring to making our world a better place.If we look at, what a poor is : ""Poor-lacking sufficient money to live at a standard considered comfortable or normal in a society"" We got all the opportunities and right circumstances to live a standard life, but somehow(whatever be the reason) they haven't got that, and that's why they are poor. If you believe in God. He has given you that money which can be put to many uses. You can use it wisely or waste it. Many people throw away kilos of food daily, but why can't we use our money efficiently, don't cook that extra food which is being thrown, save that money, and give it to poor, they can also have a meal. They are also working hard to live a standard life, we can help them today in their bad days, maybe someday they will also catch up. On personal level, charity and helping people may make you happier by giving feelings of purpose and fulfillment. 

You may get better perspective on your own life's problems. It's one of many things quite universally recommended by psychologists for keeping your mental health. You may also need nice and interesting people when volunteering, both among other volunteers and those who you help. If you are religious, it may also count towards your chances of salvation or your future incarnations.
It depends on the righteous need of the benefactor. If one need to live a righteous life one cannot look the other way when somebody needy ask you for help. This usually is considered difficult for citizen to handle depending on the limited endowment they are entitled with. So it is the 'paternal' dimension of the government responsibility that need to handle this benevolent side of the economy because their 'redistributive' dimension of responsibility remain failed due  to poor forming in country. The other choice for the government is for 'cultural engagement', where missionaries from abroad handle such situation of disenfranchised due to broken and destroyed state of their existence. Political engagement boundaries need be clearly fixed so that formation of poor need be prevented and inspite of mindful politics it still happen, then the above routes will make sure that social justice happen to everyone devoid of birth injustice.
 Some people could say  the US, k-12 education is free. Students cannot be denied loans, so everyone can also obtain higher education, then work to pay if off later. If a student works hard, studies hard, and focuses on developing their critical thinking and written and spoken communication it is very easy to set themselves apart from the crowd with internships, publications, assistantships, and scholarships, especially for minorities, or just with stellar grades. It is not easy to emerge from poverty, it takes years of hard work. But developing wealth takes years of hard work, even for ordinary people. Anyone willing to make good choices and work hard can find their way out of poverty, or at lead and coach their children out of poverty.
It's not that poor people have little or no respect for productive people, it's that so many low income people have worked all their lives and have nothing to show for it. It's hard for low-income people to feel respectful when the rich themselves show no respect in return. Low-income workers are the labor force which drives up the productivity of the rich, yet the rich are the only ones who have the time and luxury to benefit from it.

There are not really that many actual ""Cinderella-style"" success stories when it comes to the rich of this world. Many people are either born and bred with money or clearly know how to network and be in-the-know.

Very few people actually become millionaires by hard work alone and know-how. Very few people make their millions by 100% honest work-ethic. Many low-income families consist of people who have done nothing but try to work hard and do things honestly, but very few can climb the corporate ladder that way, therefore, they don't. Many people who have hit rock bottom and are, as you say, really poor, didn't necessarily get there because they were being lazy or were too messed up on drugs or alcohol. In this economy, there are just as many blue collar workers on the streets as there are people whose bad decisions landed them there. It's not that all poor people don't respect the productive, and again, every individual is different, but again, I think that it's hard for most people to show respect to people who never showed them respect. Furthermore, people on the street or in low-income situations are very stressed and just focusing on day-to-day survival. For most, it's very difficult to keep a positive outlook. But if we do our society as a whole whil get better.

1.  Hide is serious with Akira discussing Kanou.  Continues to search for Ken.
2.  Amon is dramatic asks ""what Hide will do when he confronts his best friend Ken.""
3. Hide looks dramatic again.  (For some reason, Suzuya has a musical note as talking?!)

TG Chapter 109

1.  Book signing.  Hide wonders ""if its over.""  Ken and Hinami left.   Goes to see Eto.  
2. Hide has a scary face.  Explains hanged man of muffin and did I see a similar hat?  Lol Ishida.  This has a lot of implications for Eto and Hide lol was Hide feeling inspired 
3.  Hide talks about Prisoner 182.  Eto appears to be pointing at him.  Hide looks surprised.  

TG 117

1. Touka wants to take wanted poster.  
2.  ""Ok let's put one here!""  Hide shouts.  Then he slams a poster right next to Touka.  Hide is called ""Senpai"" by someone and he explains to the idiot that its the cultural festival.  Surprised by seeing Touka.  Before that Touka ran into Furuta, he looked pretty surprised and walked away.
3.  Hide is surprised to see Touka.  

TG 118

1. Hide gets Touka coffee I believe.  
2.  Touka explains she's going to Kami.  Hide says ""is that so.""
3.  Hide says ""ladies first.""  Touka is sad can't find Kaneki.
4. Touka asks Hide about the type of person Kaneki was.

9.  Hide explains that Kaneki puts on masks and acts a part.  ""Always puts everything on his self."" 
10.  Hide says slyly ""This time too he's taken on various things.  I think things like 'I wish you wouldn't go too far.""  (Uh oh.)
11.  Hide gets upset changes ""He could just talk to me! Just a few words you know!  We've been together since we were kids!""  (Explains the text messages.)

1. Amon and Kaneki are fighting.  Hide looks creepy and Marude explains that this a reason they have to write their wills ""says scary."" 
2.  There was a chapter awhile back with Marude and Hide where Hide acts pretty goofy about writing a will.  I can't find it.

5.  ""I want to help you.  Can you fight with all you got.  Just one last time."" Kaneki explains he's pretty crazy at the moment. Hide explains they've blocked off all routes.""


That more or less wraps it up.  I think there's two other chapters of Hide running around as an intern (doing a good job at it), Marude interrogating him ""thinking he's a crook,""  and Hide writing his will with Arima doing the same thing as well.  But this more or less captures all of it right before what we know might be coming.

I can certainly do that, but I’m seriously struggling to give up my current job as a manager, which I guess I kind of like, and my YEAR-LONG gym membership (for showering, temp shelter, shaving, etc.), which I bought in January. I had to buy the year-long membership, because it was the only plan with a buy-in fee that I could actually afford at the time. But now I’m going to be billed $20 for the next 9 months for a facility I won’t even use! Kind of irritating and honestly it’s making me have reservations about relocating. I know it doesn’t seem like a big deal, but I live paycheck to paycheck, and the idea of having to buy a new membership at my new place, thus having me pay for TWO memberships simultaneously all while not even having a stable income is making me distraught.

And then I’ve worked extremely hard at my job and have become a manager. And the job has lots of locations around the country, making it easier to move around if you need. But I’ll have to give up that job, because they don’t have a location where my friend lives.

And to make all of this worse, I have to make a decision quickly, because my friend will probably graduate soon and who knows what he’ll do over the summer (internships and stuff). Right now he’s offering to let me stay rent-free (for a little?).

Any advice on how to deal with this/move past it?"

Info for newcomers: I've selected a bunch of quotes using a random generator from different Degrassi seasons (TNG 1-NC4). The goal of the game is to name the speaker of each quote and the person being spoken to for up to 2 points per question. For example, if the quote is ""Welcome to Degrassi"", you would get 2 points if you said ""Eli to Becky"", 1 point if you said ""Eli to Clare"", etc. Because it's random, the quotes vary in difficulty. But I always picked the first line that I thought was at least guessable.

Quotes:

1. “You ditched your own birthday party?”

2. “Uh..Esme and Tristan? Or did you finally hook up with that Swedish exchange student?” 

3.  “Hey, I think I’m going to stay here and do this internship at my dad’s firm.""

4. “Are you like pro-terrorist or something?”

5. “Conner gets expelled. Clare gets a new wardrobe.”

6.  “Betcha Eli overreacted.”

7. “Frankie has beautiful hair.”

8. “No, get out of here. Both your ages combined would not make you old enough.”

9. “They are so cute. Remember when we were that afraid of Degrassi?”

10. “So, feeling that school spirit?”

Answers from last round: 

1. “They said you were housebroken”

83986f,7,2018-03-09,UPDATE: How should one work with monkeys at a zoo? &amp; new question on zoo interviews!,helpmesavethem,CaptiveWildlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaptiveWildlife/comments/83986f/update_how_should_one_work_with_monkeys_at_a_zoo/,"I have an interview for an internship at an AZA-accredited zoo! Any tips on what to wear to that (business professional or business casual)? 

Right now I’m still working at the private zoo until I know for sure I have been accepted for this internship (even if I don’t get accepted I will be putting in my two weeks notice ASAP). I am a little nervous about how to talk about my private zoo experience with out sounding like I’m bashing this zoo which could come off very negatively to the interviewer.

I filed an OSHA report about 1-2 weeks ago but I haven’t heard anything back.. Do I file a another one or does it take awhile? Then I have been in contact with someone from the humane society who is involved with captive wildlife. She said she had her suspicions about what was going on at this zoo, but now I just confirmed it. She was in touch with the two contacts I gave her who have previously worked there and gave their experiences at the zoo but apparently when she contacted the last person she said something along the lines of “if I file a USDA report...”  so now I’m worried that this person won’t send in a report at all. 

When my contact told me that, I sent in a USDA report talking about the conditions and how the water bottles of the monkeys are never scrubbed out along with the water tanks of the tigers, bears, and lions (I have been doing my research about the animal welfare act which says it should be scrubbed out at least once every 2 weeks). I just really don’t understand how we passed our USDA inspection this winter because there were several violations including open containers of food, soiled bedding, and gross water. Apparently the inspector gave us an excuse saying she understood because of how cold it has been outside. Also when meat is defrosting for the animals shouldn’t it be defrosted in a refrigerator (because it’s defrosted at room temperature at this zoo)? This zoo also never spot cleans. When the deer pen became too dirty (which it had been for awhile) the head zookeeper had us throw hay on one side of their pen on top of the already soiled hay. 

Also it’s really sad that there aren’t any animal welfare act regulations for birds. One of the cranes we have has a banged up wing for months (when it’s scared it bangs one of it’s wings on a wall to the point that it is bloody) and no vet has came in to see it or treat. I asked the head zookeeper if we could put in cushioning along the walls and she just looked at me weird and said no it’s not necessary. I could probably go on and on about other stuff that’s going on. I’m very frustrated and when ever I make suggestions to do things I always get the response of oh we will do that next week or today we are just feeding and going home (when usually we only work from 8 am -12 pm, which is ridiculous for how many animals there are). 

TLDR: Interview at an AZA-accredited zoo and leaving this terrible zoo as soon as possible, but still feeling very guilty about leaving the animals in these conditions.

839oxx,1,2018-03-09,"23[t4A]Nerdy, Sexy, Descriptive, Sexual, Sensual, Fellatrix Sub Looking to be mindfucked with a detailed and sensual tale.",MystiChase,eroticpenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticpenpals/comments/839oxx/23t4anerdy_sexy_descriptive_sexual_sensual/,"Hello!

I'm seeking a long term RP partner for a collaboration on a feminization story. Maybe this is you. My writing partner must be a solid writer, good at character development, dialog and not just looking for stroke material. Writers who enjoy sensuality, eroticism, and romance will get preference. If you're a strong, dominant type who is also kind and loves the build and the romance and eroticism involved with a story like this then you may be the partner for me. :)

I love building backstory with my partner as we iron out all the details. We don't need to figure out the whole story, just your basic story beats so we have some direction. I've worked really hard on this prompt so I ask you to please not message me with lazy, half-hearted responses. I think with the right partner we could have a blast with this!

The type of stories I prefer are focused on a transformation that takes time to complete. I prefer to go from naïve boi to (your ideal version of a woman). The plot would have to come first of course.
So those of you looking for a quick story in which we start having sex, I am not your gurl.

Plot elements I like:

As stated above I like the naïve boi that goes along with authority figures because he believes they know what's best. One thing to note is I prefer men to women when the transformation is complete. The method in which I become attracted or obsessed with men I would prefer to be a natural progression. For example, loving the way being wanted feels then becoming desperate to attain more of it and one time going too far and realizing that the attention is only half the fun... ;)

Or you know a good old stand by the poor intern at Disney world that has to become a Disney Princess and through a slow mental manipulation process becomes the princess of the parks desires...This can be taken many directions and be a fun way to manipulate the character into becoming feminine perfection and having to love it in order to keep my job. At first hating and fighting it but eventually loving the feeling of being the princess to the prince or park attendees...


It would be helpful to the plot if I were to start as a virgin.

Another plot point that I like is trying to hide the changes to mind and body. If the changes occur at work I like trying to hide them at home so my parents or roommates don't notice. Or if they are happening at home trying to hide them at work.

Method: I like ""realistic"" changes like HYPNOSIS, hormones and surgeries . Science fiction can be fun when paired with the hormones I.e. Fast acting ones.

Slow moving magical curses are also super fun. I like day to day or week to week changes that my character has to get used to in everyday life.

Dislikes: I don't like scat play (including diapers)or furry. But I am game for whatever else sound fun to you.

Likes: Above all I want you to enjoy it. IRL I am a bottom and pleasing is what I prefer.


---


The story below is just a sample. I am very open to any prompt you would like to throw out there as long as there is an erotic element that is sensual first sexual second. 

For example: 

My name is Chase and I live with my mom in a small apartment in the north end of town. Our apartment is not very big it has a kitchen area a bathroom one bedroom and a living space. My bed is a pull out couch in the living space and my mothers bed is in the bedroom. I have some semblance of privacy at times but mostly my life is an open book to her. She knows everything about me. I wouldn't say we have a weird relationship but it is awfully close. She had me when she was 16 and ever since I turned 13 she always wants to talk to me as if we are best friends. Which is why she is desperate to see me succeed in life.

She wants to see her bff be successful and happy. Which is a nice sentiment but I have very little interest in being a typical guy. I don't want a girlfriend because it seems like to much effort to make sure I am as presentable as possible at all times. I am a more go with the flow type person. I am not the type of person to decide on my life decisions by myself I like being told what my choice is. I feel that it takes away any bad repercussions that could happen. I like being able to blame the decision maker and not myself. Which is why my mom is struggling to motivate me.

She has tried to ask me what I want to do with my life and I just shrug her off. I think it is getting to her because every morning she comes out of her bedroom with a large sigh seeing me on my pullout bed still sleeping. I think she sees me as being lazy but like I said I am just anxious of making the wrong decision. 

So she found a job beta testing games for VR. However something changed once I got a new game called ‘The Academy' she hasn't a clue what the game is about, but she heard it was an X-rated game, so I was trying to keep it hush, hush from her, for I know she doesn't appreciate filth like this in her home. She saw me playing it and wanted to say something, but realizing I was twenty-three and an adult, maybe in age, but not mentally, she feels I have a right to do what I want. Well she was pleasantly surprised to hear nice music coming from the game, almost classical music, easy to listen to. The graphics were truly spectacular, it almost looked like I was watching a daytime soap opera, the characters looked that real. She noticed there was a white noise being generated in the background. She guessed it was a meadow scene and it was supposed to be the wind or something. The dialog was interesting too. First it sounded like real people talking, not a computer-generated voice at all. It looked like this was an adventure game, where the person was given puzzles to solve, to find clues or hidden things, which help solve the game. Kind of like the Telltale Games.
 
She noticed that my character was a female, a very [sexy cougar](http://i.imgur.com/CfrGtii.jpg) in fact. She found this interesting that I would choose such a character I am not your typical guy but she figured I would choose a male character to live out the fantasies. It was almost embarrassing how beautiful she was too. She was almost jealous she didn't look like her.
 
I heard the beautiful, skimpily dressed girl, my character was standing next too, saying, ""My, my. You need to date  him to get that information that you seek girl. You look like such a tomboy. You need to make yourself look sexy and appealing, for him otherwise he will have no interest in you. Let me get you ready so you will know how to dress properly in the future. I'm sure you can get an outfit that will make his eyeballs pop out of his sockets when he sees you. Come with me dear.""
 
The character that was helping stated, ""Oh Cedric , but I'll let you find out what those things are from him. Come let us take a bath and remove all of your body hair, so you are silky smooth. Then I'll wash your lovely hair and put it up in the most beautiful of locks, that any girl would be jealous of."" With this the other girl took off all her clothes and the both of them went into the hot spring to wash.
 
She noticed I was was getting sexually excited, judging by the bulge she saw in my pants. 

So I am finding this interesting and sexually stimulating huh? She was beginning to wonder why her son would even consider playing this game? This is too weird. It's so girly, why would a boi possibly play this character in the game? She thought she better have a talk with me about this.

I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR FUN PARTNERS REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THIS HAS BEEN UP!"
839v86,2,2018-03-09,"23[t4A]Nerdy, Sexy, Descriptive, Sexual, Sensual, Fellatrix Sub Looking to be seduced with a detailed and sensual tale.",MystiChase,TransformationRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransformationRP/comments/839v86/23t4anerdy_sexy_descriptive_sexual_sensual/,"Hello!

I'm seeking a long term RP partner for a collaboration on a feminization story. Maybe this is you. My writing partner must be a solid writer, good at character development, dialog and not just looking for stroke material. Writers who enjoy sensuality, eroticism, and romance will get preference. If you're a strong, dominant type who is also kind and loves the build and the romance and eroticism involved with a story like this then you may be the partner for me. :)

I love building backstory with my partner as we iron out all the details. We don't need to figure out the whole story, just your basic story beats so we have some direction. I've worked really hard on this prompt so I ask you to please not message me with lazy, half-hearted responses. I think with the right partner we could have a blast with this!

The type of stories I prefer are focused on a transformation that takes time to complete. I prefer to go from naïve boi to (your ideal version of a woman). The plot would have to come first of course.
So those of you looking for a quick story in which we start having sex, I am not your gurl.

Plot elements I like:

As stated above I like the naïve boi that goes along with authority figures because he believes they know what's best. One thing to note is I prefer men to women when the transformation is complete. The method in which I become attracted or obsessed with men I would prefer to be a natural progression. For example, loving the way being wanted feels then becoming desperate to attain more of it and one time going too far and realizing that the attention is only half the fun... ;)

Or you know a good old stand by the poor intern at Disney world that has to become a Disney Princess and through a slow mental manipulation process becomes the princess of the parks desires...This can be taken many directions and be a fun way to manipulate the character into becoming feminine perfection and having to love it in order to keep my job. At first hating and fighting it but eventually loving the feeling of being the princess to the prince or park attendees...


It would be helpful to the plot if I were to start as a virgin.

Another plot point that I like is trying to hide the changes to mind and body. If the changes occur at work I like trying to hide them at home so my parents or roommates don't notice. Or if they are happening at home trying to hide them at work.

Method: I like ""realistic"" changes like HYPNOSIS, hormones and surgeries . Science fiction can be fun when paired with the hormones I.e. Fast acting ones.

Slow moving magical curses are also super fun. I like day to day or week to week changes that my character has to get used to in everyday life.

Dislikes: I don't like scat play (including diapers)or furry. But I am game for whatever else sound fun to you.

Likes: Above all I want you to enjoy it. IRL I am a bottom and pleasing is what I prefer.

The story below is just a sample. I am very open to any prompt you would like to throw out there as long as there is an erotic element that is sensual first sexual second. 

For example: 

My name is Chase and I live with my mom in a small apartment in the north end of town. Our apartment is not very big it has a kitchen area a bathroom one bedroom and a living space. My bed is a pull out couch in the living space and my mothers bed is in the bedroom. I have some semblance of privacy at times but mostly my life is an open book to her. She knows everything about me. I wouldn't say we have a weird relationship but it is awfully close. She had me when she was 16 and ever since I turned 13 she always wants to talk to me as if we are best friends. Which is why she is desperate to see me succeed in life.

She wants to see her bff be successful and happy. Which is a nice sentiment but I have very little interest in being a typical guy. I don't want a girlfriend because it seems like to much effort to make sure I am as presentable as possible at all times. I am a more go with the flow type person. I am not the type of person to decide on my life decisions by myself I like being told what my choice is. I feel that it takes away any bad repercussions that could happen. I like being able to blame the decision maker and not myself. Which is why my mom is struggling to motivate me.

She has tried to ask me what I want to do with my life and I just shrug her off. I think it is getting to her because every morning she comes out of her bedroom with a large sigh seeing me on my pullout bed still sleeping. I think she sees me as being lazy but like I said I am just anxious of making the wrong decision. 

So she found a job beta testing games for VR. However something changed once I got a new game called ‘The Academy' she hasn't a clue what the game is about, but she heard it was an X-rated game, so I was trying to keep it hush, hush from her, for I know she doesn't appreciate filth like this in her home. She saw me playing it and wanted to say something, but realizing I was twenty-three and an adult, maybe in age, but not mentally, she feels I have a right to do what I want. Well she was pleasantly surprised to hear nice music coming from the game, almost classical music, easy to listen to. The graphics were truly spectacular, it almost looked like I was watching a daytime soap opera, the characters looked that real. She noticed there was a white noise being generated in the background. She guessed it was a meadow scene and it was supposed to be the wind or something. The dialog was interesting too. First it sounded like real people talking, not a computer-generated voice at all. It looked like this was an adventure game, where the person was given puzzles to solve, to find clues or hidden things, which help solve the game. Kind of like the Telltale Games.
 
She noticed that my character was a female, a very [sexy cougar](http://i.imgur.com/CfrGtii.jpg) in fact. She found this interesting that I would choose such a character I am not your typical guy but she figured I would choose a male character to live out the fantasies. It was almost embarrassing how beautiful she was too. She was almost jealous she didn't look like her.
 
I heard the beautiful, skimpily dressed girl, my character was standing next too, saying, ""My, my. You need to date  him to get that information that you seek girl. You look like such a tomboy. You need to make yourself look sexy and appealing, for him otherwise he will have no interest in you. Let me get you ready so you will know how to dress properly in the future. I'm sure you can get an outfit that will make his eyeballs pop out of his sockets when he sees you. Come with me dear.""
 
The character that was helping stated, ""Oh Cedric , but I'll let you find out what those things are from him. Come let us take a bath and remove all of your body hair, so you are silky smooth. Then I'll wash your lovely hair and put it up in the most beautiful of locks, that any girl would be jealous of."" With this the other girl took off all her clothes and the both of them went into the hot spring to wash.
 
She noticed I was was getting sexually excited, judging by the bulge she saw in my pants. 

So I am finding this interesting and sexually stimulating huh? She was beginning to wonder why her son would even consider playing this game? This is too weird. It's so girly, why would a boi possibly play this character in the game? She thought she better have a talk with me about this.

Desktop and Mobile wallet betas are going great and I want to give a huge thank you to everyone submitting bugs. Devin is planning to release Desktop version 5 this weekend which will be including features such as password confirm on change and allowing representatives to be switched. 

We have created a beta network to run alongside the main net as an expanded test net. Currently, universal blocks are being tested on the newly launched beta network where the currency Benano is being traded.

I know everyone is awaiting the roadmap, I hear “When Roadmap?” in my sleep at this point, and the team is working to finalize it for release. We hope to have it ready for you guys soon.

Finally, Community Manager Intern Taxes is going to be hosting a puzzle tomorrow morning. This puzzle will have a bounty attached to it, and more information can be found in the #puzzle-solvers channel on the NanoTrade discord server. This is going to be the third puzzle he has hosted and the other two have been a great time, so join in on the fun tomorrow at 15:45 UTC at https://discord.gg/ew74pGK

83bm58,0,2018-03-09,"[Conflicted] I am afraid I am making a greedy decision that is gonna haunt me, at the sametime I know the decision I am making is right.",welchie98,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/83bm58/conflicted_i_am_afraid_i_am_making_a_greedy/,"Now this year I am transferring. I have researched two schools that I am interested in going to, SUNY Albany and SUNY Buffalo. If I chose to go to SUNY Albany, I would be staying at home. Of course, I will be living at SUNY Buffalo.

I will be a CS major, and SUNY Albany does not have the best CS department. The schools don't really seem to have a lot of effort on that end. It's rather small, the classes are more ""Information Science,"" rather than ""Computer Science,"" which are totally difference and something that I don't want to do. I don't wanna do IS, I wanna do CS. SUNY Albany is a great school (especially for business), but not so well for CS. Even kids that go there for CS, the ones that I have talked to, says nothing bad about it but nothing great about it either.

SUNY Buffalo, on the other hand, is probably the 2nd best with it's CS department out of all the SUNY schools (Stony Brook is the best). There CS department has seen nothing but growth and improvement, a lot of job/internship opportunities. So they clearly beat SUNY Albany by a mile (to me). However, if I go to SUNY Buffalo, that means I would have to take out more loans than I would for Albany.

My parents are gun ho about me going to SUNY Albany, and I think the only reason is that it's cheap and I am staying at home. While yes, that really is a big reason, I am on the other side of the fence. Obtaining a CS degree and having access to internships in a already great CS program, while Albany seems to lack this.

Is this being greedy? I am trying to not be greedy, if Albany was great for what I want I wouldn't even be on here questioning this. I am not doing this because I wanna ""go away from home,"" or because of, ""the name of the school,"" (it's SUNY Buffalo not Stanford). I am just looking at graduating out of college with a job more importantly, and I think my parents are just looking at the pricetag more than what the pricetag is going towards. Am I being greedy? Am I making a good choice? Should I just deal with SUNY Albany and the mediocre CS department?

If I went to SUNY Buffalo, I would have to borrow loans. I would have to take out at least $40k in loans for 2 years (I am a transfer), that will include the Federal Direct Sub. $3.5k I just got in my financial award package. I also have a strong feeling my grandfather will pay for the tuition, so take that away from the $40k loan (tuition is about $6.6k for a year)."

Is SFSU even remotely a good choice of schools for the type of student I describe above, if not where in california would be a better school that would accept the same sort of student?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

83exzx,50,2018-03-10,I'm afraid my daughter will think the same of me as I think of my mom,AlishaaHh,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/83exzx/im_afraid_my_daughter_will_think_the_same_of_me/,"Hi,

I'm not really sure how to start. My mom wasn't there for me emotionally and I am still struggling with it sometimes. She didn't have a job but just sat on the couch next to my dad and now we don't really talk. Which I don't mind at all, I don't want to talk to her because it only makes me feel sad.

Anyway, I am a student and will be an intern next month for 3 months. What stresses me out is that I'll have to work 9 to 5 each day and I'm afraid I won't be able to give my daughter enough love/attention.
I'm sure it won't be as bad as I think it will be now, but I'd like some advice in how to make sure my relationship with my daughter will stay the way it is now.

My daughter just started kindergarden this month and she'll get to do new things this schoolyear, which I will miss out on. My internship supervisor is a mom herself and I already talked to her about me having a daughter, but I don't want to keep asking if I can have some time off. But on the other hand, my heart breaks a little just thinking about not being there for my daughter.

I know I probably need (more) therapy to subside these feelings and accepting that I won't turn into my mom, but for now that isn't possible and I'm not sure if I am even ready to go through that.

I'd really appreciate it if anyone of you could give me some advice or even just tell your experiences. I don't really know any moms that work fulltime (and even if I do, I don't speak to them because I'm rather young still)

Thanks in advance"

83ff48,19,2018-03-10,"As a muslim, what would you do in my situation?",MoeDunkins,islam,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/83ff48/as_a_muslim_what_would_you_do_in_my_situation/,"

I'm going to try to sum it up as much as I can. Feel free to ask for more info in the comments.

Here we go:

Prior to my becoming a muslim, I was in law school and used to intern at the local courthouse. Everything seemed to be going just fine, and I didn't have any major concerns.

Back then I thought I'd graduate in a few years and eventually start life like most of the people I grew up with did, working my way up till I finally reached the golden days in my career... Except that it didn't happen. I had a thing come up along the way, and that led to me not even being able to make it through college. Things took a downturn all of a sudden, and next thing I know, my whole life was spiraling out of control. An 18-year-old guy who'd been once one of the top students in school and who was said to have a bright future laying ahead was now a loner, cooped up in a tiny room at his parents', cut off from society as a whole.

It was during this very time that a muslim I met through the Internet invited me to Islam. I didn't know what to say at first (**there are no Muslims where I live** and I didn't know what to expect), but it's not like I had anything to lose (or so I thought). I took him up on his offer. I decided to keep this under wraps in the beginning, fearing rejection, but my mom ended up finding out and... Well, things got nasty. She's not fond of islam in the least. We had a lot of arguments and fights, and soon enough my relationship with her had become permanently damaged.

Are you guys still with me?

At this point, not only was my professional life off to a terrible start, but so was my relationship with my family as a new muslim. It goes without saying that it didn't take long for depression to take over once again — *I literally felt like my life was ruined.*

In a desperate attempt to get my mind off of that, I went back online and began to make friends with even more Muslims from all around the globe. Fast forward a couple of months, and, with the little knowledge I got from a bunch of Islamic courses I undertook off and on, there I was, engaging in virtual dawah. I had a YouTube channel that was starting to get a fair share of fame, and I'd also become the editor/admin of a few popular (Islamic) pages out there. That did seem to work for a while, but...

Turns out that years went by, and even with all the positive results my recent actions have brought, the truth is that reality is still knocking on my door, waiting for the perfect moment to suck me back in. I'm almost 25 now. I don't think I can run away any longer. What if my parents die? Even though we're not on good speaking terms, with Allah's permission, they are the ones who've been supporting me this whole time. If anything happens, I'm as good as homeless (I've read a hadeeth that says that Muslims don't inherit from non-Muslims). That's quite a scary thought, and I'm not going to lie... Sometimes I wish for death.

When I see my old friends on the street, I quickly cross over to the other side so they won't come around and ask my how I'm doing in life. I'm embarrassed to say that, after all this time, basically nothing has changed for me. Some of them are now married, and others taking a masters and all that, and I'm here, as if it was just yesterday that I left high school. How lame!

I need some advice. I have no money of my own, and I'm not willing to ask my parents for help. They're Christians who live off of shirk and activities related to riba. Getting a job in this minuscule town without dealing with haram is not the easiest task either — not to mention the humiliation (I wouldn't want the people who always thought I was going places, including old teachers, seeing me working as your average Joe). What about the rest of the family? Lawyers, doctors, a soon-to-be engineer, teachers, personal trainers... And then me. The black sheep. I can't put myself through that.

I wish I could just disappear without a trace. Maybe go somewhere really far off, where nobody knows me and somehow find a way to start over. I'm starting to feel hopeless. A lot of people say I have talent, but I just can't figure out how to get myself back on track **IN A HALAL WAY** (especially without a degree).

What do I do?

83g0ik,209,2018-03-10,Got told by a university lecturer that PHP is shit,s1mpl3_0n3,PHP,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/83g0ik/got_told_by_a_university_lecturer_that_php_is_shit/,"I've been a PHP dev for around 6 years now, some of which I've spend time developing in Python, but it's just now that I've had the time to start a masters degree. Sadly in my country people tend to go to university only to actually get a degree, because it's highly unlikely the lecturer will teach you something practical.

So here I am after one of the exams having a chat with a couple of classmates and a female lecturer about the upcoming semester and we reach a point where we discuss a project that we'll have to complete by the end of the year. So one of the classmates asks what kind of a technology we should use for that project and the lecturer says ""well you can do it in Java, C#, whatever you decide, but not PHP"" and she starts laughing. Understandably I ask her in a jokingly manner ""why the discrimination towards PHP?"" and she says, that it's not a very popular language at the university.

A couple of moments later another lecturer enters the room and he goes for a chat to the female lecturer and she says to us ""let him tell you why you should not use PHP"". With a serious look he stares at us and says angrily ""because here we write using programming languages, not using shit"". At this moment I probably got red of anger, because I'm tired of these generalizations. He continues ""there is not a single serious company that would use that silly language"". That's when they both get out of the room and I look in disbelieve at the classmate, that asked the initial question, knowing she also writes mainly in PHP. 

Why I felt so bad you may ask. It's not that I take this personally in any way, or that I feel threatened, but because these are the people, that the young students look up to and take advice from, and that's when those young fellas build their views for the technology that they are to use in the future. I've seen numerous occasions of interns talking the same crap in the company and of course I'm one of the guys that tell them otherwise with examples. 

I'm really fed up with all the constant bashing on PHP and I have no idea how we can change that. That's why I feel like I have my hands tied up..."

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

83hnan,115,2018-03-10,Boyfriend (24m) wants a farm,Ahailiao,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/83hnan/boyfriend_24m_wants_a_farm/,"So, my (24f) boyfriend (24m) of five years has decided he wants to move to Oregon and start a farm.

He’s found a few videos of people on YouTube claiming they’re making hundreds of thousands of dollars through organic farming and he’s buying into it.

I’ve been reading about organic farming, and farming in general, and while admittedly I don’t know much about it, what I have found isn’t encouraging.

There are people all across the country who are raised to farm, who go to college and study agriculture, whose families have been trying to make it work for generations. And for many, it fails. A handful succeed, but it’s INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT and heavily dependent upon luck. People work twelve hours every day for years, and end up broke.

He’s been talking about this for about 6-12 months, and at this point seems pretty adamant about actually doing it. So I told him what I thought....that it was a bad idea.

He got INCREDIBLY offended, saying that I was “STOMPING ALL OVER HIS DREAMS”, and that I just wanted him to work a “soulless real estate job to finance my babies” (this quite angered me as I’ve always known I didn’t want kids, and he’s always claimed the same; in the back of his mind, I fear he might buy into the cultural idea that every woman secretly wants nothing in life but to breed children, regardless of what they say. Also, he was completely denying the fact that I have been actively working to support myself. I’m hoping it was all just heat of the moment nonsense).

My boyfriend and I graduated from college two years ago. I have a pretty clear idea of what I want to do, and have been getting relevant jobs and gaining experience. Through this career, I’ll never be rich, but I’ll make a steady income and I’m doing something that I believe will make a positive impact on the world.

He has always been a star student and very dedicated to school, from elementary to college. He was always that 4.0 Honors Student. Since graduating, he’s just been bar tending, refusing to in any way work towards any kind of actual career. He said to me that he’d “never work a 9-to-5” and scoffed, like he was above it. I think he might have a bit of a superiority complex from everyone in school telling him that he was brilliant, and he thinks that he has to find some alternative means to become a billionaire.

But, he also seems to be having kind of an existential crisis. He’s become obsessed with various conspiracy theories- I try to be open minded and don’t automatically assume every “conspiracy theory” is nonsense, but I’ve listened to his “logic” with some of these and I’m astounded by how much his former rationality has deteriorated. So much of what he’s told me doesn’t make sense, and can be immediately refuted, but he still seems to WANT to believe them. He always made a big deal about being an atheist and not falling victim to blind faith (both of us were raised by religious parents, but left in high school) but that’s exactly what he’s started doing.

I think this whole thing is kind of typical at our age- to be looking for a purpose in life, and to be desperately wanting to believe in something. But I am taking the boring, responsible route to achieve feasible dreams through long hours at office internships, and he is at home smoking weed and watching conspiracy videos on the internet and committing to what appear to be get-rich-quick schemes. He’s always been a hard worker and he has indeed dedicated a lot of energy to learning about this organic farming and practicing it in our backyard, but my faith in the whole thing is low, and even if he does go through with this, there’s no way I’m giving up all the progress I’ve made so far to move to rural Oregon and labor 60 hours a week under the sun on a farm (!!!)

I guess I’m just waiting for him to...get over this. I have been with him for five years and I love him; is it wise to hope this is just a phase, and wait for it to pass? He’s been fixated on the farm thing for a while now, but he’s cycled through various other obsessions before for just as long. Part of me thinks that maybe he will eventually gain a sense of reality and pragmatism and above all humility, but perhaps not.

Tl;dr: my boyfriend wants to start a farm, I’m not on board, he seems to be going through a phase of fantastical career aspirations and I can’t decide if I should leave or wait for him to pick a realistic career.

It usually happens in maps with rain. (Ruins of Sarnath, the most popular one, great)

I have RX480 / 8 GB and the newest drivers. A bit older cpu i7-2600k / 3.4 GHz, but I can play games like f.e. Witcher 3 on almost full details. Doom on full (especially on Vulkan, makes me get much more fps). So idk if it could be some setting that makes my cpu bottleneck the game.  But I guess I would have constantly low fps and not stuttering. 8 GB RAM.

Tried to reinstall Windows, upgraded from W7 to W10 with a clean install and didn't help

Otherwise performance is good, I mean I have good fps in general, but there are just these micro fucking stutters all the time. I thought it  was fixed for a while in one patch but then it returned.

It's a last resort asking here, personally I'm convinced it's just the shitty game engine made by an Indian intern and I will never get to play the game and get a smooth experience like let's say in QL. But hope dies last."

I've had this fantasy for sometime and hopefully will find someone that would like to play it out.  We can discuss the specifics but initially I'm thinking you're a young intern at my wifes work.  You've been over to our place for BBQs, supper etc. and on this occasion I'm out with some friends.  I return home and hear noises from the bedroom.  The door is slightly ajar so I silently walk down the hall and peak in.  What I see is disturbing and also very erotic.  Hopefully this scenario interests you.  We can change things up depending on your interests and desires.
Some about myself and my wife.  She doesn't know I chat online so won't be involved in the play herself.  We're both 55 yo.  She is very attractive with a nice body; long legs, a nice butt and smaller breasts.  FYI - I will get involved in the play but the thought of catching you two and watching for awhile excites me.
Anyways. I hope to hear from you and get to know a little about you before we begin.

Take care,

For a €80k car, you'd expect car makers to make a proprietary infotainment system, but they just put a skin on Android and market it as 'apps downloadable'. 

First of all, did they not think of the privacy issues? Google loves your data, that's how they make their money. Now the auto makers basically gave them access to all your car's data as well.

Secondly, the security issues. The Bentley [here](https://youtu.be/KB2MA2jVXXU?t=5m30s) seems to be running android 4, and it's Android 8 now. God knows how many security issues that thing has.

https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_59e78243e4b0e60c4aa36711/amp?__twitter_impression=true

From the article linked above:
""On October 18, 2014, two employees of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals drove their van to the small  community of Parksley, Virginia. Parksley is an out of the way rural town of less than 1,000 people. The destination of the PETA van was a trailer park located there, made up largely of poor, Spanish speaking immigrants. The park is described by a local resident as “difficult to find unless you know where you are going.” The PETA employees knew exactly where they were going because they had been there before.

Over several weeks, PETA representatives had been visiting the trailer park and befriending the residents. They got to know who lived where and who had dogs and cats. They sat with the families on their porches, talking to them, offering biscuits to the dogs, promoting vaccinations, sterilization, and other PETA services. One of the families they spent time with had a three year old Chihuahua named Maya, a happy, healthy, and beloved dog. And on October 18, her home was one of the houses PETA set out to visit. This time, however, they were not there to talk to the family or any of the other residents or to offer any kind of assistance. In fact, they knew the family was not home.

The PETA employees backed their van up to the porch and threw biscuits to Maya, who was sitting on her porch, hoping to coax her off her property and give PETA the ability to claim she was a stray dog “at large” whom they could therefore legally impound. In Virginia, PETA is licensed as an “animal shelter.” But Maya refused to stay off the property and after grabbing the biscuit, ran back to the safety of her porch. One of the employees went onto the property and stole Maya. But larceny wasn’t the only law the PETA employees would break. Virginia law requires dogs to be held for five days before they can be killed by shelters. It also requires private shelters like PETA to notify the municipal animal control shelter of any “stray” dogs they take in. PETA would do neither. Within hours, Maya was dead. PETA had killed her with a lethal dose of poison.

Maya’s family ultimately sued PETA. Last month, after arguing and losing pre-trial motions that Maya was worthless and **facing the specter of PETA administrators being forced to turn over records and testify under oath about their inner workings — particularly, their campaign of animal extermination — PETA settled the case by paying Maya’s family $49000**

In 2014, PETA killed 2,324 of the 2,626 animals it acquired, including Maya. It had a 1% adoption rate. In 2015, it killed another 1,494. Last year, 1,442 were put to death. The majority of the remainder were taken to local pounds where they were killed. ""



""In fact, DxE’s leader has publicly stated that Newkirk is “brilliant,” and “just the sort of the leader our movement needs,” despite being provided with evidence demonstrating that PETA is not only responsible for the deaths of more than 13,744 animals over the last 13 years, but that it encourages pounds across the country to kill even more.""

""
This evidence includes impound records acquired through Public Records Act requests, reports by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services after its inspectors visited PETA facilities, affidavits, witness testimony, and court rulings in criminal and civil cases, accounts of other PETA employees, as well as statements made by PETA founder, Ingrid Newkirk, herself.

And what this evidence reveals is that PETA employees both take in and seek out, often through deception, theft and outright lies, thousands of animals every year, the vast majority of whom they immediately put to death with a fatal dose of poison. While PETA claims the animals it takes in and kills are “unadoptable,” the facts do not support this claim. 


Healthy mother cat and two kittens killed by PETA within minutes, despite promising to find them a home.
**Employees have described — and records reveal — 8 week old, 10 week old, and 12 week old healthy kittens and puppies routinely and immediately put to death with no effort to find them homes. PETA has been caught stealing healthy animals and putting them to death. Rescue groups, individuals, and veterinarians have come forward stating that the animals they gave PETA were healthy and PETA insiders have admitted as much, one former intern reporting that he quit in disgust after witnessing healthy puppies and kittens in the kill room.**

Indeed, a former PETA fieldworker says that killing is not an ancillary part of PETA’s program; it goes to the core of the mission. **“The objective of the program,” she says, “was to get as many animals as possible and the vast majority of those animals were killed.” Nothing came between that objective and the staff, including lying by telling people the animals would be adopted knowing full well they would be killed: “I was told to pretty much say anything I needed to say to gain custody of an animal… I was told to lie by my direct supervisors directly and then by Ingrid [Newkirk]…”**"

In my third year of college, I won a cash scholarship that gave me work experience with the sponsoring firm. I did a 3 month paid internship the summer. A few things happened outside of work during this time.

* I won the award of law student of the year in my country 
* Was interviewed on radio, magazines, online, etc 
* I made lots of connections and received job offers as a result 
* Generally grew a lot as a person and professional

On my last day of the internship, having interviewed for other firms, the founder and senior partner of the firm offered me a job as his associate. He was hiring for full time with experience, and although I could only do part time and I had little experience, he wanted to take me on because he liked my personality and drive and thought I was a fast learner.

When we first talked about how it would work he asked how much I was wanting to be paid. I hadn’t prepared for this question as I’d never had that choice before, and I asked for the standard minimum rate for the first 3 months while I find my feet. So that’s what I’m on.

Now I did some investigating, and here’s some points to consider…

* I’m on $25,000 p/a
* They were originally hiring for someone with some experience at a rate of $95k p/a (didn’t know this til after I was taken on and did some research, previous assistant/associate was getting this rate with no law experience)
* My boss pays me himself (no longer paid by the company) and he earns enough that he can easily pay someone $100k p/a.. thats all I'll say there 
* Boss and I get along like a house on fire, and all the staff comment on how much happier and less stressed he is since I came on. He has also been able to bring in new business as a result of time I’ve freed up for him
* I’m working around 25 hours p/w, job was advertised for around 35
* I’m in my last year of college, graduate with my bachelors end of year
* I fucking love my job and the training and flexibility is excellent

If you were me, and you had a very generous boss, what would you be asking for? "

In a quandary of my own making atm. I've been chugging along pretty okay since my last major depressive breakdown ~2 years ago but the stress is getting over the top of my head recently and I've no idea who to talk to about it. 

Some backstory: 
- two major depressive episodes that left me housebound for 1+ year in total - first one 4 years ago, second episode ~2 years back
- my depression is heavily tied to my eating patterns (i've got a history of disordered eating) and stress; and i cope with my emotions poorly (self-harm and isolating myself) 

Anyway, moving on - midway through last year it dawned on me that I'd be graduating in about a year's time (Dec 2018) and that I had a shit CV with nothing lined up since I've perpetually been preoccupied with settling back into uni (after taking multiple mental health breaks) and coping. I was feeling better around this time and joined a bunch of clubs and activities. Surprisingly, despite how stress-inducing it all was, I was able to cope with all of it, and so I just added more and more to my plate - yeah, i do stupid things like this all the time. 

So, between mid-year 2017 to now, I've managed to get my hands on writing roles for two clubs, finish an intensive overseas summer subject, complete an internship and get a grad offer and headed straight back to uni without any rest in between. On top of that, I've had to deal with quite a few headache-inducing issues regarding my accommodation. 

Lately, I've noticed that I'm getting more irritable when skyping with my family. I've also fallen off the wagon a lot more in terms of eating. Also, while I gym regularly, I've been getting a feeling almost akin to desperation when I'm there, as though this is the last thing that's still ""right"" or ""normal"" in my life. Stuff like this has always preceded my previous depressive episodes where I end up just not functioning and being bed-bound. But I can't afford to take another leave of absence since my job offer next year is contingent on me graduating end of this year! 

The thing about me though, is that I stress so easily, I'm not sure if this is just another situation for me to grow from, or if I should actually heed these warning bells. Even though I got a grad offer at the end of my internship, I felt more dread and trapped than anything. 

I'm thinking of quitting one of the clubs I'm in to lessen the load and maybe this feeling of constant dread might edge back a little. But I'm apprehensive about talking to my therapist about it. During my internship, I mentioned how I was struggling with the hours (it's pretty intense - I was waking up 5.45-6 and all the social interaction was pretty draining to me) and she recommended I quit it. I didn't listen to her advice, and managed to get through it. Although I understand where she's coming from wanting to save her own ass, I just get really doubtful about where her advice is coming from since she has a habit of telling me to tone it down and not letting me test my limits. On the other hand, if I ask my family - they'd tell me the right thing to do is to stick it out and go for the long haul. That I've got less than a year left and it would give a bad impression for me to quit halfway through the semester. I can see the sense in that as well. Honestly, I feel like ""normal"" people live on a different plane of existence and expectation most of the time. The club I'm planning to quit are a bunch of high-achievers who wouldn't understand and they might potentially be colleagues in the future. I wouldn't want to leave them on a bad note. 

Honestly, my ""stress"" limits change so often I just get hella confused. It's like some months I can take on the world and others I can barely get out of bed. It's annoying because I feel like the more ""Recovered"" I get, the higher people's expectations become. And you know that graph that often gets thrown around? The one about recovery not being a linear thing. But expectations so often are! And I want to test my limits but then situations like this happen and I second-guess myself - should I forge on ahead or should I step back? 

tldr getting advice - my therapist gets overly cautious vs my family tells me to tough it out; sometimes i can cope with my family's solutions, sometimes i can't. not sure whose advice to follow this time round?"

I will be debt free and after looking at a few online payroll deduction calculators such as paycheck city and ADP it seems like I'll be walking home with a net monthly paycheck of ~$4000 after an 8% 401k deduction and uncle Sam's cut. Based on the rental market, in order to live alone in a 1 bedroom apartment I'll have to dish out about $1700/month in rent which does tend to include several utilities such as heat and water. That brings me down to $2300. I don't plan on really having a car since public transportation is really convenient and I have to take the train to work anyways since there's no parking available for junior level employees. A monthly metro pass will cost about $100. That brings me down to $2200. After that I'm budgeting about $500/month for food and $400/month for other utilities and misc expenses. That brings me down to $1200 left for the month after recurring expenses are covered which is 30% of my net income on top of the 8% of my gross income I'm also saving for my 401k. I already have about $20k saved through what I earned through part-time jobs and internships so I do have a cushion to fall on should a major unforseen expense happen in my first year out in the world. Is this an appropriate budget? I find it weird that I still have a good chunk of income left at the end of each month considering rent takes up 42% in this scenario. Am I missing something?"

83mcnr,59,2018-03-11,The Trouble With Wes...,[deleted],htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/83mcnr/the_trouble_with_wes/,"...is Laurel.

&amp;nbsp;

I've binge watched 1 - 3 seasons and then there was a long ass break and I caught up with 4 so far. I have forgotten a ton of stuff so keep that in mind. I'm going to binge rewatch this weekend and see if it still reads the same. I got lots of notes....something I'm finally picking up on...the trouble with Wes is Laurel....

&amp;nbsp;

**According To Laurel:**

Everything we know about Jorge is from Laurel...we don't really see him being a bad human being. We never see him ordering any hit on anyone. It's all Laurel's version. His version, however, is that she's mentally ill and unfit and he went to some pretty extraordinary lengths to legally gain custody of her child before she even got out of the hospital. We know from Laurel that her mother had the history of mental illness and her father intervened to keep her from harming her daughter. 


&amp;nbsp;

Laurel had a thing with Frank for awhile and yet, her parents were barely mentioned. Frank, we discover, was a closet thug who finally went openly thug and fell for Laurel. Kinda like Dominic. Dominic, who also told Frank they were a lot alike, fell for her and doing her bidding, but knowing she'll never love them, blah blah blah and Frank kills him. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Sandrine Knew Christophe:**

Now we get told that Christoph called her mother and that the two had met, she tried to pay him to break it off with Laurel more as protecting him from Laurel, and when cornered and threatened, her mother claims it was to protect Laurel....from......................remains to be seen.

&amp;nbsp;

The big question is why Wes would even remotely be in contact with her mother as Christophe and why she'd be on his emergency contact list, and why it had been initially shown to be Dominic's phone.

&amp;nbsp;

**Dominic's Loyalties:**

Flash back - Dominic had apparently begun working with Denver to take down Annalise. Denver's agenda was political, not homicidal. He's not going to hire an intern's father's thug to kill some college kid to take down Annalise, none of that makes any sense and has no point. Jorge has no incentive to kill Wes, either. Wes was enough of a ""puppy"" that Jorge could've just threatened him outright and Wes would've broken it off on his own. He wouldn't need to be paid. Jorge would've been way more likely to have Frank killed for impregnating Laurel than Wes...Frank actually was a thug who could jeopardize her entire life and his too. Wes wasn't a threat...

&amp;nbsp;

I know Laurel claims it was her father who hired Dominic to kill Wes but I wonder if we missed something right in our faces all along.

&amp;nbsp;

I think there are some pieces missing they haven't told us yet but I am starting to lean heavily toward two scenarios: Wes is alive, and it was Laurel herself who tasked Dominic with killing Wes. That is literally the only logical explanation for why her parents would go to that extreme to interfere in her life this way when they never had to this extent before (in the show that is). We listen to Laurel and we believe her, as we would if our friend we got to know and care about told us their horror story about the meddling crazy parents. 

&amp;nbsp;

I went over the timeline a bit and it blew me away...Laurel was in the house when it exploded, according to Laurel...

&amp;nbsp;


**But that timeline, though...**

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfsqNB7kIbk

&amp;nbsp;

So they reverse the scene with the time stamps overlaid...but we have a problem. The question is, is that just editing and not a thing or was it in front of us the entire time?

Compare the above to this play of events:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFoWjisHmI

&amp;nbsp;

2pm hour - Annalise has started leaving voice messages to them to meet at her house.

Prior to this, no time provided, we know Nate is arriving...meanwhile Annalise is enlisting Oliver's help to hack into the DA's office...least that's all we get to hear. But from other clips we are shown Annalise leaving messages for ""everyone"" to meet at her house, they're all possibly in trouble - that's the word.

Some point later, Connor uses his fling's phone and gets the message so he leaves fling and makes his way to Annalise's house also.


8:22 - Wes and Nate are talking. 

8:34pm is when the timeline shows Nate walking out and Wes walking to the office to start dialing Annalise....when Dominic jumps him. They show us the phone specifically hitting the floor. The hypo in the floor and we see Wes nail Dominic with the bottle and smash it. Dominic gets the better of him and drags him to the basement.

We presume all this doesn't take too long if Connor has shown up shortly before 9pm. As we see, though, there is a broken bottle on the floor and Wes' phone...right there in the hallway because Connor sees it when he enters....

&amp;nbsp;

Then we see Connor tending to Wes, noticing the gas leak...all of this, according to their own time stamp takes place over 20 minutes though...they jump on purpose rolling back the clock instead of a single frame showing what the time would be. If this is a clue, then it means Connor was in the house from 9pm until 10:14.


&amp;nbsp;

Then we see Laurel show up, calling for Annalise several times...and then the explosion happens.

&amp;nbsp;

Flash back again: Nate enters the house and sees the vodka bottle on the floor. Wes sees it when he goes in. Connor sees it...but does Laurel notice it as she's roaming through there? Never does she seem alarmed.

&amp;nbsp;

Their timeline also means Laurel was in the house, obviously, for the explosion, but she later claims she saw someone going out the storm door. 

&amp;nbsp;

Flash back: Nate later questions Laurel in the hospital and asks about when she knew she was pregnant. He tells her that Frank confessed he killed Wes when he found out she was pregnant with Wes' baby. Laurel is confused as fuck. In another scene, Laurel is telling investigators way later, a week or longer after the fire, that she had a memory and remembered seeing Frank there, she saw him running out the storm door.



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFzpI21Q0NU



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmHXnTx_BTU


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWJjZN8keH4

&amp;nbsp;

However, according to Connor, he's the one that ran out the storm door - courtesy of this scene. Also pay close attention to Laurel's reactions:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aKd_dc_QgE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVcX0k0LDXo

&amp;nbsp;

But according to their stamp the explosion happens at 9:47...

&amp;nbsp;

How did Dominic know to be at Annalise's house for Wes? As we see in the clip above, Frank picks Wes up after Wes leaves the station...but we know Frank didn't actually kill Wes. He ""confesses"" for Laurel, presumably because he's that in love with her. Why would Annalise want them all to show up at her house? 

&amp;nbsp;

Connor is usually the one who acts like a drama queen baby about lying and deception...but he's still a good actor. They all offer their curious conversations and knowing looks, while the entire time Laurel is entirely full of absolute shit and she really lashed into Connor demanding that he go kill himself.

&amp;nbsp;

Could it be that this was a production for Laurel's benefit? Annalise gets Oliver to hack stuff for her and in the process they discover Laurel and Dominic are in regular contact because it's Laurel who is behind wanting Dominic to kill Wes. They hatch the plan to catch her in the act...

&amp;nbsp;

**Is Wes Alive Or Dead?**

&amp;nbsp;

It could go both ways to be honest. The plot backfired and Wes was killed, Laurel blamed it on Frank and then Connor, always deflecting and playing the victim...and they don't have enough on her. They discover shortly after the fire that she's pregnant so the plan is dragged out til she gives birth and they are the ones behind her father intervening because she's a nutjob....they can't pin anything on her overtly because she's just as guilty as they are in other things so they have to do it on the DL and keep her thinking she's in the group. 

&amp;nbsp;


Or what happened was Laurel called Dominic and sent him to Annalise's house to wait for Wes to show up. Frank intercepts Wes and reveals the plot to have him killed. The time stamp is the kicker. If it's the right time frame they want us to consider then Dominic had put Wes in the basement before 9pm and then sat outside in the car...and he was out there when Connor showed up and for 47 minutes til the explosion...except Connor didn't run out from the back of the house til 10:14pm...another half hour.

&amp;nbsp;

It's easy to say it's just artistic license but taking Checkov's gun into consideration they pause ever so briefly on these specific times: 10:14 - Dominic/Connor running away from the scene, 9:47pm explosion, Laurel showing up at some point, Connor showing up just in front of 9pm. Nate &amp; Wes talking at 8:22. But in the 2pm hour is when Annalise started telling them to meet at her house. We know Wes called Dominic/Sandrine as Christophe saying they're all about to be in a world of shit. 

&amp;nbsp;

The wrench in this consideration is this screen grab shows 10:12pm on Laurel's phone when she's arriving at Annalise's house.

https://s17.postimg.org/gke4q5lsv/Screen_Shot_03-11-18_at_01.48_AM.png


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFoWjisHmI

&amp;nbsp;

We know Bonnie had Frank tail Wes and sent him to Annalise's house while she checked his apartment. Wes leaves Frank's car while it's light out. Wes ditches Frank and gets in the taxi and it's dark out. Connor was having his tittybaby fling but he got the message hours before the fire. Laurel shows up at 10:12pm, according to her phone and is texting Wes saying Annalise wants them to meet there. 

&amp;nbsp;

Why'd she wait so late to send him a message? What was she calling about while he's in the cab?

**Oliver**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOh8KyW4_pQ

According to Oliver, however, Connor checked his voice mail and left the fling's house hours before the fire...and he went to Annalise's house...so we've got a second ""hours"" time frame going on because when he later tells the story, he implies it was a few minutes....came in, sees the ruckus, goes to basement, finds Wes, attempts to revive him, something cracks, smells gas, bolts and the explosion happens, but he just manages to run out in time. Except according to the very specific time frame Connor isn't running out until 10:14, half an hour after the explosion.

**Dominic**

&amp;nbsp;

Now at 10:14, as Connor flees the scene, the explosion has happened but Laurel is still inside. She saw ""him"" but he never saw her. According to her. He makes a call to someone and calmly says there's a problem and things got a little messy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Does this make any sense? If he is hired to kill Wes, why not just kill him? What actually happened was Dominic injected Wes with something and suffocated him til he passed out...so why the fuck did he take the body to the basement and mess with the gas line, and then go sit outside in the car through Connor showing up and running away and then call somebody to say it got messy? What got messy exactly? 


&amp;nbsp;

The only other people who were there were Wes, Nate, Connor and Laurel. Nate left. Connor leaves after the explosion. Laurel doesn't leave at all. Dom won't have any idea what's going on when Connor arrived because he's already outside in the car. We see the scene again in another version - this one

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnD01fccER0


&amp;nbsp;

and we know Dominic is talking to Jorge but we do not get any confirmation that it's Wes specifically being referred to. As we see in the above clip. Laurel's about to go off that guy who is supposedly Wes' real father and suddenly Dominic steps out of the shadows and intercepts her so that guy could leave. 
This is a huge clue that Dominic is not after Wes

&amp;nbsp;

Think about the alliances now. Dominic is tied to Laurel's mother. Christophe also called her to say there was a problem and they might all be in trouble. Could it be that Laurel had already been aware, thanks to Dominic spying for her, that Wes met with her mother and about that interaction, found out something that sent her off the deep end and she enlisted Dominic to kill Wes. 

&amp;nbsp;


Annalise sent Laurel to visit her father to get his help finding out where Frank disappeared to. Jorge knew that was the reason she showed up and then tried to persuade her to sign some papers in exchange for him telling her where Frank was. How would Jorge know this is why Laurel was showing up to ask for help on? Why would Annalise send her to ask Jorge?

83msip,1,2018-03-11,I am going crazy over a work dispute,dudewithajolly,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/83msip/i_am_going_crazy_over_a_work_dispute/,"So I want to get this off my chest and hopefully someone here can help me out a bit. I have been in contact with several people about these issues, my mother, two of the teachers responsible for my internship and several of my friends and nothing has made me able to tackle them.


I'm just going to lay it all out as what has set me off were several episodes last week and has made me anxious and extremely nervous to go to work tomorrow. I just feel like hell.


I am a teaching intern at a public school and this internship has been extremely hard on me. We are six students at a school in two groups of three and we're supposed to take care of the English lessons for a class of 14 year olds that sometimes can be quite a mouthful.


I'm in a team with ""John"" and ""Mary"". 


On Monday Mary was supposed to teach a 90 minute morning lesson for these kids and I was not doing too god. I hadn't slept more than 4 hours and I didn't manage to get breakfast, so I was already not in my best shape. Mary and John has a different approach to these students than me, as they will reprimand and yell at them in a much harsher fashion than I would, add to that, Mary is scary to me in general. She is a tiny 24 yo, who talks about teachers, students and John behind their backs. She's is constantly complaining and being shrill. So yes, as you might have guessed, she's the one making things hard for me.


Add to that, this lesson their usual teacher wasn't there, so we had a substitute instead, meaning we are four teachers during this lesson.


Mary starts the lesson out by telling the kids to converse in English about their favorite movie. Two of the boys aren't willing to participate, despite my trying to motivate them. I drop the subject, since I don't believe this is a battle worth fighting. Mary decides to start arguing with the students and ends up making them do grammar and again starts a conflict with them when the other kids are reading for a new activity. Mary yells at them for not participating, which confuses even me. As we're four teachers (three interns and the substitute) in the room, I feel the atmosphere as very tense and I don't really feel like I can help in any way. I want to make light of the situation and keep establishing a good rapport with the students, as we'd agreed beforehand but can’t do this without undermining Mary’s attempts at disciplining, I can't really tell Mary that I think she's overreacting in the middle of a lesson either and I hate this approach of yelling at the students myself, meaning I won’t be joining in the abuse, so I decide to step outside to check on some students out there. They're reading. Acknowledging that I'm kind of stuck because I can't disturb the students and I can't see myself as a positive force in the classroom, I stay outside.


Mary ends the lesson by reprimanding the students once more and I feel sick to my stomach at the end, because of how unmanageable the situation became. Then John and I spend over an hour trying to calm Mary down, me trying to be constructive about it, and John mostly agreeing with her about how terrible the students are and now right she is to be offended. During this I completely lose all motivation to stay positive, because I realize I have to spend my energy keeping Mary happy and agreeing with the two or risk the whole team falling apart, since I just can't take more of that negativity.


The next few days I spend in agony, because I know that at any point I'm with Mary, I will have to listen to her negativity and I don't feel like going to work. Also, we have a meeting with the regular teacher scheduled on Wednesday. I really don't want to go to this meeting, as every meeting so far, has been John and Mary complaining about the students. 


At the meeting, Mary is already there talking with the teacher. My thought is “oh no, are they talking about me? Is she now bent on ruining my reputation as well? No calm down”.


Mary starts out by saying that she feels like John and I abandoned her during the lesson and she is especially angry that I left the classroom. I am mortified by this, since not only is she attacking me, or reprimanding me, really, while the teacher and John are there, she is also disrespecting me immensely.


How do I handle this situation? I can't remember exactly what happened, I was experiencing so much inner turmoil. But I believe I explained that I thought there were too many teachers in the classroom and I couldn't see myself helping out. She continues the tirade, so I respond annoyed that I don't think it's okay for her to blame the failure of the lesson on me. We make agreements about teaching the next weeks without the issues being resolved.


I have the lesson on Friday and I take on Monday as well, as to not stress Mary out further, but we don't manage to make a complete plan and at this point I'm scared to be in the classroom with Mary. Cue another day in complete agony.


I go straight to bed when I come home, I just can't handle anymore. In the evening I write an e-mail to our teacher at the college, who is responsible for the internship detailing my problems. She writes me the next day about how to proceed. I also write a mail to the teacher at the school about not wanting to teach the next morning due to issues in the group and not feeling like continuing things. She is understanding and kindly offers to tell John and Mary that she will teach on Friday, which I agree to. I also tell her that I want to do the exam alone, even though we had planned to go together, again, I am scared of working with Mary. The teacher relays this information as well.


I don't talk to any of the two before Friday, when I meet Mary on the bus, we exchange a few words about her new cellphone, but she doesn't seem talkative and I imagine she is angry with me. So that is it. On our way to the school I am walking in front and we talk a bit about the snow. I am painfully aware that I might offend her, by not slowing down to walk beside her, but I guess if she's angry with me, it doesn't make sense and isn't it normal for some people to work together, but not be happy about each other's company?


At the school we hardly speak, we're both focused on our cellphones until the meeting with the teacher, where I'm supposed to explain what's going on. I stick to what I've been counseled on by the teacher at the college. ""I feel that our way of handling the planning and execution of a lesson is too different and I'd prefer that you two observe when I teach and I do the same during your lessons, also I would rather do the exam project on my own"", this is what it's meant to sound like, but of course I'm stammering and stuttering, not making much sense probably. I feel horribly sensitive.


Now Mary makes my worst fears come true, she openly confronts me about being ""mad at her"", ""not wanting to talk to her today"", ""making it personal"". I respond that I'm not willing to talk about it under these circumstances that this is something that should be discussed in private. At this point I'm feverishly looking at the teacher for help and I feel like I'm drowning and completely empty inside. The teacher tries to negotiate some sort of agreement and I just try to de-escalate the situation. The teacher ends up saying that ""she thinks this is very hard"", ""she's no psychologist"" and ""seems like Mary and I should have a chat"", she even points out that my body-language communicates that I would rather not talk.


What makes this such a humiliating experience, is the fact that I have to illicit help from the teacher. I don't feel like ever going back there and yet I have to teach tomorrow. I just want to run away and never show up again. I almost started crying. Worst of all, they all saw me humiliated and helpless and it makes me want to kill myself for being so worthless.


I talked to Mary after the meeting and she was still angry about all of the things listed, which we talked out, but she made it seem like I had fucked up, obviously this is what it was about. I asked whether she understood that I didn't like being confronted with a personal confrontation in public and I don't think she acknowledged it. She did however say that ""I could always come to her with my issues"", ""she wanted me to have a good internship but was adamant that she should too"" and that she wanted to continue to cooperate in the future.


Yet I just don't think I can handle this last week and I feel like never showing up at school again. I can't handle the thought of being near her, having to keep up appearances and being friendly. I never want to talk with her again and I can't see myself looking anyone of the three in the eye.


What if she does something similar again? What if she brings it up? What if one of the guys in the other group points it out during lunch?


I feel like entirely removing myself from this situation and never looking back. 


I am not a strong person right now, I know that. I am very anxious and very neurotic. I spend half the time being scared that previous fuck-ups will ruin my life and make people ostracize me. I have low self-confidence, I am sometimes paranoid. I was somewhat convinced Mary would want to sabotage me even before the internship, because I had drunkenly committed a horrible faux par during out first meeting, which I had apologized for. But since working with Mary my fear was mounting as she was describing the offence she took by so many of her acquaintances: her roommate, who was always on her lips because she had committed yet another horrible blunder and gotten on Mary’s bad side without really doing much; John, who admittedly is a bit eccentric, for being a bit too forward or confident in his opinions; the students at the school and the teachers. I expected her eventual revenge to be pre-meditated, but I don’t think it was, I don’t think she really means any harm, but I am terrified regardless.

83n128,6,2018-03-11,I had a horrible week,dudewithajolly,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/83n128/i_had_a_horrible_week/,"So I want to get this off my chest and hopefully someone here can help me out a bit. I have been in contact with several people about these issues, my mother, two of the teachers responsible for my internship and several of my friends and nothing has made me able to tackle them.


I'm just going to lay it all out as what has set me off were several episodes last week and has made me anxious and extremely nervous to go to work tomorrow. I just feel like hell.


I am a teaching intern at a public school and this internship has been extremely hard on me. We are six students at a school in two groups of three and we're supposed to take care of the English lessons for a class of 14 year olds that sometimes can be quite a mouthful.


I'm in a team with ""John"" and ""Mary"". 


On Monday Mary was supposed to teach a 90 minute morning lesson for these kids and I was not doing too god. I hadn't slept more than 4 hours and I didn't manage to get breakfast, so I was already not in my best shape. Mary and John has a different approach to these students than me, as they will reprimand and yell at them in a much harsher fashion than I would, add to that, Mary is scary to me in general. She is a tiny 24 yo, who talks about teachers, students and John behind their backs. She's is constantly complaining and being shrill. So yes, as you might have guessed, she's the one making things hard for me.


Add to that, this lesson their usual teacher wasn't there, so we had a substitute instead, meaning we are four teachers during this lesson.


Mary starts the lesson out by telling the kids to converse in English about their favorite movie. Two of the boys aren't willing to participate, despite my trying to motivate them. I drop the subject, since I don't believe this is a battle worth fighting. Mary decides to start arguing with the students and ends up making them do grammar and again starts a conflict with them when the other kids are reading for a new activity. Mary yells at them for not participating, which confuses even me. As we're four teachers (three interns and the substitute) in the room, I feel the atmosphere as very tense and I don't really feel like I can help in any way. I want to make light of the situation and keep establishing a good rapport with the students, as we'd agreed beforehand but can’t do this without undermining Mary’s attempts at disciplining, I can't really tell Mary that I think she's overreacting in the middle of a lesson either and I hate this approach of yelling at the students myself, meaning I won’t be joining in the abuse, so I decide to step outside to check on some students out there. They're reading. Acknowledging that I'm kind of stuck because I can't disturb the students and I can't see myself as a positive force in the classroom, I stay outside.


Mary ends the lesson by reprimanding the students once more and I feel sick to my stomach at the end, because of how unmanageable the situation became. Then John and I spend over an hour trying to calm Mary down, me trying to be constructive about it, and John mostly agreeing with her about how terrible the students are and now right she is to be offended. During this I completely lose all motivation to stay positive, because I realize I have to spend my energy keeping Mary happy and agreeing with the two or risk the whole team falling apart, since I just can't take more of that negativity.


The next few days I spend in agony, because I know that at any point I'm with Mary, I will have to listen to her negativity and I don't feel like going to work. Also, we have a meeting with the regular teacher scheduled on Wednesday. I really don't want to go to this meeting, as every meeting so far, has been John and Mary complaining about the students. 


At the meeting, Mary is already there talking with the teacher. My thought is “oh no, are they talking about me? Is she now bent on ruining my reputation as well? No calm down”.


Mary starts out by saying that she feels like John and I abandoned her during the lesson and she is especially angry that I left the classroom. I am mortified by this, since not only is she attacking me, or reprimanding me, really, while the teacher and John are there, she is also disrespecting me immensely.


How do I handle this situation? I can't remember exactly what happened, I was experiencing so much inner turmoil. But I believe I explained that I thought there were too many teachers in the classroom and I couldn't see myself helping out. She continues the tirade, so I respond annoyed that I don't think it's okay for her to blame the failure of the lesson on me. We make agreements about teaching the next weeks without the issues being resolved.


I have the lesson on Friday and I take on Monday as well, as to not stress Mary out further, but we don't manage to make a complete plan and at this point I'm scared to be in the classroom with Mary. Cue another day in complete agony.


I go straight to bed when I come home, I just can't handle anymore. In the evening I write an e-mail to our teacher at the college, who is responsible for the internship detailing my problems. She writes me the next day about how to proceed. I also write a mail to the teacher at the school about not wanting to teach the next morning due to issues in the group and not feeling like continuing things. She is understanding and kindly offers to tell John and Mary that she will teach on Friday, which I agree to. I also tell her that I want to do the exam alone, even though we had planned to go together, again, I am scared of working with Mary. The teacher relays this information as well.


I don't talk to any of the two before Friday, when I meet Mary on the bus, we exchange a few words about her new cellphone, but she doesn't seem talkative and I imagine she is angry with me. So that is it. On our way to the school I am walking in front and we talk a bit about the snow. I am painfully aware that I might offend her, by not slowing down to walk beside her, but I guess if she's angry with me, it doesn't make sense and isn't it normal for some people to work together, but not be happy about each other's company?


At the school we hardly speak, we're both focused on our cellphones until the meeting with the teacher, where I'm supposed to explain what's going on. I stick to what I've been counseled on by the teacher at the college. ""I feel that our way of handling the planning and execution of a lesson is too different and I'd prefer that you two observe when I teach and I do the same during your lessons, also I would rather do the exam project on my own"", this is what it's meant to sound like, but of course I'm stammering and stuttering, not making much sense probably. I feel horribly sensitive.


Now Mary makes my worst fears come true, she openly confronts me about being ""mad at her"", ""not wanting to talk to her today"", ""making it personal"". I respond that I'm not willing to talk about it under these circumstances that this is something that should be discussed in private. At this point I'm feverishly looking at the teacher for help and I feel like I'm drowning and completely empty inside. The teacher tries to negotiate some sort of agreement and I just try to de-escalate the situation. The teacher ends up saying that ""she thinks this is very hard"", ""she's no psychologist"" and ""seems like Mary and I should have a chat"", she even points out that my body-language communicates that I would rather not talk.


What makes this such a humiliating experience, is the fact that I have to illicit help from the teacher. I don't feel like ever going back there and yet I have to teach tomorrow. I just want to run away and never show up again. I almost started crying. Worst of all, they all saw me humiliated and helpless and it makes me want to kill myself for being so worthless.


I talked to Mary after the meeting and she was still angry about all of the things listed, which we talked out, but she made it seem like I had fucked up, obviously this is what it was about. I asked whether she understood that I didn't like being confronted with a personal confrontation in public and I don't think she acknowledged it. She did however say that ""I could always come to her with my issues"", ""she wanted me to have a good internship but was adamant that she should too"" and that she wanted to continue to cooperate in the future.


Yet I just don't think I can handle this last week and I feel like never showing up at school again. I can't handle the thought of being near her, having to keep up appearances and being friendly. I never want to talk with her again and I can't see myself looking anyone of the three in the eye.


What if she does something similar again? What if she brings it up? What if one of the guys in the other group points it out during lunch?


I feel like entirely removing myself from this situation and never looking back. 


I am not a strong person right now, I know that. I am very anxious and very neurotic. I spend half the time being scared that previous fuck-ups will ruin my life and make people ostracize me. I have low self-confidence, I am sometimes paranoid. I was somewhat convinced Mary would want to sabotage me even before the internship, because I had drunkenly committed a horrible faux par during out first meeting, which I had apologized for. But since working with Mary my fear was mounting as she was describing the offence she took by so many of her acquaintances: her roommate, who was always on her lips because she had committed yet another horrible blunder and gotten on Mary’s bad side without really doing much; John, who admittedly is a bit eccentric, for being a bit too forward or confident in his opinions; the students at the school and the teachers. I expected her eventual revenge to be pre-meditated, but I don’t think it was, I don’t think she really means any harm, but I am terrified regardless."
83n4ms,122,2018-03-11,My best friend [21/F] is furious at me for withholding information from her [21/F] even though this is what she asked me to do,dnfl111,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/83n4ms/my_best_friend_21f_is_furious_at_me_for/,"Hello everyone! Myself and everyone in this story are seniors at a pretty intense university which is known for its huge premed population (I'm not premed, but another STEM student). My best friend Sarah is a  premed student but had struggled quite a bit with her grades her sophomore/junior year so she's taking another year to recover her grades and all that. Overall, she's super stressed out because as you guys know, getting into med school even with a perfect GPA and a bunch of extracurriculars is very difficult, and her resume is (objectively) not perfect, though I personally do think she brings a lot of unique things to the table. Our school environment is also kind of toxic and competitive so everyone is on edge a lot. 

Freshman/sophomore year, Sarah and I were best friends with a guy named Jason. We were like an inseparable trio but he got a girlfriend sophomore year who didn't like us so we slowly drifted apart. I'm not a burn bridges kind of person so I still keep in contact with Jason but Sarah had a few arguments with Jason after this incident so she doesn't want anything to do with him anymore (nothing serious actually happened, she's just definitely a burn bridges person). 

Jason isn't the perfect person - he can be kind of TOO honest at times and it appears that his girlfriend still has the final say in things. However, he is a remarkable student who has gotten 4.0's all semester (very hard to do at our school), perfect score on the MCAT (entrance exam to med school, also nearly impossible) as well as a variety of amazing accomplishments. 

Last semester, he told me he got a perfect score on the MCAT (because I asked, not to brag) and I was so impressed I told Sarah. I thought that she'd be happy for him because I mean, regardless of past arguments, this is an absolutely amazing accomplishment! She ended up getting so mad at me for telling her and ruining her day that she canceled concert plans we had that weekend and gave me the silent treatment. She started sh*t talking Jason and bringing back up all the stupid shit he did freshman year (not like we didn't do stupid, harmless things) and just being kinda cruel about it. I could tell this was mostly just coming from stress for her own med school situation so I just let it go. Later, she apologized for blowing up at me but she just said she doesn't wanna hear about Jason anymore because it's just too much. So I promised I wouldn't talk about it anymore.

Last weekend, I found out Jason actually got into Harvard Med School (I'm sure you guys know how a huge accomplishment this is). I was so happy for him and told all our mutual friends, who were all proud and happy for him too, even if they didn't like him very much or just dind't know him. I remembered the absolute meltdown Sarah had before so I just didn't say anything to her especially since she has two exams next week. I didn't plan on our mutual friend coming over last night and telling Sarah about Jason' good news. OUr mutual friend also let it slip that I was the one who knew first. Oh my god. After our mutual friend left, Sarah couldn't even look at me and I asked her if she was okay and she just did one-word answers. She was absolutely livid, asking me why I didn't tell her about this. I brought up the MCAT incident and she wasn't even listening, just saying how embarrassing it is that everyone knew about Jason except for her. She ended our hang out sesh and told me to leave because she needs to go study and then wouldn't answer my texts. Except we live together. She has been so cruel to me since, cancelling all our plans together. She's telling me she's going to fail her exams because I betrayed her like this. 

I'm so confused. I tried to do the best for her and honestly, I don't get her attitude at all. I'm in a competitive STEM field and have definitely felt pangs of jealousy when someone got the internship I didn't, but my feeling of happiness for them overwhelms any jealousy and I congratulate them.. If anything, other people's success positively motivates me to work hard as well??

What should I do? Navigating girl stuff (even as a girl) is quite hard.

Thanks!

**tl;dr: BFF is a super stressed out premed senior who had a breakdown because our former friend did super well on his MCATs. She told me not to tell her anything else about his accomplishments. I withheld info about him getting into the best med school in the country and she blew up at me again, even though I did what she asked me to.**"

i wanted to thank everyone from that post, 
u/KeronCyst
u/KungFuDabu
and u/throwawayguy11115
even though they commented just once and we didnt really talk, i wanted to let you know that you guys helped a lot &lt;3

so here's the update
I began speaking to Allie again, she ignored me for a short while but on New Years, we began texting again. So after that she began to grow on me and I began to 'feel' things. I wanted to get closer to her but didn't know how. We only knew each other through our history class and through theatre club. I mostly sat by myself during lunch at a tree and just listen to music. One day she asked me about what I did there at the tree.
""so antho, why do you sit there all lunch?""
""I have no one to talk to""
""why not sit with me?""
so at that point I was hesitant. I never been invited to be with others so I didn't know what to do. I accepted it and soon we began sitting together, eating lunch and watching cartoon network shows. I thought I liked her and she liked me. Then came February, I was ready to tell her, I wanted to tell her so bad. I began asking her stuff about her and from there I bought her chocolates, sunflowers and made her a card saying what needed to be said a while ago. It was a B-Day so we didn't have history class together and she had to leave off campus for her internship program. So I brought it all up to her morning class and left it there for her. The day goes on and comes lunchtime and I go and sit at our usual spot with her friends that aren't in the internship program and here she comes. She came over and was really really happy (idk if its just her natural personality tho, shes usually positive and upgoing) and she came over 
""hey antho, that was really cute thank you""
and she hugged me.
I don't think I ever touched her before so I just embraced it for the short time it lasted. So I'm happy and we start hanging out and start text each other more. And then she joined the tracm team in the middle of the month. She had to join track because her mom was making her join it. Now things shifted. She stopped texting me and responing to my stories. She still was at lunch but never like talked about anyone to me. I didn't think about it at the time and I thought something happened with her parents and she couldn't talk about it. So around the 20th the school announced the Junior trip to Hollywood Studios, So excited we began talking about it and I settled to go, I was ready to be with her and her friends. The trip was in the beginning of March and we were gonna meet up at the school at 4:00 A.M. in the morning. I'm there sitting on a bench and there she comes over and sits next to me.
""yo whats up allie?""
""hi""
""you got a partner for the trip? I heard you didnt have one so wanna be mine?""
""nah, I got a parnter but you can hang out with us""
Ok, weird the day before she said she didn't have a partner. 
So we are waiting and she goes off to find her partner. So I'm there by myself just listening to music and we get called to board the bus. I sat in a seat and from where I sat Allie sat behind me and here comes her partner, Kyle. (Kyle is a basketball player at our school notorious for being a trashy person, cheated on his last girlfriend) Kyle comes over and sits to Allie and they began cuddling. My reaction was that of shock, anger, and sadness. the whole ride to Hollywood Studios I cried silently while hearing them hugging and kissing and shit. One of her friends saw me and began texting me
""whats wrong?""
""Im upset""
""Y""
""Did you know about this?""
""yea but he's toxic""
Was done, no one told me shit and everyone else was telling me she was leading me on. So we are 2 hours into our drive and we stop at one of those like road stops and I go and sit by myself and there she comes trotting along like the she was in a field of flowers or some shit. and goes up and asks me 
""whats wrong?""
I couldnt even look into her eyes, I couldn't look at her 
""nothing""
""wanna come sit with me?"" 
""no im good""
and so defeated she went and sat with her friends
We make it to Hollywood Studios and I merge into another group with someone else from my theatre club. I saw her a lot through the day and did my absolute best to avoid her at all costs, even walking out of conversations when she came up to talk to someone behind or next to us. So the trip passes and then the next day, I get a notification that she's typing to me over snap, I wait a hour to see if I got a message or not and nothing, so I took the offensive 
""hey you were typing, whats up""
I waited like around 2 mintunes but it felt even longer than that and then
""can I talk to you?"" 
god I fucking knew it
""what about?""
""are you anger at me?""
""yes""
""what about?""
""oh you dont know?""
""yea i do know but i want to hear it from you""
I went and told her everything
I told her, I like her straight up, I told her that she was the first ever person that I trusted fully, I told her that what bothered more the most was that you didn't tell me anything, and then she says
""I didn't tell you anything not because I didn't trust you, it has nothing to do with trust, I'm sorry if I hurt you but I thought you would be happy for me, good night""
it hurt me, when I read that, it hit me harder than any sledgehammer and cutted me deeper than any knife could. However, even with that I didnt want to leave it from a low blow. So I told her.
""Hey I'm happy for you but you have no idea how that makes me feel seeing y'all like that, I'm fine being your friend and forgive you. Sorry for acting like a brat""
""its okay, i understand why you were upset.""
and fron there we talked about the trip and I thought everything was fine between us and that on tuesday we would talk about it and maybe clear some more stuff up. 
Come monday, its a B-Day so I didnt see her that whole day. Come tuesday and she saw me and said hi and didn't talk to me. Weird, usually she would ask about something but she just left me off. Then we were supposed to get into groups of two and we sat next to each other so I turn and she got up and went with her other friends and left me alone. Super weird. She's ignoring me. Sit at our spot, she comes by greets one of her friends and ask something about me and leaves. The whole week she only said ""hi, antho"" and ""good bye, antho"" like nothing was between us and there was no problems. So why ignore me? I never got that answer. So comes to last night, I made a sarahah for the fuck of it and 30 mintunes later she made one too. Weird.
I swiped up and left ""💚 u"" 
and she replied on her story ""💚 u too"" and fron there I changed my name to 💚 so she would know it was me and I sent her a message and it was delivered, hours pass and it was never opened. The next day passes to today and I couldnt find her on my friends list. I fucked up and went too far. I don't know what to do and I still have really have strong feelings for her. I know it in my bones that Kyle is going to break her heart and leave her a broken person. She changed a lot and I'm not the only one to notice it. I don't want her to hate me.

P.S. I think something is bothering her l, during history class she was like laying on her desk and then punched the desk and began kicking her feet together. idk whats going on and I know she isnt gonna tell me 

TLDR, girl i liked betrayed me we talked about, she ignores me now, kinda."
83o6te,12,2018-03-11,How the fuck do you communicate openly with people as a survivor of emotional abuse?,schwulerbro,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/83o6te/how_the_fuck_do_you_communicate_openly_with/,"TL;DR: I need to have a conversation with my roommate about how he made me feel, and I’m terrified. What do I do? (specific questions are in the second last paragraph)

A bit of backstory: I’m abroad in Europe for an internship and have a roommate who is local. Both males, he is late 20’s and I’m early 20’s. I’ve been living here for about 6 months and will be returning home in 2. 

Having a Nmom and Edad, I obviously have emotional issues. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and a currently undiagnosed trauma disorder. 

My mental health has been up and down while I’ve been here, but I was in therapy at the beginning of this year and after some EMDR therapy was feeling amazing. I felt that I was finally having a good relationship with him and that we were getting along well. I was meditating and felt that I had a good handle on my emotional state.

Well, then he invited me to come with him to a local celebration and we had to dress up. I don’t like dressing up and I told him that, but he brought it up a couple of times, and so I was feeling really good that he seemed to genuinely want me to come (I struggle with feeling like a burden on people, people only interact/hang out with me out of moral obligation or pity, that people don't want me around, etc.). So I did my best to get my shit together to be able to go, but the depression really kicked into high gear a few days before we were supposed to go. 

I texted him and told him that I was super depressed and wouldn't be able to go. I felt really bad and was scared he would be mad at me, but thankfully he was really understanding and supportive. He offered his support and told me to tell him if he could support me in any way. 

I replied and opened up a bit about how I was feeling (what I mentioned above), that I feel guilty about my behavior, I liked hanging out with him, and that I had to be my own emotional support since I was young, and so I feel like no one gives a damn. 

Next day he texted me back (he went out that night) and said that he was super hungover and so would respond to my message later. Unfortunately he didn't.

A few days later I found some articles about my condition, and how to support someone with it. I sent them his way and he said he would read them. He also said he wasn't much in the mood to be open and talk at the moment because he had some minor things to clear up with himself and that work was a lot for him at the moment. I said no problem and that he should take care of himself. 

Well, it's been a month now and he hasn't brought it up. After a couple weeks it really triggered my abandonment issues (of course I recognize for someone who's neurotypical it can be overwhelming to have to deal with someone else's mental illness), and so I feel sub-consciously that he's dangerous and I can't trust him. Whenever I'm around him I feel so vulnerable and scared that I can't be in the same room as him. I've been isolating myself to cope and so have been declining opportunities to hang out with him and his friends cause I'm just so emotionally unstable, afraid, and feeling really, deeply hurt. I feel that maybe opening up was a mistake cause now I've upset the ""power-balance"" in the relationship since I took down my defense momentarily and now he knows that I'm really fucked up. I recognize my behavior is toxic as fuck and is probably only making things worse, but that's how I cope. I'm looking forward to getting into trauma therapy when I'm back home. 

I’ve observed that learning a foreign language (and especially being in the foreign country) is very infantilizing, and so I feel that maybe I’ve sub-consciously parentified him since he’s been my connection to the environment around me and helping me with basic things due to the language barrier. 

So I don’t know what to do, or how to bring it up. Did I come on too strong with it? The problem is that I’m gay and I really find him attractive, and so interacting with him is stressful anyway because I’m super self-conscious about “letting it be known” in anyway in my behaviour, what I say, etc. Even though he knows I’m gay and it’s not a problem (he’s even watched some Drag Race on TV with me). I’m just so terrified of rejection and would hate to, even inadvertently, make it known and be given the “silly f** I’m straight” talk. 

I crave emotional intimacy and yet it also terrifies me and makes me feel small and pathetic (“You should be able to take care of yourself”), or that it would be used against me. Due to my childhood, I'm terrified of having love/support taken away from me, and so I felt that he did that in a way (not intentionally of course). I also don’t know what’s appropriate to ask for and receive due to toxic masculinity discouraging this at all, so I was taking the approach of “he’s your roommate, not your friend”.

So how do I say “Hey can you please pretend to care about me” in a productive way? I feel like telling him that he “made a mistake” or did something wrong just opens me up to being attacked and being accused of being worse, and so having conversations like this is so terrifying that I would rather die, honestly. 

So, any tips on how to confront people and express your dissatisfaction, hurt feelings, etc.? Things I should and shouldn’t say, tips on staying calm (I’m probably going to do this over text anyway, even thought that’s kinda pathetic I know) and not being overly emotional. What is too much to ask of him? How do I prepare myself if he does say “well you’ve been doing this and that’s really shitty” or something like that? How do I not overwhelm him with my toxic feelings and thoughts? How much should I share, how much is too much or too little?

Any perspectives, advice, tips, etc that can be given about this situation and/or in general would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

83oaon,2,2018-03-11,(PT) I desperately need to leave my parents' house,Engraze,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/83oaon/pt_i_desperately_need_to_leave_my_parents_house/,"So I'm a 19 year old (20 this year) kid who lives in Portugal, with his parents. I am still studying and will graduate highschool this year (I know it's late but I've made some bad decisions in the past). Unfortunately I have very controlling parents and I am not free to do anything while living under their roof - they have specifically told me this. I am only allowed to get up in the morning, go to my internship which is far away from home (2.5h of train every day), come back home and sleep. No going out on the weekends anymore either.

This lifestyle is extremely depressing. We don't even have a good relationship - they're the kind of parents that would rather be respected than loved.  
I feel like I can't handle many years of this so I decided I have to do everything I can to move out of here as soon as possible. I came to you for help.

I have a debit card which they have access to, I have a paid for driver's license (no car) and a paid for apartment room in my name. I have no savings right now, but I understand I must start saving. It's just that what I earn is so little  that I never felt like I could sacrifice a % of it.

As I said, I am still studying but a part of the way my school works is they put us in internships and pay us food and transport for it. So that means I receive 40€ per month when taking classes and about 120€ per month during internships.

I was thinking about maybe renting out the place I have in my name, but even then that's not a lot of money that would come in my way. The house is located in a poor region outside of the capital and I'd charge tops 30€ per night (and give 23% back because laws).





Another option I have is going to work at a factory on the weekends. Friday from 00:00 to 12:00 and Saturday from 00:00 to 12:00. I'd receive 470€ per month. I'm not sure if I can handle all that workload but if it's the best option I'll take it.

I might be trying to rush this too hard but living in this house is destroying my mental health and I think it's best for me to start living my own life. Please give me some advice."
83oiaz,22,2018-03-11,Theory to Shoot Down,VincentFistingmuch,EARONS,https://www.reddit.com/r/EARONS/comments/83oiaz/theory_to_shoot_down/,"The timelapse map posted the other day is pretty fascinating, and watching it a couple times, it caused me to have a thought.

The first three attacks were roughly three months apart in June, July and August of 1976, and escalated beginning in September, with an additional 19 attacks from September 1976 through June 1977. All of these attacks occurred in the suburbs around Sacramento, with the first 22 occurring west and northwest of town, and only the 23rd breaking with routine and occurring in the Florin area south west of downtown. And then a summer long break.

In September, the 24th attack occurs some 47 miles away in what is now the Lincoln Village neighborhood north of Stockton. 

So what happened here? Why the break, and then why the 24th attack happening so far away before returning to his old stomping grounds for the next six attacks? 

A theory.

EARONS grew up in the Fresno area where he graduated from high school in spring of 1975. During his final high school years, he ransacked homes in Visalia as he attended Fresno High School. He knew Brian Maggiore, who graduated a year ahead of him in 1974. He is the son of a divorcee whose ex-husband relocated to Sacramento for work. EARONS is not a great student, often distracted, and does not have the grades for a four-year college. It is decided that he will relocate after high school graduation to Sacramento where his father lives, and where he can enroll in a technical school. EARONS aspires to be an architect.

As an 18-19 year old, EARONS attended American River College during the 1975-1976 and 1976-1977 school years (a technical/community college in Sacramento), building up enough credits to transfer to a four-year college. As noted on Wikipedia, ""it is the choice of many students in the greater Sacramento area, serving as a launching point for later transfer to competitive four-year universities such as the University of California, Davis and California State University, Sacramento. It transfers more students to UC Davis and CSU Sacramento than any other community college.""

During his initial years in Sacramento, he vows to leave the prowling behind and buckle down, but trips home to Fresno bring out his prowling side and he commits a handful of B&amp;Es in October, November and December of 1975. He returns to Sacramento for his second semester in early 1976 and lays low and/or prowls to learn his way around. Following exams, he gives in to the urge and commits his first crime in his new community (June 1976). He stays in Sacramento with his father over the summer and commits a few more. And then the floodgates open. 

At the end of the 1976-1977 school year, he transfers to San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton, CA where he studies Architecture in the School of Applied Science, Business &amp; Technology. He commits his first crime there in September of 1977. He would go on during his two years in Stockton to branch out southeast to Modesto and west to areas in the suburbs of San Fransisco, always maintaining Stockton as a base and rarely committing crimes there. During his final year of college 1978-1979, an internship has him traveling to the Walnut Creek area. He graduates with a degree in architecture in June 1979. He ""celebrates"" with his final attacks in Danville and Walnut Creek before relocating to Santa Barbara County for a job. There he continues as ONS.

Notes:

--- Divorced parents can tie Visalia and Sacramento, with the father as the steward during his community college years. The assumption here is that his father would have paid less attention to him as he was out at all hours.

--- I am most intrigued by the first attack in Stockton (#24), which to me suggests a shift in focus. Though he returns to Sacramento for a time, he is soon branching out even further.

--- The narrative of this theory tries to tie together pieces of evidence, suggesting architecture/city planning, the relationship to the Maggiores, etc. But in general, I'm more suggesting a pattern of relocation related to school.

--- Some think that he wouldn't have risked attacking in areas where he lived, but I don't ascribe to it. I think he was compulsive and prowled where he knew his way around. I do think he might have spent his first school year in Sacramento (September 1975-May 1976) learning his way around. 

Okay, tear it apart and/or tell me it has been conjectured before."

83p191,20,2018-03-11,This subreddit opened up my eyes [day 2],mac1211,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/83p191/this_subreddit_opened_up_my_eyes_day_2/,"I've known about this subreddit for a few years now and have always respected anyone who tries to actively better their lives. Unfortunately for me, I never really opened up my eyes to what smoking trees has been doing to my life... **until now**

I'm 27 years old and have been smoking regularly with a few extended breaks since I was 16 years old. I managed to finish my college degree in Physics as an everyday smoker, even though it took a little bit longer than the standard 4 years.

My relationship with MaryJane started as just a crutch during high school, trying to help me get through the days that my father was a raging alcoholic and always fought with my mother. It gave me a good reason to sneak out of the house at night and go for a smoke walk. There were a few times I remember police being called to our house because their fighting was so out of control. I ended up finding a group of people with problems not much different from my own and started hanging out with them and smoking together. I'd sometimes go as far as cut days at school to go smoke with friends and goof off around the city.

Eventually, I went on to university and slowly but purposefully began to lose touch with my old group because I was the ""college boy,"" even though we still lived in the same town. They liked to take not so subtle jabs at me for going to college and being a ""sheep."" None of these people ended up going to college (some didn't even finish high school) and I guess they were jealous that I was trying to make something of my life while they wilted away, eventually moving on to harder drugs and pretty much losing their minds, some even lost their lives due to overdose. I ended up getting a job my freshman year of college and had my own regular income flow to spend on weed. That's when I basically became an every day smoker. 

Throughout what seemed to become a lifetime spent at university, I made new friends, ones that still smoked weed but seemed to have goals in life. Those friends introduced me to their other friends and it made me feel good to be part of a group again, part of a tribe that looked out for one another even though they partied extremely hard. It was at this time in my life that I felt the most social, meeting new people, having all night adventures, dancing the nights away at different clubs. Unfortunately, my grades started to slip at school and I had to get my work/fun balance in order.

I refocused a lot of my energy and time during my last 2 years at university on finishing my degree (even though I was smoking by myself more than ever) and that's when a lot of my antisocial tendencies started coming the surface. I stopped wanting to go out on weekends, I stopped talking to people, I stopped making plans, **I became content with sitting at home by myself getting stoned**

Shortly before graduating university, I got a full time job that had nothing to do with my degree (and one that I absolutely hated but was extremely good at, hell they even promoted me twice within the first 6 months working there) but I was still smoking before, during, and after work by myself. Towards the end of working that job, I did quit smoking the herb for a good six months to help better my chances at finding a better job. After a while not working, I was offered one in another city, although it was just a paid internship. I had a lot of money saved up from not smoking so I accepted it in the hopes of performing really well and staying on board full time because it really was my dream job opportunity. I decided to take a calculated risk, found a place to live, packed my car to the max and left everyone and everything behind me. I figured to myself, ""new town, new people, there's no way I could fuck this up!""

**Boy, was I wrong**

Within my first week there, I found a new connect for weed in that town and was back in my old ways in the snap of a finger. Long story short, the internship went really well, but they couldn't find a place for me to work full time. I didn't end up making any good friends out there so I had no choice but to move back to my toxic home environment. I felt like a failure, continued to smoke while hiding it from everyone around me, and that's when my good old friends depression and anxiety came back to visit.

There were some really bad days, days I wouldn't even want to get out of bed. For hours I'd sit there all by myself only to get up to smoke, eat junkfood, and use the bathroom. It felt like rock bottom. Eventually, I pulled myself out of that mindset (by spending an hour+ every day going for a walk) and had to take a step back and look at what I've been doing with my life. With a future that once felt so promising, I was failing to live up to my own expectations and potential. 

**That's when I stumbled back upon this subreddit.** I read through so many old posts during my final smoke session  and realized that I'm not the only one in this situation and that I have the ability to beat my inner demons, once and for all like many of you have done before me. I only have a few real friends that have been in my corner through all these years (and I'm so fortunate to have them in my life), but they don't live anywhere near me at the moment, so it almost feels like I'm going through this alone. It's nothing I haven't done in the past; sure the withdrawals suck a lot and it was absolute hell trying to fall asleep sober last night for the first time in over a year. Eventually, I fell asleep to start a new day, my second day without MaryJane. 

I don't know why I basically typed out my life story with weed but it felt pretty good to put it out there and this felt like the right place to do it, even if nobody reads this. I don't know how often I'm going to post through this sober journey of mine but I just wanted to say I'm thankful for this subreddit and everything this community does to help each other out!

* **What?** City Pier City Run
* **When?** March 3rd, 2018
* **How far?** 21.1 KM (Half Marathon)
* **Where?** The Hague, Netherlands
* **Website:** [http://www.nncpcloopdenhaag.nl/](http://www.nncpcloopdenhaag.nl/)

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | &lt;1h 35m | *No Spoilers* |
| B | Negative Split | *No* |
| C | Finish smiling | *Yes* |

### Intro
I'm a 23 yo male from the Netherlands. Five months ago I wrote a Race Report for [my first 10K race](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/74xo71/race_report_eindhoven_marathon_10k_event/). I was hoping to do more of them, since I love the community here. But I ended up only lurking. I did however race. I brought my 10K time down from 42:42 to 42:14, then 41:00 and finally 40:48 last month! I also ran a 15K in 1.04:04. The running virus has really got me now.

I moved to The Hague after the summer for an internship at one of the ministries. The Hague is the political capital of the Netherlands and honestly a beautiful city. I just had to run The Hague's biggest race: the City Pier City Run! The main event is a Half Marathon, where you run through the city for about 12KM then turn around and run back more along the coast (near the Pier) and then back into the city. City Pier City, you see? I've never ran a Half Marathon, although I did go over 21K in two seperate long runs the past two months. For my first HM I'm hoping for a sub 1.35:00 time with a negative split. Let's dive straight into it!

**Disclaimer:** The numbers don't add up! 5K splits are from the official website, while kilometer splits are from my Garmin watch. Trust the official website.

### Kilometers [0] to [5]
| Kilometer | Time |
|------|------|
| 1 | 4:24 |
| 2 | 4:19 |
| 3 | 4:20 |
| 4 | 4:20 |
| 5 | 4:26 |
| First 5K | 21:54 |

My biggest fear is starting too fast. I'm not that great at pacing myself, I tend to overestimate myself. My coach told me to leave at around a 4:30 pace and see from there. I happily waved to him around the 1KM point, but I wasn't quite following his advice.

At the start I was with several clubmates. Two of them were going for a sub 1.30:00 time, so I knew they were going to go out faster. One of them was like me, going for 1.35:00. We'll call him T. He has run the CPC several times and is a far more experienced runner. So I stayed close to him. The first 5K were pretty relaxed. We passed [the Peace Palace](http://www.vredesloopdenhaag.nl/media/384440/vredespaleis.jpg) and ran through [gorgeous Dutch streets](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laan_van_Meerdervoort#/media/File:Den_Haag_-_Laan_van_Meerdervoort_164.JPG). Some guy asks my pace around the 3rd KM. We've been going pretty steady 4:20s (bring on the Dutch stereotypes), and he wants to join T and me. We're quite the party now. The first 5K were steady, and I'm not sure why the 5th split is so slow, I don't recall it feeling particularly different.

### Kilometers [5] to [10]
| Kilometer | Time |
|------|------|
| 6 | 4:20 |
| 7 | 4:23 |
| 8 | 4:23 |
| 9 | 4:20 |
| 10 | 4:16 |
| Second 5K | 21:40 |
| First 10K | 43:38 |

Goal: do exactly what I did for the past 5K. Result: 5 very similar kilometers. T and New Guy are still with me as we pass the 5K mark. I skip the drinks, I still haven't learnt how to drink during a race without dieing. I haven't really tried either. Kilometers 5 and 6 mostly run past a nice canal, but we're mostly past the interesting landmarks of The Hague. Around the 7th KM New Guy and I start to gain some distance on T. He wishes us good luck and we fly out of his safe and experienced nest. At least we've got each other and the amazing bond we formed over the quiet kilometers we spent together.

I am wearing a blue shirt that says ""Running for Government"". People working at the ministries or any of the dozens of government agencies in The Hague could sign up. The shirt doesn't quite fit, even the M is too large for my 1m90 body. Being a civil servant is all about sacrifice though, so I keep going. Around KM 8 another guy in the blue government shirt passes me. I tell New Guy ""there goes my chance at the fastest Civil Servant price"". I didn't end up winning. I try not to think about it.

I negative splitted the first 10K.

### Kilometers [10] to [15]
| Kilometer | Time |
|------|------|
| 11 | 4:14 |
| 12 | 4:16 |
| 13 | 4:22 |
| 14 | 4:23 |
| 15 | 4:18 |
| Third 5K | 21:31 |
| 15K | 1.05:09 |

I'm feeling strong! I didn't start too fast this time, I didn't overestimate myself. I'm on pace to reach my goal. That sounds like a perfect time to make mistake. So I did. ""I'm going to speed up to 4:15 pace"" I told New Guy (he's not quite new anymore, I consider him my BFF by now). He tells me good luck and I run away.

Little did he know I also sped up during the 10th KM. I'm sneaky like that. Three kilometers later I realise the mistake I made. Speeding up was a horrible idea and I'm getting side stitches. I pass my coach again around the 12th KM and put on my biggest smile and a thumbs up. Actually I'm dieing, but he doesn't have to know. I'm not at all having fun. I almost pass my house in this part, but decide not to shower and go to bed just yet. Just keep running.

Little interesting things happen while I disappoint myself with two slow splits in KMs 13 and 14. I somehow manage to push out a slightly faster one in 15. We're getting really close to the Pier now. I think we pass [Madurodam](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurodam#/media/File:Madurodam_pays_bas.JPG) around here too, the famous miniature city in The Hague. I should've ran the miniature CPC to be honest, could've been done already..

### Kilometers 15 to FINISH
| Kilometer | Time |
|------|------|
| 16 | 4:30 |
| 17 | 4:28 |
| 18 | 4:24 |
| 19 | 4:27 |
| 20 | 4:31 |
| 21 | 4:13 |
| Fourth 5K | 22:20 |
| Second 10K | 44:51 |

From city to pier and back to the city. That's what they told me. They forgot to tell me about the dunes between the two. These kilometers are hell on earth. There's rolling hills all the way. As I go up the first uphill part people along the path cheer on the woman that passes me. She's the 32nd female in the race. Nice. Meanwhile, I'm feeling dead last as I struggle uphill. I regularly train in [the dunes of the Hague](http://static.zoom.nl/7649D1667B1F48AEF4AAB5E491C8B396-binnenduin-meijendel.jpg) and I ran the [Seven Hills 15K](http://www.nnzevenheuvelenloop.nl/) in november. Yet in neither of those cases I had done 16 kilometers before running uphill. It is at this point that I really miss New Guy, I should never have left him. I'm sorry.

It's actually a beautiful part of the course with a view of [the North Sea](http://www.noordzeenettenvrij.nl/assets/img/slide-01.jpg) and [the Scheveningen pier](https://www.architectuur.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/De-pier_Reuzenrad.jpg). However all I can think of is my pace slowing down. I can't keep it around 4:20 at all. I have no idea whether I'm heading for a sub 1.35:00 finish anymore, I just want to finish this damn race. Even after the 3 hilly kilometers are behind me, I feel terrible. We're passing through [beautiful streets](https://cloud.funda.nl/valentina_media/082/665/588_1080x720.jpg) as we go back towards the city center. I'm not really aware of any of that, I'm just trying to keep 32nd Female in sight.

As we pass the 20KM sign I know I didn't negatively split at all. It was my slowest kilometer of the race. My legs hurt. But it's only one more kilometer, so yay? The whole last kilometer is a straight road. At the end of the roads the government buildings form [the Hague's skyline](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f7/0f/1d/f70f1dcba4eedfda187ac9cada20c597.jpg). And you know what? Like the good civil servant I am, nothing makes me run faster than going to work. I begin a final kick. With 500M to go I'm pretty dead, but I keep going. With 400M to go I am not quite sure my left toes are still attached, the only assurance I have is that they hurt. With 300M to go I think my legs are about to fall off. With 200M to go I'm looking for my parents in the stands. With 100M to go I'm about to begin an all out sprint. Which I somehow manage.

**Finish time: 1.32:03!** MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! I stopped calculating what paces I needed to be running, so I'm just ecstatic that the final result is THIS good! If it wasn't for my legs, I would've jumped for joy.

### Post-race
I really love reading everyone's Race Reports, so I hope I could at least entertain some of you with this one.

I'm blown away with my result and all the mental gymnastics I went through to get here. I don't think I'll be running anything beyond the Half in the near future. While the satisfaction from this finish is great, I don't believe I would mentally survive a marathon just yet. I got some 10K's and [an amazing relay](https://www.batavierenrace.nl/english/home/home.html) from [Nijmegen](https://images2.persgroep.net/rcs/XSWU4wLjMNy65-0ugSD8emFs94g/diocontent/68806371/_fitwidth/694/?appId=21791a8992982cd8da851550a453bd7f&amp;quality=0.9) to [Enschede](https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/40nnWPdHL-MVoF29NS5zBc9Hcrc/diocontent/106885362/_fitwidth/694/?appId=21791a8992982cd8da851550a453bd7f&amp;quality=0.9) on the calendar before summer. After summer I might do the [Dam to Dam run](http://www.damloop.nl/en/) (10 mile) and improve my [Seven Hills](http://www.nnzevenheuvelenloop.nl/) (15K) time.

I hope to bring some more Race Reports to you in the future! Gotta show you guys what Dutch races are like, right? Any feedback is always welcome :)

83qpz1,5,2018-03-11,Feeling so bad about myself for so many reasons...,lacr1m0sa,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/83qpz1/feeling_so_bad_about_myself_for_so_many_reasons/,"I'm 20 (turning 21) and I honestly feel so bad about myself all the time; as if I've done nothing significant with my life at all so far and that I'm just in a bad place in life. I'm back at university after taking a leave of absence last year mostly due to health+mental health reasons and ultimately deciding to transfer schools. I'm a commute student; ONLY because nobody here lives in the dorms unless they are international/from another state and nobody really goes anywhere else other than universities in their city.

My first two years of university (I was enrolled in a 4 year double-degree which I started at 17) were maybe the worst ever two years of my life with a brief brutal relationship+nasty breakup in my first year that took me FOREVER (almost 2 years) to get over, toxic friends, doing courses I wasn't even really enjoying, isolation, changing my major 3 times during my 2nd year, very low GPA and a string of failed courses (which was mostly my fault for not getting my act together though I can attribute mental health to at least part of it). Now that I'm at a different university and have taken a break, my mental health is significantly better and I AM more motivated with my classes but feel so bad about having to sit in freshman classes because a fair few of my courses didn't transfer and different universities have different core requirements. Most of my friends are entering their final year and they all seemed to have a better experience than me and area really flourishing in uni. As for me, I had the worst experience of my life and spent the first month of my time off mostly crying about it. When I entered university, I was really hoping to recreate myself as a more open and social person after going through high school with no real close friends and only a bunch of people I considered ""acquaintances"". Looking back, my first ever semester was actually fairly decent before I met my then-boyfriend who ""ruined it all"" and never even cared. 

Though I'm aiming to graduate at the end of next year (provided I take summer courses/maybe extra courses) at the age of 22 or 23 instead of 21 which I know still seems like a ""normal"" age, I feel so bad about myself for graduating a year later than I originally planned with only a single degree that is supposedly less ""prestigious than my original one. I also feel inferior to my friends who are graduating ""on-time"" and seem to have their shit together. I think this is really a kick in the ass to being an overall ""good student"" (being a scholarship student at a private school who was always in the top class despite having bad study habits and not studying much). I feel like the culture/community I'm from (including my family, which I can't escape) is really fixated on matters like who scored the highest marks, who went to the best schools/colleges, getting internships at the ""best"" companies/firms, becoming a doctor/lawyer/engineer/businessman, competing about who makes the most money e.t.c and is really just very closed-minded, showy and materialistic in general which is why these things seem to matter, even though I personally don't particularly care about these trivial issues myself. 

To make matters worse, my teen/youth years seemed to be a bit of a waste in general. I mentioned that I went through high school virtually ""friendless"" and unpopular; I had maybe only 1-2 friends outside school whilst at school, I had ""friends"" but they were just that- people I sat with at lunch. At home, I'm an only child, not by choice but because my younger brother passed away at a very young age and my parents had an extremely abusive relationship towards each other; I had a controlling and domineering mother and a father who never really cared about me at all. I started having depression/anxiety and multiple eating disorders that cut me off from others from the age of 13 which never really got resolved until age 19/20 and have virtually no passions in life. I do have a bunch of ""hobbies"" that I'm ""good"" at primarily in the arts but nothing really stands out; I feel like a slew of wasted talent. Despite having many dreams of my own, I was really strongly discouraged from pursuing them at all by people around me because it was not ""practical"" (I did dabble in some acting positions for a bit and took a few painting and foreign language classes) and now that gives me anxiety/fear of doing anything I want to some extent. Though I have a license, I still can't officially drive since I haven't passed my license test (I failed it whilst most of my friends all passed on their first try). 

So basically, now I'm just trying to turn everything around but with all this baggage behind me, I have the lowest of the low self esteem and feel bad about myself, which is really holding me back and letting go of these but I really don't know how to begin or how to start being optimistic about my future considering my terrible past...

TL;DR: 20 years old living in a materialistic society I don't like, life seems to have been a series of unfortunate events, feeling behind in life and empty inside. "
83qq81,23,2018-03-11,THEORY: The Aurora - How It Works And Why It Has The Effects It Does,Captnq,thelongdark,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/83qq81/theory_the_aurora_how_it_works_and_why_it_has_the/,"**Thesis**: To create a theory as to the reason behind the aurora. The Theory must explain how the aurora works, why it is happening, the history of aurora events, and explain the effects it has on both wildlife and electronic equipment. It must do this without breaking any existing cannon and must be predictive for the purposes of future game development.


The Theory must also be as ""realistic"" as possible, trying to use real world science to justify the theory as much as possible. While it will be necessary to ""fudge"" some of the science, because the events that take place are technically impossible, instead of just creating new scientific theories to explain things, we can use actual real world animals, plants, events, and phenomenon as much as possible. We just might have to ""squeeze"" them a bit to get things to fit. Squeezing existing science to fit the narrative is acceptable for the purposes of this thought experiment.

**Question**: *What Is An Aurora Event?*


**Answer**: We don't know exactly and to the fullest extent of what the aurora events are and what they do, but we can make a number of guesses and extrapolations from in game observations.


Taken from the TLD Wikipedia entries:


**""Auroras are often present in the sky, appearing and disappearing according to some unknown set of NATURAL RULES ^[editor ^emphasis]. Besides acting as a hauntingly beautiful reminder of what has transpired, the auroras also have an effect on the world around you.""**


What can we determine from this? Specifically, that this is a natural phenomenon following **Natural Rules**. If it follows natural rules, then this indicates it is natural and not man-made.




**""The aurora makes its first appearance when the player first wakes up following a plane crash. This is hereafter referred to as the ""First Flare."" After that, it does not make another appearance until in Episode 2 where the player blacks out at Maintenance Yard. From then on, auroras will keep making appearances randomly.""**


While this reflects the start of the Aurora Events, and is mostly for narrative purposes, we can make some conclusions from this. Specifically, that the phenomenon started out slow. There was one flare, then it took time for another to appear. Then it started to occur with much greater frequency. This implies that this is the start of a cycle, and not some man-made event. If it was man-made, then the events would occur with some sort of pattern, indicating that the process was predictable. Events in nature that occur are usually more chaotic in nature and not predictable. The fact the events are random, but increase in frequency, implies there that the aurora events are part of a cycle of some sort. It will continue to a point of peak output, then the cycle will decrease until it stops completely. 


**""In Survival mode and challenges, the aurora's appearance is rare and is based on many factors, REGARDLESS OF THE REGION ^[editor ^emphasis]. It only appears during the night and when the weather is clear with no fog or snow.""**


First, we have *""regardless of the region""* that we must address. While this clearly refers to the maps, I believe we can safely extrapolate to indicate this is a world wide event. This line implies it is happening everywhere and to everyone.


This is a game play limitation; that the effects of the aurora are only during a clear sky at night. While we know this is for purposes of game balance, we must include this in our theory. So, whatever is causing it only occurs at night. Why? It could happen during the day. Normal auroras do occur when the sun is shining. Why would the aurora fail to work during the day?


If we assume that the source of the auroras is the sun, then the sun is fighting against the earth's magnetic field. Normally that would cause the energy to head to the north and south poles. However, if we make the assumption that the energy causing this is not strictly photonic in nature but some sort of boson, then the energy would be affected by gravity to a greater extend then magnetic fields.


Assuming this is the case, it would be possible that the energy from the sun hitting the earth directly is actually rather weak. It would also be ""drowned out"" by the more energetic photons from natural sunlight. However, the earth's magnetic field and gravity well is rather large. It is possible that in many ways, earth's gravity and the magnetic field acts as a lens, trapping these Aurora Bosons out to a rather sizable distance from the earth, possibly many thousands of miles. This then causes the Aurora Bosons to, instead of streaming past Earth, to arc inwards towards the earth. Particles that miss the earth would just go spinning off into space. Those that hit would be mostly concentrated on the side facing away from the sun.


If we assume this is the case, where both gravity and the van allen belt are working in concert, we can make some conjectures.


1) There will be a spot on the ""day"" side of Earth directly over the point that is closest to the sun (which changes over the year, based on the Earth's tilt) where the majority of ""day side"" Aurora Bosons would be focused. This happens already with the van allen belt, and I see no reason why it would not happen this way for this phenomenon. It would be a very small area, but it would exist. It would only be visible for maybe a few minutes at high noon at one specific location, because otherwise there just wouldn't be enough concentration to punch through. This would be a very limited number of particles, due to the limited surface area.


2) The aurora is only visible to us because the particles can interact with the particles in the air. The particles that are caught by earth but miss hitting the earth's atmosphere would interact with the van allen belt and escape the earth's gravity field to the north and south. While we may not see it in the game, in the X-ray, gamma ray, and possibly cosmic ray end of the light spectrum, there would be a very visible and continuous ""jet"" of this material shooting away from the earth to the north and south. If humanity had any working telescopes capable of seeing into this end of the light spectrum, they should be blazing beacons in the night sky.



3) Any and all of humanity's artificial satellites that were not created with basically an internalized Faraday cage are completely borked. Even then, I believe a relentless bombardment on this level would overwhelm even the most hardened of electronics. Simply put, the Aurora Bosons will naturally accumulate in any orbital satellite like you or I building up a static charge from walking across the carpet. Except the charge just builds and never goes anywhere. Eventually, the charge will build up to the point where if it gets close enough to any object, from another satellite to a passing fleck of paint, that the energy will seek to equalize. This will be basically a giant lightning bolt.


It doesn't matter how distant it is from all other objects. Eventually, enough energy will built up that it will be able to arc across virtually any distance. The low earth orbit satellites will go first, because most are only a few hundred miles above the planet. When the energy is discharged, the satellite will be reduced to slag from the release of heat. Only satellites completely surrounded by a cage of superconducting material (none in orbit today) could survive. As these satellites blow up, it will be most spectacular. Chances are the lightning blast will be a rather deep red, not unlike the red lightning phenomenon that occurs in Earth's upper atmosphere.


**""When the aurora is present, electronics will come to life. Lights will flicker, radios in cars can be usable and songs will begin to play, and the elevator at the Carter Hydro Dam becomes operational in story mode.""**


Energy from the sun interacting with electronics is already possible, but the problem is the radio. This doesn't make any sense. Unless the radio has a ""play list"" it shouldn't work. Unless there is a radio station somewhere that randomly turns on as well. If this is the case (and AM signals can bounce very far through the earth's atmosphere., then radio's should be more random. We'll just have to chock this one up to bad writing. It just doesn't fit anything.


**""The flashlight's battery can be recharged when the aurora is present. However, it will quickly die if the aurora leaves, rendering the flashlight useless.""**


This is another ""doesn't fit"" situation. The batter could recharge, given the ""in game"" internal logic, but why does it drain when the aurora is gone? The aurora shouldn't drain any batteries during the day, but that seems to be the case. I have a theory on this, but I'll get back to it later when we discuss the aurora animals.


**""The predators will be extremely hostile and very dangerous during an Aurora event as they will ignore any form of natural threats such as, flares and campfires and will give a chase from long distances on the player.""**


Aurora animals. They glow in the dark and make no sense.


Or do they?


Allow me to introduce to you Staphylococcus aureus a magnetotactic bacteria. It is rather common and steers by crystals inside it that allow it to detect the magnetic fields around it. The stuff is rather resistant to antibiotics and has a tendency to cause infections to people with compromised immune systems. How to kill it off, is a problem. Well, one solution is to bombard the infected person with intense magnetic fields. They have no effect on the human, but on the bacteria, it causes them to heat up and die due to excessive Hyperthermia.


So, we have bacterium that can detect magnetic fields and they can be heated up with magnetic fields. How does this apply to animals?


Well, let us assume the auroras are a cyclic event. Maybe with thousands of years between cycles. Now there are bacterium that have evolved to live off every form of energy ever discovered. There are bacterium that live off radioactivity. It would make logical sense we had a bacterium that evolved to live off aurora events, if they occur for say, a thousand years, then stops. Said bacterium would thrive during aurora events, but suffer when the ended.


So lets assume this bacterium, or many variants exists. What would they do in the interim? Well, perhaps they would go dormant. Maybe they'd act like normal bacterium and have normal bacterium lives in an intern. Or maybe, they would form a symbiotic relationship with other species.


Lets make some assumptions. Let us assume that this bacterium reproduces faster in aurora eras. Maybe this bacterium is more like a fungus. And maybe it's packed full of calories. So, the bacterium evolves to exist in the gut, but maybe it's got some limitations. Perhaps only plant eaters give it enough of the right raw materials. So, in herbivores, when the aurora is out, all the herbivores go somewhere to basically bed down. In their guts food is being produced, and the bacterium is also generating heat. So you're warm and your getting food. Might as well go to a safe place and sleep. Especially since the predators are out and about.


Now meat eaters, they might actually have digestive systems too aggressive for this microbe to exist in. However, the microbe just grows somewhere else. Specifically, On the skin. The carnivores don't get the extra calories, unfortunately, but they do get the warmth benefit. Unlike the magnetic microbe in your gut, these microbes have access to oxygen. SO the aerobic versions are going to be MUCH MORE aggressive. This means much more heat. Great deal for a critter that exists in an ice age, however, I suspect it would be rather uncomfortable.


In fact, they might warm up so much, they would need a way to bleed off excess energy. What better way to pump out excess energy then bioluminescence? Thus we get that all herbivores go hide to enjoy the warm and full bellies (and also explaining how rabbits and deer don't all die off in a 500 day winter). In Carnivores the microbe feeds off fur, which the carnivore is making all the time. Its basically a waste product. But it's now awake, active, and has very itchy skin. It's also glowing. Also, the microbe is in the carnivore's EYES (the eyes glow in aurora events). So, it cannot sleep. It's very warm so it can ignore the cold. Your average wolf or bear might as well go find something to eat.



**""To counter the increased hostility, wolves will avoid street lamps and floodlights as they are afraid of the light. In addition, all wolves and bears have a green glowing effect on their fur that can be visible from long distances.""**



Why? Why do they avoid street lamps and flood lights? Answer, they have glowing microbes IN THEIR EYES. They already are suffering from too much light, they are bound to be in AGONY when seeing any form of full spectrum light from an artificial source. A fire does make light, but the light it makes is a very limit section of the light spectrum. The light from a fire is not as painful as a flood light, which is designed to pump out light from at least the majority of the spectrum.

**Question**: *What is the source of the Aurora Events?*


**Answer**: The Sun.


There has been some conjecture as to if the aurora events are man-made or if they are a natural phenomenon. While the conversation with Methuselah in episode two does lean towards the implication that the aurora events are manmade, the effects of the aurora are so wide spread as to make this seem unlikely. We are talking about humanity using some sort of MacGuffin Device to destabilize the earth's core or some sort of nonsense. Frankly, the ability to cause the world wide effects that the aurora is causing is far beyond the ability of humanity at our current stage.


Of course, we are dealing with fiction, and the creators of the game may be trying to push a particular story. After all, this is fiction, so we can have some sort of ""super science:


However, as I have alluded to, the must sensible and obvious answer is, the sun. Now exactly how does this work? Well, our theoretical ""Aurora Boson"" comes from the sun and it obviously comes in waves and ebbs and flows. Why? Well, the sun has a number of convection zones. The energy that is pumped out at the heart of the sun is rather constant, but different forms of energy interact with the hydrogen and helium of the sun in different fashions. Some forms of energy zip right out. Some forms of energy takes millions of years to get to the surface.


These convection zones would act as natural ""choke points"" for certain types of energy. Energy at this juncture would then ""back log"" until it built up enough to push through the barrier into the next zone in mass. This phenomenon is already observed in the 14 year sunspot cycle. So it already exists, we're just apply it to our theoretic aurora boson and assuming the cycle happens over thousands of years.


The aurora particle would leak out, of course. But when it reached a certain threshold, it would, by its very presence, change the localized currents within the sun's convection zones. In short, the energy would disrupt the convection cycle and just SURGE to the next zone. This might happen several times as the aurora bosons migrate to the surface until it gets to the last barrier and WOOSH.


Now, such a surge would undoubtedly have other effects on the sun. What effects? Let's take a leap and say that the effect would basically destroy the sun's surface magnetic fields and that sunspot activity would drop to ZERO. If you are familiar with the ""Maunder minimum"" sunspot theory, basically when the sun's magnetic field bottoms out, it's heat output drops and we get a mini-ice age. It wouldn't drop much. But the last ""mini ice age"" the earth had involved a one degree centigrade drop. A drop in the earth's temperature of 2-5 degrees due to decreased solar output would be all it takes to cause the wintery conditions we observe.


-----


This is the rough draft of my theory concerning the aurora. If anyone has any observations, questions, or suggestions, I welcome any and all input or feedback.

**Side Note**: Next Maunder minimum is scheduled for 2030. Hope you stocked up on Crackers. If you haven't, come on down to the Quonset Garage for supplies and be sure to bring your matches, because we're a match based economy, but don't worry about packing extra water.


Because At Quonset Garage:


**THE WATER IS ALWAYS FREE!!!**


-----


**Addendum**: I forgot to mention how it affects humans.


Assuming the magnetotactic microbe exists and for some reason does not flourish in the GI tract of carnivores, humans, being omnivores, would not have the microbe in their gut. However, we did evolve from herbivores, so that might explain why humanity has an appendix. Such an organ would be ideal for a microbe that needs a haven to retreat to between Aurora cycles. In humans we simply evolved away from it, instead embracing a more varied diet as a form of hedging our bets.


As to why humans don't glow, well, we don't have fur. Yes, we do have body hair, but not the same degree or thickness as most animals. Also, human hair is chemically different from animal fur. When humans stood upright and the need for body hair diminished, there would have been a threshold where we wouldn't have been able to sustain a high enough concentration of magnetotactic microbes for it remain with humanity between aurora cycles. Thus so would end any past possible symbiotic relationship.


-----

**Addendum**: I forgot the weather conditions.


The Aurora event has no effect on nights that have fog or snow. These are nights where there is a increased amount of water in the air. There is always water in the air, but under those conditions, the water has condensed. Therefore, we can assume that whatever is happening is ""grounded"" by water.


This would mean that anything underwater would be unaffected, eletronics-wise. So underwater vehicles, like submarines would still be functioning under the rules that cover Auroras. 


-----


**Addendum**: I Forgot Batteries.


Assuming the magnetotactic microbe exists, it's population has bound to have exploded. Assuming this microbe feeds directly off the electroweak force, it would find the energy inside batteries a tasty snack. So, the microbes are what causes all batteries to ""bottom out"" after the aurora event ends."

Despite all of this, my self-esteem and self-confidence remains low. Why? Because of how they treated me (and sometimes still do) growing up. My dad and I almost got into a fight about why I have been ignoring his texts. I told him its because I do not have much time on my hands like I did in college, and also because of his criticisms about me (about my weight mostly). Granted, yes I've made some immature decisions in my life. Although, not anything dangerous or illegal. For example, during my sophomore year in college right after finals, I rode my bike to a nearby river and actually went into the river because of how bad things were. My mom found me the next day with soaking wet clothes. The only reason she found me is because she saw a note on my dorm room door, which I wrote. Had a cold chest, but not enough to be hospitalized. I was deeply depressed because of how bad my grades were at the time. Granted, I could have handled this more maturely. My parents furiously confronted me about my ""stunt"". Another time was when I bought unprescribed pills (as in not approved by the FDA) in an attempt to increase my processing power and therefore boost my academic performance. It worked wonders and my GPA went from 2.7 after 3 semesters to nearly 3.5/3.6 at graduation. Understandibly, they were concerned about my safety and health. However, the reason why I don't really contact my parents is because I don't really feel comfortable around them. Like sometimes, my dad would be in a bad mood and take his stress out on me, and would be patronizing at times, especially as I was close to leaving the nest. My relationship with my parents deteriorated severely despite doing well in school, and earning and completing internships. I mean seriously?! For what?! My parents made me come with them on a family trip, which I absolutely hated because my dad spent the whole trip criticizing my brothers and I and lecturing us about the importance of school, and how grateful we should be (at almost 23 years old mind you with good grades and internships lined up and one completed). After I got hired for one of my internships, my dad groaned about the fact that I would not be able to go on the trip instead of congratulating me like any father would. I literally avoided spending time with him or contacting him after that. Its pretty depressing for a 23 year old to feel like they're walking on eggshells around their father. There are more incidents, but for this post I'll keep it short. When I was a teenager, my dad would sometimes yell at us, but he stopped as I got to around 16. When I was 12, he yelled at me for being lazy. Though, I am actually quite grateful for that one. A few months later he made me sleep in the garage for the night after I mouthed off to my mother in an argument. In fairness, I've had many good times with my father. We both share alot of good memories and joke with each other ever so often. However, I've also had memories whereby I've felt patronized, criticized, and walked on eggshells around him. Even when I left home, became a professional, and started a career, their attitude continued. Always criticizing me, correcting me, questioning me telling me what I did or said was wrong. I just want my parents to be proud of me, or at least see me as an adult and take me more seriously. I mean they do, but not at the level that I would want. I mean I have no criminal record, except for a single speeding ticket, and a professional license (CPA if anyone is interested). I understand how hard my fathers childhood was and that he went to bed hungry every night and that his father would sometimes abuse him, his siblings, and mother (my grandma) but it at times seemed as though he would take out his frustrations out on me.I am depressed about it to the point that I sometimes self medicate with food. I’m almost overweight now because I just cannot stop eating. Why? Because of the emotional void that I’m trying to fill. I refuse to go to therapy because I’m not sure I’m I have the money for that and plus I think it’d be a waste of time. There are many more incidents that I would like to list on this post, but I’ll explain that in another post. Anyway does anyone have any suggestions or opinions on how to deal with my parents and my depression."

I am currently a senior in college. I will be graduating next fall because I need to take a few more classes to complete my degree. My plan was to apply to medical school this upcoming cycle. My university has a Health Committee and I am to submit all of my materials (LORs, PA, resume) by the end of this month. Which by the way, I still have no clue what's going on my PS. I took my MCAT last June and scored a 492. I know. I studied for quite a few months but I definitely did not put in 100%, got the grade I deserved. I now have my MCAT scheduled for June 1st. Meaning, I will not be submitting my application until July. I am starting to think that I should wait another year to apply to medical school. 

I am an average student I would say. I have a 3.7 GPA right now but I did poorly during my freshman year of college (at another school) and some of the dual enrollment courses I took while I was in high school. Once I incorporate those C's I should have a GPA of ~3.4. I have volunteer experience, I was a scribe and I am currently working on publishing my research. My research is not in anyway health-related but I won't go too much into that. 

I am currently taking Organic Chemistry 2, Genetics, A&amp;P 2, another course related to my major and an internship. Even though I KNOW that I did not put enough effort into studying for my MCAT the last time, I still feel that I have not changed my ways. Ochem is really kicking my ass and I can't seem to prioritize my MCAT even though that should literally be my #1 priority. I have my second ochem exam on March 23rd. I need to do very well on it as I did very poorly on the first exam. My ochem 1 professor is writing me an LOR and he is going to wait for that grade to write my letter. I must submit my health committee application by March 30th. So, basically the next two weeks must be dedication to ochem and my PS. I feel like I can not make the MCAT my priority at the moment. I'm already taking a gap year, or half year I guess since I won't be graduating til December. I feel that the main reason that I am having trouble making the decision to wait another year is because I feel that I need to enter medical school as soon as possible. I think to myself, other students have entered medical school right after college! Why am I not able to do that? What is it about me that keeps me from doing that?

I believe I am not ready to apply. I may be getting sentimental, but I feel it in my heart that I am not ready. I was hoping to get some advice from you guys. Would I be making the right decision? I know that I am the only person that can make this decision but it's difficult for me to see if I am leaning towards waiting another year because it would decrease my stress or if it's what I actually want? Maybe it's something that is occurring subconsciously as our brains are made to keep up from doing things that make us uncomfortable. At least for me that's the case. 

The way that I see it is that I can take this extra year (1 1/2 gap year in total) to fully immerse myself in my MCAT. I could finish my semester off really strong if I can focus on my grades and internship. The other option is to continue with my original plan, continue studying for my courses while simultaneously studying for my MCAT and have 1 month to study school-free. Finish my health committee application this month and apply in July once my score has been released. 

I don't want to be so negative but I don't believe that I can get best score I could possibly get in June. Because of my average GPA, I need to have all of the other aspects of my application in my favor. Meaning, awesome MCAT score and early application. I feel like I am basically babbling away but I just have so much going through my mind and don't know who to ask.

Basically, I'm torn at the moment because I don't know if I am making this decision for the right reasons. Would taking that other year off strengthen me as an applicant or is this me subconsciously putting off my MCAT and application process?

Thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this."

I'm +18 year old in real life and I'm seeking an fantasy with a equally +18 year old in real life roleplayer

 I'm more inclined to accept first the ones submitting their own suggestions rather than leaving me to pick everything, if you read the prompts you will realize I am flexible and open to all sort of things so please don't feel shy of pitching your idea. A bonus if it is something related to r/breeding r/impregPersonals or if you would love to corrupt/tease 

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the boys had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. In fact, this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unless he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that the intern was only (+18??) years old.

Who would like to play as her? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left aim charge of a few errands because as your parents have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**edging stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. You started to grow up to (?age), paying more attention to the opposite, boys started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way you saw her dad...which, after all, is everything you can wish for in a man of your own... Without realizing you started to imagine him touching you....kissing you...and even taking you on his bed...such as every night or so you hears your mum moan as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes you a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, your mum (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. You are at home waiting to have your man(dad) around to try something more than just imagining....today you are willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent young adult girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) Summer vacations and you invited 2 of your best friends. During the night sleepover you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them  and there is no internet available, some of your friends are more experienced but still doesn't quite satisfy you, also no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just not slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** (none are deal breakers) are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks) coupled with thick girls, being corrupted/mind broken, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.


Suggestions for *how you might look*: r/tinytits or r/slightcellulite r/ThickThighs/
*Things I would would like to see* r/girlsinyogapants r/seethroughleggings r/visiblepantyline r/cameltoe 


remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png 
Also it would be great if you can stick to describing things rather than just using pictures (both are welcome).


I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :).

83sucn,2,2018-03-12,Library clerk interview soon,RoseLunaa,Libraries,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/83sucn/library_clerk_interview_soon/,"Hi everyone! I am a 22 year old in case that happens to matter. I live in a major city and have always heard that city jobs were the best so I applied for all that I was qualified for. I applied for several library clerk positions in different areas. I actually got called for an interview! I don’t know how that happened as it is usually hard to get a city job. Like, you have to know someone. I really don’t want to get my hopes up , but this job would seriously change my life for the better. Not only that, but I love working in libraries and would consider a career in it. 

I’m nervous about the interview despite the fact that I think I am a great candidate. I looked at the requirements and it only says hs diploma. However, this job pays above min wage. I do have a bit of library experience. I worked as a digital scanning student at my university in the library. I basically helped to archive graduate thesis using computer programs. I also have worked for the city before as an intern one summer for an alderman in my neighborhood. 

I guess I need some reassurance that this isn’t a mistake that they called me back. How do I stand out in the interview? What kind of questions should I be prepared to answer? What should I wear? (Female) My interview is after library hours, which seems pretty late and that is also making me nervous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I think I’m making myself more anxious than I need to be, but I like to be prepared. "
83sudv,2,2018-03-12,The Strategies I've Used to Get my Life Together Aren't Working in my Dating Life. How Should I be Taking Action to have the Dating Life I Want?,myayhrowawaytay,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/83sudv/the_strategies_ive_used_to_get_my_life_together/,"College Aged Straight Male

Recently in my life, I feel like I’ve been improving in every area except one; dating.  Some background on me before I get into it: in high school I was extremely obese (260 lbs. at 5’8”).  I had little social interaction outside of school.  I had poor hygiene.  I wasn’t involved in any many clubs or organizations.  I had no idea what I wanted to do post graduation, other than go to college, which was expected of me.  

My freshman year of college, I hit rock bottom and realized I needed to make some drastic lifestyle changes.  I was unsure of what I wanted to major in.  I was getting fatter and fatter.  I was getting more isolated than ever before.  All I did in my free time was play FIFA and watch Netflix.  I was going nowhere.  So, I took a year off and knocked out some prereqs at my local community college (online).  I lost 100 pounds (though I put 30 back on eventually).  

When I got back to college, I became more social.  I meet a lot of people through classes, and a religious organization on campus I became involved in.  I got my first job as a tutor, which helped me network and become more social &amp; ambitious.  I decided to hit the gym more, and am starting to get strong (though I’m still about 25 pounds larger than I’d like to be, but I’m told I look normal sized).  I started paying more attention to my fashion.  I picked a major that suits my personality, and almost guarantees me a financially stable career upon graduation.  I got a paid internship in that field that gives me enough money to pursue my passions (concerts, sports, eating out, new experiences, etc…).  I decided to move away from home (I’d commuted for 3 years) for my senior year.   I’ve gotten really confident with the person I am, and more importantly, who I’m going to become.  It made me feel comfortable that I’m ready to date (something I’d always wanted to do in high school, but couldn’t due because of the aforementioned reasons).

So, I started reading up on dating advice.  The majority of the advice that resonated with me was the advice that said cold approaching was the best option.  As a self-improvement junkie, the concept of cold approach really spoke to me.  In all other areas of my life, taking action by going after the things I want had been a great strategy!  So, with the confidence in taking action I had gained from losing weight &amp; working on my career, I had started cold approaching (usually going indirect and asking girls to watch my stuff while I go to the bathroom, then starting a conversation upon return).  I probably did this, or a similar approach, with around 130 girls (I lost count).  When I started, I could barely even work up the courage to open my mouth… I was mortified of women.  Thanks to cold approach, I’m now very comfortable talking to random girls like they’re old friends of mine.  I really do not regret cold approach, and I credit it with improving my confidence around women...  However, the results weren’t there.

In roughly 130 approaches, I got about 15 numbers.  I also got a few instant dates.  However, only on one occasion did I get beyond a first date, and that girl and I had a much more friendly vibe, and we stopped hanging out when I made it clear with my actions that I was looking to date and not be friends.  I became almost numb to rejection, but after so many rejections and flakes, I just can’t go on with this.  I’d be insane to continue to do the same thing and expect a different result.  The “take action” method that has worked so well in all other areas of my life clearly isn’t working in my dating life.

So now I’m at a crossroads.  I’m looking for a new way to improve my dating life. To clarify, I’m looking for a girlfriend (not hookups, just a girl I get along well with that I can spend time with and go to concerts, dinner, parks, and museums with).   I’ve tried Tinder, but I’ve gotten under a dozen matches, none of which have gone anywhere (even using Tinder Gold).  Must people say they meet their girlfriends through work, class, or their social circle.  I’ve met a few girls in my work, classes, and social groups that I’d been interested in dating, but I have absolutely no idea how to ask them out.  I know it’s weird, but I’m actually a lot more comfortable asking out a complete stranger than a girl I know and have a lot in common with.  Because if the complete stranger rejects me, there’s no long-term consequences.  If a girl I know well rejects me, then it could affect my reputation within my social circle, and have a long-lasting negative impact in my life.  How can I change this mindset?

I’m not a bad-looking guy (I’m no stunner, but I pay attention to fashion and look normal sized in clothes, and I know that if I kept up with my diet &amp; exericse plan that I’ll be very good looking come the start of next school year).  I’ve gotten confident in who I’m becoming.  How do I find a girl to share my improved self with?

**TL/DR: I’m a former fat &amp; lazy kid who’s now normal sized, confident, and ambitious.  I’ve tried cold approach &amp; Tinder with no luck. What different approaches can I take to finding my first girlfriend?**

I did my Anmeldung but I also still have my address in my home country. I’ll stay here for less than six months and then I will return to my home country. 

I have an A2 license and I would like to ride a motorcycle here. I am on low budget and there are plenty of affordable second hand motorcycles available here. The problem is all the problems and expenses I’d have to go through to have it TÜV checked, registered, later imported (without riding it back home,  because it’s illegal to ride with foreign plates in my country) etc. 

Buying a motorcycle in my home country is significantly easier. The process is very simple and very cheap. Furthermore there is no import process when I return.

On Europa.eu it says this about using a vehicle with foreign plates

&gt; You can use it for 1 year, as long as the vehicle's location is not established in Germany.

And

&gt; If you change your country of residence to Germany, you have to re-register a vehicle previously registered in another EU country as soon as you take up residence there.

Has anybody else done this with a motorcycle or car with plates from an EU country? If I’m registered in Berlin, does that make my country of residence Germany? What does it mean for the vehicle’s location not being established in Germany?

Does anyone have personal experience? Did you get stopped more often by police?"

83tlvm,2,2018-03-12,Looking for answers from those who might understand.,ConstantReader76,otosclerosis,https://www.reddit.com/r/otosclerosis/comments/83tlvm/looking_for_answers_from_those_who_might/,"I only just found this sub an I'm shocked to see it exists.  So, I'm going to reach out and I apologize if anything has been asked to death already, but I don't see it.

My otosclerosis is hereditary.  I started losing my hearing around sixth grade.  I got lousy hearing aids in seventh grade that I refused to wear because they didn't help.  After a year of fighting with my parents and being yelled at by every adult I knew (because of course I didn't wear them because of teenage vanity!), we finally went to a different audiologist who confirmed that the first guy didn't actually give me proper hearing aids for my hearing loss.  I lost the low tones, not the high ones.  I'm weird that way.  The original hearing aids made things worse because they were cheap, off the shelf ones meant for the opposite of what I needed (but I was lying about that because of teenage vanity, of course!).

So, since then, I've worn my bilateral BTE hearing aids.  I've gone through about five sets that have just been a part of me and that I haven't really been bothered by past my teens.  In adulthood, it's just a fact of life that I deal with and don't care who notices.

I couldn't get the surgery because my ""Schwartzee"" was still active.  So active that they used to bring interns and students in to see my ear when I'd come in for appointments.  Seriously, I'd have at least a dozen of them lined up.  I had a better example than they had in their textbooks.  In fact, if you've had a newer textbook to see this condition, you might have seen my Schwartzee.  Lucky you. I've never seen it.  (I constantly asked why they didn't have an otoscope that curved around for the patient since every family member knew what my Schwartzee looked like, but I have never seen it!)

They told me the activity might stop in my early twenties and then I could get the surgery.  I lived for that day.  It didn't stop.  I was also told that I shouldn't get the surgery if I was going to have children because the hormones just restarts it and you need surgery again.  I shrugged at that as a teen.  But, I also had a teacher who had otosclerosis.  She had the surgery.  She had one kid.  It started again.  Surgery again.  She had the next kid.  Surgery again.  Next kid,  Surgery....and that surgery caused nerve deafness that can't be helped with a hearing aid.  You kind of shrug off that warning as a kid, but it means more when you're older.

So, my problem now....

* I'm 41
* I HATE going to doctors.  (Scoliosis with two back surgeries as a kid too, because I'm just that lucky.  I got tired of doctors pretty quickly.)  I'll fully admit that I haven't been to my Otorhinolaryngologist since my twenties.  (He's probably retired by now.)  Advice will be to go to a doctor, I get that.  But that's not what I'm asking.  I have to figure that the schwartzee/activity is done by now and I can get the surgery.
* I got the hearing aids I currently own about ten years ago.  The right one finally quit.  The left one is not doing well now.

Everyone I know is bugging me to just ""go get new hearing aids"" because they think they're freaking miracle ear hearings aids that you buy online.  I don't want to spend that kind of money if I can just get the surgery, which I probably can now.  Again, I can't imagine that the activity is still there.

So.... here are my issues before doing that, because this is what has me scared to just freaking go and decide between new hearing aids or surgery:

* I have not planned to have kids.  At this point, I'm 41.  I think that decision is mostly made.  But, I am SO afraid to put the nail in the coffin by admitting that this is it.  If I get the surgery, I'm not having kids.  Have any women here gone through this?  Any advice or regret?
* I am strangely afraid to be able to hear.  I'm not kidding.  My husband snores.  No big deal once I take out my hearing aids to sleep.  I used to take them out for tests in school.  I've taken them out for work when I need to concentrate.  Everytime I get new hearing aids it is such an awful adjustment to having to actually hear stuff that I wasn't able to before.  Has anyone here gone through this?  Is it as bad as I think it is?  Does hearing properly sound like background noise, or is it easier to focus on what you need to hear?  Can you sleep?  Can you concentrate?
* Please, anyone who has done the surgery: would you do it again?  Did it solve your issues?  Make them worse?  Did it come back?  Did hearing normally become an issue of its own?

If I were to tell 12 year old me that I've avoided even considering the surgery for almost 20 years, 12 year old me wouldn't believe it.  But over 40 me can't imagine what it might be like to hear like a normal human being.  My husband got me earphones for our bedroom TV so he can sleep while I watch stuff.  I was shocked to find out how much sound there is that I never hear because it's blared directly into my ears with a high bass that doesn't exist in my hearing aids.  (Skis and skates are so NOISY during the Olympics!  The Twin Peaks theme has a beautiful bass that I never knew was there!)  That's awesome!  But then, what in the hell will day-to-day noise sound like if I were to get the surgery?  Will I be able to tolerate it?

83u7h1,202,2018-03-12,Some family members [45F;19F] have come to me [23F] expressing that they believe my mother [41F] is lying about having cancer.,ameliamirerye,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/83u7h1/some_family_members_45f19f_have_come_to_me_23f/,"Firstly let me say that I do know about /r/raisedbynarcissists. I do have a few posts in my history if you're interested that better describe my relationship with my mother.

I do not have a great relationship with my mother. She is often selfish and manipulative. I feel that she lies often and refuses to take responsibility for anything. I love her but my own mental health declines when I have to deal with her frequently. Now that i have graduated college (I left home at 18 anyways and moved away for college) I choose to limit my interactions with her. I see her when I visit my brother [18M] every couple of months and speak to her on the phone once or twice a month.

&amp;nbsp;

She lives off of my step father. They split up several years ago but he still supports her because I believe he feels bad for her because she never feels well. She has an unprovable pain disorder. And I also believe he was waiting for my brother to turn 18. When he did he filed for divorce. My mother does not work. She has frequent boyfriends that contribute to the drama that she apparently needs to fuel her life.

&amp;nbsp;

From Sept-Dec 2017 I was doing an internship across the country that I was very proud of. While I was there (and truly for years) she never called to see how I was doing or asked about any of the cool things I was participating in. I am used to this. But we got into an argument while i was there and stopped talking. The night before i was to come home I called her and she told me that she was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer months ago. She said she didn't tell me because she did not want me to worry while I was on my trip. That she had already had a surgery and was going to be doing chemo. I was devastated and felt terrible about our fight. But the part of me that knows my mother well felt that she hadn't told me, not to save me from worry, but to punish me for ""not caring about her enough"" and for our fight.

&amp;nbsp;

I got home and find out that she told no one about this cancer until one of my aunt's exes let it slip because apparently she had been texting him about it. This ex is weird and its odd that she would be talking to him about it but no one else. So my whole family found out but she told them all not to tell me. They were upset but didn't tell me. My aunt begged my mom to let her come to appointments with her/ help her. (note: my aunt had breast cancer about 10 years ago and it was a big thing in our family/ my aunt frequently takes care of people with breast cancer and makes them food/etc). My mom said no thanks. She often feels like our family doesn't care about her, but she isolates herself and makes things up in her head. She feels that if people aren't doing things for her then that means they don't care about her, but conveniently forgets that its a two way street. Most of my family is fed up with her but everyone would absolutely help her with this.

&amp;nbsp;

A few weeks after I came home I got an apartment with my boyfriend a few hours from my moms and have been busy applying for jobs. I want to help my mom but she is always busy with her boyfriends when I call or go over. She doesn't tell me much about her treatments besides that she doesn't feel well. But she's always out and about. 

&amp;nbsp;

She sent a group message to my entire family that basically said 
""I am so disappointed in all of you for not helping me. I don't need anyone to go to my appointments with me but i do need help around the house, need someone to clean my house, need money, and someone to cook/feed me. I would do those things for any of you and can't believe no one has stepped up. Even (insert her abusive bf that smokes a ton and pays no rent) helps out and he's not even family and I know you all hate him but he's the only one helping me. i just thought more of all of you"". It was weird and everyone was very confused. She regularly wants money from my grandparents and even asked me for my college aide money while I was in school. 

&amp;nbsp;

Well recently my aunt visited me. She and her daughter explained to me that they think my mom might not be telling the truth about having cancer at all. And I have to admit right now that when my mom first told me I had more than a few doubts and immediately felt guilty. My aunt told me she went to my moms to clean her house. My mom left with her boyfriend and my aunt went through her medication and couldn't find any related to cancer treatments. Then another time begged my mom to let her come to chemo with her. My aunt had a doctors appointment near hers around the same time and called my mom 30 mins before her appointment (Around 8:30am) was supposed to start and said she was around could she come. My aunt had made her a pink breast cancer blanket and wanted to surprise her/sit at her appt with her. My mom told her that her appt was already over. But my aunt told me that chemo could take hours and there is no way that is possible. So my aunt went to the treatment center my mom says she goes to. She went in with the blanket and told them she was there to surprise my mom and they said there was no one by that name there. She told them the doctors name my mom had given her. No doctor with that name either. She went to my moms house and asked her how her appt was over so fast and my mom just said something about the doctor doing the treatment in his office (weird) and something about a pill. My aunt said my mother was wearing long sleeves. My aunt asked her about her arms (if they hurt/etc.) I remember my aunt had very swollen arms when she did chemo and even had problems with blood clots. My mom didn't show her her arms and waved it off saying she was fine.

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly i feel terrible for questioning something as serious as cancer. I know that my mom does often use illness as way to garner sympathy. She may have been talking to my aunt's ex and telling him she was sick (I used to go through her messages as a child and see her telling men all kinds of things about her pain disorder/ about how my dad was mean to her (he's not)/ about how no one cares about her and they would tell her she deserved better). Maybe it just got out of hand because he ratted her out? Maybe my mom has cancer? I talked to her recently and she talked about how much chemo is taking a toll on her. About how she sleeps a lot because of it and how she feels nauseous all of the time. She has her hair still but I know that with newer medications/treatments many women don't lose their hair (my aunt did but that was 10 years ago). My mom does talk about her hair thinning but my mom has had that happen for years.

&amp;nbsp;

I know this is long. i'm sorry. I am just really struggling with feelings. I don't want to think my mom is lying about this. But she doesn't have a great track record. I love her but I am exhausted with her. Does this even matter? Should i try to find out? Or do I continue to keep a distant role? In someways I feel like who cares but in other ways I know she could be taking advantage of people by claiming she is sick (like my dad who believes her wholeheartedly and is likely prolonging his financial assistance to her since he filed for divorce a week before she ""found out"" she has cancer. What should I do if anything? Am I wrong about jumping to conclusions?

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: My aunt came to me with some evidence that my mom might be lying about having cancer. I feel terrible for entertaining the thought but my mom has been untruthful in the past and it gives weight to my aunts belief. Should I try to find out or should I let my mom's life play out and stay away from the drama?

83uet0,4,2018-03-12,I (20F) feel so hopeless after being depressed,pma300,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/83uet0/i_20f_feel_so_hopeless_after_being_depressed/,"(Note: I'm not from the west)

I used to be really socially awkward when I was a kid. I had very few friends when I was young. In high school, I tend to prefer one-on-one friendships as I am introverted.

Now that I am at uni, I have been working on my social skills. I was socially awkward when I first started uni. I tend to have the same classes with the same people in my major. I then became depressed. I got bad grades and failed some courses. 

Now that I am feeling better, I don't know what to do. I've been working really hard to make new friends and I only end up with acquaintances. Most people in my major have already formed their own social circles so they are not exactly open to the idea of me joining them no matter how much small talk I've done with them. Almost all of the girls in my major/class are taken so I guess they are less interested in pursuing a BFF-type friendship than me.

I've reached out to people at club events and dorm. I did end up knowing a lot of people and can easily engage in small talk with them. People never reach out back to me though. At the end, I only end up with acquaintances. At some point, even the friendly ones will decline my offer to hang out with them or catch up with them.

I don't know why it is so difficult for me to make friends. I've had people tell me they really enjoy talking to me, and a week later, they never talk to me again and ignore my text messages when I try to reach out to them.

It's not like I dislike being single but I just want companionship. I know that older single people often feel lonely when all the people they know are married or taken, but damn, I am feeling this at the age of 20. I don't think I've ever met a guy interested in me but this may have something to do with my social skills. I feel like everyone else has moved on in life except me.

As for my grades, they are really bad as I have failed a couple of courses. I tried applying for summer internships this year and got rejected from all of them. I feel like it is too late to do anything as I am already a junior.

Tl;Dr: I am a junior at uni and feel so hopeless after depression/withdrawing from other people/failing some courses. I failed some courses and got rejected by every company I've applied to for summer internships. I've tried making friends, but end up with dozens of acquaintances and no friends. I tend to have the same classes with the same group of people from my major and it's hard to find a BFF given how they already have their own social circles and a SO. Is there still hope for me and what can I do about this?"
83uoai,6,2018-03-12,So a friend I use to work with has been gone about six months. nothing bad happened. one day she was just gone..,strik3r2k8,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/83uoai/so_a_friend_i_use_to_work_with_has_been_gone/," I worked with her for years. She was someone that made the work week bearable. I really grew to like her but kept it under wraps. But I think she knew. At one point she got a boyfriend and it hurt but we still stayed friends. Eventually they split. Never knew about it for a while.

But the way I found out was a gut punch. Because during that time,  my parents were in a bad spot. Looking  to separate so a wedge was driven in my family. And about a few hrs before I found out she hooked up with him, I found out about an old friend's suicide. Both times on Facebook. So it felt pretty shitty because I was gonna speak to her about it. But she did message me asking if I was working the next day. I didn't reply til' much later when I told her sorry for lagging it and told her what happened. She said she was sorry for my friend's death.
    I tried to see other people but always fell through.
Despite her relationship she still enjoyed talking to me about different things. She was smart and funny. We were really close and many times we'd go out for lunch or after work.

 I liked her because she was beautiful, intelligent and she had her head on her shoulders. 

 Only drawback was that she eventually became really religious. She got into Christianity. She asked me if I'd like to come by for the winter to her group. I really didn't  want to, but I went mainly for her. To be there with her. 

 It kind of changed how I saw her. In a way, how passionate she was  about was beautiful. But at the same time made me worried because I wasn't feeling it. Because it was weird to me. I'm catholic, although I'm not entirely religious. For us it's less personal. We just go to church for a baptism and go home. At this church it was in a class room and singing and a few student preaching. I felt bad for being weirded out. But the people there were genuinely nice. A friend invited me to continue but I turned it down. During this time, things took a bad turn.

 We got  into an argument about something dumb. And I called her out on something. We both stopped and things seemed good. We changed the subject and seemingly things went back to normal. But when she left she had a sad look in her face. I felt bad and wanted to apologize but got stopped by a customer. Over the weekend I thought about it and could not wait to see her again to tell her I felt bad.
  
 The day came when I saw her. I asked her how she was and she gave me a mad look. I asked if everything was ok. She said yeah. But I could tell it wasn't. I asked if she wanted  to talk and right away she said ""NO"". She was cold and this was the first time I saw her like this. Before I left work, I came up to her and told her I was sorry for how I spoke to her. She accepted it but it didn't seem genuine. A week later I was with her in the same department. I asked if we could speak. She again  said ""NO, don't talk to me"". I reply with ""Look I just wanted to sa..""

""Your talking to me"", she interrupts. She doesn't even look at me. My heart kindof sinks and I walk away. 

A couple of months go by and we have a store meeting. It was pretty depressing because we had it at a bowling alley and I saw her a few lanes down. I avoided making eye contact. I walk out of the restroom at one point and pass by. She sees me and quickly waves. I just nod in acknowledgement. During that night the song by Usher ""Without you"" plays. Great timing eh?

  A month later, I remembered she asked me to work on a project for her graduation. A logo. We were gonna work on it together prior to our argument. So I finish it and have it printed on a sweater. One night at work before we leave. I talk to her and she seemed more open.

We walked through the parking lot and I explained that the morning I saw her after my friend's suicide. I didn't wanna talk to her. I was short with her and didn't see any point. She asked if I needed help with unloading some boxes and told her no. But in a cold way. She just said ""ok"",and walked  away. I realized I was being a dick and she didn't  deserve  that. Later in the day I talk to her and try to be more positive and crack a joke. She was with it and I really couldn't be mad at her or stay mad around her. She deserved none of that.

 In the parking lot standing by my car, I told her during that time, I felt upset about her new relationship. I told her that her relationship really wasn't that big a deal looking back, but the news of my friend made it feel worse because of how isolated I felt. In a strange city, barely know anyone, a friend from my old city dies and the one person here I felt really connected with is snatched up by some dude. 

So during that time I was in a roller coaster of negative emotions.

But I told her that I realized that I'd rather her be happy with someone else than to be unhappy with me. I didn't want this argument and falling out to be the last thing she remembers about me. She told me she was sorry too for being so cold. She felt I was rude and I acknowledged it. I then gave her the sweater. She loved it and we talked about working on it some more. 

 We both hugged and I felt a huge relief.

Time went by, and people quit, new faces were hired. But we were both still there. But our schedules changed so I hardly saw her. For her birthday I took her to eat and got her a book as a gift. 

Eventually she graduated. She hugged me and thanked me for helping her with homework and her graduation sweater. This was probably the closest Ive ever felt with her.


Some time later, the inevitable showed it's face. I went to my parent's for the  week. On Thursday, she asked if I was working Sunday. I told  her yes. I thought she wanted to swap schedules. 

Also during that time, my professor offered me a paid internship. So I could not wait to tell her.

 At work on friday, I told her the news and she was excited. Then she tells me ""Guess what?"".

 ""Sunday is my last day"". I was surprised. Like ""whoa, what?"" She got another job and gave her two weeks a long time ago.


That whole weekend felt like an eternity. I just remembered looking at her  face when we spoke. Just wondering if it was the last time I would see her.

 I knew I'd have to let her go. But damn it came by unexpectedly. 

But she told me it wasn't the end. We'll go out and still stay connected. So I felt good about it. 

Sunday came, and it was my birthday. She comes into work and asks me to come to the break room. She made me some cupcakes and asked people to sing happy birthday. I was surprised she even remembered.

 She gave me a card and it said how she was thankful for me being there this whole time. So that night, we parted ways. It was bittersweet in that she did something amazing for me, and that it was the last time I'd see her.

A few days later coming into work, I looked at her locker. Just open and empty. It sunk in. Felt a lump in my throat and snapped out of it and went back to  work. 

 A couple of weeks later, she messages me saying she got her RN license. I congratulated her and said we should go out. Celebrate. 

She agreed. We planned it for a Thursday.

The day came, and that morning she messaged me saying she could not make it.

I told her ""Cool, maybe next time.""

The next  week I texted her and asked how she was. Nothing.

A week later I sent a link to her on Facebook about an event. She  didn't even look at it(to this day it hasn't been opened). A month goes by. 

An old man at my job asked if I've spoken to her. Told him no. He said he talked to her the other day. She was doing fine.

So I decide to call her up later. Voicemail, left a message.
Nothing.

 A month passed. It sank in that she was gone. That's it. I had to let go. 

Thanksgiving, Christmas, then New years eve. I got close with another girl during those times but it fell through.
 During New Years Eve, I  thought about my friend.

I decided to drop her an email. Just something that I will never know whether she read it or not. Something that I could send and forget.

 I told her that we haven't spoken in a long time. And I hoped it was nothing bad on my part. But I wished her well and told her I miss her. But it's probably better like this.

Told her that I realize that you love someone, you gotta let them go. 

That was my way of doing it. Kept it short but to the point. And I admit I was probably drunk.
But I'll never see her again. Never contact her, and move on. I don't even hope to see her.

But I'll never forget her.

Moral of the story: Don't get too close to anyone at work. It will hurt.

Despite all of this, my self-esteem and self-confidence remains low. Why? Because of how they treated me (and sometimes still do) growing up. My dad and I almost got into a fight about why I have been ignoring his texts. I told him its because I do not have much time on my hands like I did in college, and also because of his criticisms about me (about my weight mostly). Granted, yes I've made some immature decisions in my life. Although, not anything dangerous or illegal. For example, during my sophomore year in college right after finals, I rode my bike to a nearby river and actually went into the river because of how bad things were. My mom found me the next day with soaking wet clothes. The only reason she found me is because she saw a note on my dorm room door, which I wrote. Had a cold chest, but not enough to be hospitalized. I was deeply depressed because of how bad my grades were at the time. Granted, I could have handled this more maturely. My parents furiously confronted me about my ""stunt"". Another time was when I bought unprescribed pills (as in not approved by the FDA) in an attempt to increase my processing power and therefore boost my academic performance. It worked wonders and my GPA went from 2.7 after 3 semesters to nearly 3.5/3.6 at graduation. Understandibly, they were concerned about my safety and health. However, the reason why I don't really contact my parents is because I don't really feel comfortable around them. Like sometimes, my dad would be in a bad mood and take his stress out on me, and would be patronizing at times, especially as I was close to leaving the nest. My relationship with my parents deteriorated severely despite doing well in school, and earning and completing internships. I mean seriously?! For what?! My parents made me come with them on a family trip, which I absolutely hated because my dad spent the whole trip criticizing my brothers and I and lecturing us about the importance of school, and how grateful we should be (at almost 23 years old mind you with good grades and internships lined up and one completed). After I got hired for one of my internships, my dad groaned about the fact that I would not be able to go on the trip instead of congratulating me like any father would. I literally avoided spending time with him or contacting him after that. Its pretty depressing for a 23 year old to feel like they're walking on eggshells around their father. There are more incidents, but for this post I'll keep it short. When I was a teenager, my dad would sometimes yell at us, but he stopped as I got to around 16. When I was 12, he yelled at me for being lazy. Though, I am actually quite grateful for that one. A few months later he made me sleep in the garage for the night after I mouthed off to my mother in an argument. In fairness, I've had many good times with my father. We both share alot of good memories and joke with each other ever so often. However, I've also had memories whereby I've felt patronized, criticized, and walked on eggshells around him. Even when I left home, became a professional, and started a career, their attitude continued. Always criticizing me, correcting me, questioning me telling me what I did or said was wrong. I just want my parents to be proud of me, or at least see me as an adult and take me more seriously. I mean they do, but not at the level that I would want. I mean I have no criminal record, except for a single speeding ticket, and a professional license (CPA if anyone is interested). I understand how hard my fathers childhood was and that he went to bed hungry every night and that his father would sometimes abuse him, his siblings, and mother (my grandma) but it at times seemed as though he would take out his frustrations out on me.I am depressed about it to the point that I sometimes self medicate with food. I’m almost overweight now because I just cannot stop eating. Why? Because of the emotional void that I’m trying to fill. I refuse to go to therapy because I’m not sure I’m I have the money for that and plus I think it’d be a waste of time. There are many more incidents that I would like to list on this post, but I’ll explain that in another post. Anyway does anyone have any suggestions or opinions on how to deal with my parents and my depression.

I was just wondering if anyone had any input about how I should go about handling my situation… It’s been stressing me out for a long time and I’m at the point where I need to do something about it.


I’ve been with my girlfriend for just over two years now. Before her, I only dated one other person for about six months, and before me, she dated around 7 people, 3 of those for over a year, and one for over two years which she broke up with about 2 weeks before meeting me. We started dating a month later, but I did not know about her previous relationship at the time.


Needless to say from her wealth of experience, she is extremely comfortable in a relationship. Like, seemingly needs to be in one. Also, she tends to carry things with her. As in, she still brings up salt from her previous relationships and has crises because she doesn’t know how she feels about her ex on the regular, to this day. 


She is also extremely, extremely insecure. A good portion of the time we spend together is spent with her asking me for some form of validation, whether it being asking me if I think she’s fat, or if I think she’s pretty, or, even more commonly, if I think (insert random girl we both know here) is prettier than her. I feel like it’s common for girls to want/need validation every once in a while, but for her its literally 80% of the time we spend together, which is a lot, considering…. We live together.


At first I was hesitant to move in together, as I really enjoy my independence. But she convinced me it was a good idea, and eventually got to the point where she was saying things like “if we end up together you’re going to have to live with me, so if you don’t want to live with me that means you don’t want to end up with me.” I should also probably mention that my self esteem, while not at her level, also isn’t the best and I have a very hard time standing up for myself to people I care about, which is probably the main cause of all of this.


Back to her insecurities, her previous boyfriend broke up with her fairly “out of the blue” so she says, and apparently it really destroyed her. To the point where she still brings it up. Weekly. Anywho, because of this, she has said many things along the lines of “I can’t get broken up with again” and “I’m so scared your going to leave me” or “I can’t trust anyone, they all just leave, I bet you’re no different” (accusingly). Meanwhile I’ve done my absolute best to tell her that I care about her and that I don’t care about any other girls and that she’s more than enough for me etc., but it 
just won’t work. 


She has a history of very bad mental health. Though she has stopped cutting in the last two years, when she gets upset, she often gets extremely depressed for over a week and threatens to cut all the time, and even gets low-key suicidal. Not to the point where I think she’d actually do it, but seriously says things like “I want to die”, “life is so disappointing, there’s no point to it”, “it wouldn’t be so bad if I just got hit by a bus today.” Her mental health and total paranoia of me leaving, as well as her making me promise many times not to break up with her “suddenly” are probably the main reasons I’ve stayed this long. I don’t necessarily think its on purpose, but it feels like I’m being manipulated by her mental health.


So anyways, take all of what I said, throw in that she’s extremely needy (as in, if we’re both home, I can’t spend more than 20minutes doing homework/studying without getting interrupted because she feels “lonely” even though I’m right there), she makes me not have any time to myself, and her parents have paid for vacations for me to go with them (which she has used against me in the past), and I don’t know if I can do it anymore. I think this girl just isn’t for me, but I feel super guilty taking this long to do something about it, which just makes it harder. That being said, I don’t know how to proceed, especially since we live together and the whole thing about promising to not do it suddenly etc. When I show signs of being unhappy in the relationship she moves to being super sweet but sad, all scared that I’m going to leave and says that she loves me so so much and can’t live without me and wants to marry me… I still really care about her as well, and am worried for her health if I end it. Plus, I have no idea how to just bring it up that I’m unhappy slowly before ending it to give her the “warning” she wants.


I was thinking about ending it this Friday, when my dad can come pick me up (he lives about an hour away) and I can hopefully find a buddie’s place near my uni to crash at until the end of the term, after which I’ll be on internship and can live at home.
Any advice on logistically how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.


TL;DR, my relationship has been stressing me out for a long time and I think I need to do something about it and very soon. But many things, including her mental health, past promises, and living together are going to make it messy.

83wy72,1,2018-03-12,The tip of the iceberg that is.....DIGITAL MARKETING,connor142,digital_marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/83wy72/the_tip_of_the_iceberg_that_isdigital_marketing/,"Over the past month I've become very very interested in the different angles and career paths within digital marketing. PPC, web development, and advertising and driving traffic to a particular website.

I've joined stack that money, followed one of the newbie guides and ran 2 direct link campaigns in mobidea to get the ball rolling towards ""affiliate marketing"". It really wasn't as glamorous as I was expecting lol....

Now I'm seeing that affiliate marketing is just one section of the industry, and I believe I'd like to try other things within the space.

I've had an idea for a while to start a service for creating/updating/developing websites for businesses and companies for people who don't understand the importance, have the  know how or have time to do. Is this a common practice in 2018? How does the business work? Do charge per month? Per website? Per hour? Bundle deals? 

I've sent out emails and intern applications to marketing agencies in my area to try and learn more but not many businesses want to take on a student (that's why I'm asking Reddit!)

I'd REALLY like to offer a service for people who already own a website (or once they have one built be myself) and have their own traffic. I really do not know much about this aspect of digital marketing. I want to learn how to drive traffic to a particular website and help the owners monetize their blog/website through advertisements..... is this a common practice for 2018? Had the space been dominated by big huge companies? 

I would assume if you are a master at driving traffic, paid or organic, your skills and services will be highly sought after by all types of businesses on the internet. 

What do you think is the best way to learn this business? College? Internship? Online courses?

I am a member on stack that money, which has a ton of good general information but a lot of the content is a couple years old. It seems it has grown to having a TON of people like me and very little experts to talk to. 


Thank you in advance. It's hard to find information on digital marketing without someone trying to sell me their master course for 297 dollars around every corner and link that I click!!!!


I wrote this really quick at work, sorry if anything does not make sense and forgive me for my simple terms! Thanks in advance to anyone with any insight, maybe this post will help future internet entrepreneurs for years I come!!!!"

I'm currently interning at a startup doing UX Research/Design/a bit of development (but my title is Software Engineering Intern), and have accepted an offer at a startup in the PNW for a similar UX-oriented role with potential for software engineering (in React Native). 

I'm having a hard time deciding between Information Science or Computer Science. I used to be dead-set on software development as a career in the future, but ever since I was moved to a UX-oriented role, I've fallen in love with it. I'm scared I'll pigeonhole myself into UX and want to keep my options open for Software Development positions at the same time. Is this even possible?

Here's my goals by the time I graduate:

- 1. Be competitive for UX positions at large companies

- 2. Also be competitive for Software Development positions at large companies

- 3. Be competitive for Graduate Schools in HCI/HCDE

I'm currently planning on majoring in Computer Science, but I was thinking of doing Information Science and a minor in CS, because 1. the iSchool is highly ranked, 2. the IS degree has a specification in User-Centered Design (and the option of completing a related area in Cognitive Psych), 3. job applications for UX positions seem to prefer Information Science majors over CS majors, and 4. minoring in CS is still possible while graduating on time (the minor goes very in-depth at my school as well). 

Are these goals realistic? I want to stay competitive for SWE roles but at the same time want to also be competitive for UX applications. 

This leads to my question - what would be better in my situation - A CS degree with an 'unofficial/self-designed' related area in Cognitive Psychology, or an IS degree, specialization in User-Centered Design, minor in CS, and a related area in Cognitive Psychology? 

Note - the double major is an option, but would require a summer semester in order to graduate on time."

83y5rk,2,2018-03-12,Picking a University,dannyg5423,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/83y5rk/picking_a_university/,"I'm in a dilemma right now. I have to pick where I want to go to college and I've got 2 choices: FIU and MDC Honors. I will be majoring in math. I will give the breakdown of each. (Both have Calc 1-3)

FIU (4 years)
- Full ride
- Offers all VEE classes and has many stats classes (all are above 4000s in course code)
- Considered the lesser of the two (prestige-wise)


MDC Honors (2 years)
- Full ride
- More prestigious than FIU
- May be able to get a full ride to UF as a transfer (more prestige than FIU)
- Can still get guaranteed full ride to FIU after 2 years
- Many companies offer internships to the Honors students
- Does not have any VEE classes other than Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
- Only 1 stats course (STA 2023)


Basically, the factor that is determining my decision is how Exam P will play into this. I plan on taking Exam P sophomore year, but if I go to MDC Honors I will only be able to take 1 stats course (STA 2023) but in FIU they have plenty of stats courses. However, if I can pass Exam P MDC Honors' internship program may be able to get me an internship at an actuarial company.


Pretty much, are stats courses very important for Exam P or can I make do without them?

My first month I was prescribed 2 10mg IR Adderall to take as needed each day. Other than a few times of missing it as I was running late for class, I noticed a huge difference in my quality of life. Not only have i had nearly 0 mograines or headache days, they were multiple times a week previously and we think triggered by stress, I have been excelling at school and work. Because I am a full time student and work 15-30 hrs a week from home, computer science intern, i asked if there was a way to extend my dose better throughout the day so i didnt have to pick and choose the four hour chunks i needed to be productive during the day. So at my checkup appt, a few weeks ago, i was prescribed 10mg of XR as well as the 10mg IR as an afternoon booster. Due to some insurance and doctor and pharmacy miscommunication these were filled about a week apart. Today is my third day of taking the XR and I am starting to feel as if it is not nearly as effective as the IR. I initially chalked it up to the fact that my first day on it I was working on a 6 page paper I was completely uninterested in. But today is a normal work only day for me and i have still been extremely less focused, that is until I take my IR in the afternoon and then i feel great. I was under the impression that the XR would feel the same as the IR  but just last longer, however i feel like it is far less effective so i cant wven tell if it is lasting longer honestly. I am frustrated because now my next appt is not for 3 months but im worried I am going to suffer through finals and work until then. I know I could make another appt to discuss this but then I would have to pay again and this has already been an expensive process . Is it common for XR Adderall to feel less effective and only last maybe 5 hours? And has anyone had success in asking for a higher dose from there doctor over the phone when getting the refill script or will I have to make another appt? I apologize for the length and any mistakes, I'm posting from my phone."

83yyu6,2,2018-03-12,My [24F] ex [26M] and I split up 3 months ago. Do I tell him that I'm leaving the country?,capersiste,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/83yyu6/my_24f_ex_26m_and_i_split_up_3_months_ago_do_i/,"Hi r/relationships! I hope this is the right place to post this question.

I (American) am recently out of a 3.5 year relationship with my ex (French).  Throughout the course of our relationship, I moved around quite a bit, but ultimately ended up in France (to pursue a graduate degree, and him). In December 2017, I ended up leaving the relationship for a plethora of reasons that I won't go into on this forum. However, despite the breakup being hard emotionally, we both mutually agreed that we wanted to try to remain friends.

Over the past few months, I've started to feel a bit suffocated in the city that we (both) currently live in. We don't cross paths very often, but the vast majority of my experiences in this city (and this country) are tied to memories with him, and I'm having a hard time healing in the way I need to because of this. I know that I don't want to rekindle anything romantically with him, but despite this, I still can't get past the fact that every corner of this city is littered with ""our"" memories.

Therefore, I've decided to move. My graduate program gives me a summer + semester off to pursue an internship experience (this is mandatory), and I can do my internship anywhere in the world. I've basically decided that I want to do it anywhere in the world but here if I can help it (unless I get an offer that I absolutely can't refuse). Ultimately though, I do need to come back to France after this experience to finish up my last semester of my degree program (spring 2019). 

To me, leaving France on my own accord and choosing somewhere in the world that I want to be (and only for reasons that directly pertain to me and my own wellbeing) feels like a crucial step in ending one chapter of my life and beginning the next. However, I'm confronted with the dilemma: do I tell my ex that I'm leaving the country?

We did agree to be friends, so a part of me feels obliged to tell him. On the other hand, I don't feel like I owe him anything because of the way he's been treating me recently (it's starting to become very apparent that our friendship is only valuable to him when it's convenient for him). However, I don't want to hurt hum.

If I leave, it will likely be in early to mid-May 2018. I'll be gone until at least January or February 2019.

tl;dr Moved to France in part to pursue a relationship, said relationship ended a few months ago. I have the opportunity to leave France until January or February 2019 - do I tell my ex that I'm leaving?

So r/relationships, should I tell my ex that I'm leaving the country? "
83z69u,2,2018-03-12,Stressing over drug test,KanyeDepressed,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/83z69u/stressing_over_drug_test/,"I know that there have been numerous threads of this kind, but I kind of want some reassurance or some advice as to what I should do. Some background info: I smoked every day for almost a year but recently went on vacation on March 2nd and came back on the 9th. When I got home, I loaded up my Arizer and smoked with my girlfriend. Since then I haven't smoked since I found out that I have a drug test at some point in the near future. I'm kind of a bigger guy, in width not height, but I am not obese by any means. My diet is shit, though I have always consumed about 64oz of water a day.

The issue is that this is an internship for a software engineering position at some government company. They sent me an email that didn't say when I had to complete these forms by, but I would be starting this May. However, in the email, they said that I have to fill out and submit some form to initiate a background check and that some 3rd party company would be in contact with me. Once I received a ""receipt"" that I would have 48 hours to complete the drug testing at a lab in the city. Had I known that there would have been a drug test this soon, I wouldn't have smoked when I got back.

My question is, will I have time if I use the detox guide that gets reposted here all the time? Where I mix a drink with water, sugar, vitamin b2, and creatine? I am not a very active person, but I definitely can be since this is a massive opportunity for me. My school has a gym and a sauna, should I do some cardio and then chill in the sauna afterward to try and sweat it all out? I almost want to contact my hiring rep and tell them some BS story about how I smoked while I was on vacation (I did travel to a legal place but didn't smoke at all).

Any advice is much appreciated! Thanks in advance"
83z9vz,2,2018-03-12,Considering going no contact with my Ex... do i [24F] tell him [26M] that i'm leaving the country?,capersiste,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/83z9vz/considering_going_no_contact_with_my_ex_do_i_24f/,"Long story short, my ex of 3.5 years and I broke up. I was the dumper in this situation. Nevertheless, the relationship has taken an emotional and mental toll on me. For this reason, I've already deleted him off of Facebook, and the only social media he remains a ""friend"" on is Snapchat. I'm considering putting an end to that, too, but just need the strength to rip that final bandaid off.

A little bit of my backstory: He and I both live in France, and I moved here in part to pursue our relationship. We met here a little under 4 years ago, and I moved (back) here around a year and a half ago. Since then, our relationship has slowly deteriorated to the point where I ended up breaking it off with him in December 2017. Mind you, this is the man I thought I'd be marrying one day. We'd already discussed it on multiple occasions. 

I personally feel like in order for me to heal in the way that's best for ME, I need to spend a little bit of time outside of France. I have the opportunity to spend a summer + semester pursuing an internship for my graduate program, and I'm almost 100% sure I'll be pursuing opportunities outside of France (unless an opportunity comes up that I can't refuse). 

However, here is the dilemma: I think it's time for me to go no-contact with my ex, but I also will be moving soon. Do I tell him that I'm leaving the country before going no contact, or do I simply go no-contact and let him find out through mutual friends that I've left?"

After graduating college, I decided to do affiliate marketing for a company that I failed at but learned some things. 

Then I started my own business with a buddy of mine from high school. He was actually the one who got me into affiliate marketing (note: the business we now run is not affiliate or network marketing). We are both creative people who like to make content and share it with the world but don't have the best means of getting it out to the world or effectively running a business in regards to any aspect - accounting, marketing, operations, legal, etc., everything. 

We're about 3 months deep in the venture and are having serious issues in regards to brand direction, content creation, accounting for sales, and pretty much everything a business entails.

My thoughts are my partner is an idiot with good intentions, but just doesn't know how to do this shit and is kind of a shady dude in terms of always giving away our merch for free to people with no social following, not depositing merch funds in the business account, always claiming we should do things but expects me to do them most times ...

I used to work in the fashion industry with huge influencers in LA and take photos of hot girls for a living, now I'm running a (what seems to be) failing business. I love the brand we've been able to build but I don't see us ever getting over this hump of creative difference/sketchy activity.

Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated I am very lost. Thanks in advance."
83zxjm,26,2018-03-12,[23F] Dream job? Check. Dream colleagues? *cries internally*,TooCasualToBeCool,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/83zxjm/23f_dream_job_check_dream_colleagues_cries/,"I’m in desperate need of advice. 

Two weeks ago, I started my literal dream internship at a literal dream company doing - you guessed it - dreamy work. I’m eternally grateful for the opportunity, and I recognize that I worked hard for it. And I plan to continue working my ass off every step of the way because opportunities like these don’t just fall into your lap. And also, everyone I work with is brilliant - top of the line in their field. It’s inspiring, to say the least. 

So what’s the problem, you may be wondering? Maybe I’m just soft, but I’m having a more-than-difficult time adjusting to the people in my company. 

Minor detail I might’ve failed to mention: I work for a PR/Marketing agency. 

The moment that knocked me off my rocker happened this past weekend. Being new and wanting to make a good impression, I decided to volunteer for an event my company hosted for a local music/tech/film conference. (Trying my best to be discreet here, can’t you tell?) The actual event was phenomenal - truly brilliant technology! The downside to the whole day was meeting my co-workers outside of the office. 

Turns out people aren’t so nice in this industry. Like at all. 

I was pretty taken aback when the women (my office is mostly women - not trying to perpetuate any sexist stereotypes) I was slotted to volunteer with kept passing pretty harsh and unnecessary judgements on every person that passed by our building. This made me uncomfortable for a couple of reasons: 

(1) I like to think I’m pretty open-minded and genuine with people. Every person has intrinsic value and can teach you something new. And why not be kind? It beats being negative and hateful, IMO. While manning the door, I didn’t shy away from making light convo with those walking past, even going so far as to compliment them and give coffee recs! I like making people smile and laugh - this was not at all how these women liked to spend their time manning the door. 

(2) It’s safe to assume that if one is talking shit about someone else to you, they will not hesitate to do the same behind your back. Example: There was another woman volunteering for a different company event in the same building as our own. She was nice, and we shared a couple laughs, before my Co-workers showed up. As soon as she left, one of my Co-workers turned to me and said something like “She’s really weird, isn’t she?” I just kind of laughed it off and said she’s the go-with-flow type. I didn’t want to insult someone just for the sake of fitting into the crowd. 

After volunteering, I decided to go out for drinks with some of the women - again, just to make a good impression (and who knows, maybe make some work friends). Welp, I’m starting to think I’m just naive. We went to a bar and met up with some other Co-workers who had been drinking already. Everyone was nice enough, but for the most part, they shut me out of the convo. So there I was standing, drink in hand, wondering why the fuck I was out with these people. Oh right, “networking.” 

And please, please understand I made a strong effort to get to know these women. But anytime I mentioned anything personal (like how I too met my GF on a dating site) just to relate to them, I was brushed off. I hate to say this but I definitely got along way better with the guys. We just made jokes and talked about career goals/job hunting nightmares. 

It just felt like a clique mentality, and I’ve never been very adept at being “popular.”

And coming to work today, I just felt very aware of how different I am. I keep telling myself to focus on the work and my ambitions, but I feel insecure about not liking my coworkers. I don’t want to say that they’re mean, but they’re definitely not as kind or open-minded as I had hoped. And maybe that’s my own naïveté? 

Sigh - this is so long. If anyone reads this, I do desperately want to shake these bad feelings.

TL;DR! Landed the position of my dreams with an amazing company, but am feeling insecure about the clique mentality. "
83zyul,3,2018-03-12,"I [20 M] have some unresolved problems with my gf [20 F] of 2.5 years, and I don't have any energy left",psycholatte,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/83zyul/i_20_m_have_some_unresolved_problems_with_my_gf/,"We've been in a relationship for more than 2 years now. Same college, different departments. We had ups and downs, but I feel like I'm at my limit.

I have my faults, for sure. I don't usually give her enough attention, and I can ruin good moments with words. I try to improve myself, to get better but my progress is slow. And lately, we're fighting over minor stuff daily. I never start them, and I wonder how she can find so many stuff to argue about.

So something happened recently, that killed most of my feelings for her, but I guess I'm attached to our memories together and the closeness we have; that's why I can't let go. 

Anyways, there's the story:
My cousins live in USA, and it's much like the other end of the world for us (16h flight time). I've only been there once, but I love hanging out with them and we usually chat online. So one of them was going to marry his girlfriend, who I like a lot, and my father got me a plane ticket for the wedding. I was so happy that I'd see them again, plus be there on such an important day. It was during school time, so I'd be there for just a week. Well, guess what, my gf didn't take this well. She started a fight almost every week. She'd say stuff like how traveling together was too important for her, that she wanted to go to USA with me, and I was cheating on her for betraying her feelings etc. I told her, repeatedly, that it was for family, and I wouldn't go there with travel purposes without her. Then she started demanding me not to go any fun place in the US, or not to do anything interesting. I said I'd just hang out with my cousins, nothing special. 

Fast forward to the trip, they were very happy that I made it, and so was I. My younger cousin had to go to work everyday, and the newly married couple went on their honeymoon for 3 days, so I could only spend a limited time with them. But it was so much fun. We played games, smoked hookah, drank alcohol, watched TV shows etc. I had the best time of my life!....
I wish I could say that, but sadly, I couldn't enjoy much of it because someone would constantly text me, start a fight, try to call me on telegram multiple times, get mad when I don't answer because I'm hangin with my cousins or I have no connection, say things like ""You chose to go there. You chose not to have a proper internet connection and you didn't care about me at all"" and way worse stuff. She stayed up until I went to sleep, even though the 8 hour time difference, just to check on me. She even got mad because I posted a picture, then proceed to post pictures of her with guys she met a few days ago. 

After I returned, we somehow got things back on track, but as I said before, I don't feel like I did before. I mean if she doesn't respect me enough to give me some time with my family, how can I love her?

There's also a second major problem.
I'm studying astrospace engineering, and she studies computer engineering. We both want to leave the country, and move to somewhere in Europe, Canada, or USA. I have very high goals, and I'm really working hard. I'll probably apply for my master's degree in one of the fore-mentioned countries. I'll also try to get an internship in one of them this summer. She wants the same things too, and I tell her that we'll try to find some places suitable for both of us. But if that doesn't happen, and we somehow can't go the same country, then I'll go by myself and so should she. Because of that, she blames me for not wanting to build a future together and being obsessed with my career. I tell her that my future is important, and I can't base my relationship for the steps I'm taking right now. She then goes on like ""Why did you waste my time then? You knew my expectations""

So, I'm really losing my temper here. I want to focus on my studies and career, but most of my time is spent either fighting with her, or doing stuff together with her. I thought about breaking up, but something's stopping me from that. Maybe it's because she's so in my life (literally all my family and friends know her), or because she starts either blaming me or threatening to harm herself when I bring that subject up. Even if she doesn't do that, she somehow convinces me to keep going (or maybe I'm afraid of letting go) at the last minute.

Thanks for reading up until this point, I'm really at a loss now and feel like I'm stuck at a point. What do you suggest I should do? Is there any way to get better after this point, and if there isn't, how should I break up?

Also sorry if I made any mistakes, English is obviously not my first language.

tl;dr: I fight a lot in my 2.5 year long relationship, and about to go nuts. I'm also trying to advance in my career and improve myself, but she's more into ""building a life together"" and wants me to sacrifice stuff that's going to have a big effect on my future."

I am excruciatingly tired but my mind won't leave me alone with random irrational anxiety. I've been sweating on and off all day, but I welcome it as it is my body fixing itself back up. The night sweats are what get me though, I would wake up drenched and shivering every 2 hours or so of light sleep. 

I found that the cravings have subsided somewhat but they always seem to come back when I'm trying to get some shut eye. I exceeded just enough that I felt tired going to bed, but to no avail, here I am. 

Some good news: also got a call from a firm that they want to hire me as an intern. As a recent college graduate this is probably the best news I have heard this year, and the sudden burst of happiness and excitement gave me enough energy and motivation to continue on with chores and keeping myself generally preoccupied; drawing, playing my guitar, cleaning etc.

Nights are definitely the hardest, I'm too tired to distract myself but too anxious to fall asleep.   Hot showers help a lot (upon suggestion of another post on this subreddit) with the sweats and the chills. 

I'm excited for day 3. It's going to be shitty. But it's going to be worth it. Godspeed to you all out there trying to kick the habit, I have an immense respect for you guys and your personal stories; they fuel my resolve to continue to stay sober.

I'm starting a paid internship (through my University) in the next 3-8 weeks and will have my next payment from the University out of my Financial Aid in 8-12 weeks in addition to what I get in payments from a loan I gave to a family member that gets monthly repayment. So what I'm looking to do is take out the money now and then make monthly payments from now until July (I expect to have the financial aid based on previous years by mid-June but if they are slow and it slips into early July I will make an additional monthly payment beforehand in July )

8433h7,2,2018-03-13,I [21 AFAB] struggle to socialize at work because of my traumatic past.,awkwardsteg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8433h7/i_21_afab_struggle_to_socialize_at_work_because/,"So for context, I've always struggled with groups since I'm very young, I've been heavily bullied when I was 10 until 12, and then I had lasting defenses (I was super agressive when someone was talking to me because I thought they'd want to make fun of me).   

I've thus had issues trusting people not only because of that, but also because of my father and mother-in-law who were very abusive to me and my brothers. 
I'm slowly recovering from my PTSD thanks to therapy, but I still struggle to integrate a group because I have this irrational fear that they already hate me (not because they're bad, but more because I'd have some kind of aura or I don't know that'd make them hate me).  

I'm okay with 1 to 1 interactions, and I think that I can handle them really well (I'm studying psychology, so that's a good start for my future job), but I don't know how to behave in a group.
I always feel like I'm not relevant in what I say or what I do, and even though it is explained by the fact that I have some autistic characteristics, I have some friends who also do and they fit really well in groups (so I want to learn how to do it myself too).  

I'm posting because I just begun an internship that I dreamed of, and I only gathered twice the courage to go and eat at the cafeteria, because I'd meet people there.
Also, yesterday a colleague knocked at my door to see how I was doing and it surprised me that he was nice...
So how do I start ? What can I do to better fit in the team ?

**tl;dr**: struggle to make friends since I'm a child, due to traumatic events, what can I do to learn and integrate the team at my internship ?"
8447qv,10,2018-03-13,Thoughts on a CMBYN sequel after re-watching Brokeback Mountain,M0506,callmebyyourname,https://www.reddit.com/r/callmebyyourname/comments/8447qv/thoughts_on_a_cmbyn_sequel_after_rewatching/,"Last night I rewatched Brokeback Mountain for the first time in three or four years. Seeing as Jack and Ennis also have a summer romance that ends, and seeing as CMBYN may be getting a sequel, I couldn't help but watch it with an eye to what I hope Elio and Oliver avoid.

Ennis and Jack don't see each other for four years after their summer together, and by the time they reunite, they're both married with children. Their relationship gets stuck in a state of suspended animation because while Jack wants them to split up from their wives and live a ""real sweet life"" together with their own ""cow-and-calf operation,"" Ennis thinks it's impossible. So they end up seeing each other a few times a year and trying to recreate their summer together for a week at a time when they can, despite the fact that they're older and their lives have gotten increasingly complicated.

Luca's indicated that the sequel screenplay takes place largely in America. I'm glad, because just as Ennis and Jack couldn't really hang on to their first summer on Brokeback Mountain, Elio and Oliver can't always have the summer of 1983, somewhere in northern Italy. We don't know if Elio and Oliver actually get back together in the sequel, but if they do, the geographical change hopefully indicates that they're not trying to recreate exactly what they had. And I think that's good. I don't want them to be Jack and Ennis. Elio can't be a precocious teenager forever, lounging around waiting for summer to end. Oliver can't have a perpetual internship in Italy away from his day-to-day life.

I know there are people who don't want a CMBYN sequel because part of the allure of CMBYN was the specific time, the specific place, the specific summer and everything that happened. But honestly, I'm okay with Elio and Oliver moving past that, as long as they really do move past that. I'm with Jack Twist; quiet domesticity can be a ""real sweet life,"" even if the initial thrill of first falling in love has developed into something less heady and more stable.

If Elio and Oliver get back together, I want them to deal with the complications of each other's lives that have developed in the years since they fell in love, instead of trying to escape from those complications. I don't know what those complications may be, because we don't know how much the sequel is going to take from the book and if Oliver really did get married or have any kids, and we don't know what Elio may have been doing since last we saw him. But please, please, Luca Guadagnino and whoever else is involved in crafting the story of the sequel, don't let them end up trying to recreate exactly what they had like Jack and Ennis trying to recreate their summer on Brokeback Mountain."
8448v7,1,2018-03-13,Investments during Internship out of State,KingJades,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8448v7/investments_during_internship_out_of_state/,"I currently live in PA. I have a tax free Municipal Bond Fund (FPXTX), which produces income that is PA State Tax free. 

I also have stock in a company that I'm looking to sell soon. 

For approximately 6 months, I will be doing an internship in Washington, DC.  After the internship, I'll likely be moving to TX, FL, or GA.

Questions:
1) I'm assuming that my monthly bond income during the internship period would be taxed as DC income, for which the bond fund is not tax-exempt? 

2) Given that I plan on moving around a bit, and the earnings from the bond fund wouldn't be tax exempt in my final locations of FL, TX or GA, might it make sense to sell my shares in the fund? It currently shows that I have capital losses, which could be used to offet the gains from Question 3.

3) Does it matter whether I sell the stock before or after temporarily moving for the internship?

Thank you!

You can get information from people manning the booths.
Meeting people happens when you just strike up a conversation. Clubs are a great place, so are your classes.

I am writing to apply for the Electrical Engineering Internship and to share how my skills and
experience make me a strong candidate for this role. I am pursing a Bachelors Degree in Computer
Engineering with a Minor in Physics. My interest in IoT devices reaches beyond my education as I
have spent the past few years learning about them in my personal time. For these reasons, I was
very excited to read the job posting on your career site.

A personal project that I have worked on is a Homekit enabled Raspberry Pi that was capable of
controlling a lamp. Using Python to control the GPIO pins and a relay, I was able to create a safe
circuit that controlled a mains voltage device. The addition of Homekit allowed for voice control of
any device I had connected to the relay. Another relevant project is a thermostat made with
Arduino. Using the dht11 sensor I was able to output temperature and humidity data to an I2C
display. A script uploaded to the microcontroller allowed for automatic control of a relay and in turn, an AC fan. All of this combined
gave me a way to control the temperature of my room. The labs I have done in my two years at
school have further solidified my knowledge of building circuits and doing real world testing with
common lab equipment.

I hope my enthusiasm for this position translates well in this letter because my passion for this
type of work helps me to be a quick and eager learner. Thank you for your time and consideration."

846f5l,1,2018-03-13,Boyfriend (21M) of about a year broke up with me (25F) yesterday out of the blue. How do I begin to cope and avoid spiraling into depression and loneliness? How do I get closure from this?,MovingOn1234311,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/846f5l/boyfriend_21m_of_about_a_year_broke_up_with_me/,"Background Info: Last year, my ex-boyfriend and I met from an online video game and we became very close in a short amount of time. As luck would have it, we found out we lived relatively close to each other, met up irl and immediately began dating. I fell in love him with him quickly. I was his first grown-up relationship and the person he lost his virginity to. Basically, I was his first for many things. 

During this past year, we had some hiccups. We briefly broke up early in our relationship (last summer) because he was starting university again, his major is stressful, and he didn’t know if he could handle a relationship during it. I was hurt, but willing to give it a shot and managed to convince him to try. By late October/November, he tells me he’s in love with me. However, in December and early January, we began arguing a lot over little and big things (politics, my body insecurities, etc) and because of having tons of miscommunication issues, we nearly break up. We end up talking it over, and resolved this with a promise to discuss our problems as soon as they start - big or small - instead of letting them build up inside. We also promised to always be honest with one another about our feelings, bad or good. We’ve had our differences, but we’ve barely argued since then and it’s been smooth sailing ever since. 

Fast forward to Valentine’s Day and we had an absolutely amazing time together. I’ve never loved him more and I felt like we could really grow as a couple and saw us together in the future. We’ve talked future plans before after we graduate (we are both students) and little fantasy scenarios of living together. I thought everything was peachy. 

Now while helping him clothes shop for an internship interview with his father this past Sunday, we find out he’s allowed to bring me to his aunt’s spring wedding. I’m excited to meet his dad’s side of the family and keep babbling about dress shopping. All seems completely normal. But while discussing meeting his dad’s family Monday night and if he truly wants me there, he first tells me he’s actually indifferent and doesn’t care about that side of the family much (which I find hard to believe because he’s big on family) and suddenly comes to a realization that he doesn’t love me anymore during that convo. In his words, he’s been lying to himself that he has. No real rhyme or reason. An hour before this, he did say he loved me.

I feel like I have zero closure. I’m torn and confused. We met up to talk and all I’ve gotten out of him is he wants to focus on himself, there’s no other girls and he’s not looking for another relationship, he’s moving on, he lied to himself about loving me, he doesn’t see me in his future and gave no reason as to why, and secretly didn’t like when we’d casually talk about it. Yet we promised to talk issues out first and he hit me outta left field with this stuff. He then confirms he definitely is still attracted to me, thinks I’m an amazing person, yet only realized he truly didn’t love me that night. All in a matter of a day, completely spontaneous from my perspective. For crying out loud, he even  surprised me with roses this weekend. 

What can I make out of this? How can I better understand where he is coming from? How can I accept this and move on? I took the day off work and I’ve been crying every 30 minutes. I don’t want to cut contact from him. I still love him. Everything reminds me of him. We talked every day, a lot, and now I feel like there’s just this gap inside me and in my life. I know a year is a short time in the grand scheme of things, but it was a really deep relationship for me. 

**TL;DR:** Although not perfect, ex-boyfriend and I had a happy relationship with many good memories. When our relationship starts advancing, in one night, he decides he never truly loved me and can’t fully explain why. I don’t know how to handle a spontaneous break-up and I’m afraid I’ll end up depressed. How do I make sense of his feelings, this breakup, get closure and keep moving on, healthily?

847538,7,2018-03-13,Questions regarding UCMerced,UhOhSpaghettiNoes,ucmerced,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/847538/questions_regarding_ucmerced/,"Hello! I have been accepted to UCM for Computer Science and Engineering! I have a few questions to help me decide whether or not Merced is for me. For reference, I visited the campus last spring, and was able to visit a few classes, and i have been admitted to Cal Poly Pomona and CSU Fullerton for Civil Engineering.

1) I have been doing career research and I have been thinking whether or not I might enjoy something like mechanical engineering. How might I be able to figure out whether I like mechanical engineering over computer science? I'm wondering: Is Merced easy to transfer between engineering majors? I don't want to get stuck doing Comp Sci when I might hate it. For reference, I have mechanical engineering experience (Lead mechanical for robotics at my school's robotics team for two years, and did a lot of the machining for the robot). I have minimal experience with CAD, but I was able to pick up the ropes fairly quickly. On the other hand, I know comp sci is a more lucrative career-wise. I have an internship I just picked up that might have me do some web and app development, but I have had no prior experience coding. 

2) How is the social scene at Merced? How easy is it to make friends at Merced? The other schools I have been accepted to(CSUF, CPP) are to be known as socially dead. I don't know if I can deal with that. In spite of the engineering student stereotype, I know for sure I need to have a social life. 

3) How is the engineering school at Merced, and how has it helped you career-wise(getting internships, research opps)? I know how competitive the job market is nowadays, but Merced seems like a great place to stand out in. I hear about the many research* opportunities, but I'm curious about the recruiting. Are there good career fairs? Are there good industry connections? 

4) Why Merced over other schools? I'm aware of the financial benefits of Merced- the surrounding area is dirt cheap to live in. I'm getting a good deal on tuition as is, so at this point it boils down on what Merced offers over another school.

I actually wouldn't mind living in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a good way to focus on studies, but I'm a bit concerned about what you can actually do around Merced.

Antwoord van staatssecretaris Snel &amp;#40;Financiën&amp;#41; &amp;#40;ontvangen 13 maart 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
Deelt u de mening uit het pleidooi van belastingdeskundigen Spanjers, Van  
der Streek, Stevens en Vleggeert dat publicatie van belastingafspraken  
&amp;#40;rulings&amp;#41; met multinationals nodig is om de geheimzinnigheid hieromtrent  
weg te nemen? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?[1]  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
Erkent u dat het ophelderen of rulings wel en niet binnen bewoordingen,  
doel en strekking van wet en internationale rechtsorde passen enkel kan  
worden opgelost met óf het openbaar maken van de afspraken óf het geheel  
stilleggen van deze praktijk? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 1 en 7  
In OESO-verband en in EU-verband wordt tussen Belastingdiensten informatie  
uitgewisseld over rulings met een internationaal karakter. Daarnaast dienen  
ondernemingen informatie in hun groepsdossier en lokaal dossier op te nemen  
omtrent zekerheid vooraf met betrekking tot verrekenprijzen. Tevens kunnen  
Belastingdiensten een verzoek om nadere informatie indienen. De relevante  
Belastingdiensten zijn derhalve op de hoogte van de ruling. Nederland  
voldoet daarmee aan de uitwisseling van informatie over rulings zoals  
internationaal is afgesproken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In verband met artikel 67 van de Algemene Wet inzake Rijksbelastingen  
kunnen individuele rulings niet publiek gemaakt worden. Wel worden in  
beleidsbesluiten de algemene kaders gepubliceerd. In 2017 is daarnaast een  
notitie over de APA/ATR-praktijk gepubliceerd, daarbij zijn ook  
exemplarische voorbeelden van veel voorkomende APA’s[2] en ATR’s[3]  
gepubliceerd[4] welke een goede weergave zijn van de rulings die in de  
praktijk worden afgesloten. In het jaarverslag APA-/ATR-team wordt tevens  
nader ingegaan op de zekerheid vooraf doormiddel van APA’s en ATR’s.[5] Ook  
de door mij aangekondigde verdere vorm van centrale coördinatie van rulings  
met een internationaal karakter moet door de beter voorhanden zijnde  
bestuurlijke informatie bijdragen aan de gewenste transparantie.[6] De  
Europese Gedragscodegroep beveelt in haar richtsnoeren aan om rulings met  
horizontale toepassing te publiceren of, indien dit niet kan vanwege de  
geheimhoudingsplicht van de Belastingdienst, de algemene conclusies uit  
rulings te publiceren. Door middel van de hierboven opgesomde publicaties  
over de Nederlandse rulingpraktijk worden de algemene uitgangspunten in  
rulings gepubliceerd en wordt zodoende aan deze transparantieaanbeveling  
tegemoet gekomen. Om deze zienswijze te bevestigen heb ik de onafhankelijke  
commissie die onderzoek doet naar APA’s en ATR’s gevraagd te beoordelen of  
volgens haar de gepubliceerde stukken over de APA/ATR-praktijk een  
voldoende transparant beeld geven van de APA’s en ATR’s zoals ze worden  
afgegeven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Tenslotte zijn er verschillende onderzoeken die de praktijk controleren. Zo  
heeft er recent een procedureel onderzoek naar rulings met een  
internationaal karakter plaatsgevonden waarvan de uitkomsten in mijn brief  
van 18 februari jl. bekend zijn gemaakt.[7] Ook loopt er op dit moment een  
inhoudelijk onderzoek door de reeds genoemde onafhankelijke commissie met  
externe experts naar rulings afgegeven door het APA-/ATR-team. De Algemene  
Rekenkamer is gevraagd om volgend jaar een onderzoek te doen naar de  
rulingpraktijk.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kortom, de afgeronde, lopende en nog uit te voeren onderzoeken rapporteren  
over de juistheid op het gebied van procedures en inhoud van rulings. De  
publicaties zoals de beleidsbesluiten en exemplarische APA’s en ATR’s geven  
verdere transparantie over de rulings in de praktijk. De transparantie  
richting buitenlandse belastingdiensten is gewaarborgd door de uitwisseling  
van informatie over rulings. Dit alles tezamen geeft een goed inzicht in de  
afspraken die worden gemaakt door middel van rulings. Het publiceren van  
individuele afspraken heeft in dit verband een beperkte toegevoegde waarde.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Gaat u in uw toegezegde brief over de aanpak van belastingontwijking ook in  
op de richtsnoeren die de Europese Gedragscodegroep ten aanzien van het  
afgeven van rulings heeft opgesteld en de mate waarin Nederland aan deze  
richtsnoeren gaat voldoen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
Erkent u dat de richtsnoeren van de Europese Gedragscodegroep niet  
vrijblijvend zijn? Wanneer gaat Nederland aan álle onderdelen voldoen? Kunt  
u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 2 en 3  
In mijn brief van 18 februari 2018 ben ik ingegaan op deze richtsnoeren.  
Bijlage II bij die brief geeft een samenvatting van een intern onderzoek  
naar de vraag in hoeverre de afgifte van rulings in lijn is met de Europese  
richtsnoeren betreffende de voorwaarden en regels voor het afgeven van  
belastingrulings.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De richtsnoeren van de Europese Gedragscodegroep zijn aan te merken als  
‘soft law’. Deze aanbevelingen zijn niet direct afdwingbaar. Rulings die  
door het APA/ATR-team worden afgegeven zijn in lijn met de Europese  
aanbevelingen. Voor de rulings die niet door het APA/ATR-team worden  
gesloten zijn de huidige procedurele voorschriften nog niet op alle  
aspecten in lijn met de aanbevelingen. Ik ben van mening dat de procedurele  
voorschriften voor rulings met een internationaal karakter die niet door  
het APA/ATR-team worden afgegeven ook moeten gaan voldoen aan de  
aanbevelingen. Mijn doel is dat dit per 1 januari 2019 geregeld is. Anders  
dan bij de uitwisseling van informatie over rulings op grond van de  
zogenoemde DAC3-richtlijn, beveelt de EU-Gedragscodegroep aan om aan deze  
aanbevelingen ook gevolg te geven bij nationale rulings. Aangezien het soft  
law betreft, het risico op internationale belastingontwijking bij deze  
categorie rulings zeer klein is en de gevolgen voor de uitvoering groot  
zijn, geef ik daar op dit moment geen prioriteit aan. In dit verband  
verwijs ik u naar mijn brief van 18 februari 2018.[8]  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Kunt u uitleggen hoe het besluit uit 2016 dat bepaalt dat  
belastinginspecteurs niet meer mogen ingaan op verzoeken van bedrijven om  
vooroverleg als belastingbesparing het hoofddoel is, in de praktijk heeft  
uitgepakt? Worden bepaalde rulings sinds dit besluit niet meer verstrekt?  
Zo ja, welke?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 4  
Het uitgangspunt dat de inspecteur niet hoeft in te gaan op een verzoek om  
vooroverleg indien belastingbesparing de enige dan wel de doorslaggevende  
beweegreden is voor het verrichten van een rechtshandeling is niet nieuw.  
Dit was ook al opgenomen in de voorlopers van genoemd Besluit Fiscaal  
Bestuursrecht. In de praktijk wordt daar, in lijn met de Europese  
jurisprudentie, een zodanige uitleg aangegeven dat er geen vooroverleg  
wordt aangegaan indien er geen economische betekenis aanwezig is voor de  
rechtshandeling. Dit toetsingskader wordt toegepast op een specifiek  
feitencomplex en is afhankelijk van de specifieke feiten en omstandigheden  
van het individuele geval. Het toetsingskader ziet derhalve niet op een  
bepaald type ruling. Voor rulings afgegeven door het APA/ATR-team wordt  
sinds 1 januari 2017 systematisch bijgehouden waarom een ruling niet tot  
stand is gekomen, op pagina 21 van het jaarverslag van het APA/ATR-team  
zijn deze afwijzingsgronden gegeven.[9]  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
Is bij de afspraak dat belastinginspecteurs niet meer mogen ingaan op  
verzoeken die te kenmerken zijn als agressieve belastingplanning ook  
meegenomen dat ambtenaren van de Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency  
&amp;#40;NFIA&amp;#41; zich hier aan houden? [10]  
   
Antwoord vraag 5  
De uitvoering van de belastingheffing en zekerheid vooraf behoort  
uitsluitend tot de bevoegdheid van de Belastingdienst. Medewerkers van de  
Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency &amp;#40;NFIA&amp;#41; geven slechts in algemene  
bewoordingen voorlichting over het Nederlands belastingstelsel. Zij kunnen  
derhalve per definitie niet ingaan op verzoeken van belastingplichtigen om  
zekerheid vooraf. Wanneer medewerkers van de NFIA in hun contacten met  
bedrijven ervaren dat er vanuit de zijde van bedrijven behoefte bestaat aan  
het verkrijgen van zekerheid vooraf, zullen zij dit bedrijf erop wijzen dat  
dit slechts door de Belastingdienst kan worden verstrekt en -desgewenst-  
het bedrijf met de Belastingdienst in contact brengen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Hoe wordt in de rulingpraktijk omgegaan met het feit dat per 2020 de  
commanditaire vennootschap &amp;#40;cv&amp;#41;/besloten vennootschap &amp;#40;bv&amp;#41;-structuur is  
geneutraliseerd? Worden rulings met deze structuur nog steeds verstrekt? Zo  
ja, in welke mate en wat gebeurt er in 2020 met deze rulings?  
   
Antwoord vraag 6  
De Belastingdienst verstrekt zekerheid vooraf binnen de kaders van wet,  
beleid en jurisprudentie. Daarbij wordt uitgegaan van de huidige van  
toepassing zijnde regelgeving. Dit zorgt er voor dat er geen verschil in  
behandeling ontstaat tussen situaties met en zonder zekerheid vooraf. In  
elke APA en ATR is een bepaling opgenomen dat deze komt te vervallen indien  
er sprake is van een relevante wetswijziging.[11]  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
Zijn de transferpricing regels in de praktijk voldoende duidelijk of  
bestaat hier niet altijd overeenstemming over? Hoe voorkomt u dat de  
Belastingdienst meegaat in een –voor de belastingplichtige- te gunstige  
interpretatie van de transferpricing-regels en dat hierdoor de Nederlandse  
of een buitenlandse schatkist wordt benadeeld? Kunt u uw antwoord  
toelichten?  
   
Antwoord vraag 8  
In artikel 8b van de Wet op de Vennootschapsbelasting 1969 is het  
internationaal algemeen aanvaarde arm’s-lengthbeginsel opgenomen. De OESO  
Richtlijnen voor verrekenprijzen voor multinationale ondernemingen en  
belastingdiensten geven een toelichting op de toepassing van het arm’s  
length beginsel. Zoals blijkt uit het verrekenprijsbesluit past de  
Nederlandse Belastingdienst deze richtlijnen van de OESO onverkort toe.  
[12] Dit geldt bij het regelen van een aanslag, een boekenonderzoek maar  
ook in de gevallen waarin zekerheid vooraf wordt gegeven. Daar waar de OESO  
Richtlijnen ruimte laten voor eigen interpretatie of waar sprake is van  
onduidelijkheid geeft het verrekenprijsbesluit een nadere invulling.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
Deelt u de mening dat de Nederlandse positie in de discussie over het  
komende meerjarig financieel kader &amp;#40;MFK&amp;#41; van de Europese Unie wordt  
ondergraven door ons rulingbeleid en dat het &amp;#40;geanonimiseerd&amp;#41; publiceren  
van de rulings onze positie zal verbeteren? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 9  
Nationale belastingafspraken – en/of de publicatie daarvan – hebben niets  
te maken met het meerjarig financieel kader. Ik ben zodoende van mening dat  
deze afspraken de Nederlandse positie en de Nederlandse inzet niet  
beïnvloeden.

We are seeing some similar faces on this week's top ten.

Janelle Monáe's 'Make Me Feel' continues this dominate as it stays at #1. Meghan Trainor's new single 'No Excuses' debuts at #2, making it this week's highest debut. Taylor Swift's 'Delicate' continues its big return to the top ten by charting at #3. Will the song reach #1 again next week with the release of the music video?

Kendrick and SZA stays at #4 with the lead single of the Black Panther soundtrack, 'All The Stars'. Drake's 'God's Plan' also remains at #5. Post Malone's collab with Ty Dolla $ign 'Psycho' charts at #6 on its second week. Zedd, Maren Morris and Grey's 'The Middle' charts at #7. 

'Tongue', which is MNEK's new single and not his actual tongue, debuts at #8. Marshmello and Anna-Marie returns to the top ten as 'Friends' charts at #9. Rae Sremmurd's new song with Juicy J 'Powerglide' debuts at #10. Is it weird that the individual members of Rae Sremmurd are credited as the main artists? [The Pussycat Dolls feat. Nicole Scherzinger teas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_Ho!_(You_Are_My_Destiny)

King of sad indie pop Sufjan Stevens returns to the Hot 50 chart as 'Mystery of Love' re-enters at #21, making it the highest re-entry of the week. Migos' infectious hit 'Stir Fry' gains 29 spots to #17. Unfortunately for the gays, Troye Sivan takes this week's biggest decline as My My My! loses 36 spots to #46. The straights win again.

* **Highest Debut:** #2. Meghan Trainor - No Excuses
* **Highest Re-Entry:** #21. Sufjan Stevens - Mystery of Love
* **Biggest Gain:** #17. Migos - Stir Fry (+29)
* **Biggest Decline:** #46. Troye Sivan - My My My! (-36)

##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs

'My Enemy', CHVRCHES' song with the lead singer of The National, Matt Berninger, gains 24 spots to #13. 

Janelle Monae's 'Django Jane' loses 22 spots to #24. It's good she got 'Make Me Feel' charting at the top this week.

Khalid and Normani's 'Love Lies' also loses 22 spots to #24. Will the song see itself increase next week with the release of Love, Simon where the soundtrack includes the song?

Dua Lipa's 'IDGAF' loses 21 spots to #37. So basically this song is not going to be that big of a hit here like New Rules.

In an interesting turn of events, ""Zara Larsson's"" 'Joyride' debuts at #39. Just to avoid confusion, it's not a real song from Zara Larsson.

It seems the release of the music video isn't doing that big of a help as Iggy Azalea's 'Savior' re-enters the chart only at #41.

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

847zs0,1,2018-03-13,I (23F) doesn't have family here and will be graduating uni soon. Should I still walk even though I have no one to cheer for me?,apartment101,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/847zs0/i_23f_doesnt_have_family_here_and_will_be/,"Hi! So I'll be graduating University in the US soon (in May) with a degree that I love and currently have a good internship with potential full-time opportunity. So life is good!

Earlier my group of friends (who will also be graduating) was talking about picking up caps and gowns and attend the Graduation Fair and picking up tickets and etc. You know the routine. And I just realized, I have no one to invite to my graduation ceremony.

My immediate family is living oversea, they said they wont be coming because they won't be able to get a week off to just fly over. My extended family are not close to me, so they have never attend anything important event in my life (I had a design show, no-one showed up even thought I personally dropped the invitations off, so i don't expect them to this time either). I'm dating but not seriously, so it'd be weird to invite him to attend my graduation. My friends are either graduating at the same time or won't be in town since it'll be their summer vacation already. I will not have anyone to be with after my ceremony.

Technically I'd still be able to walk with my friends, but afterwards, when their family and friends would be showering them with flowers and leis and pictures, I would be alone by myself. 

I'm debating if I should even walk. I feel like it's a waste of money, just to feel lonely afterwards. My friends want me to walk with them, but they'll be with their family afterwards.

I really don't know what to do. I want to walk and be in the ceremony, I worked hard for this, but I don't want to be reminded that I am alone with no family.

TL;DR: Family won't be there for my graduation. Should I still walk?

All advice is welcome! 

Title:
I Work as an Intern for the Company that Kidnapped My Parents.

Or at least, that's what I believe happened, anyway. My parents are Joseph and Maria Thompson, and they have been missing for 9 months. They were both scientists, graduated top of their class together, and have been making discoveries together ever since. Amid a breakthrough involving a new type of MRI technology my mother gave birth to me. She wrote her thesis in maternity clothes, that's the reason why my dad married her. Never let anything stop her from doing what she set her mind to. I am.... not quite the prodigy that my parents were. By the age of 18 my father had a bachelor's degree. I was still in high school. Funny how that works out. Of course, they never saw anything wrong with that, but I digress. 

Two years ago, my parents started working for CycloneTech Innovative Industries. CycloneTech was supposedly some center for the improvement of human lives and the innovation of science or some crap, but I didn't pay too much attention. After 2 Nobel Peace Prizes, you kinda just let their overwhelming success go over your head. They got the job from some guy at one of their ""great unveilings"" who talked about all the great opportunities that they would have working for their company. With a huge company backing them, they were set. So was I. And so, when they didn't come home, nor answer their phones for 3 days I started to be concerned. I had known a guy in the reception area, Dave, and so the first thing I did was call CycloneTech to ask questions. 

""We are sorry, there's no one working here under that name.""

I heard that excuse so many times I was saying it under my breath. *No one working there by that name*. I contacted the police, their trail stopped dead after receiving the same bull crap I got. A detective was working with me for a while, but eventually I told him to just give up. I know who has them. And so, I sent a job application. 

On the day of my orientation, I was of course as suspicious as you would expect. I carefully checked everything in the waiting room that I had been sat in, along with the other 2 interns they had just hired. The room was like a hospital waiting room. The colors were bland, eggshell white walls, gray chairs with cushions that were made from that fabric that isn't too unlike carpet. The only real splash of color that the room had was the company's logo spread out along the floor, a large gray ""C"" formed by the edges of a hexagon, against a painfully yellow background. There was a window on the opposite wall from me that separated the receptionist's desk from the rest of the room, where I could see a woman in her 40's chewing gum. Her blonde hair was done up into a bun, and she twiddled a pen between her fingers. She had given me some papers to fill out, barely paying attention to me as she did so. It was just a contract stating that I couldn't describe what I saw here to people outside, upholding company standards, etc. The liability waiver caught me off guard, but I figured it was just because of the experimental nature of the place. I signed it Daniel Davis, the alias I was using staring at me from the dotted line, reminding me of why I was here in the first place. When I finished filling out the paper I looked around the room at the other interns that were joining with me. 

First, I noticed the girl sitting across from me. Brunette, hair pulled back into a ponytail, eyes a deep emerald green, hiding behind a pair of thick framed glasses. She looked to be in her early 20s, my own age, with a slender frame, and olive skin. I wondered how the hell I could have missed her, she was the kind of person that could draw attention from the room. Locks of her hair fell in front of her face as she tapped the end of her pen against her cheek, clearly thinking about whatever form she was presently filling out. She must have felt me staring, as she began to peek up from her forms. Embarrassed, I quickly shifted my gaze to the other intern. He was an older gentleman, probably in his early 40s, with a soft face. He had short, brown hair and the slightest 5 o'clock shadow that accentuated his sharp jawline. I was intrigued to see a man his age working as an intern, but I guess the $18 an hour pay must look pretty appetizing to anyone. 

""Hey, can I borrow your pen? It looks like mine must have run out of ink."" A female voice asked. It was a soft, friendly tone. I shifted my gaze to the source, to see the female intern looking at me. *Oh god,* I thought. I hadn't really had much contact with humanity after my parents disappeared, let alone a member of the fairer sex. I guess 9 months of nothing but brooding behind a computer screen and occasionally doing online classes can deal a hit to your social skills.

""Uhhhhhh.... My pen?"" I stammered.

""Yes, your pen. I mean, if it's too much trouble I can just ask the guy over there, but he looks like he's having a hard-enough time as is."" She stated. I looked over at the gentleman, who looked very concerned at whatever was on the clipboard in his lap. I assumed he probably was reading the waiver or something. ""Yeah, sure."" I reached over and gave her my pen. 

""Not much of a talker, eh?"" She asked.

""I uh, I kind of am I guess."" I stammered. She laughed. ""Well, my name is Sophie. Pleasure to make your acquaintance. And you are?"" My real name is Lucas. But of course, she didn't need to know that. ""Daniel. But my friends call me Danny."" I stated. ""Fair enough. So, Danny, what brings you to this job?"" She questioned. I told her some BS story about how I had been working toward a degree in astrophysics and this job just *happened* to show up. She told me she was a chemistry major and had sought out this facility specifically. She was motivated, to the point where she was convincing me that *I* should be pursuing my career here. Of course, I had a different mission all together, but the thought was still there. We talked for about 15 minutes, as I slowly got to know this girl and she slowly got to know the man I was pretending to be. I didn't lie about everything, just most important things. We learned the other intern's name was Douglas, and he had just recently gone back to university for biochemistry. His wife stayed home with the kids, they inherited the house and car from his parents, so they didn't need much. He was reserved, but kind enough that we could make conversation. Douglas was just finishing his story when the door to our room opened. Standing in the doorway was an older man, in a pristine white lab coat and safety goggles. He cleared his throat, and raised his head, the wisps of hair left on his head shifting as he did so. 

""Interns?"" He raised an eyebrow. ""Please hand the receptionist your completed papers, and then follow me."" He stated. There was a certain authority in his voice, the kind that demanded action. We complied and followed him down the hall. He led us to a set of offices, identical in size and shape, four in a row. ""These will be your offices. We have placed your nameplates in them already, so please make yourself at home. We have left you some instructions on the desk, please follow them. I will return shortly to check your progress."" He rasped. He gave us the slightest of smiles, and turned down the hallway, away from where we came. We scouted out the offices, Doug's was in the front, Sophie's in the middle, and mine was in the back. Doug said goodbye, wished us luck, and retreated to his office, leaving Sophie and I alone in the hallway.

""We get our own offices? As interns? Awesome!"" She exclaimed. 

""Hell yeah!"" I said ecstatically. We parted ways, holding eye contact maybe a little *too* long for two random interns, and went to our respective offices. The walls were beige, with brown trim. It was about the size of an average cubicle, but it had its own door and window, complete with blinds. I would later ponder why the door was solid steel, but at the time I was too distracted by the events of the day to notice. I had my own wardrobe for my coat, a chest for personal belongings, and a sturdy oak desk, with a state of the art computer. I got to work quickly on the assignment on my desk, just simple stuff like creating an account and familiarizing myself with the system. When the man who led us here came back, he commented on our progress, and simply wandered off. The rest of the day was pretty much just that. Boring desk work and an occasional ""You're doing well!"" from a staff member. That is of course, until Sophie leaned into my office and handed me a piece of paper.

""Hey, since the company messaging system records all of what we say, I figured I'd give you this, so we can keep in contact and maybe help each other out?"" She stated. I took the paper and unfolded it, revealing the cell phone number nestled inside. *Hell. Yes.* I thought. When I heard her give the same speech to Doug, my confidence fell a little, but I wasn't fazed too much. I had a job to do.

The next few days consisted of boring desk work, getting to know Sophie and Doug (mainly Sophie, sorry Doug), and learning about the company. I decided I had better just go along with the intern work for a while before doing any snooping around for information about my parents, to avoid suspicion. I learned that Sophie lives by herself a couple of blocks away from my house, which was awesome to hear. Doug worked as a mechanic for 10 years in a little shop he used to own. Never asked him what happened to it. I also learned that CycloneTech has been around for a mere 4 years, and has revolutionized the medical industry, as well as catapulting scientific research to a whole new level. Most of their discoveries were involving cures to odd and foreign diseases, new chemicals that I still can't pronounce, etc. Overall a successful company I suppose. Aside from the parent stealing, of course. 

2 months later, I finally devised a way to dig for files without interruption. My superior, who we were required to call our ""mentor"", was the old guy from before. His name was George Blackwell, and he wasn't much of a talker. He was nice though, he never yelled or anything. Maybe I just met my quota, I don't know. Either way, after the millionth ""status check"" in his office, I had finally watched him put in his password enough to have it memorized. **ATLA5pr675** I realized I was too closely monitored during the day to have any chance at getting to any hidden files fairly quickly, which led to me observing the routes of the security guards. I learned an interesting bit of information. At about 11:00 every night, the security guards make their last rounds and then **leave the building entirely.** A more perfect opportunity could not have presented itself. 

At first it was nerve wracking. The prospect of getting caught terrified me, but I pressed on nonetheless. The first few nights I would just sleep in my office, claiming that I had accidentally fell asleep the night before. Sophie said she ""had my back"" and ""wouldn't let me sleep in a shitty office chair all night."" And that was the end of that. I began leaving an unmonitored first-floor window open that, to my surprise, had no alarm. I would leave with Sophie, and then once I made it to my house, double back to the facility. I would claim that I forgot something, stay until the guard left, and around 1 or 2am I would leave through the open window. I hadn't been able to find much, that is, until just two days ago. I found an employee record. I hadn't had the chance to look inside yet, but this had to have a connection. Last modified date? 1 year ago. My parents would still be working at that time. So, I spent the next day preparing everything I needed, creating shortcuts, double checking the window, and making sure Sophie and Doug wouldn't be interrupting anything. I decided to stay on the night that Sophie would be working late with her administrator on a project, that way I could feign leaving before her. Everything was ready. I was about to finally figure out something about what this place did to my parents.

The dull glow of my computer monitor illuminated my office. I had just crawled out from underneath the desk it sat upon, taking care not to bump my head on the rollout keyboard underneath. As I heard the last few footsteps heralding the end of the night guard's rounds, followed by the final slam of the front door, I set to work. The lights of business hours from the hallway were long gone, now the only thing piercing through the slits between the blinds on my wire-laced window was the reddish-orange light from the exit sign hanging only a few feet down the hallway outside. I straightened the back on my leather swivel chair and put my hands to the keyboard. ""Tonight."" I thought to myself. ""Tonight, I am going to get to the bottom of all this."" I paused the music I had been listening to, ""Welcome to the Jungle"" by Guns N' Roses and opened up the file explorer. I clicked on the shortcut that I had left in the Documents folder, passing several firewalls to reach the directory I had tried so hard to find. Apparently one password from my administrator was all that I needed to get inside. Neat. I scanned the names, finding the J's and my heart skipped a beat. Joseph Thompson. My father. I hovered my mouse over the file, heart racing, and attempted to open it. Password protected. I typed in my administrator's password, but it didn't work. Shit. I racked my brain trying to think of what I could possibly do to figure out how to get into this file when the silence was broken by something in the hallway. 

Crying. The sound of a woman crying. It felt familiar somehow, like I recognized the voice. This crying... this wasn't the sound of just someone sad. This was far deeper. This was the sound of the gross, slobbery wailing of someone who just lost something important. I would know, I was the one making those sounds for a long, long time. As I listened closer, something finally clicked, and I recognized the soft, feminine sobs in between. Sophie. Sophie, the girl I had been flirting with, that I had become very fond of, was bawling her eyes out in the hallway. At 11:20. My 'hero' instincts took over, and I flung the door open, to find her kneeling to the side of the hallway, bawling. I ran over to check on her. ""Sophie? What's wrong? Are you okay?"" I asked. Her crying slowed. She turned her head up to say something to me but stopped in her tracks. A noise pierced the quiet, echoing down the hall.

*Scraaaaaaape. Scraaaaaaape. Scraaaaaape.*

 The sound of something sharp or metallic being dragged across tile. Almost like... claws? I used to have a pet Iguana, and I was reminded of the sound he would make skittering across the bathroom floor. Sophie's face immediately turned to one of sheer terror as the bawling began again. ""What is that?"" I asked frantically. ""Sophie, what the hell is that??""

""We.... we have to run... It... It killed him, Danny. It killed him.""

""What the hell are you talking about!? Killed who!?"" I yelled. I didn't get an answer. Instead, I saw the shadow of a figure slowly turn the corner of the hallway. The hallway had only the exit sign's dim glow to illuminate the area, and the reddish tint just added another layer of uneasiness to the situation. I squinted and was able to see this figure through the gloom, coming from the hallway to the right. It stood at about 8 feet tall, but I couldn't make out any of the other features from this distance. I grabbed Sophie's hand, and immediately pulled her into my office, shutting the door and locking it. I motioned her to crawl under my desk and she obliged. I pondered what to do for a moment, as the sound of its footsteps slowly made their way closer. As I stood there, frozen in fear, my inner scientist tunneled its way out of my subconscious, and demanded I peek through the blinds, and examine what exactly we were up against.

This ""thing"" finally moved into view, and I was shocked I didn't just lose my lunch right there on the spot. It was a humanoid, but that's the only thing human about it. Its head was bulbous and swollen, narrowing down to its ""face” if you could even call it that.  It had two slits where it's eyes should be, no nose, and no mouth. Its neck was about as big around as a toilet paper roll, which connected to an emaciated torso. In the center of its chest sat a strange metal pyramid that appeared to have been fused into the flesh. Its arms went down to its knees, ending in 4 sharp claws, each dripping with some unknown fluid. Its legs were long and spindly, each ending in a birdlike talon. The skin was stretched over the skeleton like silly putty, giving it a skeletal and otherwise tormented look. Its face was fixated on the door to my office, as it slowly and methodically made its way to the door. It reminded me of a cat, slowly stalking its prey. I shivered. Eventually my short burst of bravery finally ran out, and rationality set in. *What the hell are you doing? What are you going to do, balance its checkbook? You're basically an accountant!* I said to myself. I backed away from the window and swore under my breath. I looked back at Sophie, who was trembling under the desk, and whispered ""What in the fuck is going on? What is that thing?""

""It's a long story. I'll tell you when-"" Her sentence was interrupted by the sound of claws scraping faster towards the door. We froze. I motioned for Sophie to stop talking, and I made the decision to peek through the blinds again. What I saw sent chills creeping up my spine. Its silhouette was just... standing there. Less than a foot in front of the door. Its head pointed at the ceiling, it's entire body was completely and absolutely stock still. I could have mistaken it for a statue had I not just seen it walking around. I stepped back, and mistakenly stepped right on the wheel of my chair. My body was sent toppling to the ground, and with it my chair went flying across the room. The crash was cacophonous, and I knew at that moment everything was going to shit.

The next moment was a blur. As I attempted to recover from the fall, the loudest noise I had ever heard exploded into the room. The door. The door was no longer attached to the fucking frame. This... *thing* had just blown the goddamn door off. With its bare hands. Er, claws I suppose. As it stumbled in, now illuminated by the computer monitor's light, I got a second look. It was hideous. And I mean hideous. The skin was gray and dull, like hewn stone. It was stretched and strained over the putrid frame, some parts appearing thin as tissue paper, and other parts flaked and chafed. The slits where it's eyes should be we're still shut tight, but that metal pyramid in its chest was starting to... glow. Its jaw began opening, despite the lack of a mouth. I soon saw why. The skin that had covered where its mouth would have been began splitting, making a sickening noise not quite unlike the tearing of wet paper. Strings of torn tissue hung down over it's now exposed mouth, which was home to **thousands** of tiny, rotating teeth. ***Rotating*** teeth. It made a sound somewhere between that weird pterodactyl screech that some people do to weird out their friends and a vacuum cleaner. It was inhaling air. 

It kept inhaling. Kept sucking in air as I stood there mortified. Its gut began to slowly become engorged with the copious amounts of air it was receiving, and before long it was beginning to look more like a grotesque gray balloon than a stomach. In a flash, I saw Sophie, bellowing out a war cry, as she charged it from under the desk brandishing a box cutter that I had dropped earlier that day (I was delivering supplies to another scientist). The resulting explosion was deafening. The glass to my window shattered, by some miracle my computer survived. Sophie was launched backwards into the wall, and I was knocked off my feet. I scrambled to my feet, ready to face it again, reaching for my own Swiss Army knife from my desk. To my relief, the thing was dead. Its body lay limp on the floor, and then began... dissolving. Its body bubbled and spat, releasing a putrid odor that reminded me of the roadkill we would pass in my dad's convertible on a hot summer day. It slowly bubbled down to nothing, leaving only the metal pyramid that once jutted from its chest. Steam rose from the object, so we made the decision to leave it where it was for the moment. We listened carefully to the open hallway, making sure the coast was clear, before discussing what just happened. 

""So, you mind telling me what the fuck that thing was? Or should I just figure it out on my own."" I snapped. I immediately felt bad. She didn't deserve me yelling at her, and she certainly didn't deserve whatever the hell happened with that thing.

""Fine. I'll tell you. But I'm return, I want to know what the hell you are doing here this late at night."" She retorted. 

Shit. 

I reluctantly agreed, and she began her story. 

To be continued...

848xft,2,2018-03-13,Different motivations for going outside primary relationship,n0-se1f-c0ntr0l,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/848xft/different_motivations_for_going_outside_primary/,"Hi. So a little b/g on our relationship my fiance and I have been together nearly two years engaged for around 6 months. I had been in an ""open"" relationship before, but it was very emotionally unhealthy, and basically the guy just wanted me to be his mommy and not also have to fuck me. He dumped me I got better an I feel better now.  Fast forward a year or so and I meet my fiance. As a part of our get-to-know me phase I told him about my experience with poly (it really wasn't poly but, I digress). He seems interested. A little while later I had an internship at an LGBT+ nonprofit that hosts the local polyamory discussion group. I wanted to look good for my internship so I attended a Poly 101 class an invited my fiance.  We discuss it, but now that I think back on it I didn't really want to go poly or open. We get busy it goes to the wayside.

Fast forward a little while, he meets a girl who he's interested in, we go on a date with all 3 of us, and we hit it off. We went on maybe 3 dates and then she was like, ""I don't think this is for me, but I enjoyed the time we spent together."" 

Now, he's been swiping on tinder and talking to people on okc. I originally thought he was just looking for friends to talk to, and I was alright with this. I know that I have a wider friend group and support system than he does, so I thought he was just trying to branch out. I did not know that the girls thought that he was in an actual open relationship. So last week he goes on a first-time-to-meet you thing, **he did not describe it as a date until after**. Well that broke my heart and I was really upset. I thought that we were on the same page on not dating.

 Anywho, we had several long talks, and I am in a better place with him seeing other girls. He still comes home to me and I am still the most important person in his life. Since then I posted on Fetlife to try to meet someone to experiment sexually with. I am not looking for anything beyond friendship and sexploration. Whereas it seems to me that he is looking for extra companionship/feelings.

Anyway, down to the actual question, so, if we are basically looking for two different things outside the relationship are there specifics that we should discuss, fundamental things that we may have missed?"
849dtd,3,2018-03-13,To move out or not. Help.,sw4gZaddy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/849dtd/to_move_out_or_not_help/,"My partner [M/21] and I [F/21] recently moved into a condo. We got a loan from his mom and we pay our mortgage monthly. We were super excited going into this but at this point I personally feel like we rushed it. He and his father weren’t on good terms and basically forced him to move out. I agreed because I wanted to help my partner out. My name is not on any of the official papers, but I payed for everything fifty-fifty with him since we moved in. I payed for the washer, he paid for the dryer. We split the bills: he pays the electricity and I pay the internet and his phone bill. They come up to about the same price monthly. I know that if I move out he does not legally have to pay me, but he told me when we first moved in that if I was to move out he would be fair with me and give me some of my money back, and obviously my stuff. I know that if I leave he’ll be fucked. The mortgage is $600, which we split. The electricity, the internet (if he was to pay for it), his car insurance, gas, and groceries would empty his pockets entirely. 

We fight viciously. Every time it gets nasty, the conversation always ends in “plan your departure”, “how much are you expecting back?”, “go find what you need elsewhere.” Every time I have something to say that he doesn’t agree with, I am told to pretty much leave. I’ve approached my concerns in every possible way: calmly, angrily, sometimes even happily FFS. A lot of the time, unless he’s in the mood to make amends, tells me to go elsewhere. He even told me to go fuck somebody else when I told him I wanted to have more sex. The way I was approaching it was apparently burdensome: I would talk about it too much. Despite being excited and making jokes about it. 

Long story short: we nitpick each other, there are a lot of clashes with our personality, and we generally don’t understand each other... especially when it gets rough. We have been together for a year and a half. I have known him since high school (approx. 5 years). We broke up last year because I couldn’t handle it anymore. He came back into my life and we got back together. Four months later, we were moved in with mortgage and condo fees, taxes, and a shit ton of bills to pay. 

When it comes to chores, I do the majority of the dishes, laundry, fold the clothes, clean the bathroom, take out the trash, and just general cleaning. I love doing this for him but sometimes it piles up and I get stressed out. He’s been improving in segments, but there’s still a long way to go. 

About me: I’m in my second year of university, have a well paying job at a shoe company, an internship in my field. Needless to say, I’m either at home, school, or at home putting in work. This has been a lot for me. Financially, I’m on a student loan and the majority of my salary goes to this condo. I was willing to sacrifice my selfish spending habits and going out to places that were generally a waste of money. 

About him: he is a landscaper and does snow removal in the winter. It’s currently winter here in Canada and he has had a lot of days off but, if I’m being honest, has not been EXTREMELY productive around the house. That’s okay, we all need a break. He likes gaming and smoking weed. 

Every time we fight, just to reiterate, the conversation of me moving out always comes up. These past few months have been miserable and happy. Our highs are high and our lows are low. It’s incredibly hard for me to figure out what to do in this situation. We have both changed and I feel like I’m trying to push two fucking magnets together every time I try to get through to him and he wants nothing to do with me. 

I know I’m young, attractive, capable, and not an idiot. But my hands are tied with this entire situation. I try not to think about it most days because it stresses me out. I’m losing myself in this a little bit. Shit got too real too quickly and despite the fact that I’ve been able to lift my weight and some, it doesn’t seem fair. Some days I feel like his mom with the amount I pick up after him. I’m rambling now. 

Can somebody help me please. Sorry for any typos, I’m on mobile.

849jov,1,2018-03-13,I'm moving in less than three weeks and i have no idea what i'm doing,cyanfolds,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/849jov/im_moving_in_less_than_three_weeks_and_i_have_no/,"So last year after taking a break from college for a few months, I decided to get away from my hometown and move from the States to Canada.  It took several months to get the paperwork together, saving up money, and saying goodbye, but I made it to Calgary.  My plan was to go back to school this winter and I just wanted to live in a big city.  I chose Calgary because I have family and I was told it'd be easy getting into the big university here.  My aunt and uncle let me stay in their basement since moving.

Since moving however, I found I wasn't accepted into the college, I've been out of a job since the holiday season, and I've hardly made any friends since getting here.  On top of that, my aunt and uncle were hoping to have me move out by now, but I don't know where to move to, especially since I don't have a car, job, or know people needing roommates.  I've been especially anxious about finding an apartment because my last place was awful and while my roommate was great, his brother moved in for a bit and got and we got on some bad grounds to say the least.  Plus it seems like everyone my age smokes weed and I can't live in that environment.  So with everything together, I've kind of just hid in the basement here the last three months.  I have been trying to find a job and getting help from the youth employment center, but no luck.

Last week I randomly looking at jobs in Vancouver and realized there were a lot more companies than I realized in the movie and video game industries.  The industries themselves always catch my interest and I'd heard on a podcast that if you want to get into those industries, you should move out that way and find work in even entry level things and start networking.  I told my parents about this and they told me they would help me move again to Vancouver if I can get everything together and move at the end of the month.

On one hand this is an amazing opportunity and should go for it, on the other I'm worried I'll fall into a similar slump that's not much different than Calgary has been.  I know I want to do a Japanese minor and I want to do voice acting which I found some schools out there.  My other thought is I could do internships more easily out there in the entertainment industry while in school.  I'm not sure though if I just haven't tried hard enough where I've been the past five months.

**TL;DR**  
My parents are helping pay for me to move a second time to a place I'd love to be, but I have no connections yet, a bad experience with finding roommates, and I've tried this once before"

For various reasons, I ended up having a series of severe panic attacks over the year, and eventually my parents decided that they were pulling me out of university because they ""couldn't afford to keep bailing me out.""


Ever since then, I've been living in my parents' house, finishing my degree online, stuck in my hometown away from my friends. And I absolutely hate it.


Back in Big City, there were job opportunities, fun things to do, professional networking events, more space, just more people my age who shared my interests. Here, everyone is either a miner or a nurse, the economy is shit, there's almost no entry level jobs in my degree field, nothing to see, nothing to do… it's so frustrating and oftentimes I have difficulty getting to sleep at nights because I get so scared that if I fuck up, I might have to spend the rest of my life here.


I don't have a lot of friends here, and the majority of the ones I do have are scatty and just want to sit around playing video games and avoid thinking about life or the goals that they don't have. I'm still in contact with some of my friends from the city (who I went to school with) and I see their snapchat stories of going out and having some fun on Friday nights, when I'm getting ready for work in the morning or just trying to catch up on study. They've finished their degrees, starting their adult lives and some of them have travelled to London to start jobs over there…. I haven't left the country yet.


My parents and brothers don't respect me. My brothers both work full time- one is in a trade and one is a trainee engineer who got a full time job through a friend of my dad. All they do is talk about tractors and mechanics and since I don't really know anything about that, I just have to sit on the sidelines of every conversation that they have. Even if I try to ask my dad a question about what they're talking about, he just says ""you don't have to worry about that"" and continues with the conversation. It just makes me feel like a baby.


I have a part-time retail job,and have made a few connections through networking and cold calling local people who work in my field. That has helped a lot but the message that I'm getting that, although Hometown's economy is starting to get better, the place I need to be if I want to develop my career is the Big City… I look for jobs in the Big City online and there's just masses of jobs and internships in my field popping up by the day, compared to not a lot here.


Last night, I decided to speak up and tell my parents that I want to move back to Big City because there's so much more opportunity there. They flipped it. My mum said I couldn't afford to rent there on a retail wage, I was uncommitted and unmotivated (which isn't true), and that I have no idea what life is like in the real world and how to support myself.  I tried telling her that I should try and go now so I could try and get some experience to compete with all other kids my age who will be going for graduate jobs this year, but she wouldn't listen. My dad flat out forbade me from moving until I finish my degree at the end of this year.



I just need some help. I am turning 23 next month and I am so scared that I am slowly wasting my life away in my parents' house in the middle of nowhere while the outside world keeps turning without me.

I'm +18 year old in real life and I'm seeking an fantasy with a equally +18 year old in real life roleplayer

 I'm more inclined to accept first the ones submitting their own suggestions rather than leaving me to pick everything, if you read the prompts you will realize I am flexible and open to all sort of things so please don't feel shy of pitching your idea. A bonus if it is something related to r/breeding r/impregPersonals or if you would love to corrupt/tease 

I am really horny now...so this case I'm available to chat as well

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the boys had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. In fact, this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unless he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that the intern was only (+18??) years old.

Who would like to play as her? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left aim charge of a few errands because as your parents have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**edging stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. You started to grow up to (?age), paying more attention to the opposite, boys started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way you saw her dad...which, after all, is everything you can wish for in a man of your own... Without realizing you started to imagine him touching you....kissing you...and even taking you on his bed...such as every night or so you hears your mum moan as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes you a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, your mum (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. You are at home waiting to have your man(dad) around to try something more than just imagining....today you are willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent young adult girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) Summer vacations and you invited 2 of your best friends. During the night sleepover you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them  and there is no internet available, some of your friends are more experienced but still doesn't quite satisfy you, also no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just not slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.

In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** (none are deal breakers) are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks) coupled with thick girls, being corrupted/mind broken, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.

84b4sp,1,2018-03-14,Time of year for finding a winter internship? Is it appropriate to get a winter internship if graduating in December?,accountingqqq,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/84b4sp/time_of_year_for_finding_a_winter_internship_is/,"Hi everybody.

Going into my senior year with 14 credit hours remaining for my Accounting degree and I have a decision to make.  Here are my options:

1) Finish this Fall semester

2) Finish in the Spring, having gotten a foreign language minor as well (6 credits left for the minor)

One reason I was considering the first option is because I think it would be good to get a internship like most people do.  I've already worked an industry accounting internship, just not a public one.  For the most part I believe I'm interested in tax.

I was wondering if it's even possible to get a winter internship in the fall semester via networking/career fairs.  I know the fall semester period is usually when firms hire for summer internships so I wasn't sure.

Secondly, would they consider giving me an internship if I were to have just graduated?  I know I should really be looking for a full time job, but it really seems like the firms are more comfortable hiring out of internship and I wouldn't mind doing it, especially as it would be a better use of my time than prolonging my graduation for a minor, I would assume"
84btnv,3,2018-03-14,Should I switch schools?,zytron11,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/84btnv/should_i_switch_schools/,"This is probably the hardest decision I've had to make, let me explain:

So currently, I'm a freshman at UC Santa Cruz, and I'm enjoying my time here, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows here for me. I've found a decent core group of friends, and they're great, I get along with a majority of them, and we're like a big family. The issue though, is that I don't really feel fulfilled, or like I'm getting the most out of my time here. I've joined a bunch of clubs for my major (Computer Science), but currently the department isn't in the best shape, with overflowing students and an understaffed department, the education here doesn't feel as serious as if I were elsewhere. Overall, I just feel like I won't really be ready as my peers from other colleges when graduating, and I feel like other than the great views and few friends I have here, there's not much holding me here.

Now here's the difficult part: 

I still keep in contact with most of my high school friends, and I talk with my 2 best friends, call them T and L, almost daily. Now T currently goes to UC Irvine, and has plans to get an apartment next year, with another friend R, and L, who is going to transfer there next year from community college. 

Now T and L are my very best friends, like I would take a bullet for either of them. They both are very important people in my life and have shaped me to be who I am today. L is also a Computer Science major, and he was the main person to give me the idea to transfer after I told him about the CS department here, hell he works part time in the same position I did last summer, and will go into again this summer(internship). So he and I will be working together this summer (and possibly spring) at the same place, same manager, and same work. 

T and L both are very hard-working people, and they drive me to work harder too, I've yet to find people like them here at Santa Cruz however, most people seem to just go with the flow, which isn't bad, but it's hard to drive myself to do more without friends who also drive themselves to do more.

Last year we joked about me dropping and transferring to UCI to live together with them, as UCI has a much better computer science program than Santa Cruz, and much more funding and reputation. Recently I've been considering it seriously, and have kinda made 3 options for myself.

1) Stay at UC Santa Cruz and graduate here after 3 more years, possibly find friends like T and L, possibly not, and learn to live and love the hippie attitude.

2) Return home next quarter, work full time at internship into the summer, but do summer classes online at Irvine Valley College, then in the fall, move in with T, L, and R, while going to IVC for a year to finish my GEs, then transfer to UCI the following year

There's also a 3rd sort of option where I stay at Santa Cruz next quarter, but still transfer to Irvine after.

If I were to go to Irvine, it would help me economically too, as I was able to get a grant this year, but next year I won't since my household income went up. If I could work and go to a community college, it would save me a lot.

I feel though that if I leave Santa Cruz this soon, I may not fully experience the school, and I may fall in love with it, and find the right friends. I also fear that I won't like Irvine as much, despite being there with my best friends, like Santa Cruz is great, but I don't feel I'm the happiest I could be here, and I feel I can amount to more at UCI.


TL:DR UC Santa Cruz vs UC Irvine"
84c6zr,3,2018-03-14,Feel like I just ruined my future...,279ksn,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/84c6zr/feel_like_i_just_ruined_my_future/,"Just really in need of some advice. I started a masters program 6 months ago but it is not what I thought it would be (not as passionate about it vs my expectations/ do not click well with classmates personality wise etc). Fast forward 6 months and I’m in a horrible depression from so much social isolation/ overall not enjoying this program. We have final projects to turn in this week but I’ve already not shown up to one of those classes. It’s not that the program is difficult academically but the last month I’ve been paralyzed in bed/no energy to do anything unless I was in a class. Also started an internship a month ago but felt very isolated there too and it was just painful to witness my friends progressing in their lives/jobs/enjoying themselves while I feel stagnant. 

Basically decided to quit this program earlier today since my mental/physical health is going in the shitter quick. Basically means moving back home to parents in mid 20s and all I have is a bachelors/ 1 year experience in kind of a menial entry level office job. Idk my anxiety is just through the roof now on if I’m destroying my future long term. Friends are saying no and that I’m just psyching myself out... but I can’t find any piece of mind right now or not feel like a complete failure/disappointment. Also seems easy for them to say that since they’re already in stable well paying jobs with a “normal” life right now. Been having suicidal thoughts most of my time in the program too. 

Idk I guess I’m just lost with if I’ll ever get out of this rut or not and if I won’t be constantly miserable ever again. Also ashamed I can’t get over being dumped almost a year ago from a future doctor over text after 3 years.... so being with her to my current life makes me feel even that much lower. Fuck this I am just dreading my life choices at this point/ feel ashamed of myself as a man and am losing hope of going on anymore.

Ps I’ve been told I am one that tends to overthink/over analyze but I still feel I have legitimate points to just feeling like a complete piece of shit right now.

Tldr: feel like I’m just throwing any future away that isn’t bleak and am losing will to go on.

Apologies in advance for the longish post!

I'm currently a 3rd marketing major with a minor in CS who waited too long to get out of my useless major. Unfortunately I'm not in a financial position to pivot into a CS/DS-related major so I've decided to give my marketing classes the absolute bare minimum from now on and focus my energy on self-taught CS/DS.

I've chosen to enroll in either Open Source Society University (OSSU) [Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) or [Data Science](https://github.com/ossu/data-science) and I'm wondering which makes more sense to pursue. I have about 1 year of experience with Python, a little less with R, and did my last internship as a web traffic analyst which I really enjoyed. While my ultimate goal is most probably to be a data scientist, the software and web development side of things also interests me. So my questions are:


-First of all, does anyone have any experience with the Data Science program? It seems to be significantly less well-known than the Computer Science program and the github page isn't nearly as active. So I want to confirm that it's of the same quality as Computer Science.

-If I want exposure to the data side and software and web dev sides, does it make sense to go with CS? I figure that this way I get the fundamentals of CS that aren't really covered in the DS program, while still covering material relevant to DS. On the other hand, it's not as specialized as the DS courses.


Whichever path I choose, I want to go all in. In other words, I don't want to pick and choose classes from each program. While I understand that 100% completion of either will not be recognized as a real Bachelor's degree by employers, I would like to have the personal gratification of having completed the equivalent of a full degree.

Thanks in advance for the help!

84cdbm,1,2018-03-14,My (27M) girlfriend (32F) started acting crazy and making me depressed.,bibibitconeeeect,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/84cdbm/my_27m_girlfriend_32f_started_acting_crazy_and/,"I first met her 2 years ago and it was amazing. At that moment I was recovering for 2 years from previous abusive relationship that left me severely depressed for more than a year. She were complete opposite of what I always had before and I fell in love.

She were hiding how much she made when we first met, I thought the is fine financially and she never showed any signs of need. I did not work then living on my savings while learning to change profession from logistics to software engineer.
In a year I got an internship at a huge reputable company, but the salary was shit. 

Few month afterwards (more than a year into relationships) she started acting weird for two days and broke up with me. We talked a week later and she told me that she had money troubles and she felt like crap because she thought I'd leave her, so she cheated on me to end it. And before that she started going to raves and parties without me and did drugs - mdma and acid. She were insisting it was her first time and she is sorry for not doing all of it with me. Do not believe it. I tried to forgive her and we got back together. Oh and she gave me herpes because whoever she banged she did without a condom. I paid for our treatment. She were acting like she is sorry, and I understand that my inadequate reaction might be the cause of it, probably should have just left. It was a roller-coaster, but I was hopeful and it seemed like it will be ok. Month later I got paranoid and found some shit in her phone from before our break-up. Some new shit she did not tell me about. By the way it happened when I saw some male name in messenger and when I asked who the fuck was that she promptly deleted it and told me that I am seeing things. 

Fast forward to now. Last several month she is acting crazy, extremely jealous, agitated, angry. Usually it is external stuff. Work or something that somebody said. She is telling me it is because her health issues. Breast pain and PMS and she is not able to control it as she is in constant pain 3 weeks out of 4. She did not fix her problems that led to the first incident and it makes me anxious. She got the same CC debt for 2 years long even though her salary tripled. In last year I went from zero income to making 2 times more than she got at her new job. To claryfy  - I make 4 times average salary in our city, she makes 2 times average salary. When I try to discuss her finances she gets mad and tells me that she does not need a budget, she just needs more money to take care of herself. I was always supportive, mostly I pay for everything also in attempt to help her pay her credit card debts. She is showing no progress and buys shit all the time. I took her for a vacation 5 or 6 times in 2 years. 
Also it seems that she is emotionally abusing me. Not going into details but pretty much wikipedia page for Emotional Abuse.

I am finishing renovating an apartment I bought a while ago and wanted to move in with her. Mostly all the work is done I was just getting some furniture to finish it. Meanwhile all the time I was living at my relatives, they are out of town 3 weeks out of the month, so we usually were staying there. To make it worse my mother is not stable too and when she is in town for that 1 week I can no longer stay at home. So I was staying with my girlfriend. Her brother is living with her in small 2 bedroom apt. She hates it and it causes her anger outbursts too. No matter where I was I did not feel right and developed alcohol problems, I really started drinking too much. When I talk that I am tired and do not feel right she immediately responds that she got it worse. Last week I realized that I am extremely anxious, paranoid and depressed. I am a software engineer and work on scientific software for biotech company. I could not finish a single line of code in 3 days. I isolated myself for now and not seeing her, we were just texting a little. Then I felt need to express myself and wrote her a letter explaining that I am hurt, why and some other stuff. Basically I know I would not be able to get that information to her in person. Send it to her yesterday night. She answered me with: ""Now I know too how to live and sleep with somebody and then they suddenly leave you. 1:1. We will talk later.""

We had plans to go for a vacation end of month. I paid for everything a while ago. Not sure what to do about it.

So here I am today. I might have skipped some details, sorry. Appreciate any input."

84cut3,2,2018-03-14,Me [25F] and my BF[25M] are breaking our 3+ year relationship. My first real relationship and I'm not sure how to go on from here. Help!,kayyes25,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/84cut3/me_25f_and_my_bf25m_are_breaking_our_3_year/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years now. We met in the last year of undergrad college and continued on through 2 years of work. For the last one year, I have been in another continent as I moved to pursue my Masters. We broke up for a brief period last year when I got my admit as he said he doesn't think he can do a long distance. But we couldn't be away for long and even in the 4-5 months that we were broken up we pretty much had the same equation. We even took a holiday together before I left for my Masters. He then asked me out again 3 days after I moved saying he misses me and he couldn't bear the thought of losing me and I was obviously delighted as I never did want to break up and so we got back.

My boyfriend has always been saying that he has a commitment problem and the thought of committing to a long term scares him. So he's always maintained that he doesn't want anything long term. I always believed that this is something 22 year olds feel anyway and never really bothered much about it. But its 3 years now and we still have fights about how he doesn't EVER want to marry(he says he doesn't want to marry anyone in life but thats a debate for another day) and how me holding on so dearly to this makes him feel like he's trapped. He's had 9 girlfriends so far(probably only 2-3 serious ones) and he's my first long term boyfriend ( I've had only one before who was just there for 3 months). 

We've also constantly had fights about how he never introduces me to his friends and always keeps the two lives very separate. He does a demanding job and so it's not right of me to expect constant texting or calling. We text for a while on most days and call each other 2-3 times a week. Even though I've constantly asked for more communication, I can understand if his work makes it impossible so I usually try to be understanding. but what pisses me off is that on the days he does get off early, he chooses to stay out with his friends till late and doesn't tell me where or when he'll be home. He lies about where he is and whom he's with sometimes. The first time we broke up, I've caught him lying about being at work or elsewhere a lot of times( Our iPhones are on the same family so I can track his location, yeah, fucked up I know). Also, after every office outing, he takes it upon himself to drop EVERY female friend back home. That kind of makes me jealous too. That when he can get back home and reply to my texts but he chooses to spend more time doing these things. When we broke up last year, he got onto every dating app there is within a week. He says he just wanted to 'try'. We kind of broke up because he said he's crushing on this girl at work.

We've been having a lot of fights about these things and he says my questions make him sick. But his secrecy makes me insecure which leads to my questions in the first place.
But apart from the fights, I love him dearly and I am still willing to make this work. I love how well we understand each other and the comfort we've built over the past few years. We get each others work, jokes, stresses and basically I share a GREAT equation with him. I haven't gone more than a day not communicating with him for 3 years now and I don't even know where to start.

He wants to break up now coz he says the commitment makes him claustrophobic and he still doesn't ever want a long term with anyone so he doesn't see the point. I asked him if he was ready to lose what we have built for these reasons and he said nothing has to change but he just doesn't want the 'tag' of a boyfriend but everything can remain the same. I obviously don't want that as it'll just add to my insecurities. 

I am also going through a generally tough time in life being away from home and struggling to find an internship, not many friends in a new place etc and I am unsure how to go about the only constant in my life breaking. I am considering therapy now. I wake up with anxiety on a lot of days and I don't know how to deal with it.

Sorry for the long post. I know there are a lot of red flags but I keep wanting to hold on to the hope that we can work. 

TLDR : My boyfriend of three years wants to break up with me coz he has commitment problems and I am too attached and unsure how to let go."

In September I'm going to Belfast for an internship. I was thinking of getting a mobile subscription with unlimited data from Three, so that I could have internet on my laptop aswell, no matter where I am. 

I saw that Three had a 30GB data limit for mobile hotspot. Is there any way for them to enforce this? I currently have a unlimited data plan in The Netherlands, and I can tether as much as I want. 

If they do enforce this, is there any way to get around this?

After setting all up, I'm a little disappointed. Not by performance, that I still have to test, but certain things:

1. The screen had light bleeding issue and I could easily see 2 big spots on top right and bottom. I know it's an IPS display but the light bleed was so prominent in dark! I really didn't expect light bleeding from a 94k laptop. 

2. The screen quality is not really that good. The colors are pretty off, especially the whites. Or maybe I haven't updated the drivers yet or didn't tweaked with the display properties(?).

If any of you have the same laptop or bought it recently, please share your experience.
I'm a student and I spent 60k of my internship money on this. I can easily see all my excitement for this laptop getting drained badly now. I've applied for a replacement and Flipkart would take a whopping 10 days to replace it!

P.S. Can anyone provide me with the adaptive brightness solution? It just won't turn off! I've applied the settings in advance battery options too.
Thankyou.

84dvt3,2,2018-03-14,[SP] The Reactor,s3nt1nel,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/84dvt3/sp_the_reactor/,"**Flier:** I met her in Berlin in April, about, what, two years ago. Her name was Kat, she was from New York, she liked Sci-Fi and fantasy and was stuck in the city for four days while her fiancé negotiated some investment-banking-sorta thing. I bumped into her in that huge bookstore near the train station, it has five floors and all kinds of books in there; she was glimpsing through the “Mona Lisa Overdrive” when I hit her with my camera bag. I swear that was not intentional. Sorry, does that have to be so tight? It hurts.


**Mr. One:** Mister Flier, those restraints are for your own safety. Please, continue.


**Flier:** Okay, awww, shit. Yeah, so I hit her, just a tiny bit, and she dropped the book. Guess she was too deep into the book and I scared her alright. I said I was sorry, she told me to never mind it, that it was OK, and smiled. That, sir, was the moment I fell in love and sold my soul to whoever is into that kind of business. I mean, it’s nasty, trading souls, right? If most people don’t have souls anyway, what’s there to buy? What kind of fucked up Ponzi scheme is that? OK, so she smiled and I was lost. That was the most beautiful, humble and cute smile humanity could have ever been capable of. Man, I don’t know, those dark brown eyes, those lips, those cheekbones - they were so perfect, I felt so warm and happy and… Blessed. Yeah, that’s the word - blessed.


**Mr. One:** What were you doing in Berlin, mister Flier?


**Flier:** Oh, well, I’ve been on my sabbatical, got too tired of doing programming, and decided that a few months in Europe would do me good and clear my head and whatnot. I got my backpack and camera bag, and took off, decided I start in Germany and move back to the US.


**Mr. One:** What kind of programming where you doing?


**Flier:** All sorts of it, mostly analytical applications, statistics, reporting. Man, I had dreams of numbers and charts, nightmares really. Needed the time off. Anyway, what that has to do with Kat? Is she here? Can I see her?


**Mr. One:** Focus, mister Flier. We’ll get to that after the interview. What happened next? In the bookstore?


**Flier:** Nothin. She smiled and I smiled, then she turned away and went off. I was so struck, I stood there for a good five minutes, and when I snapped back she was gone. I searched the whole store and been runnin’ back and forth so that security had to escort me out for scaring customers. I never saw her again that day, although I was looking for her, taking train after train after a bus. She just wasn’t there. But next day I got lucky. I’ve noticed her standing on the platform, waiting for a subway train. She was soaking wet, there was this huge rainfall above the ground. I took my camera outta my bag, aimed and took a picture. But my dumb ass forgot to turn off the auto flash, so she saw me, startled, then laughed and told me to delete the picture because she knew the picture was bad. She always told me that she didn’t look good in photos, but to be honest, photos of her were the best I’ve ever taken. I told her that she is the best thing that camera ever saw. Hell of a pickup line, I know. Never was big on talking to women. Or people at all for that matter.


**Mr. One:** Go on


**Flier:** That day we’ve walked, and talked, and ate, and laughed, and drank, and saw all of the city, all of the landmarks. She was telling me about everything at once - her life, her famous family, her fiancé, her work… I was listening, but hardly understood the meaning, it was the sound of her voice, her giggling and laughing that mattered. Never thought of myself as of a romantic, but at that moment I would’ve kicked Shakespeare’s sorry ass out of competition, you know.


**Woman over PA (in Mandarin):** Mr. One, warning, he’s too close.


**Flier:** What was that?


**Mr. One:** Don’t mind that. Tell me, Mr. Flier, what happened next? Why did you return to the US?


**Flier:** We met every day for a whole day. On the last day, that is, when she had to leave, I’ve walked her to a bus - her asshole fiancé didn’t even bother getting a taxi for her. She told me that she had a wonderful time. We exchanged the phone numbers, and when the bus arrived, she got on it and smiled at me. I knew there’s something I should do, otherwise, I’d be regretting not doing it for the rest of my life.  So I took the next bus to the airport, thinking “What the hell”. I found her in the line for the check-in, she never looked up and was very upset. You know, kind of “funeral went wrong” upset, the bitterness was almost palpable. I ran towards her and when I reached her, I hugged her and kissed her. And then she slapped me. Told me she wasn’t that kind of girl, that she was engaged and I was just good to spend some time with. A part of me died that very moment.


**Mr. One:** Why do you think so?


**Flier:** I’ve never felt so empty and dumb. I turned around and took off, to her crying behind me. Some child started crying, and I had that feeling of a cold clawed hand tightening around something in my chest.  I bought the ticket home and spend next twenty hours thinking that I’ve finally managed to fuck up something, that I knew was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. After that, I didn’t want to do anything anymore. I sold my camera, I quit my job and landed a job as a bartender in a bar across the road from my house. It wasn’t that much fun, but I guess all I wanted to achieve was to find a poor fucker that screwed up more, than myself.


**Mr. One:** Did you?


**Flier:** Nah, all of the stories I got to hear were the same, sometimes as pathetic as storytellers themselves. Cheating, gambling, alcoholism, business failures - I’ve heard it all.


And then one day - imagine that! - Kat walks into a bar. It was Halloween, I was wearing the stormtrooper helmet, you know, from Star Wars. She scoffed at a crowd and all the loud music and talking, and then she sat down at the bar and ordered some bourbon. She didn’t know it was me, so I asked her why wasn’t she cheering and celebrating. She told me that she had just broken up with her fiancé over some guy kissing her half a year ago in Berlin. She told her fiancé about that incident and he gave her shit for it, tons of it, like asking why didn’t she tell him earlier, and why did she hang out with some random guy in the first place, et cetera. By the time she finished telling me all that, she had a lot to drink and cried more than she talked. Then she asked me, “I did nothing wrong, why do I have to put up with this crap?”. My first reaction was to kiss her again, but then I thought that it didn’t end well the first time I did, and it kinda would have felt like I was going to violate her - drunk and depressed. So instead I just took off my helmet and told her that she could slap me once more for not thinking through all the consequences. And man she did, it hurts even remembering it.


**Mr. One:** Was her slapping you an emotional closure for her?


**Flier:** I don’t know doc. We never talked about it afterward. She was going to leave and I asked her not to because she was drunk. I called an Uber and took her to her parent's place. We never spoke while riding and the only thing she told me was “Goodbye” when she closed her door.  And that’s the moment when weird things started happening.


 **Mr. One:** What kind of weird things?


**Flier:** Like when I turned around to walk my way home, there was a cab waiting on the curb. I’ve never called for it. And when I got home there was no power, and I couldn’t charge my phone and something nasty died in my fridge. I had to deal with that next day, and I missed Kat coming to the bar to apologize. She left me a note with her number, but someone spilled tomato juice all over it. I went to visit her at her parents, but my bus caught on fire mid-trip and I had to be checked up at the hospital. I was like something didn’t want us to meet again.  We’ve met next week after the Halloween and she told me all sorts of weird stories - how she couldn’t find a pen to write down her number, or no one of my co-workers was able to give her my cell number, or how that cell number was not responding, or how the network died when she tried to call. How she got mugged on one day while walking to a bar and had to spend the rest of the day at the precinct. How some lady was fatally hit by the bus on a completely empty street and she was the only eyewitness willing to testify, taking her another day with the police.


 **Mr. One:** That is disturbing.


**Flier:** Yes, that shit was intense. It eventually stopped, I guess, the two days after we decided to move together. We just couldn’t get enough of each other. We had to be inseparable. And for a while everything was good. I bought a camera and she taught me to take better pictures - she had arts degree or something like that, I couldn’t remember. I have trouble remembering a lot of things, really. Eventually, she organized an exhibition of my works. We even managed to sell one - her portrait, for a hundred bucks. Of course, that didn’t cover any of the expenses, but she told me that the main point was to show me that I had a talent for this.


And then it started happening again. Phone calls in the middle of the night, power outages, gadgets catching fire, minor injuries, minor accidents. It escalated quickly. We always loved the sunny weather but next summer we’ve got ourselves a real drought, something, that never happened before in New York - people and animals dying of heat, birds falling from the skies, wildfires. Water shortages and rationing. It was all over the news.


**Mr. One:** I remember, that was quite a distress.


**Flier:** Then I started seeing people. Same people following me to work and just staring at me. Two weeks later I almost got killed by a brick that fell off the roof of a construction site. Next day some idiot rammed into a side of my car and I had to go to the hospital again. In the hospital, they’ve messed up my anesthesia and I almost died of anaphylactic shock. A month later I got to a fistfight in the bar and got stabbed three times by some guy who later denied remembering this accident at all. He was sentenced to a few months in jail though.


**Mr. One:** Have you talked to Kat about all these accidents?


**Flier:** Yes, multiple times. She said that I was imagining things, that those were just accidents, and it could happen to anyone. But I knew there was more to it. Someone was deliberately trying to kill me. A couple of last times we spoke we ended getting angry and shouting. I insisted on moving out, going someplace else - like Chicago, Houston, New Orleans, anywhere really. She refused. We’ve got into a fight and I pushed her. I didn’t mean to do it, hurting her is the last thing I would ever do. She told me I needed to get help, and that I was doing that all to myself. I apologized, and for a few days, it was quiet again.


**Mr. One:** Focus, Adam, please. What happened next? 


**Flier:** Three days ago, Kat received an anonymous letter with photos of me kissing some girl over the bar. She got pissed off, I got pissed off, I told her I never did it, that it’s a hoax and someone’s fucking with us. She didn’t listen. She took her keys and ran off to the street, I ran after her to stop her and to talk, to get her to understand that that wasn’t me and whole this thing is a fucking setup. When I caught up with her, I grabbed her but she wrestled out and started screaming for help.


**The bracelet on Mr. One’s hand beeps twice** 


**Mr. One:** Adam, I want you to focus on what happens next. This is very important.


**Flier:** I don’t know, what happened next. I just saw this guy, I saw him before a couple of times. He was one of the stalkers from before. I ran to him and punched him in the face. He didn’t even try to protect himself. I hit and hit and hit him until police tazed me and I woke up here. All I remember how scared Kat was when I grabbed her. And then it just fades to black. Is Kat OK? Can I speak to her? Can you at least pass her a note and say that I’m sorry that I hurt her?


**Mr.One:** Adam, it breaks my heart, but I need you to understand this. There was never a person in your life named Kat. She is just a figment of your imagination, of your shattered and sick mind.


 **Flier:** No no no no….


**Mr. One:** On April 10, two years ago, you suffered a major injury that unfortunately had devastating consequences for your mental health. You remember the bookstore in Berlin?


**Flier:** This can’t be true, I remember her! There are photos! Social media! People I worked with!


 **Mr. One:** The bookcase went off the hinges and fell over you. You had major internal hemorrhaging and severe brain trauma. You were in a coma for two weeks. All that you think has happened - never happened at all. After you got better, we released you into the care of your parents, and three days ago you punched a bystander to death for no reason.


**Flier:** No no no no no! I couldn’t do it!


**Mr. One:** And yet you did. There’s CCTV footage, there’s evidence, eyewitnesses. And my job here is to make sure, that all of this is a result of a trauma you’ve suffered in Germany two years ago, otherwise you’re looking at a life in prison.


**Flier:** I… I… I remember her… I remember her stories… I remember her smell…


**Mr. One:** Adam, all of this is not real. She was never there. She does not even exist, we checked. There has never been a Kat for you. But I think that is enough. I can pass my opinion to your layers, so they can start working out your defense. I guess I’ll see you around, Adam.


**Flier:** No! No! Don’t you dare to walk away! Don’t you dare to say that Kat is not real! Don’t you fucking dare, you son of a bitch! I remember her! I remember!


 _Adam’s screaming is muffled by a closing metal door._

－ Wow, that was intense! - said intern staring at Adam through a glass wall. The light in the room faded, consuming Adam, the chair, and the table. Whirring, that was coming from the wall, gradually died down.


－ Yes, but you’ll get used to it, - answered woman with a Pokémon hairpin, pressing glowing buttons on the glass in a complex sequence - Is this your first time?


－ Yes - said intern, chuckling, obviously nervous. - First day on the job, trying not to screw up.


－ You have a lot of work then, - said the voice behind his back. Intern turned around to see Mr. One approaching one of the holographic panels on the wall.


－ How was it, Ms. Twenty-Three? - asked Mr. One


－ Run was good, yield at the optimal level, he’s stable now. - responded Ms. Twenty-Three.


－ Good, good. - Mr. One turned his head to the intern. - And you, young man, must be wondering, what is this all about?


－ I am, sir, - said intern. - This is not what was in the recruitment pamphlet anyway.


－ What’s your name?


－ Its A-D-F, - said intern, spelling each letter.


－ What kind of a name is that? - asked Mr. One, amused. - Did they run out of numbers for you, people?


－ Y-yes, sir, - answered A-D-F, stuttering. - They did seventeen years ago.


－ Well, I never liked the idea of sequenced names anyway, - said Mr. One, coughing - Do you have a real name?


－ Jake, my name’s Jake, sir


－ Good. So, Jake, you know that this facility has a very long history and is very important, right?


－ Yes, sir, since we were able to convert human emotion to energy, this faci…


－ Yes yes yes, don’t read the onboarding bullshit, it is boring. - Mr. One coughed again, wiped his mouth with a cuff of his scrubs. - Our Mr. Flier here is an anomaly. We’ve never seen anything like him, not in a whole System. On his own, he is a regular John Doe, with no particular talent or abilities, or future, for that matter. He was expected to live to be 56 years old and die in a house fire.


－ But he’s here now, and…


－ Bright one, aren’t ya? Don’t ever interrupt me again.


－ Sorry, sir, won’t happen again, sir.


－ But at some point, he encountered her, this Kat person. That was the first time we registered such yield since that poor fella, around two thousand something years ago, that got ahold of build logs of one of the alpha versions of the System, and thought, that the God spoke to him and the truth revealed itself, et cetera. He even managed to get some followers. We had to reset the whole build and kill him, just to make the situation manageable. Such a waste of resources, shame shame shame. But after the reset, we’ve got a steady output of Joy, Love, and Happiness from all over the world, even the Competition conceded, that this was a genius move. Of course, we have to deal with a lot of Hatred, Greed, Envy, Lust, but it is important and really needed, because we cannot store and process amounts of energy that huge, we have to neutralize the excess.


Mr. One paced across the room to another terminal, “ahem”-ed looking at the numbers and charts and murmured something indistinguishable.


－ But what’s his deal? - asked Jake nodding to a blacked out glass wall with Adam still behind it.


－ Oh, as I’ve said, Adam is an anomaly. The compilation of previous errors, bugs, and miscalculations, made by our Engineers. You see, on his own he’s useless. But with Kat… With Kat, the emotion yield was so enormous, that we’re still trying to calculate it’s capacity. Together they emit so much Joy and Love, that it affects this physical reality. Remember the part about the drought? That was them, loving each other to the end of the world. We had to step up, otherwise, this alliance of theirs would have destroyed everything. Adam and Kat amplified each other’s yield, wasting such a potential…


－ So you’ve made him go mad?


－ Technically, he did it to himself. We wouldn’t want to be tied to any legal issues with Inquisitors. So we put our employees in different places, ever so slightly changing other people’s decisions and, subsequently, fates. The guy that Adam punched to death was destined to die ten minutes later of a stroke. No big harm was done there. He was an abusive asshole anyway, and he raped his wife.


－ But what happened to Kat?


－ We had to move quickly with her. After we brought Adam in, she started generating such an amount of Grief and Despair, that it started tearing space, time, and cause-and-effect itself. We wouldn’t know how to contain it. Two days after the incident, she was T-boned by a truck at lower Manhattan.


－ But trucks are not allowed there…


－ I know, right? It was a sloppy job, we had to deal with this quickly. She died in horrible agony next day, and a lot of people were affected. God, - Mr. One chuckled, - imagine the paperwork! Eighteen years ago, and here we are, dealing with the consequences!


－ Eighteen years? Has he been there for eighteen years?


－ Yes, he’s been with us for eighteen years. We’ve noticed, that on a third year here his energy yield started to deteriorate, so we’ve capped him at his peak - two years and three months from the point of meeting Kat. This provides us with all we need to keep up the current facility and redistribute the rest. Of course, all of this is carefully calculated, so the anger at the end of the conversation is needed to mitigate the reaction, so nothing bad will happen - I mean, so we don’t overload Adam or the network.


Mr. One coughed, looked at his wristwatch.


－ Mr. One, - said Jake, pointing to a framed portrait of a girl on the wall. - Is that her? Is that Kat?


－ Yes, Jake, it’s her. The curious artifact, side effect, and a reminder. Ms. Twenty-Three, I’ll be ready in 5 minutes.


－ Yes, sir.

 Jake stared as Mr. One coughed, started sparkling and then vanished into thin air.


－ What the… - said Jake, confused


－ Mr. One is an AI that oversees the Operation from the very beginning. Consider yourself lucky, rarely anyone gets a history lesson from the thing itself. It liked you.


－ Lucky? - Jake shouted. - Liked me? Eighteen years? Killing people? “Paperwork”? - Jake gasping and furious. - What the fuck is this fucked up job?!


－ The one, that pays the bills. - said Ms. Twenty-Three in a cold voice. - You heard the man. We don’t want to be late with the run. Reset him. We need Adam awake and ready in five.

I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!
———————————————————
Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

aandacht en bekendheid te willen geven aan de ""veiligheidscultuur"" bij de

Is het mogelijk dat juist medewerkers de noodzaak voelden om naar de pers

So I applied to the Roswell Park Cancer Institute undergrad research internship (deadline was early Feb.) as well as UCincinnati’s Summer Undergrad Research Fellowship (deadline was mid Feb.).

84fusm,36,2018-03-14,What advice can we give to young women living in the age of trans madness?,tigersharkchomp,GenderCritical,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/84fusm/what_advice_can_we_give_to_young_women_living_in/,"I’m young myself (late 20s) but I think I’m past the the age prone to trans madness&amp;propaganda. 
Thinking back to when I was 18~21, I find myself just as emotionally vulnerable and socially awkward as those Tumblr kids buying into transgenderism. But thinking about it now, I doubt that any woman be emotionally stable and comfortable in her own skin at that age. I was often depressed. I had minor family issues back then as my mom was having a difficult time, and that influences you. As a more of an introverted person who doesn’t like to display her achievements, I felt like I was falling behind everyone else even though I wasn’t. To be truthful, I still feel a bit inadequate even after years working now! 
The social expectations of young adults and college students as always happy, passionate, and taking on challenge didn’t really help either. I had my goals and passion, but I just was not the poster child that applies to 13 internships in freshman summer and produce independent films, etc. This social image making is a trend that I see in a lot of places in the world, not just North America. The society told me that I was living the happiest years of my life and that wasn’t true. Of course, you also have to add the fact that I’m a woman and every nasty misogynistic expectations that comes with. 
I began to dress more masculine and thought of myself as with a man’s soul, etc. I still dress a little androgynously but that’s because I look good in it. 

As a woman few years older now, what I want to tell 18-23 young women is that things do get better, so try to surround yourself with good, critical friends, not the self misery basking ones, and woman on. Cry when you need to. 

Some other tips:
1. Do some physical activity. I’m by no means an active person; I just try to do at least some minimum physical activities—10 min workout, walking outside, etc. And it does help keep me relatively emotionally healthy, especially taking walks outside. 

2. Keep a physical journal. It may vary among folks but I find the act of writing physically calm me down. I’ve also used something called “750 words a day.” I let it go in favor of physical journal, but it’s super useful in keeping track of your emotions, thoughts, etc.

3. Make something. Cooking, knitting, drawing, etc. and keep record of it! It’s a healthy way of getting a sense of achievement which nourishes your confidence.

4. Try using verbs instead of nouns or adjectives when you describe yourself. This may sound weird, but for me, I found it more empowering to describe myself using verbs instead of nouns. For example, instead of thinking yourself as “depressed, angsty, mental health issues,” try “I feel depressed, I feel angst, I have mental health issues.” Saying that you ARE a “depressed, angsty” person hints that these negative emotions are somehow integral part of you. Saying that you feel these things imply that you are you, but you feel such emotions because you’re human. 

5. AVOID FRIENDS WHO USE YOU AS EMOTIONAL TRASH CAN! These friends, no matter how much you might feel sorry for them, do zero good for you. They come to dump all their negative emotions on you, who, as a woman, will nod and listen. Emotions are contagious. It’s good to have friends to occasionally commiserate with, but be aware of selfish people who wish to drag you down. 

6. Avoid social media when depressed. Emotions are contagious. No person can stay happy after being fed all the negative news and emotions. 

I’d also love to hear from older women on the sub for their wisdom!"

Earlier this week, Morgan Murtaugh announced her run for Congress in the 53rd District of California. In a recent press release, her team has informed us that this run makes Morgan the youngest candidate for Congress.

Full disclaimer: I met Morgan six years ago at CPAC when she was running the mega-popular Twitter handle “Republican Girl Probs.” Since then, I have seen her start a successful Conservative merchandise company, a news site which frequently published viral pieces that were underserved by MSM news, and worked as an incredible host and producer over with our friends at [OANN](http://www.oann.com/). While I don’t know much about what the 53rd District of California needs (and have no desire to research it out further because I personally dislike California), I do know that I have rarely seen the same drive and ingenuity in any candidate, much less individual, than I have seen in Morgan over the years; she fully has my love and support for this incredible and patriotic venture. Hopefully, by the time she wins, and has a chance to accomplish her goals for the district, California will suck just a little bit less.

VIA Press Release:

SAN DIEGO, CA – Today, Morgan Murtaugh was the youngest candidate to declare her candidacy for the United States Congress. Born and raised in San Diego, Morgan has been a political activist for nearly a decade, promoting conservative values in an effort to improve the lives of Americans from all walks of life. She now intends to do the same for her community in the 53rdDistrict of California.

Morgan began her work in the San Diego community working for the United States Navy as Assistant Protocol Officer to Commander, Naval Air Forces. During this time, she attended community college and volunteered for local and federal politics. She also founded the political platform RepubGrlProbs in 2012, which reached over 50,000 users across several social media platforms and employed a staff of 15. Morgan finished her degree in Political Communications at George Washington University, where she spent time as a communications intern on Capitol Hill. She then worked on the digital team for Carly Fiorina’s presidential campaign before returning to San Diego, where she is currently employed as an on-air political commentator at One America News Network.

Morgan hopes to encourage and inspire young Americans and her community to re-engage in politics, and better the lives of the people in her district.

“As a lifelong San Diegan, I understand the wants and needs of the people of San Diego and will fight tirelessly for them in Congress,” said Morgan. “I plan to fully engage with my community, learn their struggles and their successes first hand, and empower them to succeed. Unlike career politicians who represent special interests, I will represent my community over anything else.”

Election Day is June 5th. To learn more about the campaign, visit [http://morganmurtaugh.com](http://morganmurtaugh.com)

84hfh9,2,2018-03-14,Lifting only 3x a week but super exhausted: work/gym balance help needed,nomadora,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/84hfh9/lifting_only_3x_a_week_but_super_exhausted/,"Hey! So I’ve been doing pretty well in terms of strength and fitness goals with a 3x a week strong curves inspired workout. For someone who was super duper weak, I went from those 5lbs dumbbells to using the regular bar over the past 6 months by doing Strong curves B.B. on repeat essentially until I got to the final weeks. 

Once I was done, I took the last 4 weeks of strong curves with accessories added for upper body work. The issue is, as I’m starting to lift heavier, with warmups and cool downs... I’m lifting about 1.5hrs straight sometimes more. 

The issue I’ve been running into is exhaustion. I’m working as a software dev intern and sometimes I have to put in extra hours to get a hard task done or some volunteer tasks related to work and I’ve been unable to do this anymore. 

Like I come back from my workouts, eat dinner, sit on my bed and eventually pass out. I think I might be overtraining somehow despite only working out 3x a week. I feel sore most of the time on non-training and training days.

I want to make time for interview studying or doing additional coding after work but I’m too tired nowadays. Is there a split that will get me into and out of the gym faster? I don’t mind adding more workout days if my workouts are efficient.

84i0hz,1,2018-03-14,I’ve made many decisions in my life. You’re not one i regret.,puddingllama,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/84i0hz/ive_made_many_decisions_in_my_life_youre_not_one/,"My dearest sunshine,
today marks one year since the day you’ve told me you don’t love me anymore after spending 5 years together. The day when you told me that the spark is gone and that I can not make you happy. Hearing those words come out of your mouth - I couldn’t process it. I was sure we were just grabbing lunch normally, I even had a good work story to share since I just started my internship and _poof_, all was gone. 

I know we had our ups and downs. 2 years in, you called me one day to tell me you cheated on me with a prostitute to _test my faith_ and i ended up being a horrible emotional mess full of jealousy. I realise that now and i’m sorry i have put you through that. 

But the ups - they were amazing. Baking with your grandparents and cousins, going to a music festival, planning our future trips or just lying in your arms at evening thinking how lucky I am to be there.. I still think of those memories.

In one year, I did not lose the weight i hoped I would. I did not go to USA like I dreamed of and I never went to Qlimax or any other festival, because I was afraid i'd see you there. I stopped going out for more than half a year just to make sure I don't run into you. Heck, I changed my schedule just so we wouldn't end up being on the same train.
But in that one year, I had a job at the best central European accelerator. I moved 6 times. Lived in another country. I was in 2 startups. I visited 3 countries, got a raise, stood up to the person I respected, got into 3 more startups and am helping out everyone I can with things I've learned so far. I’ve met amazing people who had left enormous footprints in my life, just like you did. And I hope you would be proud of me.

But all things must end, and I have decided this will to. As from today, I will no longer give you access to my life. You will no longer be the first person I will wish to contact (even tho we have been no-contact for almost all of our time apart) whenever something good happens. You will no longer be there, in the back of my mind - no more quick access to happiness shared with you. No more wondering why I wasn't good enough, why I couldnt make you happy even tho I gave you my all. We were a dying dream and it's time for me to wake up. 

Im happy for you and I hope you achieved everything you wanted and more. 

Good luck on your journey,
your Ka*i"
84iini,2,2018-03-14,"I need some cold hard facts, or at least some criticism.",dbnrdaily,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/84iini/i_need_some_cold_hard_facts_or_at_least_some/,"I'm at 25 yr old male living in Southern California, I graduated from a Cal State in 2016 and I've been in a relationship for 4 years. I still live at home but I'm planning on moving out in the summer. I am constantly anxious, indecisive, and get incredibly mad over stupid things (road rage for ex). 

Throughout college I worked at a mechanic shop that me and a close friend owned together. I have a passion for motorsports and racing and cars in general I suppose. My friend was is an incredibly talented mechanic, I was just a DIY enthusiast, so he taught as much as he could. I was a decent mechanic but doing 15 honda civic brake jobs wasn't really ""fulfilling my passion"". Pair this with the fact that my partner at the time had a completely different and (chaotic) way of running a small business, safe to say neither of us knew how to run a small business. Long story short I sold my interest in the business to my partners dad who has since stepped in and helped my friend get his sh*t together. We are still very close friends and I visit him often and store my track car and my other project car there. 

I graduated with a degree in Finance, I wanted to work in Mergers &amp; acquisitions, I had taken classes on this, grew comfortable with valuation models and the M&amp;A space in general. Unfortunately the amount of time I dedicated to my business and the fact that I never really was good at school meant that my GPA wasn't so great, so the prospects of me working in the more prestigious side of banking M&amp;A was going to be tricky. I landed an internship with an M&amp;A brokerage firm, I was there 6 months and they offered me a full time job. I had received another internship opportunity for a fortune 100 company, working directly with their corporate strategy team and getting a lot of face time with big execs. This was so awesome for me, I stayed late and busted my ass, I made some friends with some great people as well. I was told the 3 month internship would turn into a full time job, I was excited. before the internship ended the company was bought out by an incredibly sketchy chinese firm (HNA). They laid of 1/3 of the 30k employees and needless to say I didn't get an offer. 

I was laid off in September and spent the rest of the year trying to get a job. Being unemployed for a few months took a toll on my self esteem even though I was constantly reassured that this was normal for recent grads. 

In January I desperately accept a position as a municipal financial advisor. This job really sucked, I had a toxic boss who hated me, I had to expense all my hours to a client, if there was no client to expense it to I had to expense it to the company, which directly affected my bosses bonus, whether or not I had a client to expense hours too was never my responsibility, I was assigned clients based on need within the company. The company had 28 people when I started in January and 13 had quit by April. I had a horrible relationship with my boss, this was stressing me out and causing me to miss deadlines. I set up a face to face meeting with my boss to get everything on the table and see how we could work passed this. In corporate speak she essentially told me she didn't want to work things out and that I should consider leaving. With this in my head I lost all motivation to be good at this job, not to mention I hated the actual work. I was fired 2 weeks later end of April 17' and it was bitter sweet. I had never been fired before and this was really messing with my head. 

I was so over EVERYTHING at this point. In May I decided to take a 4 week 10,000 mile road trip around the U.S. and parts of Canada with my girlfriend. With all the ups and downs we had this will forever be one of the greatest decisions I made. I miss this trip everyday and so does my girlfriend and I really think it was good for our relationship as well. 

In July I found another job. I was hired by a local investment firm to manage a tranche of their portfolio's, the pay is decent and my co-workers are cool. But the job has become incredibly high stress, right now I am not only managing the funds but mitigating tax season. People tell me that I am over worked and under paid but I can't help but think I just over exaggerate the difficulty. I have made many mistakes at work due to a lack of attention to detail, and it's always something small like a missing border on a spreadsheet or something aesthetic on a deliverable. My analysis and calculations tend to be solid. But because I have direct contact with some huge banking officials I need everything to be PERFECT. This is really stressful and exhausting and I don't enjoy a second of it. I can't tell if I suck at this sort of thing or If I'm not trying hard enough or what. I am hanging in there but I'm really not happy, I come home tired and just wanting to watch T.V. all night. I don't engage my girlfriend as much, motor sports has been thrown on the back burner because track days require a lot of time and energy. 

I can't help but think I'm forcing myself to do something I don't want to do. Is it okay to feel like this is wrong? I try telling my girlfriend these things, but she tells me I'm over thinking, feeling anxious, or I just need to stop whining and appreciate what I have. I do try... 

I don't want to be miserable anymore, I want to find something I'm good at and I like, I know this is everyones goal but I am having a really hard time finding guidance. I am very indecisive and lethargic and beginning to think I'm actually depressed. I've also questioned whether I might have ADD and if this is affecting my work and leading to added stress. I'm here looking for someone whose been through something similiar, or has any advice. If nothing else it felt good to type this out... 

Thank you"

but here's how the story goes, please forgive me for my action and i totally regret it.. i just need to know what is this girl thinking and why are her actions like this..


--

one day i met this new intern in my workplace, she got a boyfriend who is in the same university with her... she see's him EVERYDAY .. we got pretty close at work and we started to like each other.. we share a common interest, a lot of interest in fact.. 


we spend a lot of time together at work.. at the last day of her intern she kissed me, the next day she confessed and she says she like me but i said we cant do this because its wrong..


she talked her way into my heart and make me fall for it.. so we got together.. everything seems okay... she started to come over my place to sleep over and things escalated REAL quick from hugs to kisses to touch and it goes on.. she have like 99 reasons to sleepover at my place without anyone suspecting.. literally no one..


we do argue from time to time due to my guilt because i cant do it anymore because i have a gf... she said she feel the guilt but she loves me at the same time which is ridiculous... she have like almost 99 reasons to sneak out from her home or uni just to see me or even sleepover, sometimes i feel uncomfortable but i didn't tell her cause it'll upset her, i'll just play along.. we're really into each other but at the same time i got my own limits.. because the guilt is eating me..


i went back to my home town twice and when i see my gf i feel remorseful and sad and the guilt is eating me up... i told this girl about it and she still insist to have me with her, she still talk her way into my heart and i get all soft and deceived and i fell for her trap again


we argued way more and more because i couldn't handle my guilt but at the same time it feels so good to be with her, she knows how to love me and she knows how to ease my pain... maybe its because i'm far away from my girlfriend... but things escalated more and more, we argued, i call her names and she scold/scream at me.. at one point she just hit me, hit me and it hurts but i suck it up.. 


late january 2018 we broke up, I stopped texting her because I thought it will be great to have a break... but then.. when I texted her after 2 weeks.. she said she moved on, she deleted everything of me completely from her life.. and now here i am feeling so lost/cheated/betrayed.. now its as though i feel so much for her than my gf... which i'm not suppose to... i even tried to talk to her but she blocked me completely


the reason she left me is because she said she's sick of getting hurt by me, but it's only normal because the guilt is eating me up... i'm not sure why she doesn't understand.. it's so confusing...
she doesn't even feel a slight guilt because she's cheating on the bf.. now she can happily go back to the bf as though nothing happened... and here i am stranded alone...

**TL;DR** hooked up with another girl because I was lonely in another country, regret my actions of flirting and things just went downward spiral..."
84jow9,6,2018-03-15,I'm [21F] trying to move out but my parents [50sM/F] are having a hard time letting go,fishey12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/84jow9/im_21f_trying_to_move_out_but_my_parents_50smf/,"First time poster here, so I hope this is the right place (please let me know if it isn't). 

Backstory: I don't get along with my parents. At all. I love them and I'm grateful for everything they've done for me, but even my friends talk about how badly they treat me. They've made up stories behind my back (mostly to people I know and won't believe them, so no real harm there). They constantly put down my ability to be a functional adult, even with evidence to the contrary. They've put down my major (which is a rapidly growing STEM field), my interests, my hobbies, and my accomplishments to my face. They've openly mocked me about my problems, and on one memorable occasion my mom left me alone with an abusive boyfriend less than an hour after I confided that I was terrified to be alone with him. As a result, I don't go home much, and I don't tell them much about my life. This drives them crazy.

My current problem: I had plans to move out of my parents' house at the end of this semester - I even picked up a second part-time job while going to school full time to help save up for the expenses. However, that fell through very recently, leaving me with about three days to either find an apartment by myself or fill out my uni's contract to live on campus for another year. I was freaked out and, desperate, called my parents asking for advice. They laughed about my situation, didn't take me seriously, and told me that everything would work out. 

I ended up finding a studio apartment about 30 minutes from my uni, and it was something that I might have been able to afford by picking up a few more hours every week at my jobs. I mistakenly told my parents about it, still looking for advice. They absolutely freaked out. Apparently, they had never wanted me to move out at all. They told me I was going to run out of money and be broke, and end up coming home crying to them, and that if I did this, I shouldn't bother trying to move back in with them when I failed. They ended it with ""Maybe next year, you can try to be independent again. Until then, looks like you're still our little baby girl."" They even tried to tell me that under no circumstances was I to take the studio apartment.

I know I'm old enough that they can't control me, but I was worried about the finances. I might be able to afford it, but if I couldn't and my parents wouldn't take me back in, I'd be homeless, and I couldn't risk that, so I applied for on campus housing. However, that doesn't start until August, and my parent's home is two and a half hours away from my jobs. I quit the job I had been working in my hometown because I thought that me moving out was a sure thing. So I've started looking for places to stay over the summer. My parents, however, are pushing for me to quit my two jobs here and move back in with them over the summer. They even want me to turn down any potential internships I get (they live in a small town, and even the closest city to them doesn't have internships for my major), just to stay home with them. They even told me to take a job in the closest city to them (an hour and a half drive away) and commute from home every day. 

I can't move back in with them. I just can't. I was diagnosed with a severe panic disorder a few months ago, and just the thought of living with them again for three and a half months gives me a panic attack. But I don't know what to do. If I can't find somewhere to stay over the summer, I won't have any other options. I reached out to a few friends of mine who live in the area and I've already been turned down by a couple just for a lack of space. 

My parents have been mocking me and gaslighting me through this whole process (although when they try to gaslight me, I send them screenshots of their own texts proving them wrong about whatever they're saying. It hasn't helped them stop, but it helps my sanity). Has anyone ever managed to get parents like mine to help support them in a situation like this? And if not, and I have to go back home, does anyone have any advice for how I can survive it? 

I'm at a loss. I might post to another subreddit about the finances portion, but I really need help navigating this situation with my parents. It feels like I've tried everything.

The final episodes are riveting. There are so many great moments. I mean, things were unrealistic, but the cast still sold all the storylines? 

First, Burke. Wow, I have forgotten what an interesting and layered character he was. He was a man of science and a man of faith. He loved being a surgeon and jazz. He was sensitive yet cold. I found his character very realistic. I love when he tells Christina he was never naturally talented like she was, but he was disciplined. You can see that discipline in all aspects of his life: clean apartment, eats well, works out. Honestly, he was one of Grey's best written characters and I never realized that until now. I love the Denny/shooting parallel. Christina and him were really great together. Of course they had their issues since he was a lot more senior but their story was really compelling. I'd definitely say he was a better written character than Owen, even though I did like Owen and Crowen. I do think Burke/Christina was better though. If anything, better written.

Everyone was on top of their game acting wise. The show felt like a true ensemble. George had his intriguing storyline with Callie - and was making amends with Meredith. Christina became ""human"" and was dealing with Burke. Izzie and Denny were really believable - no matter how absurd the situation actually was. And Alex, well, he was the high point of the finale. I had forgotten what had made me love Izzie/Alex and that scene where he carries her off Denny's back was it for me. Alex Karev, surprising everyone and showing for good that he was... good. 

The Chief's storyline wasn't repetitive and it was actually interesting. Bailey was the best resident with her interns in this show. I just loved the way she treated them. 

While I did find Meredith and Derek's scene compelling, it was kind of ridiculous how they ended the episode though.

You have the chief's niece dying of cancer, you have Burke possibly losing his career, you have that super emotional Alex/Izzie/Denny moment and then it ends with Meredith having to choose between Derek and Finn? *Eyerolls* 

Still, it was nostalgic to rewatch S1-S2 again and I would recomend it to any Grey's fan who miss the vintage seasons. I just saw a lot of things differently this time. I was uber focused on Mer/Der the first go around, did not like the Denny/Izzie/Alex storyline and hardly payed attention to Burke. Watching it again really shows how well that cast worked together and a moment when Shonda was still treating the cast as a true ensemble. 

Anyone love S1-S2 and specially the S2 finale? "

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

I immediately left for Ohio and was not mentally prepared. I was worried about Sarah and got rattled being in a new environment with a stressful and strenuous work schedule. That lead to me having my first panic attack there and my life has never been the same.

When I skipped town in the middle of the night I ruined the best opportunity I’ve ever had. I pissed it away and burned bridges that will limit my career growth in the future. I became very depressed following and I still think about it every day. 

I felt I had my anxiety under control until I went to Memphis for New Years. I had yet another panic attack for unknown reasons and embarrassed myself in front of all of my friends and people I did not know. That was the most humiliating moment of my life. Ever since then I have had no social confidence. I am afraid that anytime I go out or leave town that I am going to become paralyzed by whatever this awful thing is. 

I am now in a situation where I have another great opportunity in Chattanooga that I was supposed to start tomorrow. Instead, while packing for this internship I became overcome and crippled by yet another panic attack. Nothing should have triggered it. I was in the comfort of my own home after enjoying some family time. I had no external pressure form school. Yet it still happened.

So now, I am completely at a loss. I have no confidence in myself to go anywhere or do anything. I know how important going away for internships is for a successful career, yet I have no confidence in my ability to control my anxiety. 

I have to decide between suppressing my career growth further by quitting before I start or risk getting down there and having a debilitating panic attack. If I choose not to go, I have to first explain to my professor, who has stuck his neck out for me many times, why I cannot go after he set me up yet again. Then I have to put my tail between my legs and explain to all of my friends how my anxiety ruined another of my internships. If I do go, I risk having a panic attack and having no way to control it. Maybe I don’t, but at this moment I can’t see outside a future where I can control the outcome. "

I hit a joint three or four times on Spring Break today and am now a little nervous about passing. I haven’t smoked since the weekend after New Year’s Day and that was splitting a bowl with a few friends. I smoked a handful of times over the Holiday period before that, sporadically (once or twice a month at most) in the fall of 2017, and had taken a very long t-break for essentially all of the summer of 2017. All of my smoke sessions over that time period have been only a couple of hits in just one session per day. I workout anywhere from 3-6 times per week depending on how busy I am and have held to that schedule relatively strictly over that time period as well.

I haven’t actually been sent an email concerning the time to take the drug test yet, but was told I’d be receiving more information sometime this month (March). A few of my colleagues with similar internships lined up have had a 2 week period in which to schedule and take the drug test at Quest. **Do you think I will be able to pass by just abstaining from smoking from now until then?** I was planning on upping my workout schedule + adding creatine when I got home from Spring Break anyways so I am now planning on doing that then stopping exercise for a day or two and eating greasy foods around the specific time I schedule the test."
84k9uk,1,2018-03-15,Another one Negotiating Salary. From intern to full time position.,travisty518,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/84k9uk/another_one_negotiating_salary_from_intern_to/,"Background: I'm 26 years old and 2 years ago decided to go back go school to really start a career in something that interested me. 

Sorry in advance for long read!

I currently work at a company and am considered an intern. I was originally hired on as a ""student help employee"" where they hire students to help with manufacturing during the summer, but I stayed on while I was in school and worked part time. I'm in school for Industrial Maintenance Technician (or electromechanical technician is another name for it) and will be graduating from the 2 year program in May with a 4.0 GPA. So far, since I started in June, I have been working in the circuit board department hand soldering components onto boards and occasionally learning how to run the machines. I was also required to get a certain amount of Maintenance intern hours for my school program, so work allowed me to designate my Fridays to strictly a maintenance internship, while continuing hand soldering the other days I work and am now considered an intern rather than student help. (Currently only making $13 per hour which is what all interns make there, which I was okay with since they work so well with my school schedule and it's a great place to work that's close to home) 

My circuit board department manager talked to me the other day about when I'm done with school. He was hoping I could stay in his department and be the ""designated electromechanical tech"" for his machines, since the other machine maintenance techs also have to worry about the rest of the factory. I asked for a little more info and was told I'd be learning the machines and software and working on them when they need work, and debugging, testing and fixing circuit boards and learning basically every part of the department and said I'd be the ""jack off all trades"" there. He told me I'd be considered an ""electronics technician"". Honestly, it sounds like a position I'd enjoy.

I asked what a salary range is for that position and was told they start all there Electronics Technicians at $17.50 per hour and I have some concerns about that. If they hire me on at the starting pay of all Electronics Technicians of $17.50, I'd be doing the jobs of the regular technicians, but will also be the only qualified person to be an electromechanical tech in that department and will be fixing the machines as well. I feel that qualifies for a higher salary by itself as I'd have higher qualifications and have more responsibility. Also, according to my school, the average starting pay for what I'm going to school for is usually $20+. 

I plan on also talking to my facilities manager and seeing what is offered in the machine maintenance position, and that covered the whole factory rather than that one department, and I know the pay for that tops out at $32.50 where I work (although I'm not sure how long it would take to get there or what the starting pay is). 

My manager said we'd speak more next Tuesday. I plan on negotiating for a higher starting wage and seeing what the range is within the next few years. I feel that having two years of schooling in that field with a lot of hands on experience as well as experience on those machines and in that department justifies a higher starting pay than someone just coming off the street and starting there fresh. I've been there since June of 2017 and it will be about a year of working there by the time this job positions is official for me. 

I was curious if anyone thinks that asking to start at $20-$22+ per hour is justified based on what's stated above. If that pay isn't an option I'd likely have to search for something new and start somewhere else. I really like the company and really like working there (plus it's only about a mile from where I live), but I don't want to be so far behind on the pay for what I went to school for and don't want to be taken advantage of. Part of me feels like they see me as a person they can use for all these different jobs, but only pay me the basic starting pay for one position, but I feel like I'm worth more than that. I could probably go somewhere else and make a couple more dollars an hour, but wouldn't be as happy working there as I am here.  

Any input would be greatly appreciated!!

Tldr; getting offered $17.50 for position that everyone starts at. They want me to do that position along with other jobs and I have experience there and schooling behind me. What's reasonable to ask for?"
84kgdx,0,2018-03-15,Me [22M] with my [20F] 9 months. Dealing with the prospect of not seeing her for over half the year.,throwsoutway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/84kgdx/me_22m_with_my_20f_9_months_dealing_with_the/,"It's late and I can't sleep and this is weighing heavy on my mind and reddit is the only place I think I can vent this and someone anonymously will care to listen.

A little context: This is my first girlfriend. I've kinda messed around with people my whole life and never gotten into a serious relationship. But now here I am.

We got together over the summer and I thought it was just a summer fling (she also had just broken up with her boyfriend of like 2 years and didn't trust that she was over him enough to turn around and date me) so I didn't label us anything because:

* See parenthesis above, I figured it would be better for her to be truly single back at school to ""get over her ex"". Really thought I was a rebound haha

* I didn't want my first girlfriend to be long distance.

* Tbh wasn't sure if I wanted to give up a life of doing as I pleased with whoever for a single girl.

Yeah I was very wrong. She wore me down after a few months of her trying the single life and hating it. Wanting to be with me the whole time.

It's honestly crazy to me that girl was so down for me. Still kinda is. I don't get what she sees in me. But she's been an amazing girlfriend ever since!

We're doing the ~~long~~ distance thing. I can't 100% say it's a LDR because we met in her hometown at work back when she was a senior in HS (I go to school here) and she goes to school now in my hometown.

Fast forward after all that, we have a great relationship. See each other most weekends. Doesn't even feel like distance half the time. Maybe cause I'm used to my dad working out of town all week and seeing him on weekends. Wow, I'm distracted.

I'm a senior in college now graduating soon. I'm looking forward to freedom and most importantly, being able to see my girl while she's in town all summer!

Then she gets her travel urge and decides to go volunteer for a month in a foreign country. That's awesome. I support that. She leaves like 2 weeks after I graduate but I can survive a month without her easy...

Well that's what I thought. Till she got accepted at a once in a lifetime internship next semester circa 800 miles away.

She asked me what I thought and if she should accept it. Now I know what it truly feels like to be in a rock and a hard place.

I've learned I hate the illusion of choice. Like I knew as soon as I got accepted she was gonna go. And I'm super proud of her and want her to chase her opportunities... but at the expense of our precious time together.

She thinks she's being selfish for doing this. But, I think I'm selfish because in my heart I don't want her to go. Counting this semester we don't see each other most weeks, her volunteer trip, and this new internship... It's March and I feasibly won't see my girlfriend for over half the year.

Add this to the typical angst of watching her do all this stuff coupled with the ""fuck I'm graduating... what the fuck am I doing with MY life now???"" and this is weighing on my mental so heavy.

I don't know what to do about this. Obvious answers would be to ""tough it out, if you really care"" or ""break up with her if you don't think you can do it""

I really don't know what will happen. I'm afraid I'll lose her from all this. This is going to be what I feared. *True distance*

Sure you hear stories of people making it work and I commend them. But that's over half of 2018 with no date nights, watching our shows, cuddles, sex, etc.

Lastly, I'm a realist here. No matter how much I convince myself I could do this. I can't rule out the potential of someone else coming around in my loneliness and falling for her... but the same could be said for her while she's away.

I trust the strength of our relationship... but that feasibly could happen.

I just really dunno what I'm gonna do guys... if I even can do anything. *Thanks for any comments in advance guys*

**[TL;DR: My first girlfriend who's already kinda distance is gonna be gone for half the year across the country and out of the country. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do. Need advice.]**"

Hello /r/Germany,

I am a United States citizen and will be interning in Berlin this summer and just learned that I will need either an Aufenthaltserlaubnis or a Visum as my internship will be running exactly 90 days. I [read online]^^1  that if I intend to start working immediately (my internship starts four days after I arrive in Berlin), I would need to get a visa from the consulate as opposed to obtaining an Aufenthaltserlaubnis. My original plan was to obtain the Aufenthaltserlaubnis the day after I arrived in Berlin, but I also [just learned]^^2  that the following is also required to apply for an Aufenthaltserlaubnis:
&gt;eine Anmeldebestätigung des Einwohnermeldeamts

It doesn't appear to me to be very likely to be able to visit both the Einwohneramt and the Ausländerbehörde on the same day, and would be a huge risk if something didn't go right and I couldn't start working the following Monday (I will be arriving on Thursday evening and I presume the government offices are closed on the weekend).

The reason why I am hesitant to get a Visum is that it is an expensive (for a college student) 6 hour one way trip that I would much rather not have to do with my full time schedule of work and school. I guess I just have a few questions:

* Has anybody been in a similar situation, where either an Aufenthaltserlaubnis or a Visum are both options for being in Germany more than 90 days? Why did you pursue one option over the other?

* I will be living through an arrangement made in WG-gesucht. There has been no exchange of money and no contract, how do I obtain the proper forms that are needed by the Einwohneramt?

* How long does the Visum process usually take? [The consulate website]^^3  says that it normally takes 1-3 months. I will be interning in a little over two months. Has anybody had any experience with the Visa timeframe?

Many thanks for your help! Mein Deustsch ist nicht so schlimm, wenn das eine Betrachtung für die Aufenthaltserlaubnis gegen das Visum ist. Ich würde mein Deutsch als ""Flißend mit einigen Grammatischen Fehlern und eine Wortwahl die meine Herkunft verratet"" beschreiben.

Vielen Dank für eure Hilfe!

I did an internship in Madrid from November until January.

I found a room offered by an agency called OhMyRoom! which is part of TLS Group. Standard procedure, I had to pay a safety deposit. There weren't many problems during my stay there, but their actions after I moved out are unacceptable.

After moving out your deposit has to be returned to you according to the terms stated in the contract. Apparently they do not care about this. The lease contract clearly stated that the deposit would be returned within a maximum of 30 working days. Which should have been Friday March 2nd, already two weeks ago now.

The process was taking quite a while so I sent two emails to their customer service department, which informed me that they had sent my information to the finance department and that they would take care of it. After the term stated in the contract was almost up, I was contacted by someone that supposedly took over the financial department telling me they were working on 'inefficiencies'. I was then informed that my deposit would be returned to me in recurrent bank transfers on the 20th of each month until the full amount is settled.

This is absolutely unacceptable and highly unprofessional as I need my OWN money to be returned to me.

Is there any legal action I can take or official institution I can file a complaint with?

84l443,1,2018-03-15,Update: Success on Yaz birth control,ricecrispie808,PCOS,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/84l443/update_success_on_yaz_birth_control/,"*I did post this before but reddit crashed so idk if it went through, so here's it again

Some people wanted updates on how yaz helped with my pcos and it's exam time so I can't reply to all so I hope whoever was interested reads this. 

Here's the benefits I found with yaz:

- No more insomnia
- Regular periods
- Extremely reduced hirsutism
(This was a major game changer for me. I was at that point where I was having to tweeze/shave underneath my chin daily, and it really affected my self-esteem. But on yaz, especially this 2nd month, the hair growth is much much slower. There's only 4/5 stubborn thick hairs I need to tweeze away... Maybe every 3 days. A huge improvement!)
- Very minimal period pain
- Less hair fall on scalp

Cons of yaz:
- I had major headaches in the last week of last month, but I was also sick, so idk if it was the yaz completely. 
- A little expensive on a student budget, because yaz is not usually covered by medical aid.

My opinion on yaz:

I was very scared to go on Yaz because every second person online is warning you about blood clots. But it's the only treatment in which I've seen actual results so far, it makes having pcos a lot less depressing and I've never felt more confident to just go to class and walk in the sun without the light hitting my face in the wrong angle and people will see hair growth.

I have a lot less anxiety. I was on my 4th month without a period. I was constantly thinking about infertility and endometrial cancer. Atleast on Yaz, there's a less chance of that because you're having regular periods.

I am a college student. I also live about 1300km away from my university so every 3 months or so I'm back home. My schedule is insanely busy and very irregular, it's hard for me to gym daily and also have enough money to buy 3 times the usual veggies I would buy as I'm on a low carb diet. I couldn't make all these changes and still keep up with school from 8am till 5pm, projects, internship meetings, etc. Birth control gave me a grace period, I'm slowly transitioning into low carb, no-processed sugar diet, finding an exercise regime I like. It doesn't feel like I have to do all this by tomorrow or I'll be infertile (hyperbolic, I know, but it's how I used to feel).

I know birth control is just hiding pcos symptoms but yaz made me feel more ""normal"" in a way, it keeps me motivated to exercise and actually keep on the diet because bc makes you feel like the pcos is not out of your control. I don't have the will power or time to just wait and see if the keto-resistance training 'cure' works. Since I'm on yaz for 6 months, it gives me a timeline in which I can get a handle on my insulin resistance and then work on maintaining my pcos symptoms through exercise and diet. 

For anyone thinking of going on yaz, i highly suggest it, make sure it's the right kind of birth control for you, and also make sure the pharmacy does not give you a generic. If you're worried, read up on Yaz on actual medical journals, NOT only online forums, especially things before 2015. And remember if you're only going on yaz for hormonal imbalance/period regulation, most doctors will set you on a course for 3-6 months. So it's not that daunting when you think about it! :) 

Hope this helps xx

I'll keep personal details to a minimum but...
I'm 23, born and raised in Exeter, Devon. June was the month I graduated from Falmouth University with a degree in creative advertising. I had a fairly okay portfolio that landed me a couple Internships in social media and copy writing, but honestly I wanted to shoot for something a bit higher than a property company looking for a ""Facebook spammer"". I became aware that my portfolio was not up to date and I needed to showcase brilliant work and not just work that would impress a university lecturer if I wanted to move up in the world. 


Starting today I am looking for anyone and everyone to create a new Advertising portfolio with, completely fresh from the ground up. The work will mainly be brief lead and I am looking to work with as many people as possible - The idea is to work as many people as possible regardless of their creative background but all of the work completed is solely for the purpose of our own portfolios. Keep in mind I'm not looking for an easy way out, this line of work can be extremely difficult and I'm looking for other individuals who would want to collaborate with me. So if your an aspiring creative regardless of field, for example you could be in Media, Film, Illustration, script writing, Drawing, Animation or just someone who is looking to experience a different line of work. Please get in touch, as I am looking to broaden my horizons/line of work and gain insight from other Londoners regardless of your background and hopefully incorporate that into some truly kick ass work.


All I ask is that you are an open minded person with some time to spare to meet in person, as from experience I would say I'm definitely a hands on kind of guy. Plus it's sort of satisfying to scamp 30-40 different ideas with some drinks until you find the ""one"" that just blows the rest out of the water.

If you are not interested and maybe know someone who is, could you please pass my message on, I would really appreciate it! 
Please if you have any questions or are interested in tackling a brief with me get in touch.

84l7zs,2,2018-03-15,"Operator ideas: Crow, Eagle, Intern, Hidden",Thaumus___,Rainbow6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/84l7zs/operator_ideas_crow_eagle_intern_hidden/,"So the current operator meta the developers are focusing on right now are globals -- operators that affect the entire team; Dokkebi (ringing the entire enemy team's phone), Finka (buffing team), Lion (revealing moving enemy's position to team). So in that respect, I thought of some operators that might help with this meta:

CROW: Installs motion tracking into defender cameras, revealing the position of enemies while he is alive with two possible modes of activation:

It can operate on a ""Caviera Silent Step"" or ""Vigil scramble"" gadget timer. Any camera with visual of an enemy will reveal the position in real time (either like Caviera or Lion) to defenders.

OR it can run a set amount of times during a match for a certain amount of time.

I really think running as a rechargeable timer would work best, since not only does the operator need to be alive, but the camera would need to be not destroyed too.

Possible counter-balances include making the camera light shine brighter, and/or the camera whine/make noise. Dokkebi can scramble the system while her logic bomb is in place OR my favorite, reveal BOTH defender positions to attackers if hacked into the system and vice versa-- making her a double-edged sword if Crow wishes to use his gadget, not fully destroying his ability but somewhat hindering its usefulness. Perhaps Valkyrie can enhance his ability with her cameras OR be fully neutral with her cameras completely unable to use his ability since they can be thrown around willy-nilly -- HOWEVER, if the cameras make noise and shine brighter, that can counterbalance it.

Eagle: Make attackers ""spotted"" like defenders if outside (5 seconds) after a 60-second ""prep of gadget"" time after the start of the action phase. He has to survive that first 60 seconds, then he can activate his drone(s) that will spot attackers. If an attacker goes outside and spends some time being spotted (or multiple operators go outside at once) they can shoot the drone(s) down and disable his ability, or make his coverage spotty. Will be useful for bomb defusal and discourage attackers rappeling outside a window and listening for the destroying of the defuser.

Intern: less an operator and more of a suggestion of adding a whole new type of stat: passive buffs. Can spot defenders quicker than normal OR make their position spotting more accurate akin to lion. Other suggestions involve reviving operators with more health (or make an attacker doc), giving operators more ammo (or extended magazines), an attacker version of Rook, or longer bleed out times through bandages (or passive ability for Doc). Of course you could make these all operators and Intern could run on a rechargeable timer like Caviera or Vigil, making him an anti-defender-aggression-push operator. Should run on a rechargeable timer so he is useful for preventing defenders from pulling off cheeky retakes.

Hidden: Scrambles (through hacking or smoke screen) attacking team's ability to ""spot"" defenders outside by either clouding the area around the windows OR a canister on the defenders attached like a rook plate but on their leg. Will either delay or prevent the attackers spotting the enemy, OR only display to the attacking operators ""ENEMY DETECTED OUTSIDE"" but not give them any info of their operator info or location. If it is a personal smoke screen attached to the leg, the smoke screen can also double as obscuring the defender's bodies from the attackers, making headshots more difficult to pull off at the cost of a smoke screen obscuring the defender's POV and/or visibility of enemies slightly.

These will really flip the whole meta on its head I feel like. No clue if it'll be for better or worse but hey it's what I feel would trigger everyone since the whole idea of global operators seems to trigger you all. Hope you enjoyed the read, feedback appreciated :3"

I'm a 2nd  year student at Monash studying a double degree Engineering(Aerospace) and Commerce and I've got a few questions regarding the RMIT course.

1. I've heard about RMIT having an IBL/WIL program for courses such as engineering. Just wondering if you guys can give me any details about these programs such as whether I need to look for internships etc.

2. When can you go on exchanges and what is generally the minimum WAM required for exchanges. I was thinking of going to Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) or KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

3. Is there anyway for me to find out which units I can get credits for, or do I have to manually find it myself.


Might got a few questions later but that's all I can think of rn





Thanks."
84ls2v,1,2018-03-15,A Guide to the Top Research Universities in the US,DaleRobert,MeowEssay,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeowEssay/comments/84ls2v/a_guide_to_the_top_research_universities_in_the_us/,"Interested in attending one of the best research universities, but not sure where to start looking? This article provides you with the top 10 research universities, why they are ranked so, and why it is a great opportunity to attend such universities.  

**What is a Research University?**  
A research university is one that is not only dedicated to teaching their students, but is also involved with conducting research. In this type of university, professors can spend up to half their time working on research projects, as well as the classes they teach. These schools usually have higher expectations of students academically, especially when it comes to academic honesty. Some students dislike research universities because professors have to balance their time between teaching and their research, although many of them do a great job balancing the two. There are also some definite positives to this type of university, as they usually have room for undergraduates to help and participate in studies. Being a part of a research project can help with resumes, and with getting into higher institutions like graduate school.  

**Top Ten Option for You**  
According to the center for measuring university performance, research universities are ranked by their total research, federal research, national academy member, faculty awards, doctorates and post doctorates granted, and their ranges with SAT and ACT scores . Here is a list of the ten best research universities. All of thes are great choices with excellent research opportunities!  
  
1. Columbia University: This is a private institution with 104 national academy members, 33 faculty awards, 598 doctorates granted, and 808 post doctorates granted. Their SAT ranges are from 660 to 760.  
  
2. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: This is also a private institution with 254 national academy members, 44 faculty awards, 599 doctorates granted, and 1,037 post doctorates granted. Their SAT ranges are from 660 to 760.  
  
3. Stanford University: This is a private institution with 277 national academy members, 37 faculty awards, 673 doctorates granted, and 1,394 post doctorates granted. Their SAT ranges are from 660 to 760.  
  
4. Harvard University: This is a private institution with 327 national academy members, 112 faculty awards, 666 doctorates granted, and 4760 post doctorates granted. Their SAT ranges are from 700 to 800.  
  
5. University of Pennsylvania: This is a private institution with 93 national academy members, 25 faculty awards, 464 doctorates granted, and 915 post doctorates granted. Their SAT ranges are from 650 to 750.  
  
6. Duke University: This is a private institution with 53 national academy members, 29 faculty awards, 302 doctorates granted, and 759 post doctorates granted. Their SAT ranges are from 650 to 760.  
  
7.University of Michigan- Ann Arbor: This is a public institution with 77 national academy members, 55 faculty awards, 753 doctorates granted, and 573 post doctorates granted. Their ACT ranges are from 27 to 31.  
  
8. Yale University: This is a private institution with 104 national academy members, 33 faculty awards, 598 doctorates granted, and 808 post doctorates granted. Their SAT ranges are from 660 to 760.  
  
9. University of California – Berkeley: This is a public institution with 104 national academy members, 33 faculty awards, 598 doctorates granted, and 808 post doctorates granted. Their SAT ranges are from 660 to 760.  
  
10. University of California - Los Angeles: This is a public institution with 104 national academy members, 33 faculty awards, 598 doctorates granted, and 808 post doctorates granted. Their SAT ranges are from 660 to 760.  
  
**Decisions to Make**  
If you are an planning on attending a research university, be sure to take other important factors into account such as cost, how homey if feels, and how the university speaks to you. It can be important to pick a great research university for graduate and PhD programs, but undergraduates need to not worry about this as much. Even if the university you plan on attending is not a prestigious research university, there are many internship programs you can apply to in places all over the country. They are available during different times of the year to make it easy to get the experience you need."

(ps sorry for using my porn account, but reddit wants me to sign up with an e-mail, and i really dont want to)

September last year i was going home for my sisters 20th birthday, and to make a long story short, my parents told me that someone sexually assaulted my sister when she was 8 years old. They didnt know who, and what he did, only what she had told them. a few weeks went on with nothing happened, when suddenly my cousin called me from his vacation in the US to tell me that our family was split, as my mother, and her sister got angry at their youngest sister. He was told we would never see her kids, her, or my uncle ever again. My mother didnt want to talk about this with me, only that we would talk about it, when i got home again.

A few months passed, and my birthday was coming up, so i went to my parents to celebrate, and was told that the reason my family was split was because my sisters assault, was done by my uncle, and my mother once saw him looking at pictures of naked kids... my mind was broken and i didnt know what to do. I talked to the school people-person a few times, and it helped.. for now..

we are now in early january, and i got a mail from a place i had visited that they wanted me as their intern, and maybe a job, if they liked me enough. The day after I was talking with my GF... but things had been going bad in the relationship... I had been another place mentally for the last 5 months, and she was lusting for a guy in her class... not sexually, but she really wanted to kiss him, she was not in love, and did not like him in that way, but this was the second time she had felt this in the time we had been together, and to make it worse, we have never been in love, and she has never had an orgasm. 2 weeks later we met and broke up.

now i am in a place where i know they are sort of dating, my sister has fainted because she had not eaten for 10 days, and i am miserable, even though i am at my dream company... i dont know what to do... the only thing keeping me up, is the thoughts of my internship, masturbation, and seeing my ex when i get the chance. We are best friends, and had been together for 5 years, and i have no idea how to be single. I want to be intimite with someone, but i am afraid of thinking of her... i have never been this low ever in my life, and i seriously dont know what to do. I will never move on. it is almost like i dont know what to do, if she is not there... i dont want to live this kind of life. Now i dont have suicidal thoughts, but i simply do not know what to do, if we dont start being together. I know she has it hard to, but she is still kind of date the guy, so i dont feel like she has it hard... i need some kind of help... i need to be intimate... but i dont know how"

First time posting here, but the time has come to leverage all the forums I can (been through a lot these few weeks... ._.) to see if I can get pushed in the right direction. 

I am a ML Research Intern for my uni. My professor currently would like to integrate TensorFlow into his (rather large) .NET project. I know of TensorFlow's [C Bindings](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/language_bindings), but it seems rather limited in what it can do (no gradients, no nn library, etc.). I then looked at [TensorFlowSharp](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp), which really is just an API built on the C Bindings of TensorFlow, which, as stated is not necessarily complete. 

I've been running around trying to find a way to come as close as I can to using TensorFlow as I've used it with Python, but interfacing with this project has been a nightmare. 

**The question**: Does anyone have an ideas on how TensorFlow best integrates with C#? 

**Follow up**: Would it be easier to write everything in Python TensorFlow, then execute it somehow from within the C# project? 

Thanks everyone in advance. "

I anticipate having a 3.7 overall GPA (I don't know if that factors into salary or not) and a Bachelor's in Computing with an IT focus and an IS minor. On my resume I have a 6 month internship with great industry experience as well as 2 on-campus jobs with relevant industry experience that I am currently working. I live in the greater Pittsburgh area and plan on working in the same area.

So with that all in mind, what kind of salary should I expect? I technically have almost a year's experience all said and done and great grades. I will most likely be filling entry-level positions or similar positions.

I was asked in a phone interview this morning what my salary expectations were and I had 0 clue what to say. I mentioned the 40-45k range that my university mentioned at orientation for members of my major (""40-50k right out of college"" in their words) and was told that was slightly high. This was an interview with a pretty wealthy, large, global company so it wasn't a rinky-dink ma and pop operation that would stiff me.

So going forward what should I expect to be paid, what shouldn't I be settling for, and what answer should I give for those type of questions?? What am I worth essentially lol Any help would be MUCH appreciated.

I can understand this fact: If you are coming in as a CS major without anything extra in terms of AP classes or summer classes under your belt, you’re going to have a hard (but not impossible) time. 

Here are some tactics I’ve seen students do that make them successful.

UCSC prioritizes enrollment times by the number of credits a student has. IIRC it was like 49.5 to be a sophomore, 89.5 to be a junior, and 100-soemthing to be a senior. Students with 3+ AP Classes + a CC course + they take their 15 units fall quarter will quickly become sophomore standing in their first year. These are the students who are able to take classes a day earlier than their peers. Now imagine these same students applying for 20+ credits per quarter. There are students taking 24-30 units per quarter in order to increase their credit count (and they also do well in these classes), and then take summer courses. A freshmen taking CS101 their summer before sophomore year will allow them to potentially finish their core requirements by the end of their sophomore year. That’s huge, and that allows them to be even junior standing by the middle/end of their sophomore year. 

Taking something from this – the more credits you have, the better off you’ll be getting classes. Tactics such as taking more credits per quarter, taking summer classes, or independent study credits with a research team, are all methods of gaining additional credits. 

Now, *putting on developers hat*. If you want to succeed. Taking classes ONLY at ucsc is not sufficient in succeeding after graduation. If you are a freshmen, you should start learning basics and doing small projects freshmen year, building up to an internship the summer between freshmen and sophomore year. If you start early, you can get at least 2-3 internships by the time you graduate college and applying to full time jobs. These will pay off much more than classes and will make you look way better competitively than students who take classes, get an A, and have no projects or internships on their resumes. Take up hackerrank, leetcode easy/medium, cracking the coding interview, and treat it as your weekly routine to do at least one problem a week when you’re just starting school. They all add up and by the time you’re at your senior year, you’ll be incredibly job ready competitive offers in the horizons. 

I'm always available for a PM if anyone has concerns or questions regarding how to prep for the job market! Love to help out new developers from UCSC and watch them succeed.

84o4o5,16,2018-03-15,Confusing frat bro stuff...looking for any advice please.,I-V-vi-IV,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/84o4o5/confusing_frat_bro_stufflooking_for_any_advice/,"Alright, I apologize for the long message. Don't really have anyone else I can turn to.

I am currently a senior in college...just got off spring break and things got a bit more complicated between one of my fraternity brothers and me. 

So a bit of background... my friend and I are both bi and out, but our weird relationship started during sophomore summer a few years back. When I first joined the frat I sort of had a bit of a crush on him (at the time he wasn't really out yet) and could kind of tell he seemed a bit interested, but just assumed he was straight since he had a girlfriend at the time. So anyway, over that summer a few of us had stayed in a house together for internship shit and one night when we were both a bit tipsy, he comes right out to me and tells me he has a crush on me. Thinking he was kidding I sort of wave it off and joke with him...said something stupid like "" Oh yeah I bet you do bro"" and he, understandably,  seemed pretty upset by that. Right after I said that one of our other friends came downstairs and we went our seperate ways for the night. The next morning I asked if he wanted to hang out and talk about what had happened hoping to explain that I also was crushing on him a bit. He ignores my messages and whenever I came up to him in person he would sort of just awkwardly ignore me and skeet off. He was probably kind of embarrassed by it all...and I felt awful after being so insensitive. Weeks pass and only after we have a bit of alcohol in us do we start to be more open. We start just going on walks during our parties...just chatting and having fun. Whenever I tried to bring up the night he told me he liked me and to try and tell him I was being insensitive and that he shouldn't feel embarrassed for his feelings toward me, he would just change topics or skeet off elsewhere and not speak to me for weeks. After months of trying to get him to open up a bit eventually I just give up and we don't speak about it for the next few years. We sort of fall out of each others lives, he gets a girlfriend and I'm doing my own thing, and we pretend to be bros and shit but after that night everything was different. 

So now...spring break senior year rolls around and we are staying at the same house. He still has a girlfriend (I am single btw) and he loves to talk about her in front of me and tells us everything they do together. I still like him...I mean, he's kind of an asshole, but pobody's nerfect.

Over break we start getting much closer. Opening up to each other a bit more, he starts to tell me more about what he's been up to (we literally never speak one on one with each other), and I start to crush on him all over again...and I think he can tell. He then told me how he doesn't really like his current girlfriend and plans on dumping her soon. I don't bring up any of our past history since I don't want him to ignore me for weeks again. He then asks if we wanted to take a walk together, but right as he says that our friends come from downstairs and we end up going to the bars. Not thinking too much of it, we end up going out and get pretty hammered. Wanting to get my game on, I start speaking with girls at the bar (I don't usually talk to girls back at school) and every single time I was talking to some chick he would come up absolutely hammered and start trying to talk to her. That happened at least 5 or 6 times. I would be talking to someone and he would rush up and start drunkenly rambling to her at which point she would just take off. I would then start talking with someone else and he just did the exact same thing...it was really fucking annoying and embarrassing. I tried to pull him off to the side to ask wtf he was doing and he would just ignore me and skeet off.

So here we are...I'm sitting at the airport right now writing this (we are taking different flights home so I am alone) and we haven't spoken since last night. This morning we just kind of ignored each other...I'm still kind of mad at him for it.

How the hell do I handle this? I don't want to bring it up and just have him ignore me for the rest of college. I also don't want to ignore it completely. I really like him, and I don't wanna go our seperate ways without us at least talking this over. Why is he being like this? 

Any advice would be awesome...thanks guys."

""Morning, Vanessa.""

""Good morning, sir! You have a sales meeting at 10 downstairs and lunch with Dr. Jones at 1. I've already made reservations at the usual place and sent her directions. Mr. Jefferson also asked for a call before you two meet with the board tomorrow so I scheduled him for 3pm, sir."" Like every morning, you ended with a big smile, seemingly proud of your little announcement. You should be, seeing how you've been one heck of a PA for the past year. Albeit the fantastic administrative skills, it's not the only thing that has helped you kept your job until now.

""Thank you, Vanessa."" I said approvingly. ""Anything else?""

Your makeup barely hid your blushing red cheeks as you swept the entire floor to make sure most of the senior management were either busy talking on their phones or absent from their offices.

""I've received your gift, sir, I'll go put it on now."" Your voice drastically softened. You unzipped the LV handbag I got you for your birthday and took out a black plastic bag. In a rushing manner, you stood up and started heading towards the toilet before I grabbed you by your arm and pulled you back into your seat. You let out a gasp in shock and frantically checked to see if anyone had noticed before looking up at me, ""sir?""

""Do it right here. At your desk."" You nodded, placed the plastic bag on your desk, then watched and waited obediently as I entered my office to lay down my things. After I gave a slight nod from my chair, you looked around one last time before pulling up your pencil skirt. Your juicy thighs made the process that much harder as you went back and forth between lifting your skirt a few centimeters and sliding your hand in, attempting to reach your underwear. Just watching you struggle to remove your panties while seated made me rock hard. If it wasn't white, I wouldn't have noticed the patch of wetness as you finally slid the panties down your thighs, knees, ankles, and off your legs. As you swivelled back to reach of the bag, the phone rang, making you jump a little.

""I want you to know how you taste like yourself, Vanessa"" was all you heard from the familiar voice.

You opened up the bag, took the black, laced panties and turned back to face me. Before putting the new ones on, you took the wet, worn, white one sitting on your lap and slowly placed it in your mouth. ""Good girl"" I didn’t have to say it but it was understood from my approving smile and light nod. Then, as ordered, you put on the panties I've gotten for you and sat there awaiting new instructions. I signalled you to come in with one hand while pulling out my phone with the other. With another hand signal, you proceeded to drop all the blinds, a big ""do not fucking disturb"" to everyone else in the office.

After handing you a stack of paper, I instructed you to balance them on your head. You do exactly that, confused, but without a hint of surprise. After all, you've obeyed weirder requests before. Seconds passed as you continued to wonder what was going on before a sudden jolt of sensation gathered between your thighs and immediately rushed towards the rest of your body. “Ahhh!” You almost collapsed to the ground as your limbs lose strength for but a moment. The stack of paper fell off your head and made a mess of my office. Worried about being punished, you quickly got on all fours and started to pick up the papers, all the while trying to ignore the vibrating panties you were wearing. I got out of my chair and made my way to you, admiring your meaty thighs and beautiful buttocks that were pushing your tight, black, pencil skirt to its limits.

Finally, you finished collecting the entire stack of paper and stood up to have me standing right in front of you, my warm breath upon your forehead sent shivers down your spine. Or were you shivering because of the panties that were still vibrating? I reached around and gave both your butt cheeks a tight slap and squeeze. I then moved around until I felt the zipper before pulling it open, loosening your suffocating skirt. After taking the stack of papers that were still in your hands and placing them on my desk, I grabbed your hands and placed them on my shoulders. 

“Take the skirt off” I commanded, just to watch you wriggle your hips side to side, a soft moan escapes your mouth each time your actions pressed the vibrating panties against your soaking pussy. When the skirt finally fell to the ground, your juices had already made their way down the side of your thighs to your knees. I unzipped my pants to free my fully erected member. You attempted to reach for it but was shocked when I hit them and placed them back on my shoulders.

I pulled you closer in, and felt your chest pressed against mine. Your beautiful eyes held a hint of desperation as I tilted your head up before leaning in for a long kiss. As our lips found each other’s, I reached down to slide myself in between your moist pussy and the vibrating panties. Gently, I thrusted my hips back and forth as you synchronized your moaning to me. Your hands met behind my neck and you hooked onto me for support as your breaths became shorter and moans became louder.

“I’m...coming...sir.” Your naturally sensitive clit was always my favorite part of you. I moved your hips to the rhythm with my hands, achieving harder and faster thrusts. Soon, I was close too. I let out a deep groan accompanying your loud squeal, my load gushed into your panties and eventually leaked out. You leaned entirely on me for the next couple of minutes, unbothered to clean the mixture of fluids on your legs. Eventually, you got to your feet, took off the panties, and wiped yourself clean.

I cupped your bare pussy and gave it a good rub before helping you put your skirt back on. “Don’t catch a cold, Vanessa.” You let our an embarrassing smile and nodded. After tidying ourselves up, we left the office and headed downstairs for the meeting.

——————————

Long prompt, I know, but that's just how I like to live. I’m looking for a girl to be my PA. Someone efficient, loyal, obedient, and horny. You might be a young intern in your first ever job, or a mature office lady who just transferred. We might both be in a relationship or we might both be single. All details are up for discussion.

Kinks related to this include, but are not limited to: cheating, office wear, risky (almost getting caught) sex acts, dom/sub, orgasm control.

Limits include, but are not limited to anal play and the usual extremes: blood, gore, vore, scat, puke etc.

Besides all that, I am willing to try taking the role of GM/observer if you have a particular partner that you loved to role play with and want to invite him/her to do this with you. I would love to learn from watching a good role play experience.

If the prompt interests you, send me a message and I'll be sure to respond no matter what. I like my role plays full of written details intertwined with a line or two of dialogue. That said, all participants (you &amp; I included) must be fairly literate and I would expect the length of your RP replies to compliment mine. The prompt is mostly just for your understanding about the relationship between the characters and the style of writing I’m looking for. We can start the role play from any time/day so long as our characters’ relationships are maintained.

Final note: I will reply to each and every message regarding this prompt so if you don’t get one immediately, I’m probably asleep or caught up in work."

84ofv9,8,2018-03-15,Motivating yourself to socially network more,Denzel_Fenrir,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/84ofv9/motivating_yourself_to_socially_network_more/,"I'm currently in University studying for a Business Management degree. Two semesters into the school term and I feel like I've not been socially networking as much as I should have. 

As a business student (or a student in any field actually), university is the best time and place to expand your social network, which grants you access to advice from seniors, internship opportunities, etc.

However, as an INTJ who enjoys socialising with in small groups of close friends, I've been lacking the motivation to commit myself to extended social situations which involve interacting with large groups of strangers/acquaintances (e.g. joining camp organisation committees). 

While I've no problems networking using my sociable facade, I'm probably afraid of the dreadful social fatigue at the end of the day, hence I've been avoiding voluntarily exposing myself to such networking situations.

I think many would recommend joining a club I'm interested in, but many of my hobbies do not have an active club (e.g. sure, we have a gaming club but not many would wanna play video games in school when they can do it at home with their consoles/gaming rigs)

**So my question is: How do you motivate yourself to step out of your comfort zone and throw yourself in large-group social situations?** "

84ow3v,28,2018-03-15,"Productivity app with tasks and subtasks, represented in a graph or flowchart-like style according to their dependencies, and with recurring tasks and every day reminders",sorokine,androidapps,https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/84ow3v/productivity_app_with_tasks_and_subtasks/,"Hello everyone,

I am looking for an app to structure things I want to do in my life. I want to organize stuff in several hierarchical layers, with end goals, intermediate goals, tasks and subtasks, that are all linked together by dependencies.

To give an example: Let's say one of my big goals is called ""career"", a sub goal could be ""learn how to program"", a sub-sub-goal would be ""finish your programming project "", and a task could be ""work on the project"", with the app set to remind me of that task every day. 
Another sub goal to ""career"" could be ""get internship"", and I could have a deadline there until March. The two sub goals would both have an arrow or some graphical element pointing to the big goal ""career"". Like that, all the tasks are organized in a tree-like hierarchical structure, point towards end goals. Otherwise, the app would work like most productivity apps do - with reminders and such. Stuff like pomodoros, or tracking progress with progress bars, etc. would be a nice extra, but not a need.

I can find a lot of reminder apps that do not have hierachical organized goals. And I can find lots of drawing / organizing apps that don't have the productivity-thing going on, with reminding me about tasks according to my specification. Is there something that I'm missing? I would be glad about every suggestion.

Thanks a lot everyone!

84p0bj,3,2018-03-15,The Changeling,Slut-Problems,SlutProblems,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlutProblems/comments/84p0bj/the_changeling/,"I know Nathan didn’t see me coming. I know he’d only seen me in one environment, and that was all. He had no way of knowing my secret, and I’d given him no indication that I was anything other than the squeaky clean professional I had always presented myself as at work. But I was about to surprise him. I was about to capitalize on an opportunity I’d been waiting a long time for. 

When he’d first started at the office I had taken notice. I hung back as the interns and secretaries took their swings at him. He dated a few of them, but he grew quickly bored with them. I could see that he needed something of more substance, something deeper and darker than the wispy-headed little girls that worked with us. He needed me, and I needed him. Only, I knew how to get what I wanted, and I knew it was best to wait. I knew he would come to me if I was patient. I would make him see what kind of woman I was. 

Every day I chipped away at him with my wit and charm. I knew my outfits hugged my curves but I never showed my hand. I let him think I wasn’t interested. I watched his eyes pan over my body, and rest at my tits. I watched him laugh at my jokes and touch my arm to make a point. Before I knew it he was bringing me coffee and buying me lunch. I always kept it friendly, until the night we took the trip to Austin to do a presentation we’d been assigned to together. 

“Come by my room at eight to go over the presentation a final time,” I reminded him after dinner. We’d had a few drinks and he had been staring deep into my eyes with interest. He hung on every word I said. I had him right where I wanted him. Tonight was the night.

“I’ll be there,” he said with a casual smile and I couldn’t believe the time had come. I was finally going to show Nathan my truth. I was excited, but nervous as I took a shower, preparing my body for what I was about to do. It felt right, and I wrapped the hotel robe around my body and waited for him to arrive. I did a little dance in the mirror, just like in the old days when I used to be a stripper. I still had the moves, even though my body was older now, and wiser. 

The knock at the door shocked me back into reality. I wasn’t a stripper anymore. I was here with Nathan, and I was about to take what I wanted. I threw open the door and giggled. “You caught me in my robe. But come on in.” 

“You look warm and cozy. Snuggly,” he said, touching the arm of my robe. 

“Yeah, well, it’s a bit warm. Let me take this off and put on some clothes,” I said and I unfastened the belt of the robe and lifted it off of my shoulders before letting it slide to the ground. My body was naked underneath and Nathan’s mouth dropped open when he saw my toned body and my perfect tits I’d paid good money for back in the old days. 

“You have tattoos,” he said. 

“Surprised?” I asked. 

“Yes. Very. You don’t seem like the type to get tattoos,” he said. “But you don’t seem like the type to throw off a robe like that. You look so…” he couldn’t finish. He was shaking his head back and forth in disbelief and I smiled seductively. 

“There’s a lot you don’t know about me,” I said. He moved closer and before I knew it his arms were wrapped around me and he was pulling me in for a deep kiss. I let it happen, and I let his hands move all over my body. They ran over my ass and moved to my tits. He squeezed them in his hands as his mouth moved over mine. 

“Fuck…” he moaned into my mouth and I began to help him out of his shirt, and then his pants. His cock was better than I imagined and I worshipped it with my hands first, moving them over him expertly. I watched his face as I gave him the kind of hand job men pay good money for. I saw the light turn on his eyes as his cock grew in my hands. 

“Eve!” he moaned. 

“What is it Nathan? Do you want me to suck your cock?” my voice was as wispy as those dumb girls back at the office. I sounded like a slut, like a sex kitten. Nathan heard it and he smiled. 

“Yeah. Suck my dick. Please…” he begged and so I dropped to my knees and I showed him exactly how good I was at giving blow jobs. I had to hold back a bit, because I didn’t want to make him cum yet. I knew I’d proven my point as I told him to get up on the bed, and sit with his back against the headrest. I climbed up onto his cock in reverse cowgirl. I didn’t want him to see the look on my face when I turned. I knew that as soon as my pussy slid down onto his cock, the woman he knew would disappear and another woman would take over. My inner slut was ready to come out, and I let her surface as I backed my pussy up onto his cock. 

“Holy fucking shit!” Nathan moaned as my pussy gripped his cock for the first time. “I’ve wanted this for so long!” 

“I’ll bet,” I said, the slut unleashed inside of me. Now I was the girl I’d always been, the one that used to ride cocks for a living, the girl who used to give hand jobs on the playground, the girl who used to fuck her father’s friends. Now I was the slut I’d always been and I knew Nathan could feel the change in me. I knew he could tell by the way I was riding him that I was a seasoned slut. I knew that he was wondering what he had gotten himself into with me. But he didn’t have much time to think because my orgasms began. 

I fucking used Nathan’s cock to make myself cum time after time, stopping just short of allowing him to cum. I edged him with my cunt, bringing him so close and then making him wait. 

“Please! Eve! Make me cum!” he begged. 

“I’ll let you cum when I’m done using this cock!” the slut inside of me snapped at him. 

“Of course! Fuck! Yes!” he moaned as my pussy came again. His cock was extra special to me. I’d made myself wait a long time for this. I’d stalked him from afar and planned my moves carefully, all for this moment. And I was going to enjoy it. I was going to cum my fucking ass off. I knew he needed to cum. I knew his balls were full and so I reached down and grabbed his sac with my hand and gripped him tightly as I moved faster and faster. I rubbed just underneath his balls, massaging his prostate until I could feel his cock begin to release. 

“Fucking Jesus Christ!” Nathan screamed and the satisfaction filled me as I felt his cock surging as he came. I gripped his balls, feeling them drain as he ejaculated deep inside of me. I was panting as I came to a stop and let go of his balls. I pulled myself off of him and collapsed onto the bed next to him. 

“What the fuck was that?” he asked, turning to me, a shit-faced grin on his face. 

“Oh, by the way, I’m really good at sex,” I giggled. 

“What the fuck was that?” he repeated. “I have never been fucked like that. Where did you learn all of that? Damn. Fuck.” He looked so happy, and I was surprised he hadn’t figured it out. I must have done a good job of fooling him. By the way he wrapped his arm around me and tried to kiss me, I realized he still thought I was the girl from the office. I wondered how many times I’d have to fuck him before he would see the truth.

Really, I would love to work with anyone with communication disabilities or disorders. I wear hearing aids myself.

The opportunity came up to apply to be a intern with a service dog training program on my campus. Its a big commitment. As I understand, you are training the dogs and socializing them by bringing them with you around campus and to class. They prefer that the dog can live with them. 

Unfortunately I can't have the dog live with me, unless I get the Department of Residence Life to accept the dog into the dorm, which I may be able to do but it is unlikely.

What I need help with is how do I present myself as a good applicant? What do you think they are looking for, and from your perspective, what are some specific things you would look for in someone training a service dog?

Im just looking for things that I can express personally. This opportunity means a lot to me, and Im highly motivated because of my need for relevant experience. It would be a dream to work with service animals as a career. Im gonna be doing as much research as possible, but I was hoping anyone here could offer their insight.

I know tomorrow it'll seem like everyone and their mom matches at their #0 spot on the rank list. ""OMG, I matched at my -1 and I didn't even apply!! What do you mean you didn't get your #1!? They still make people like you??""

And you'll feel scared and confused, remembering the lie you told yourself while making your match list telling your mom, ""Well, of course, I'm ranking the University of Compton in East Dakota! It'll be better than not matching!""

Then when it happens and you realize you're moving to East Dakota... you'll want to cry and throw up and go through all the stages of grief including bargaining and denial. ""There was a glitch!! Run the algorithm again!!"" ... Replaying every moment of how you must've fucked up an interview and had a giant booger in your nose no one told you about...

But you'll try to hold it in because...(won't somebody please think of the children!) you'll remember all those who had to SOAP and Scramble and Frittata this week. And you'll feel relieved... Like the kid who has an ugly date to prom.

Eventually you'll come to realize that even though your date is a hideous beast with head gear and a scoliosis brace... They have a sense of humor, and you end up having fun as the night goes on, and maybe you even get lucky and score because, hey-- ugly people have sex too and isn't it all about the experience (err... medical license) anyway?

So, I want to let you know that you're not alone. Not only am I the president of, ""the rest of your rank list you didn't think you'd match at"" club... I'm also a member. And as my intern year draws to a close I can't imagine being anywhere else. It's part maturity, part resignation, and part Stockholm Syndrome... But it's all good. I love this place. (Smile and wave at my PD in the audience)

Tomorrow bring your tears and shock and vomit stained shoes to this thread. Share your deepest darkest regrets. You won't be judged. Just remember-- one man's trash residency is another man's gold and until you get drunk one night with all the other interns you'll never even know who ranked what and how low or high everyone else matched.

So brace yourself. Reality is coming.

84pg5w,3,2018-03-15,"Looking for a productivity app with tasks and subtasks and a graphical, hierarchical system of organizing them (like a flowchart)",sorokine,productivity,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/84pg5w/looking_for_a_productivity_app_with_tasks_and/,"Hello, I hope it's okay that I crosspost from /r/androidapps. Thank everyone so much in advance!

I am looking for an app to structure things I want to do in my life. I want to organize stuff in several hierarchical layers, with end goals, intermediate goals, tasks and subtasks, that are all linked together by dependencies.

To give an example: Let's say one of my big goals is called ""career"", a sub goal could be ""learn how to program"", a sub-sub-goal would be ""finish your programming project "", and a task could be ""work on the project"", with the app set to remind me of that task every day. Another sub goal to ""career"" could be ""get internship"", and I could have a deadline there until March. The two sub goals would both have an arrow or some graphical element pointing to the big goal ""career"". Like that, all the tasks are organized in a tree-like hierarchical structure, point towards end goals. Otherwise, the app would work like most productivity apps do - with reminders and such. Stuff like pomodoros, or tracking progress with progress bars, etc. would be a nice extra, but not a need.

I can find a lot of reminder apps that do not have hierachical organized goals. And I can find lots of drawing / organizing apps that don't have the productivity-thing going on, with reminding me about tasks according to my specification. Is there something that I'm missing? I would be glad about every suggestion."
84pire,168,2018-03-15,Nate Nanzer speaks at SXSW,kagechikara,Competitiveoverwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/84pire/nate_nanzer_speaks_at_sxsw/,"Sitting in on Nate Nanzer talk at SXSW, thought I would try and type up highlights live.

Mostly marketing speak, but the big focus seems to be on home and away games and getting more teams. 
 Highlights: 

- audited different sport league types to see what kind of league model they wanted. Seems to have started as an idea between Jeff Kaplan and Nate Nanzer?

- each game they make, they approach building it as an esport differently (no one size fits all for esports) and they want to support it as a esport (building spectator tools). 

- why was there so much time between — they wanted to announce at blizzcon 2016 because it was their biggest microphone. Wanted people to experience esports live to get it (including investors, I think) 

- at blizzcon 2016 they had a closed doors investors meeting with every endemic org and traditional teams. 

- when they made the first teams, they wanted professional owners that would invest and build infrastructure . They chose based on that and owners who could build a fan base and had good operational capabilities.

- They want player treatment to be the best in any esport ( salary, contracts that meant something, player health). Wanted to make it a real career for players. 

- Nate Nanzers office in the Burbank studio is jay lenos old office and it has a shower in it?

- reinforced their commitment to diversity in talent, contenders is an opportunity for new talent to get great reps and rise up. Need more opportunity for talent to rise in the esports world.

- esports are not a zero sum game, there is audience for different esports, not all competing for the same fans. Don’t need to ‘steal’ fans from other games. 

- the deal with twitch: twitch is a great partner because they work with blizzard to bring new things 

- what would you change — playoffs were a bad idea the way they were originally done, change to games on Sunday.

- Want more storytelling. Want more stories about players/content. 

-  what surprised you? How fast the city based team thing worked. The watch parties and the affinity for cities has been great. 

- toxicity — we can’t solve toxicity on the internet within an esport league. Joined the fair play alliance. Pro gamers need to realize they’re being  watched by young kids and that they have influence. 

- looking forward — big focus operationally is Home and away. Getting people to their home cities. How do they and the teams move to cities?

- scheduling for sports is very complex. Scheduling will be a challenge. We will optimize for where the teams are based for scheduling. 

- not sure if people are going to travel for season 2 yet or stay at the blizzard arena.

- trying to get more Europe and Asian teams is another big focus.

Q&amp;A:

- what financial incentives for investing? Sold the vision of home games, local sponsors, merchandise 
- sponsorship revenue goes into a pool for all the teams 
- Core fans want first person, casual fans want third person. Have to cater to both. Thinking about tools that would allow people to see from players perspective.
-  Plans if owl didn’t work out? Honestly? No. Felt like they were ready, never worried about it failing. 
- What are you trying to do to make it stand out from traditional sports and overwatch vr when? We don’t need to have any gimmicks, the game is already interesting. Just want to remain authentic. (No plans for VR xD)
- expansion — how are you going to handle drafts? New expansion teams will have a chance at existing talent, not sure how, announcement in 2-3 months.
- what would they steal from traditional sports and sports media? A red zone style channel could be cool down the road when there are more teams (no idea what this is) 
- Path to pro for talent? want to do more formal internship program next summer. More backstage tours. Over 100 people working at the arena doing a bunch of other things, want people to know about possible careers.
- Adding limits on foreign players? this may evolve, don’t think it’s necessary to add any rules now.
- Give more access to analytics? Definitely thinking about it, launching stats on the website. More official fantasy leagues. Still trying to figure out what the important stats, have a full team of data scientists working on it.

84px57,1,2018-03-15,Some questions about Express Entry/permanent immigration to Canada from Europe,MeanSuccess,ImmigrationCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/84px57/some_questions_about_express_entrypermanent/,"Hi, I am a European citizen (Greece), 25 years old,  and I am interested in moving permanently to Canada. I have done some research, but I have a few questions. I am still a student, but will be done with my Bachelor's in CS by September (or end of year the latest). I am also doing a full-time internship right now as a programmer.

I want to move to Canada as soon as possible after school. I am planning to participate to IEC Working Holiday (applied for it yesterday), work in Canada for a year, and while there apply for Express Entry or a provincial nomination (I would prefer Ontario, since I plan on living in Toronto).

So my questions are:

1) Can you get Express Entry while in Canada on a IEC Visa? 

2) I am an Internet Marketer, so pretty much a freelancer. I have been doing that for over 6 years. I have emails that show that I have been paid from different companies and different clients. I also have an online service, which is doing quite alright these past 3 years, that's pretty much all I have been doing these years, that has been my income. So I have all the emails and invoices that prove my clients have been paying me for the service. Is that considered full-time work experience? 

3) Since I know I am going to get my Bachelor's degree within the next 6 months, could I apply for Express Entry stating I already have a Bachelor's degree? So when and IF I would get selected, I would already have the degree. Don't want to wait for me to finish school to THEN get in the pool.

4) How long does it take to get permanent residency after getting in Canada with Express Entry?


Thank you in advance!"
84pydd,2,2018-03-15,Computer Forensics to forensics,teniiver,forensics,https://www.reddit.com/r/forensics/comments/84pydd/computer_forensics_to_forensics/,"Hi guys,

I hope you are not to tired with people asking tons of questions, coz I have some.
So I am actually studying Computer Forensics (UK), and I am thinking about pursuing a career in forensics in general, like I want to treat my current degree as introduction.
So I never really cared about biology, or any other subjects, but I am aware that I should probably start from there right?
Except my degree I am reading any forensics related books, right now I am looking more into criminal forensics, later I want to look into other subcategories if you can call them like that.

So questions:
So I have general knowledge about preserving evidence, but only with electronic devices, what should I do to expand my forensics knowledge beyond electronic devices?
I understand that forensics in general looks alike in all over the world is that correct? If so does that means that any certificates that I may get in UK will be recognizable worldwide?
Would you have any extra advises for me? I am planning to do internship, but it still will be only related to computers.
Let's say that I manage to secure computer forensics job, will that experience help me with any other forensics discipline?

EDIT:
Oh I forgot about one question it is more law related, but maybe you will be able to help me.
So long time ago I was charged with criminal offense, and I was found not guilty, theoretically it should not affect any future screening before work, so will it be a problem, if I would like to work for let's say police or government?

Investing is something I love! I enjoy learning about it I enjoy doing it, I live the process, I am a current investor. My question is this:

Can you get into a financial analyst position (doesn’t have to be a big paying position for a bank) I just want to be able to work with investments starting at entry level? 

Here is my plan as of now:
Bachelors in science in research
Minor: in finance
Associates in accounting
(They don’t offer an associates in finance) 

I know that falls short in comparison to a Bachelors in finance.  

But I could pad it with an SIE and later a CFA.

I just need something that looks good on a resume for when I try to get an internship or go for a job. I’m still a freshman. 

Any advice will helps.

84qudl,10,2018-03-15,The Atlantic Front (Episode 1): The First Engagement,SuperDan000,WorldOfWarships,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfWarships/comments/84qudl/the_atlantic_front_episode_1_the_first_engagement/,"Well hello everyone. It's /u/SuperDan000 again and I'm starting another series reliving actual naval battles of World War 2. You may have remembered my Pacific War series from last year, but this time, it will be about the events happening in the Battle of the Atlantic. As usual, like the last series, it will be written in screenplay with 90% historical accuracy. I hope you enjoy this one, but to be honest, the Atlantic is not as exciting as the Pacific.

Narrator: Me? I didn’t get much attention during the Battle of the Atlantic. I find it interesting that you want me to explain some of the engagements happened during that battle. If you asked what I did, I would say that this is the longest battle of the war. It’s a pretty boring one though. Most of the time, it was me escorting convoys and looking out for subs. However, I will tell you about those larger scale battles. Yeah, I think that’s what you want to hear.

*Transition music*

Narrator: It all started in the first of September of the year 1939. The Germans invaded Poland and a couple of days later, we, the allies, declared war on them. What resulted was the beginning of the Battle of the Atlantic and it was a struggle that lasted almost 6 years. We didn’t start out well. A U-boat sunk a British freighter on the first day. We had to search for the enemy submarines, but there were also auxiliary cruisers and merchant raiders. One of these merchant raiders got involved in the first surface engagement of the battle…

*December 4, 1939 South Atlantic*

German Naval Staff: Attention Admiral Graf Spee. Our reports tell us that the British have 4 ships patrolling the waters around the South American coast. Please advise with caution when you go around sinking merchant vessels.

Graf Spee: Message received. I’ll keep an eye out not to get surrounded.

German Naval Staff: I’m sure you’ll keep that promise. 9 merchant vessels sunk without getting caught will look good on your track record. Good luck out there.

*December 13*

Ajax: You see anything?

Exeter: I don’t think so. Do you?

Ajax: Not yet… wait, over there. I see smoke over the horizon.

Achilles: Exeter, go and investigate. If it’s the pocket battleship we are looking for, get back here and tell us.

Ajax: Yeah, we have a strategy in dealing with those kind of ships.

Exeter: Roger!

Graf Spee: Huh? What’s that over there?

Exeter: I think it’s a pocket battleship. Enemy in sight!

Ajax: Hurry and get back. We need to get our battle plan ready.

Graf Spee: Looks like the Exeter. Damn, if only my scout plane was working. That’s okay, I think she’s accompanied by a pair of destroyers. Is there a convoy ahead? Now that would be quite the prize.

*Graf Spee drives closer*

Graf Spee: Oh crap. Those aren’t destroyers. They’re all cruisers.

Ajax: She fell for the trap. All ships engage!

Achilles: Watch out. She has larger guns than us so try not to get hit.

Ajax: Spread out so that we can split her firepower.

Exeter: That’s the fucking Scheer! Open fire at her!

Graf Spee: This is not good. Firing main battery.

Exeter: I’m preparing to launch my spotter.

*Shell explodes short of Exeter*

Exeter: AAHHHH!! I’ve sustained damage! My comms and structure have taken some damage. She destroyed my spotter aircraft too.

*Another shell strikes her B turret*

Exeter: No! Two of my turrets are out and I lost my comms!

Ajax: Hurry Achilles! We need to get in front of her.

Achilles: I’m trying. Be patient.

Graf Spee: This isn’t good. I have to use my secondaries.

Exeter: Firing torpedoes!

Graf Spee: Dodge dodge dodge!

*Successful torpedo dodge by Graf Spee*

Ajax: Launching spotter!

Exeter: She evaded. I’m going to have to turn around and fire my port side torpedoes.

Graf Spee: She’s turning. Perfect time to strike.

*2 Graf Spee shells strike Exeter*

Exeter: Gah! Shit! A turret is down and I’m on fire. Damn it all!

*One of Exeter’s shells strikes a crippling blow to Graf Spee*

Graf Spee: No! This can’t be happening. My fuel processing system is damaged. I have 16 hours left and I won’t be able to make it home with this. What do I do?

Ajax: How are you doing Exeter?

Exeter: Not good. I’m listing a bit and Y turret is all I have left.

Ajax: Don’t worry, we’ll distract that pocket battleship.

Graf Spee: All this damage to my AA and secondary gun and no way to make repairs, I better make a run for Montevideo.

Achilles: She’s turning around and smoking up.

Exeter: I’m still engaging her.

Graf Spee: Stay away from me!

*Exeter loses power to her last turret from a near miss*

Exeter: Oh no. I’m dead now.

Ajax: Don’t worry Exeter. We’ll distract her.

Achilles: Hey over here! Shoot me!

Graf Spee: There’s too many of them!

Ajax: preparing to fire torpedoes!

*Ajax fires torpedoes*

Graf Spee: Damn your torpedoes!

*Graf Spee dodges torpedoes and hits Ajax*

Ajax: God damn, that bitch disabled my X turret and jammed my Y turret.

Achilles: We’re running low on resources. Should we change strategies?

Ajax: I think we need to trail her and wait for night. We’ll be able to strike her with torpedoes that way.

Achilles: Roger. We’ll shadow her and avoid getting hit.

*Ajax gets hit again*

Ajax: Damn it. There goes my mast.

Achilles: I’m tailing on her starboard side.

Ajax: I’m on her port side. Cumberland, do you read?

Cumberland: I hear you loud and clear. What is your situation?

Ajax: We need you here to help us deal with a Deutschland class cruiser.

Cumberland: Roger. I’ll be on my way.

Ajax: Achilles, you’re too close to the pocket battleship.

*Shells miss Achilles*

Achilles: Whoa, too close. Turning away to the smoke screen.

Graf Spee: You there merchant vessel. Sink yourself!

*Graf Spee fires warning shot*

Shakespeare: Oh no.

Ajax: I got a radio message from a German ship.

Achilles: What’s it about?

Ajax: It’s from the Admiral Graf Spee. I think it’s the ship we are engaging. She sent a signal saying “please pick up lifeboats of English steamer.”

Shakespeare: Hello.

Ajax: Did the Graf Spee try to sink you?

Shakespeare: I think so, but she continued moving towards Montevideo.

Ajax: You were lucky. Do not worry. The Royal Navy is here to save the day.

Achilles: Let’s keep pursuing. No time to chit chat.

*Ajax gets fired upon*

Ajax: Too close. Turning back.

Graf Spee: I see my way out. C’mon just a little bit more.

Achilles: We can’t lose sight of her.

Graf Spee: Please stay away!

*Achilles gets fired upon*

Achilles: Too close. Pulling back!

Ajax: Leave her. We’re gonna cage her in port. We won’t let her get out.

*December 14*

Graf Spee: Finally, I’m safe.

Uruguay Port Authority: Excuse us Admiral Graf Spee but you can not stay in this port for more than 24 hours according to Article 12 of the Hague Convention. But due to your damages, Article 14 is in effect as well.

Graf Spee: Is there any way you can extend that time? I need to get repairs immediately.

Uruguay Port Authority: I’m sorry but that can’t happen when you are part of a belligerent nation. There is Article 16 though. That may extend your time whenever a British or French merchant vessel leaves the port.

Graf Spee: I really don’t have much of a choice. I really don’t like those cruisers staring at me out there.

Achilles: What do we do?

Ajax: Cumberland is coming. We also have reinforcements coming but they won’t arrive on time. The government is trying to sail allied merchants out of Montevideo so it can extend Graf Spee’s stay. Hopefully, our forces will arrive by the time she tries to make a run.

Achilles: That’s a brilliant plan. If we wait her out long enough, she’ll be doomed. If she tries to leave earlier, she might scuttle herself if she believes in our bluff.

Ajax: Yoo hoo Admiral Graf Spee. Surrender yourself or face the might of the entire Royal Navy.

Achilles: You got 3 days before our reinforcements arrive.

Graf Spee: Crap. I can’t tell if they are bluffing. If they really are lying and I escape now, I won’t be able to make it home. But I can’t intern myself here.

*The British tease Graf Spee for the next 3 days*

*December 17*

Graf Spee: Naval command. I have made my decision.

German Naval Command: What are you trying to do Spee?

Graf Spee: I don’t want to intern myself, nor be sunk by the enemy.

German Naval Command: Wait, you don’t mean?

Graf Spee: I have no other choice. I put my pride on the line and I don’t want it broken by my enemies.

Cumberland: Will she get out?

Ajax: I think so. Look! Steam is coming out of her stacks. She’s gonna make a move!

Achilles: Everyone, battle stations. Our allies may not get here in time but she’ll be bound to bump into them either way.

Ajax: Hey Spee! Get over this boundary and fight us!

Graf Spee: I was hoping that you’ll say that. Fine, we’ll fight it out but only on even terms.

Achilles: What does she mean by that?

Cumberland: Why is she slowing down?

Graf Spee: Congratulations on your victory. Sadly, I wish not to fight you. Farewell I guess.

*Graf Spee scuttles herself*

Cumberland: What was that?

Ajax: She just scuttled herself just so she doesn’t endure the slow pain of getting destroyed by us.

Achilles: Guess she believed in our bluff. Regardless, this is a major victory for us. That’s one surface raider scratched from the list.

Ajax: What’s your damage like? I’ve taken a quite a bit of it.

Achilles: Tis just a scratch for me. Exeter needs repairs though. She’s lucky to have survived.

Narrator: And that was how the Battle of River Plate went. However this was the beginning of such surface actions. By the next year, the Germans invaded Norway and the struggle for control of the Atlantic continued there…

Well there you have it. Another series for me to work on, and this time it will be just as challenging as the Pacific War series. Next chapter will be the Battle of Narvik.

And just like the previous Pacific War series, I'm making a guess the narrator challenge again. Guess what ship it is. I may have given away too much information but the identity won't be revealed until the finale.

84s1bw,1,2018-03-15,Helen (story 1),cfone1,u_cfone1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cfone1/comments/84s1bw/helen_story_1/,"My name's Helen I’m a very normal person really. I’m outgoing and like normal stuff, and I have an outgoing boyfriend who likes normal stuff too. We both exercise a lot together and we’re both in good shape which is something important to both of us. But other than that we’re like any couple. Our sex life is fine too, and the only complaint I have is that he doesn’t go down on me nearly as much as I would like. But it’s not a big problem really. All in all we’re very happy, we live together, and are planning a future. So I never thought of myself as a cheater, which is why it’s so weird to me that I’m writing this. Part of me writing this is because I want to share something with a subreddit that I have enjoyed for a few months now (made an account for this!), and part of it is to get it all off my chest because it's been a weird few weeks.

I work in a big open plan office in a city centre, and my job is quite fast paced and hectic. I like my job and I take my career very seriously, so I’m always looking for ways to further my ‘professional development’. Well a few months ago my company was putting a call out to anyone who would be willing to manage an intern and I thought I’d go for it. Not something I’d done before and a good opportunity. I had to interview quite a few applicants and eventually settled on this girl called Izzy, who was 21 and had just graduated from uni (I’m 25 btw).

Izzy is short and slim, with wavy blonde hair and a very pretty face. I’m completely straight so didn’t really think anything of it, other than in a ‘Oh she’s quite pretty’ kind of way. I feel weird talking about myself, but for reference I think I’m somewhat good looking too. I’m slim and tall with straight blonde hair and small boobs. Guys have said I’m ‘too skinny’ quite a lot, but it’s never bothered me. My face isn’t as pretty as Izzy’s but I scrub up okay!

Anyway, Izzy fit in with our team really well which was great. She started a bit over 2 months ago and we got along pretty well from the start. Part of my responsibility as her line manager is to schedule our weekly 1-to-1 catch up sessions to see how she's getting on. Like I said my office is big and open, but in the middle to one side there is a row of little meeting rooms you can book if you want to make some calls or have a quiet conversation. The rooms are big enough for a fairly deep desk on one wall (with side panels) and a couple of chairs. The walls are semi sound proof, and they each have a big window that looks over the city. The only inside window is at head height in the door so you can check if anyone’s in there.

About 1 month in Izzy and I were having a catch up. We were going through some stuff on my laptop and it was going very normally. I’m a really talkative person so all our meetings have a lot of joking around and chit chat in them. But today I was a bit off because I’d been arguing with my boyfriend that morning. It was just about sex stuff but it put me in a bit of a downer for the whole dat. Izzy could tell and asked me what was up, and I told her I’d been arguing with the bf. That moved the topic onto boyfriends, and she told me she had recently broken up with hers.

I didn’t mean to pry but I suppose I did anyway and asked what had happened. She kind of brushed the question off at first, but then told me that actually it was the sex. Her face went super red which made me laugh but it wasn’t really awkward at all because I’m not very shy about that stuff and Izzy knows it. I considered being all professional about it and getting the meeting back on track, but truth is that it was nice to talk about all that crappy boyfriend stuff with someone new. Plus we had a halfhour left in the room and had completed our agenda. (Plus it was a friday afternoon!)

Turns out she had confessed to her boyfriend that she was bicurious and he didn’t take it well, and things went downhill after that. She asked me if I had ever had any experience or advice with it because she was finding it a bit hard to decide what to do about it. Obviously I said ‘No’ because I’m straight and didn’t have any idea, but I said that she definitely shouldn’t feel bad about it. To try and even up the exchange I confessed that my bf troubles had been about sex too. My boyfriend and I hadn’t had sex in a couple of weeks and he wanted to know if there was something wrong. I'd admitted to him that I’d been feeling neglected about the lack of oral, but that just made him get really defensive.

I kind of realised at this point that our conversation had gone waaaaaay over the line of what is okay. Yes we are both adults, but I am her manager and she is an intern. I was about to suggest we pack up and leave the room go join our team, but Izzy gave me a friendly frown and said ‘That sucks, that’s exactly the kind of thing I’m looking for’. I think I must have gone white when she said that or something because she apologised straight away and started waving her hands. I felt bad because I didn’t want to make her feel awkward so I laughed and said ‘No no it’s fine, it makes perfect sense!’

We kind of had one of those weird moments then. Where you’re both looking at each other but your expressions don’t change for ages. She kept looking at me and eventually said ‘I wish I could find someone laid back who wants what you want, that would definitely make things easier’. I think I knew what she was hinting at straight away, but I didn’t really know how to reply, so I just kind of smiled and nodded. After what felt like a long time she shrugged and said in a jokey voice ‘Well if you’re ever in the market just let me know’. I really don’t know why I didn’t shut it down right then, or try and laugh it off or something, but I didn’t. It hit me then that I was sat in a room with someone who was basically asking to go down on me, and I got really excited. It’s weird, it wasn’t like being horny or anything, just really excited, like getting to the top of a rollercoaster. If I’m honest I enjoy the thrill of ‘taboo’ stuff quite a lot so I think that was part of it. I kind of chuckled and looked at my imaginary watch and said ‘well I’m free for the next twenty minutes!’ in a jokey way.

I said it because it sounded like a joke. I meant it as a joke, and it was a joke. It seemed like a good way to give us both a way out of a weird situation. But part of me really hoped she didn’t take it as a joke because I wanted to see how far it would go. Also, I won't lie, the thought of getting some oral was genuinely starting to push my buttons, even though it was a girl. But it was all hypothetical because it wasn't gonna happen. Right? Izzy laughed a bit in response, but then looked at me and asked ‘Er... are you serious?’. Holy shit. Before I had time to think I just shrugged and said ‘Well, sure. I mean why not? It's not like it has to be a big deal’. It felt like an out of body experience where someone else was talking and not me. I would never have said anything like that, but then I actually did. Even now when I think about the moment I said that, it still feels like it was somebody else.

Izzy looked pretty shocked and I thought for a terrifying moment she had been joking all along. I thought about getting reported to HR and being fired and explaining it to my boyfriend and having to find a new job. But after about 5 seconds she said ‘Well… uh... if you’re sure, that would be great. I mean, I’d really like it. But in here? I mean, like now? Did you mean now?’ . She was serious. It was probably suuuuper awkward in that tiny room with just us two, but I think we were both too caught up in the craziness to notice.

I looked up at the ceiling trying really hard to look like I was casually working out the logistics when I was actually just thinking ‘Oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god’. My heart was beating so hard I could see it in my vision. Was I really trying to hook up with another girl at work? After pretending to think for a bit I said ‘Yeah, it’ll be fine. I mean, we’re pretty tucked away in here. No one ever comes in if the door’s closed’. Izzy breathed out slowly, nodded and said ‘Okay. Cool’. She had gone from red to white and back again several times by this point, and had this frightened smile on her face, which is probably the same thing I had on mine. We kind of sat there for a bit not looking at each other. Eventually she laughed and said ‘Wow… I did not expect this to happen when I got up this morning’. I laughed too and said ‘Hey me neither! This is definitely not a normal Friday for me’. We were quiet for another few moments when Izzy looked at me and said ‘So how do we, you know... go for it? Shall we just do it? Is there anything we should do first? I'm kind of new to this obviously, so yeah...’. I couldn’t believe it, we were both being deadly serious.

I crossed my legs super casually at this point to try and look relaxed, and as my thigh and pelvis shifted I realised that I had gotten pretty damn wet. I kind of freaked out at that moment because I was getting wet over a girl. But that fact also really turned me on even more. I tried to rationalise that it was the situation and not the girl, but the result was the same either way. I tried to think again, and realised that if we were going to do this we’d have to have a backup plan in case someone looked in the window or opened the door. It was super rare that anyone did, but I wasn’t going to take the risk. I was wearing a dark knee length dress with nude tights which made things a bit easier, and I realised we could use the desk too. At that point I kind of mentally slapped myself and this inner voice said ‘Dear god Helen what the fuck are you even thinking?’. I froze up for a moment, and realised I couldn't go ahead with it. But before I could backpedal, the other part of me just went with it.

So I looked at her and said ‘Okay, I've got an idea. I’ll go to the toilets, and while I’m gone you can get under the desk. If someone comes in while I’m gone you can just pretend you’re looking for something you dropped.’ She nodded. Then I said ‘When I get back I’ll come in and shut the door and sit down. I won’t say anything and I’ll just pretend to work on my laptop. Is that okay?’ Izzy nodded again. I said ‘You sure you’re okay Izzy?’ and she smiled and said ‘Yeah definitely, really okay. Are you definitely okay?’. I nodded and smiled back and we ended up staring at each other for a few pleasantly weird seconds again. Eventually I was like ‘Right, cool, see you in a bit I guess!’. I was trying to sound really normal so she wouldn’t see I was about to pass out from nerves, but it was probably obvious. I stood up as calmly as I could, picked my keycard off the desk, my bag off the floor, opened the door, walked out, and closed it again.

The walk down the middle of the office to the door at the end was incredibly slow, and all I could think about was Izzy behind me crawling under that desk. I felt like everyone was watching me but I know they probably weren’t. One of my friends in another department saw me and waved, and I nearly blanked her before giving her a forced smile. She asked if I was okay and I just said I was busy, which she understood.

Eventually I got to the door and opened it, and walked round the corner to the toilets. I was thankfully alone, walked straight into a cubicle, locked it, and took a moment to think about what I was doing. I didn’t want to leave Izzy waiting for ages and it already felt like a long time had passed (though it had probably been about 30 second), but I was starting to freak out a little bit. I had a boyfriend, and I wasn't even bi. I wasn't actually going to do this was I? I nearly unlocked the door and left, but I didn't. Without really thinking too much I lifted my dress up, slid my shoes off, and slipped my thumbs into the waistband of my tights. My hands were actually shaking, but ignored it, and pushed them down. It felt sooo naughty and wrong and scary to actually do that. I balled my tights up and shoved them under all the crap in my bag.

Then I lifted my dress back up to do the same with my panties. I stopped again with my thumbs in the waistband, because I knew this was the point of no return for me. If I was willing to sneak my panties off in a toilet cubicle, I was probably going to go all the way. I took a breath, and pushed them down. I like to keep everything hair free down there, and as soon as the fabric came away from my skin the cold air felt really intense. I tried not to look as I pulled them off so I could pretend nothing was happening, but as soon as I tried to ball them up I could feel how wet the fabric was in the middle. And after I stuck them in my bag I had to wipe my hand off with toilet paper. I still couldn’t believe what I was doing. It still felt like someone else doing everything. I was on a kind of weird autopilot. I slipped my shoes back on, picked up my bag, and left the cubicle. I was going to walk straight out but then I stopped by the paper towel dispenser and pulled a wad out and stuck them in my bag. Some weirdly logical part of my brain was like ‘My intern will probably need these after she goes down on me’.

I headed back to the office. It felt like ages but I had probably been gone only a bit more than one minute. I swiped back in, and started walking as normally as I could back to the meeting room. In my head I was sure everyone was going to notice that I had no tights on and ask about it. They were nude so I figured I’d just lie and said I hadn’t been wearing any, but of course no one actually did ask. I was trying to look calm, but before I got ten steps in I could feel my wetness going everywhere each time my thighs slipped past each other. My dress was really thin and I was afraid it would stick to my legs so I tried moving my legs as little possible and prayed no one would notice.

After the longest seconds of my life I approached my meeting room. I started to slow down a bit because I didn’t feel ready, but I knew I couldn’t just stop outside the door. I took a deep breath as I got up to it, and my heart was pounding again. Half of me was praying that Izzy wouldn’t be in there, that she had freaked out and gone back to our team’s main desk, and that we could pretend none of this had ever happened. But the other half knew I’d be bitterly disappointed if that happened. I put my hand on the handle and opened the door as casually as I could. I stepped into the room and closed it on the other side. The sudden silence was terrifying and exhilarating. I set my bag on the desk and dropped my card next to it. My heart was thudding again as I looked around the room. Izzy had moved her chair out the way so only mine was by the desk, and when I realised that her notepad and pen were still on the desk I had to let out a long breath to calm down. She was under the desk. I couldn’t see her but she was probably there. She was waiting under the fucking desk.

I pulled the chair a short way out to sit down on it, forcing myself not to look down in case I saw her expectant face. I kept my legs together as I sat down as close to the edge of the chair as I could, and remembered the cum on my legs as I did so. I pulled the back of my dress up as I sat down to avoid getting it wet, and kind of draped it around the seat of the chair so hopefully no one would notice if they came in. I could feel the coarse seat cover on my bare skin, and felt suddenly self conscious about having no underwear on. My head was a mess at this point and I couldn’t think straight. I pulled up a random spreadsheet and started clicking on cells for no reason, just trying to look busy in case someone burst in. My legs were gently pressed together and I sat rigid like that, pointlessly scanning numbers on the screen. Several agonising moments went by like this. I realised with a wave of relief and disappointment that she had probably gone. I had been sat there freaking out for like 15 seconds and nothing had happened. I would just get up and go back to my desk and we'd forget all about it.

Then I heard a quiet sound as Izzy repositioned herself under the table. 'Holy shit this is going to happen, I can't fucking believe this is going to happen'

I started to breathe quite heavily, trying to calm myself down a bit. Nothing happened for a few seconds, and then I felt her hand on my knee and froze. This was actually happening. She put her other hand on my other knee, and gently pulled them apart. I resisted at first, but only for a second. She kept pushing them wider really slowly, and I was staring at the laptop screen thinking ‘Oh my god Izzy can see my pussy right now’.

Then, when my legs were pretty far open, I felt one of her hands slide up my thigh. I kind of shuddered involuntarily because it felt so intense, and she paused for just a moment. She must have seen that I was really wet, because she started running a finger over the slippery patch on my inner thigh. This went on for maybe a minute or so, and my cum must have been everywhere. I was incredibly horny by this point. Not just asexually excited like before, but full on dripping-wet horny. Eventually she stopped, and I felt her hair brush against my skin as she leaned in. Oh my god I can’t tell you the anticipation I was feeling right at that moment. I could feel how close she was because her breath was warm. My mind was just going ‘Shit shit shit shit shit’. She pushed my thighs a little further apart, her clothes rustled as she leaned in, and I knew she about to go for it.

I thought of my boyfriend for just an instant, and then I felt Izzy’s warm, firm tongue push gently into my pussy. My whole body quivered and curled. My skin got really hot and I had to close my eyes and clench my fists to not have an orgasm right there. I could feel the muscles in my groin tensing up repeatedly, and her cheeks felt slippery against my thighs. All I could think was was ‘holy shit I’m at work and my intern’s tongue is inside me’. Izzy curved her arms under and over my legs and pulled my hips gently towards her as she licked all the way up between my lips in one go. I curled up again when her tongue went over my clit and it took all my strength not to moan. She pulled her face away for a moment and I heard her gulp quietly under the desk. That nearly sent me over right there. I had no idea why I was so into this even though it was a girl, but I didn't question it.

Then she leaned forward again, and started lapping at my pussy slowly but firmly. I can’t tell how you good it felt. Nothing has felt so good before or since. I couldn’t think anymore, all I could do was hold on. If someone had actually looked through the window in the door they would have sussed it out in three seconds. I was sitting at the desk with my head back and my eyes closed, shuddering rhythmically to the soft squelching sounds of Izzy's face buried between my legs. I don’t think I even lasted 30 seconds. There was this kind of white hot feeling between my legs and a ragged breath came out of my mouth as I had the stickiest, shakiest orgasm of my whole life. For a few long moments I could have been anywhere. It was just one long wave of pure, eye-watering ecstasy. I wanted to scream and cry and tell her how fucking good it felt, but I wouldn’t have even been able to make the words. Apparently I managed to stay pretty quiet, but I have no idea how as I’m quite loud usually.

The whole thing probably lasted no more than 10 seconds, but they were 10 seriously good seconds. When it was over I just slumped back in the chair with my eyes closed trying not to fall off. My breathing was deep and heavy, I could feel sweat on my forehead, and my still open legs were just kind of shaking about. Eventually I lifted my head up, and opened my eyes. Izzy was kneeling between my legs with her mouth open and a look of wonder on her face. It’s good she doesn’t really wear makeup because my cum was everywhere. Her cheeks were shiny with it, and there was a thin strand of it connecting her chin to her shirt. She had put her hair back in a ponytail, but it was sticky at her temples. I smiled at her and she beamed back at me. She asked me if it was good, and I laughed. Then she said ‘Did you… you know?’ And I just nodded happily because I couldn’t really speak.

With the moment passing I realised how amazingly ridiculous this would look to someone else, and I pulled the paper towels from my bag. I kept a couple for myself and handed a few to Izzy. We both stayed where we were, wiping up my cum for a minute or so. Watching a girl wipe my cum off her face was seriously surreal. When we were done I stuffed the towels in my bag and Izzy got up and sat back down in her chair. I scooted back a bit to inspect the damage, and saw a predictable wet patch on my chair. Luckily it wasn’t too big and I guess Izzy got most of it. I looked over at her and we shared a giggle. Half of me was deliriously happy on a post orgasm high, and the other half was reeling from the knowledge that I had just cheated on my boyfriend and gotten eaten out by a girl. What. The. Fuck.

Once my legs were up to the challenge I got up and inspected my dress and was relieved to find no visible blotches. I perched on the table’s edge and looked over at my partner in crime. ‘So… How was it?’ I asked. ‘Yeah’ she said with a massive smile ‘Pretty much everything I was hoping for’. That made me really happy for some reason. I really liked that she liked it too. She pulled her hair band off and said ‘Do you regret doing that?’. I thought about it for a moment and was really really surprised to find that I didn’t. I know it was wrong and bad and everything, but honestly I’d be lying if I said I felt any regret. I looked at her and said ‘No, I don’t. It was honestly the best I’ve ever had. Which is really weird ‘cause you’re a girl’. She smiled again and thanked me, and I just laughed. This girl had just given me the best orgasm I’d ever had and then said thank you.

I checked the time and we still had about 15 minutes left. We made sure we looked presentable, and got our stuff together (which included me finding my emergency panties and slipping them on). I fake spilled my cold cup of coffee on the chair, and we got up, opened the door, and strolled out into the noisy and busy office that had been a couple of feet away the whole time. Izzy went to go wash her face while I took the chair to the front desk and apologised to the facilities manager (the building has a central cleaning service for things like coffee spills).

I went and sat down at my desk and Izzy came back a few minutes later, gave me a quick smile and sat down to her work. After an hour or so my friend sat next to me actually did ask if I had been wearing tights earlier. I gave her a mildly confused look and shook my head, and she and said ‘oh right - sorry, it’s obviously been a looong week! Can’t wait for the weekend.’

The last couple of hours of the day were super normal. Every now and then I would get this weird sensation come over me and would stop in my tracks and think ‘oh my god I came on a girl’s face’ but I’d shake it off and it was fine. Oddly enough the guilt never really set it. Don’t get me wrong I know I cheated on my boyfriend and he didn’t do anything to deserve it. But even though my brain knew it was wrong it just felt different because it was another girl. I don’t think the gender makes any actual difference, but for some reason it just felt different. I have been propositioned before by guys (once or twice when my bf and I were in a rough patch) and I never considered cheating because the thought of it made me feel terrible. But one proposition from a curious girl and my legs are open within ten minutes. Go fucking figure.

I got home that night expecting to be really awkward around my bf, but it was fine. We both apologised to each other and made up and some really loving sex. He even went down on me which I really appreciated, and everything has been great since. Do I feel gay or bi now? Not really no. Do I still feel straight? I think so. I’m not really sure to be honest. It’s all so unfamiliar.

84s5t2,6,2018-03-15,How to politely retract a summer research acceptance?,FunnyProduce1,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/84s5t2/how_to_politely_retract_a_summer_research/,"Hey all,

I am currently a senior in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Nanotechnology and Biomedical Engineering. Currently, I am also working on a side entrepreneurial venture: a rehabilitative medical device company focused on vibration therapy. Throughout my undergraduate, I have interned at NASA for two summers, have worked on my side venture since around September, have done summer research at Boston University last summer, and I also have some research experience at my home institution.

My question relates to summer research programs (REUs). I am still trying to decide whether to get a Masters or PhD in Biomedical Engineering. I know for a fact that I want to work in medical devices and BME in general, and I have made really great strides with my side venture. I was recently flown out to Amsterdam for a youth entrepreneurship conference, and I was accepted to an accelerator program after I graduate from college in December. Overall, I have come to despise most of my engineering program because it's so heavily biased towards power engineering and telecommunications applications, which I have zero interest in. Therefore, I would do anything to work in Biomedical Engineering.

My specific question relates to how to turn down an REU offer without burning bridges. This past school year, I had the toughest time applying to summer internships and research. I honestly did not know what specifically I wanted to do this summer, and therefore I took a shotgun approach and applied to a bunch of positions both in traditional industry and in academia. I interviewed with Microsoft for research (just got the rejection a few weeks ago, bummed out but at least I'm glad I got to the interview stage) and a bunch of other companies that seemed to go nowhere. I also got an invitation to interview with Google today, but the position does not interest me that much and has nothing to do with BME so I will probably decline. Overall, I feel like I received a ton of rejections from industry, but out of the maybe 10 or so REU programs that I applied to this year, I got into two. I received the first acceptance into the Washington State University[ GSUR program] in Gerontechnology (http://ntg.ailab.wsu.edu/about) the last week of February, and last Thursday I was accepted into the Georgetown Physics REU.

Initially, I accepted the WSU offer because I had no other summer offers in hand and I had to respond by March 2. I was not assigned a specific project, and outside of my initial acceptance on March 2 I have not heard any correspondence back. For the Georgetown REU, I was assigned a very specific project (improving fluidics for next generation glucose sensing technology), and was given details about stipend, housing, etc right from the get go. In fact, my PI reached out to me to talk about my entrepreneurial venture and how he could connect me to some folks who do similar work, so I'm excited about that.

For the WSU program, I still do not know who my mentor is, nor where the students are housed. The campus is in a much more rural setting, and I would not have a car. Furthermore, the school is not as highly ranked as Georgetown, and I fear that if I were to stick with this offer, I may be stuck with a project that I dislike in a place far away from home. Although the scenery is much prettier there than the east coast imo, I feel that I would be foolish not to take the Georgetown offer into consideration, since it looks like it will open more doors for me professionally. At Georgetown, I'd be about 2 and a half hours from home, and will have all of DC at my disposal. My parents and friends have said that the Georgetown decision would be a no-brainer, but for some reason I just feel so incredibly guilty about it to the point where I have not been sleeping much this week.

I am supposed to make a final decision by tomorrow afternoon, but I feel like I'm cheating the system if I go back on my acceptance for WSU. I may want to do some type of research collaboration with them in the future since Gerontechnology looks like an interesting field, but I do not want to burn any bridges. Overall, I just feel so anxious and guilty. I'm on my spring break and it has been very hard to relax because I keep flip flopping my decision in my head. I do have issues with anxiety and ADHD that I am working on, but in the meantime I would appreciate any advice that you could give on the situation.

Overall, my goal after graduation is to apply to a Masters program or research experience overseas. I am applying for a Fulbright to the Netherlands to do rehabilitation engineering research, and I am also looking at many other fellowships. Therefore, I hope this summer experience will help me obtain my goals.

Please let me know if I can clear anything up; I know this is a lot but I just had to let it out somewhere."
84sgp3,2,2018-03-15,Advice for interview with city law department?,Endraa,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/84sgp3/advice_for_interview_with_city_law_department/,"I would appreciate any general or specific advice on things I should focus on / research for the interview. I'm starting to panic because I haven't landed a job yet, and I can't help but feel like its because I'm not saying the right things in interviews.

I think the biggest question I usually struggle with is the 'tell me about yourself' / 'why this position' question. It's definitely easier when its a PI position with a very focused mission to help certain populations, but when it comes to government positions, usually I have ZERO idea how to express my interest and say WHY. I also feel like other people can talk about their previous work experience and  relate it to the position, but all I've ever done is retail / customer service jobs. 

I've interviewed for the department of utilities in the past, and it was a complete fail. I really didn't know what to say so I just talked about how important I thought public service was, and how important I thought their work was to the city. 


For this position .... If it helps, the position states that the intern will be working on drafting pleadings, discovery documents, motions, etc. 

The municipal issues that we would be dealing with: labor disputes, eminent domain, betterments, subdivision and zoning issues, municipal contracts, public records, sewers and street defects, easements, conservation restrictions, performance bonds, affordable housing, public nuisances, civil rights violations. 

Also, what amount of research should I be doing for this interview or interviews in general?

Do i need to look up cases they've worked on in the past? 

Do I need to know their stance on certain issues?

84t8sc,15,2018-03-16,[SPOILERS S4 FINALE] Is Laurel up to something...,MaryInMaryland,htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/84t8sc/spoilers_s4_finale_is_laurel_up_to_something/,"....BIG?

Just tossing out a wild idea that I was having and posted as a reply on another thread, wanted to see what folks thought about it, so here goes:

Could LAUREL be a serious criminal mastermind, plotting a murder (or several) that she will get away with and end up controlling BOTH the Antares and Mahoney empires?

This probably seems far-fetched, but I wonder if Laurel might be playing the long game and that she cares about money and power much more than she let on.  Could be totally wrong, this is all a guess, and I'm not attached to any outcome, but I would find it interesting if the show breaks this way.

All these people and all these cases seem to have some subtle connections, so perhaps they were scouted and targeted awhile ago.  Laurel is supposed to be a strategic mastermind, the smartest of the Keating 5, maybe she is smarter than we know, and a great actress to boot?

Antares is worth billions.  Laurel's father and mother are both now conveniently out of the driver's seat for that company.  Not sure where Laurel's siblings stand, but Laurel is a contender to inherit that empire.

Wes was a genetic heir to the Mahoney empire.  Laurel had Wes' baby, thus her SON Christopher is now a legit genetic heir to the Mahoney fortune.  Papa Mahoney was gunned down allegedly by Frank, who was in love with Laurel and under her thumb (and admitted to her that he killed the red-headed student in S1), but I don't believe that we ever had that confirmed for sure on the show, did we?  Brother Mahoney is in jail.  Don't remember what Mama Mahoney's situation is currently, need to go back and look.  Wes is (allegedly) dead.  So it appears that Laurel's son might be the rightful heir to one HUGE empire, thus leaving her in control of the Mahoney money until Wes' son gets older, and Laurel may well immediately inherit - and WANT to inherit - control of Antares.

So is it possible that Laurel might actually go for pulling off a huge coup like this?  And if so, could Frank be in on it?  Could Wes' death actually have somehow been FAKED and could Wes be in on it?  What do folks think of these way-out possibilities?

Thanks, cheers!  :-)

ETA:  Also, what better access with plausible cover to have to the DA's office besides becoming a non/barely paid intern as a single pregnant woman who just lost the ""love of her life""?  Seems like waaaayyyy too convenient of an opportunity for Laurel considering how the events shook out this season..."
84ttze,80,2018-03-16,"I broke up with my high school boyfriend because he was obsessed with his pyramid scheme ""internship""",stayarctic,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/84ttze/i_broke_up_with_my_high_school_boyfriend_because/,"I recently discovered this subreddit, which made me incredibly happy that I could finally share this story with people who would understand. So, here's the story of how I broke up with my high school sweetheart of nearly 3 years because of his involvement with an MLM scheme:

During my Freshman year of college, my boyfriend was thrilled that he got an internship with a company called College Works Painting. Essentially, they hire college students to sell exterior house painting services. They make it sound very enticing by calling it an internship and saying that you will essentially be owning your own business (since the people who actually paint the houses technically work under the interns). In reality, the interns are glorified door-to-door salesmen who work insane hours for mediocre pay and are highly encouraged to solicit colleges to recruit more interns. Additionally, I later found out the company promises to pay interns $10,000 but they don't tell you that you have to take out a loan and whatever you make goes towards paying it back with interest.

My boyfriend was completely blind to the fact that all of these components added up to it being a very obvious pyramid scheme of some kind. He was OBSESSED with the job. He would work countless hours to the point where his grades started to suffer. When we went on dates, he would take phone calls from the company in the middle of dinner and be on the phone for 30+ minutes at a time because he believed it was the most important thing in his life. Eventually, it got to the point that it was all he ever talked about, or did. It honestly felt like he was brainwashed. He wouldn't listen to me when I tried to tell him it was a scheme, and always said ""How can it be a scheme if I'm making money?"" It ultimately got to be too much, and I broke up with him primarily due to his involvement with the company.

We still talk sometimes, and I recently discovered that he sold enough services that the company sent him on an all expenses paid trip to Cancun. He claimed that a pyramid scheme wouldn't possibly send their employees on such an extravagant vacation, but I argued that's EXACTLY what they would do.

I'd love to get people's thoughts on my experience. Does College Works Painting sounds like a pyramid scheme? Was I right in breaking up with him over this? All opinions are welcome."

But an exact explanation of my current situation.

When i join tertiary education in 2017, i met my ""friends"" and i thought this was my best day of my life because i got what i thought an ideal friend would be like. Our clique is small. I didn't get along with a person B(for confidentiality sake) which is person A's friend since highschool/ secondary school. 

I don't know which words in the english dictionary can explain person B's personality but i'll give an example of what he does and you guys can judge.

Whenever i ask my lecturer questions, he would interrupt and ""angrily"" shout at me saying ""You never listened in class? Thats so easy."" My ""clique"" quietly watched. Person B is also the type of person that will never listen to your argument and is a huge hypocrite. 

So for example, we can be arguing about which graphics card is better. 1080TI vs 680TI. And if he thinks 680TI is better, he will not listen to what you have to say and when i gave an analogy like ""1080TI is like a bugatti veyron and 680TI would be like a Mercedes C63 AMG."" he would reply with ""No, you can't compare cars with graphics cards. They are different. You don't know jackshit."" Which is why i don't get a long with person B. And the rest of the clique doesn't do anything. There is too much bad qualities about him then i care to write so i'll just move on. 

This person B, somehow really dislike me and started to gossip to the clique members secretly and i found out. Which made me dislike person B even more. There are times person B do stupid shit to piss me off. Like kicking the door and the door would rebound to me. He basically did a lot of stuff to trigger me all of which are obvious. And my ""friends"" never said anything despite me asking them whether if it's right to do such a thing.

Fast forward, i seek help from my bestfriend who is currently studying law and is at a different school. He told me to tell them that they're pussies. So i did, and it triggered my ""friends"" so much that they went to person B and person B confronted me in canteen. Everyone is against me. So i thought, maybe its really my fault. 

During the end of the year exam, my ""clique"" sat near me but never talked to me. They shared advices and tips to get good grades and i overheard them. They got even salty that i got a perfect GPA where as they get the average GPA. 

Fast forward to 2018, we are having internship and we do shift work. Person A called me to cover for him. I agreed. Which i discover, he went to party and invite everyone of our clique but me. And person A later admit it to me and told me what has been said behind me (Not surprised as i've been through a lot to be able to read a person's mind just by facial expression).

We had to do project for our internship. And i did 100% of the work. I told person A to write the script he didn't. He said he wants to ""help""me. Which he never did. So i asked him to take a picture for me because it's my off day. He ""forgot"" to take picture of it. Which pissed me off. 

And he said that he will ""help"" me to go back to the days where everyone is happy. But the method he did only annoys me even further. During my off days, he message me every single day and did stupid 1 sentence conversation and whenever i reply and made effort to write like 2-3 sentences, he just gives me the ""oh hahaha"" every single day. So i gave up and replied very late and did the same to him. 

We came back to school recently for briefing. The clique basically outcasted me. At that point, I don't care anymore. But what makes it difficult is that, person B and another clique member sits next to me. I'm in between. And during group work, i always have to partner with person C(the other clique member) which i don't care as long as we get the job done and i think he thinks the same as well. 

Other than them, i don't have friends. I screwed up during my first year and i was known for being serious, unapproachable and fierce. And now, everyone kinda avoids me and it's even more difficult when i'm an introvert and have social anxiety. What should i do?"

Various members of this family have been Knights of the Order of the Garter including John Churchill the 1st Duke of Marlborough. They originate from the Despencer family and Hugh le Despencer the 1st Baron of Despencer who held the position of Justiciar of England which is similar to the modern position of a prime minister. The Despencer family held high level positions in the English government. Winston Spencer-Churchill was a well known Prime Minister of the UK. Winston Churchill's grandfather was Leonard Jerome an American financier and friend and business associate of the wealthy Vanderbilt family. Consuelo Vanderbilt was married to Charles Richard Spencer-Churchill the 9th Duke of Marlborough. Anderson Cooper is a two time CIA intern and Vanderbilt that runs propaganda for CNN. Princess Diana of Wales was a Spencer so Prince William is closely related to this family. Charles Spencer the 9th Earl Spencer is a high level member of this family along with his wicked son Louis Frederick Spencer the Viscount of Althorp. Charles Spencer is involved with the mainstream media and worked for NBC. Randolph Churchill was a politician and journalist. The Spencer family are connected with the Freud and Murdoch families which run News Corp. and Freud Communications. Matthew Freud's ancestors are Sigmund Freud the brainwasher and fraudulent psychoanalyst as well as the propagandist Edward Bernays.

James Spencer-Churchill the 12th Duke of Marlborough is the head of the House of Spencer along with his son George Spencer-Churchill the Marquess of Blandford. They own the very large Blenheim Palace. Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill is married to Nathan Gelber the CEO of Stamford Associates which is an investment advisory company. The half brother of James Spencer-Churchill is Edward Spencer-Churchill and he is a business associate of Prince Valerio Massimo and they founded the aerospace company Auctus Industries and SCM Capital Partners. Edward Spencer-Churchill and Prince Valerio Massimo are extremely sadistic. The knight of the British Empire Rupert Soames is the CEO of Serco and a grandson of Winston Churchill. Serco is company that privatizes governments and runs health care systems, prisons, military agencies, information services, and transportation for governments. The Spencer family likely have shares in Serco. There are towns all over the United Kingdom and its commonwealths that are named Churchill. Charles Spencer's ex wife Karen Spencer established Whole Child International which is involved with orphanages around the world and has been financed by the Clinton Foundation. The royal and noble families are known for their involvement in trafficking children. They use fake charities as fronts. Various members of the Spencer-Churchill family have been involved with military. They founded The Churchill Machine Tool Company which then established Matrix Churchill a precision machining company that was given to the Iraqis which used the company to machine parts for artillery and rockets.

Winston Churchill was a Knight of the Order of the Garter which is really a continuation of the Knights Templar of London reestablished under a new name a few decades after they were disbanded. The Knights Templar were Christian Crusaders that fought to conquer over Jerusalem. The name Church Hill has the same meaning as Temple Mount. Temple Mount is a religious site in Jerusalem and where King Solomon built the first temple. King Solomon was considered to be a sorcerer who used ""demons"" to build his temple. The Knights Templar or Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon took their name from the ruins of Solomon's Temple during the Crusades. Freemasonry is partly based on the Knights Templar and the Freemasons and other similar groups use sorcery or witchcraft to mind control people into doing their bidding like building temples. Winston Churchill was Secretary of State for the Colonies during the British Mandate for Palestine which is when many Zionists under contract with the British Crown migrated into Israel. This was supported by the Balfour Declaration issued by the Knight of the Order of the Garter and former Prime Minister of the UK Arthur Balfour who was a political associate of Lord Randolph Churchill the father of Winston Churchill. The name Spencer refers to dispensing or distributing. The Spencer family gave over their machine company to the Iraqi government to make weapons which were likely used to kill Americans and British during the wars in Iraq. They also helped to give out land that wasn't theirs to Zionists."

---

**Date:** February 7th, 1997

**Attendance:** 3,100

**Buyrate** 122,000

Calling this event ""Judgement Day"" is probably way more poignant than the brass could've ever imagined when they chose it. Almost certainly it was picked just because of Terminator 2's release a few years earlier, and in general, the apocalypse was super in during the late 90's. Of course though in Terminator 2 it's the story of two eras, the past and the future, colliding head-on in a duel to decide the future of the world. In the same way, this event matches that motif exactly. Its muscles vs mustache as the new era collides head-on with the old leaving only the future in its wake. Now onto the show 

---

# Background

---

**Oh lord this poor show.**

I didn't become an avid fan of the sport until after 205 took place so I think I can speak for a lot of newer fans that might not have understood how big of a deal it was for that show to take place. Some might say it was the fact it was taking place in Madison Square Garden the worlds most famous arena, a few might say it's because it did well over a million buys, and others, the fact it crowned the first and only double champ. In reality what made the event so monumental was the fact it was able to take place at all.

Try to go back and find people reading about MMA back in the day and finding anyone who was covering it both regularly and positively. You can search high and low and you'll really only be able to find Dave Meltzer. If you go and read his newsletter from around the time that UFC 12 was going to take place, which I highly recommend so [link here](http://www.f4wonline.com/), you'll realize how close the sport came to dying.

This period of time was probably the most dangerous in the sport's history as far as North America is concerned. The initial roaring success the UFC had, became it's own worst enemy. As everyone knows a bunch of ~~people taking money from boxing organizations or trying to rattle up their base~~ moral crusaders came down on UFC thanks to its own, rather moronic, ""No Rules"" advertising. 

They just made the mistake of being too easy of a target while being too popular. Despite the public at large clearly loving it, the vocal groups who almost certainly never actually watched the events championed it's banning for one reason or another. Eventually, a huge portion of cable companies pulled the plug and top draws like Gracie or Shamrock went to do other things which would see the hype for UFC style combat fade from the public eye.

The problem is that even though the fan base was neutered it was still an easy thing for reporters or politicians to chastise in order to make themselves look good to whoever they need. Which is what happened to this event.

**The Night That the Lights Went out In Buffalo**

You may or not remember UFC 7 but don't worry the New York State Government didn't either so don't feel bad. Long story short what would go on to be called MMA, was illegal in New York State but essentially everyone forgot. Seriously. The event was apparently illegal but neither the promoters nor the legislature remembered until it was already over and everyone was well out of town. 

So for awhile UFC decided they would avoid going back because, you know, when you get lucky, don't try again. New York though suddenly got all sweet and sappy leaving text messages like ""hey bby it was a mistake I've changed and if you change ($ ka-ching $) I'm sure we can make it work"". 

State Senator Roy Goodman actually introduced and wrote up the bill that would legalize the sport. He stated that the bill would remove the brutal nature of the sport by making some key changes. The only changes that actually happened was the government taking a bigger cut of the gate. Really, that's it. I guess we all know the difference between barbarism and classy fisticuffs is how blow money you give your local district attorney.

**New York Times Ruins Everything**

Basically a reporter who will only be referred to as ""Bottom Feeder"" apparently had nothing better to do, wrote how a sport that allowed tap outs and ended after knockdowns, was so much less civilized than sports like boxing where the ref will do a 10 count on a dead body 'just to make sure.'

That's literally all it took.

Every other newspaper in New York jumped on the story trying to look more enlightened than the other. Meltzer really blasts these guys but just as a preview, one writer compared the UFC's promoter to Satan, called the fans ""low-watt cretins"", and said the only good thing about the fights was the blood.

First off, if you use the word cretin un-ironically you're an asshole. Secondly, you think someone who uses the word cretin would also notice the irony in openly admitting that blood makes something more entertaining. [Clearly a closeted Just Bleed.](http://cdn.lowkickmma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lol1.gif)

Suddenly the bill being passed was a horror and the sport of MMA was once again back to being an easy target for people who wanted to look holier-than-thou to point at and scream mean things. The very people who passed the bill were now condemning it for allowing human cockfighting into the state. I'm talking literally.

As in even Roy Goodman. ***The guy who wrote the god damn bill*** was coming out and saying it was a tragedy this was going to happen. 

The problem was the bill already passed, before the people who voted on it to pass realized it was a bad idea. UFC was already coming to town for a show since, you know, it's legal. So obviously the only right thing to do was have the commission create a new ""114"" page rulebook with rules that exist solely to keep the sport out of the state and in fact go as far as to make it more dangerous if those new rules were ever followed. Here's some of them:

&gt; Among the rules stipulated by the commission was banning chokes, the most prevalent submission move used in UFC matches; kicking above the shoulders or below the knee; head-butting; any strikes to the throat (which had previously already been banned in the existing law); striking an opponent while down; usage of knees and elbows to strike; any strikes to the neck or spine areas; attacking the groin area; mandating combatants wearing eight ounce boxing gloves as opposed to the fingerless grappling gloves; mandating all combatants wear protective headgear ala amateur boxers; implementing five weight classes and banning any matches in which the two combatants aren't in the same weight class (thereby destroying the planned tournament line-up for Friday); having the matches fought in five-minute rounds to be judged by athletic commission boxing judges on the ten point must system; and making it mandatory for an octagon if used, to be at least 40-feet in diameter. The octagon used by UFC is 32-feet in diameter so this rule, in essence, shows the real intention of the law since it would force UFC to have to build a new octagon which it couldn't do so quickly and thus force them out of the state. - Dave Meltzer, Wrestling Observer Newsletter.

Following that we get a few pages of Meltzer, in a very eloquent and calm tone, verbally taking a bat to the journalists, boxing promoters, and of course politicians. Pointing out how everyone is cool with boxing, car racing, and high school football where people actually have died, but the sport that doesn't have a huge financial organization behind it, as does everything who is hounding it for being barbaric. My favorite moment is when he points out that the politicians don't even know what they want banning.

There was another fighting event going around the same time in New York that they were also going after by the initials of EFC; the problem is they kept thinking it was [ECW](https://youtu.be/2kNxmxT3Wnw?t=18), the famous wrestling organization. You might think making a mistake of initials isn't that bad, but no, they literally talk about how there shouldn't be legal fighting organizations where people get beaten with chairs and thrown through flaming tables...

All in all, facing what might as well be an actual mugging the company had to book a show down-south as it was the only region left in the country where they could practice legally and of course do a last minute flight of the 200 something people in the operation as well as all the equipment. According to Meltzer's estimates, this whole affair would cost the company close to a million dollars. Keep in mind this event is only going to do 122k buys. How the company managed to scrape by for so long is a damn miracle.

So when you re-watch 205 just remember it's important because MSG is in the state that tried to kill MMA. It's also the reason that UFC 12 is taking place in the FORMER peanut capital of the world, and savior of the sport, Dothan, Alabama.


---

**Show Start**

* As stated above, we're fighting out of the best place to live in Alabama and the FORMER peanut capital of the world, Dothan Alabama. I live in the northeast of the United States so I'm spoiled with the fact that I pretty much can point to a random tree and something historically important or just plain weird took place there, so it's crazy to me to think somewhere is really only known for being the former peanut capital. 

* Perhaps there's a long-standing blood feud for the Peanut Capital naming rights I'm unaware of? Like the Hatfields and the McCoy's, only about peanuts.

* For the first time in history we have not one but two tournaments tonight. 

* Truly it's a big step away from what the product has been built on up until this point, the tournaments are divided into weight classes, heavyweight being at or above 200, and lightweight being below, and both only consist of 2 rounds. 

*In addition, the main event will be the first step into the modern era of the sport with a proper Heavyweight Champion to be crowned 

* They go down the lists of tournament members and mention in the lightweight bracket Takahashi is ""one of Pancrase's wildest fighters"" oh boy Bruce Beck. I'm from the future so let me tell you that's an understatement 

* Just to really mark this as the start of the Transitional Era, Joe Rogan makes his first appearance. Of course, if I never watched Fear Factor growing up I would have no idea this was Joe. He's far thinner, he actually has hair and his head is a whole different shape and seemingly 12 sizes smaller. If anything it looks like current Joe Rogan ate this past Joe Rogan and absorbed his essence. 

**Jerry Bohlander vs Rainy Martinez - Lightweight Semi Final (1/2)** 

* Rainy Martinez's name is something special. I can't decide if it's a stripper name or a 1930's gangster. Think it's both but I'm leaning towards gangster with a love of martinis. Rainy Martini Martinez 

* Rainy is also the oldest 33 year old you'll ever see. He looks a good decade over that 

* As far as Bohlander though, it's nice to see him again. He's a guy that stood out in previous tournaments as a guy that was working above his weight class, actually beating the 300 pound Scott Ferrozo in a fun fight at UFC 8. So if anyone should get a shot at a smaller size your and it's him. 

* The fight is short and quick. Some fun grappling before Bohlander gets a rear naked choke for the win. 

* Actually makes Bohlander the first person ever to win a fight that involved a weight class in UFC. Extra useless fun fact. 

* Rogan does his first ever interview with the winner and it's not much. The arena is clearly small since they're just doing it in a hallway that looks like something from a school. You know how the ceiling in schools is always those rectangular foam titles? Also, they randomly have WWE style colored mood lighting but only from one source so it looks like someone is shining a purple flashlight behind Rogan's head. 

~~*Wallid Ismail vs Yoshiki Takahashi - Lightweight Semifinal (2/2)*~~ 

**Takahashi's Great War to Break Referee John McCarthy's Sanity**  

* Commentators mention this is Vale Tudo vs  Pancrase. No, it's martial arts vs lunacy 

* Before the fight even begins its weird, why's Ismail taking minutes to walk out without any explained reason 

* We get an interview with Takahashi and he ends on the note that ""my biggest challenge is to be mentally in control"". He warned us, God he warned us.

* The fight starts with Takahashi swinging hard hands shaking Ismail right off the bat forcing Ismail to try to take it to the ground. Takahashi responds by grabbing Ismail's shorts with one hand pulling up seemingly as hard as he can just to give us a total view of half his ass as the other hand grabs the fence 

* Eventually Takahashi gets bored of assaulting Ismail's shorts and moves on to a new victim, Big John. He keeps grabbing the fence, this time using both hands. To which John keeps saying ""let go of the fence"" over, and over until the phrase means nothing anymore. Eventually, John snacks Takahashi's left hand off the cage, to which he responds be simply maintaining a firm grip with his right. Later when Ismail starts to move Big John is glaring at Takahashi who looks right at him, then at the cage, then back at John starring deeply into his eyes and just reaches out and grabs the cage never breaking eye contact. 

* When they finally move from the cage Takahashi rocks Ismail with punches, again dropping him. Instead of perusing, Takahashi looks at Big John, points at the downed Brazilian and yells something in Japanese 

* Ismail now frustrated charges, swinging at Takahashi, only Takahashi calmly ghosts each and every punch while looking bored because he doesn't exist in the same plane of existence as you or I. 

* Eventually though Takahashi gets pinned against the cage, only he has a new strategy now. He starts reaching around and pulling out Ismail's cup. No, seriously.  He keeps going down and grabbing it pulling up further and further until it's hanging out of his shorts 

* Takahashi's mania still not satisfied he then proceeds to punch Ismail's now unprotected balls 

* We then get more episodes of Takahashi seemingly getting bored of fighting and looking into Big John's eyes as he keeps grabbing the cage, only for John to knock his hand away, followed by Takahashi grabbing the cage again, because John is the real opponent here. 

* Takahashi takes it to the ground and starts headbutting Ismail 

* It goes to the break period before overtime. Big John reads Takahashi the riot act about fence grabbing, who responds by nodding, grabbing the fence, and pointing to Ismail 

* Camera cuts to Ismail bent over in the corner, head down, wondering what he did to deserve this. 

* When the overtime starts, Ismail refuses to leave his corner at first knowing what his life has become.

* Takahashi punches Ismail in the head, then turns to Big John making a T with his hands and asking for a timeout 

* The end of the overtime involves Takahashi soccer kicking Ismail wearing shoes because Takahashi has a checklist of rules that need to be broken and he had to get them all in.

* Takahashi wins by unanimous decision because how could he not? He's a force of nature, chaos embodied, the judges know better.

**Rules; What are they Good for?**

The answer is nothing if you don't enforce them.

Obviously, this Takahashi fight is one of the greatest bouts in the history of our sports and an extreme example of rule breaking but it does really illustrate a problem with MMA that is still around to this day; there's very little downside in cheating.

When it comes to things like cage grabbing, low blows, and eye pokes (notice how even Taka didn't eye poke? That's cause he has something called class, Jon), fighters essentially have carte blanche to do whatever they feel. Even people who are generally considered good refs like to get in there and give guys the dad talk like Big Jon who tends to rarely call for a point reduction. This, in my opinion, stems from two factors.

***1) The Refs are Personally Held Accountable***

Now that might sound like a good thing. Someone who holds fighters well being in their hands should know full well if they make a mistake it will be known, but this comes with downsides. The biggest, of course, is trepidation. 

Take a look at that incident back in the day when Heart Ref called a finish before a fighter got choked out. The move was locked in, the guy getting shocked wasn't going to tap, but he was a second from passing out anyway, so Heart Ref stepped in and just called it for what it was, a loss. Of course, there's debate as to whether or not the choke should be allowed to go through. Personally, I think it's pointless to let a guy pass out just for the sake of pride, so if the ref wants to call it just have at it, but plenty of people didn't. So this resulted in Heart Ref's social media being bombarded by random people furious at him. Even Dana White the owner of the company was cursing him out on Instagram.

And that's for a call that was pointless. Imagine being a ref and knowing how people react to calls like this. In team sports, there's dozens of refs all running around. When they make a call that affects the game people get angry at ""the refs"". In MMA if a ref makes a bad call it's ""let's burn down John McCarthy's house"". So if a title is on the line, or someone has a huge fanbase, or the UFC really wants an event to go off without any fuckery, you're gonna have hesitant refs to take off points even for legitimate fouls.

***2) Intent is Really Important for Some Reason***

If you remember playing Halo 2 back in the day you'll know that if you got caught screen looking you could just say it was totally an accident and chances are people will move on.

MMA rules function under the same jurisdiction of enforcement as Halo 2 in the living room.

You already have refs who are going to be predisposed for not taking points away. Now you add in the fact that you give them justification for not taking those points away and shocker, it suddenly rarely happens. It's how GDR manages to punch Holly after the bell TWICE and not lose a single point. The ref and fighter just wiggle their hands and say ""she didn't mean it"" and then suddenly it never happened.

The issue with this is that even ignoring the fact it opens the door for cheating, it encourages the fighters to not really follow the rules. Just swing wildly and don't mind when your knee hits someone's balls or your fingers go three inches into their eye sockets because it's actually advantageous for you to do so. If you're trying to follow the rules and your opponent doesn't care you're now at a disadvantage, and if he ""accidentally"" eye pokes you well now you're blind for the rest of the fight. I know some will say it's minor but I'm sure if someone did a study there would be a big percentage drop off of a fighters chance of winning once he takes a finger to the eye.

Essentially these things shouldn't be up to the ref, and it shouldn't be a matter of intent. Once it happens the person who suffered from it is going to be at a disadvantage. So really it should just be automatic. There's gonna be people saying it's unfair cause ""heat of the moment"" but I can guarantee if there were automatic point loses for eye pokes or low blows they would magically disappear from the sport.

But that's like...my opinion man.

**Scott Ferrozo vs Jim Mullen - Heavyweight Semifinal (1/2)**

* They do an interview where Jim Mullen says he's already seen himself win 10 times through a hypnotherapist and that its ""already a completed mission"". What the hell is with people on this card?

* Ferrozo's interview, he says how he ideally doesn't want to get hit in the face at all and that he doesn't want to go to the doctor's afterward. Can't really argue with that logic. 

* Oh fucking Christ no, Tank Abbott is back on commentary. 

* I said a lot of shockingly good things about Tank Abbott on the last show, that will not happen tonight. He starts by mocking the lightweights for not being able to hang with the big boys, despite the fact Tank has consistently lost to people smaller than him.

* He calls Ferrozo ""rotund"". I don't even need to make a joke about that 

* Ferrozo decided to wear leggings at over 300 pounds. Who let him do this to himself? 

* The fight is just 8 minutes of Ferrozo punching, kneeing, and laying on Mullen until eventually he just knocks him out with a punch before dropping a few knees just to make sure. I guess the hypnotherapist was looking into the future of another dimension, sucks when that happens. 

**Vitor Belfort vs Tra Telligman - Heavyweight Semifinal (2/2)**

* Tra actually has a crazy cool look. He apparently had an accident when he was a child which actually left him completely without a right pectoral. It's just missing, but he's really well built everywhere else so he looks like a grizzled vet in a sci-fi movie. 

* His nickname is even cooler and a bit clever, Trauma

* Sadly he's facing Vitor Belfort. 19 year old, ridiculously ripped, Brazilian genetic experiment, Vitor. Poor guy 

* Vitor comes out and is just a flurry. Whenever he starts swinging it looks like you accidentally hit fast forward.

* Vitor destroys Telligman and actually makes sure to stop once Telligman is out and alerts Big John himself. Really classy. 

* Tanks commentary finishes the fight by taking me on a journey.

&gt;Tank starts to talk about Tra. Instinctively I tense up.
&gt;&gt;Tank jokes about Tra wishing he had another pec. I'm both sad and unsurprised.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Tank keeps talking. Why do they let Tank talk?

**Main Event Hype Promo - Mark Coleman** 

* We get a promo package for Mark Coleman that's mostly just focusing on him being a massive steroid monster and lifting just as massive amounts of weight. 

* For some reason, the heavy bag behind him is swinging. Someone did that on purpose 

**Jerry Bohlander vs Nick Sanzo - Lightweight Finals** 

* Takahashi is out with a broken hand and replaced by Sanzo. I can't tell if this is a good thing or a bad thing but I don't think I was prepared to see what Takahashi could do now that he was warmed up. 

* Bruce Beck messes up Upstate New York with New York City. If you want some good advice, go to any bar in Upstate New York around 2am or so and just keep calling it variations of ""the city"" or Manhattan, maybe sprinkle on talking about how much New York State is useless outside of NYC. They'll LOVE you. 

* The fight starts, there really isn't anything before it's over. Bohlander gets a submission on Sanzo with a crucifix which looks like whatever a reverse fully Nelson would look like if that was something that existed. 

* While the final fight wasn't great, what does seem pretty great is Bohlander walking out as the first Lightweight Champion (of course it's a tournament, and lightweight becomes middleweight which then becomes light heavyweight but the point still stands). Guy stood out as someone who was only held back because of a huge size disadvantage. Getting the opportunity to show what he can do without that disadvantage and capitalize is a fantastic moment for the slow build towards proper weight divisions. 

* Sadly though the prize for winning tournaments has become rather lame. You used to get a big ass custom title belt, now you get a really generic looking medal what looks like something you'd wear with a Kurt Angle costume. 

**Main Event Hype Promo - Dan Severn**

* There aren't really words that do this package justice. Just look at this gif https://imgur.com/a/ryyyu

* They also take the swinging heavy bag thing to its logical extreme and have 3 swinging in the background pointlessly. Just fun picturing some intern forced to repush them every time Severn flubs a line. 

**Scott Ferrozzo vs Vitor Belfort - Heavyweight Finals** 

* So yeah Vitor Belfort has hands that are essentially shoulder-mounted machine guns whereas Scott Ferrozzo... well he's Scott Ferrozzo. I'll miss you, Scott. Not that much but I will miss you. 

* And just like that, the funeral bells were ringing for Ferrozzo. Vitor came out with calm but furious precision and dropped him to the ground quickly. After Vitor started to lay on the ground and pound, the ref came, in the end, and gave him the victory.

* Of course though just as we think it's over Scott rises from grave like a concussed monster. Coming from off camera he picks off Vitor seemingly, thinking the fight is still going, causing both refs to freak out and charge, pinning him against the cage yelling for him to calm the hell down. 

* During Vitor's interview he's so winded he can only go about 3-4 words without taking a massive breath and you can tell he's both excited and struggling a little with English. Leading to Rogan trying to transition to talking to other people but Vitor keeps coming back

Dramatized example: 

&gt;**""I...love...UFC...thank you...mom...""**

&gt;""Ok that's great now let's talk to Carlson Gracie...""

&gt;**""Car...car....car....""**

&gt;""Carlson?""

&gt;**""Carlson....Gracie....is great...gonna list off...my friends now""** 

* He does mention though wanting to make his life and career fighting and 20 years later in present time he's still going. So good for you Belfort. 

**Don Fyre Interview** 

* Don Frye joins the commentary team for the main event but provides a brief interview, very vaguely explaining why he isn't involved in this match. Politics, broken hand, and donuts, all get a shout out but it really doesn't matter. Fyre never fights for the UFC ever again with this being his last real appearance as an in-ring talent. 

**Main Event: Dan Severn vs Mark Coleman - Heavyweight Championship Tournament/Superfight Unification Match** 

* Judgement Day is finally upon us as the last of the old guard still standing, tries to hold his ground against the seeming first interaction of a new breed of talent.

* Coleman comes out with both of his tournament belts held high. Really helps make him feel like a big deal if the whole mountain of murderous muscle thing didn't strike that into you already.

* Sadly Severn doesn't walk out with his amazing and gigantic Superfight title. Seems like making that was a huge waste of money since it was one screen, maybe once for a few minutes. 

* We get the weirdest ref/fighter convo you'll ever hear. Severn asks one of those 'if my train leaves at this station at 38mph' questions but then ends it with 'how many apples are in the basket?' to which Big John responds without missing a beat 'Monkey. Now hope you fight smarter'. Yeah. 

* The fight ends up being completely one-sided. Coleman takes it to the ground and pretty much can do whatever he wants with Severn, who does out and effort up at first, but seemingly saw the writing on the wall and tapped out while in a headlock/choke on the ground. Considering, like Shamrock earlier, he would've been smelling a nice fat WWF contract around this time, made sense not to fight a losing battle.  

--- 

Of course, if this was a wrestling show like New York State seemed to believe, Frye would have hopped the fence, clocked Coleman, before throwing him through a flaming, octagon shaped table. With the show finishing on Fyre doing a hip swivel as Severn announces that ""Mustache Mountain is taking over!""

---

* Regardless though, this now marks Coleman as a 2 time, back to back, tournament champion and the first ever heavyweight champion. On top of that, he decimated both Fyre and Severn to get those titles, as he poses with his steadily growing collection of gold it's pretty clear the Coleman Era has only just begun.

#Final Impressions

---

**Overall Impression: Worth a watch** 

If you're even slightly interested in the history of MMA or even just UFC, in particular, this event is worth it to track down. It's not anything that'll blow you away, but if you have even the slightest interest in it or are a fan of Vitor it deserves a watch.

This show is the beginning and pretty much the encapsulation of the Transitional Era that UFC would be in from this event onward to UFC 17. It's got the little mini-tournament, but it's also got these new things called weight classes (but only two). It's got genuine athletes and champions like Vitor and Coleman, but it's also got Takahashi ripping out a guys cup and someone talking about a psychic showing them the future. There's a bit of everything so it works as a summary of both the first run of 10 events and the second 10 nicely.

There's also just simply a ton of historic value for this event. The debut of Vitor Belfort, the introduction of weight classes, the first successful step in moving away from tournaments, and most importantly, the first Heavyweight Champion being crowned. The first weight class belt and the first belt to exist that UFC still uses to this day. So this is very much the beginning of the lineage.

The only downside for the show is the main event. I love Coleman and Severn but it's just over before it starts. Coleman basically does everything Severn uses to win, only he's a monstrous science experiment to Severn's gym teacher. Sev also isn't stupid. Once he gets down to a position where he realizes he's lost he taps out. He did this before with Shamrock as well. The guy doesn't take extra damage for the sake of pride, but it does leave the show ending on a pretty nothing, but still important, fight.

**Stand out performance: Vitor Belfort**

A lot of legendary careers don't start out with a legendary performance but in this case, I think it's easy to say Vitor's did. He had a lot of hype and his competition wasn't very high level, but it's impossible to deny how impressive he looks once his hands start moving. The guy seems like something out of a movie that the other fighters just try to survive more than win. 21 years later it's clear Vitor came to take the MMA world by storm.

**Fight of the night: Takahashi vs the World**

When you really get into it there aren't that many super unique MMA fights. Plenty of amazing standout ones but not too many where you can go to a person ""hey was that real? Am I hallucinating? What is going on?"" and that's what Takahashi brings us. Just on sheer strangeness and hilarious unintentional comedy this is a must watch. If you're an MMA fan and you want to see the antics back in the wild west days of the sport, this is something that you really need to see.

---

#What's Next?

---

Well the most dominant athlete in the history of the UFC is now our heavyweight champion and we have a clear number one contender in the first winner of a heavyweight tournament. So obviously we're gonna get Vitor vs Coleman for the title right? Well... no. We're gonna get Vitor vs Tank Abbott. Why is Tank getting another main event off of another loss? Find out next time on UFC 13: Collision Course (warning: you won't actually find out why.)

84vf6w,20,2018-03-16,Quit an internship or not?,delurach,singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/84vf6w/quit_an_internship_or_not/,"Basically, I signed up for an internship as a Dental assistant after A levels. I was told during the interview that I’d have to do counter duties &amp; learn how to assist dentists in their procedures. I decided to take up the job because I was drawn to the dental assisting aspect of the job (i love hands on, hates being desk-bound and doing nothing)

However, upon the start of the internship, I realized it was not what I have expected it to be. 

The first week, I was taught by the clinic coordinator - how to bill patients, book appointments etc. That was about it, I actually managed to master the counter duties in a few days. I continued being the counter staff for like a month and it made me felt like I’ve signed up for a job as a receptionist, not a dental assistant.

Most of the time, I was doing nothing and just facing the computer. It was utterly boring and I really don’t think I learnt anything useful in the future during this period. 

I tried repeatedly requesting to enter the room during procedures so I could observe and learn. However the clinic coordinator was rather unwilling, even when the executive told her to teach me. So I took matters into my own hands and shadowed other dental assistants, as well as doing homework on my part. 

If not for the other staffs, I probably wouldn’t have learnt how to assist in basic procedures. 

Now I’m occasionally given the chance to assist, but the clinic coordinator continues to doubt my abilities. I mean, for more complex procedures, the dentists were willing to teach me, but the clinic coordinator just didn’t want them to. I have no idea why. She just keeps denying me of the chance to learn, and only gives me easy tasks. (Like really, if there’s no challenge, how can I learn..)

Additionally, there is no fixed location to this job and the roster changes every week. They roster me to places @ Compass 1, which is approx 1.5hour from my home. I have to work from 8.30am till 9.30pm on those days where I am there. And when I am there, I am again desk-bound which I really, really dread. It’s making me really unhappy and upset.

What should I do? I mean the pay is about $640 after CPF deduction and the employee benefits aren’t that great either. However, I like the dentists I am working with and my colleagues are generally nice. I also like the part of assisting dentists, and the procedures I’ve witnessed really intrigued me, making me yearn to be involved in the procedures.

I’m thinking of resigning but I’m afraid I might leave regrets behind. (Dentists i work with are really nice. Think I’ll miss them) However, if I don’t resign I have to continue for another 4 months. 

I have requested to speak to a senior executive next week (who is in-charge of me). What should I say?

Please provide advice and suggestions, thank you!"
84vih4,38,2018-03-16,Passed Icnd1 934/1000!!,Behemoth5522,ccna,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/84vih4/passed_icnd1_9341000/,"First off I was really surprised at the score I got. I figured I was either barely going to fail or pass.

I went through the net academy in college back in 2010 ish and tried this exam twice failing both times and missing the 2nd exam by 10 points. So I got pretty discouraged at the time. Then I had some personal life situations come up that had me put any more schooling on the back burner.

But over the years I had this want to get this cert in the back of mind and it wasn't just recently when I decided it's now or never.

So I pretty much have been studying on and off for the past few years. Honesty most of the material I was going through was more or less a refresher of what I already knew. There were a few new things here and there that I learned as well as finding out my weak points.

So over the span of those years I used both Odom and lammel study books. And cbt nuggets and Chris byrant videos. Also decided to try the boson exam software.
I feel lammels stuff reads better than Odom, and favor byrant over Jeremy cause it's more technical and doesn't get off track. Halfway through cbt I got annoyed and just wanted to hear about the material and not some off story... I paid money for this after all.

I basically got all the material cause of being nervous and anxiety of failing it a third time. And it wasn't real until I finally scheduled the exam.

I got boson cause of all the recommendations of it and I feel like I'm in the middle of how good it was. I wasn't expecting it to be word for word on the test but maybe something similar. There were a few questions that sounded close but not many. I think it just helped with being in that exam environment more so.
I was actually bummed that I didn't get any subnetting questions or questions about the change of Mac address /ip address of frames /packets as they travel through the network. Cause there were many of those on boson and I was doing them no problem.

I felt I knew about 80% of the questions confidentially with a few that I couldn't exactly remember. Then there were a few I had no idea about. I had maybe 3-4 Sims with one being at the start of the exam. Which at that time I was really nervous and had hard time focusing. Maybe took me 10 minutes to do cause of that. 
But after that I  got  some questions I felt like I knew and it became a breeze. 

Also I currently don't work in the industry had to take a different job to make money at the time. The only thing I have on my resume to get an IT job was. An associates degree in Cs and an IT internship of 3 months back in 2010. So I got this cert to have something more recent on my resume to finally get my foot in the door. 

I was studying for this while working an 45+ hour a week job and raising 2 kids with a wife.
So it was hard at times to really focus.
But if I can do it under these conditions then other people can as well.

Because I want to find out more about the difference between this 2 courses. 

Differences can be in terms of:

84x99l,37,2018-03-16,FAQ: Study Abroad in the US,exMalaysian,malaysia,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/84x99l/faq_study_abroad_in_the_us/,"Seeing that the SPM results have just been released, I would like to offer some helps for those who are interested in pursuing their higher education in the USA. Below are some commonly asked questions by many people, but if you have any specific question, please feel free to pm me.

Disclaimer: This is meant for general info only. It certainly doesn't apply to those Ivy League or *alien* schools like Harvard, MIT, Yale etc.

A few terminologies: *Long semesters = Spring (January - May) and Fall (August - December), Short semester = Summer (May - August)*

**Tuition fees (including textbooks, materials etc.)**  
For international students (most commonly F or J visas) - Roughly $17,000 / long semester, $1500 / credit in the Summer.  
In-state (for US citizens, PR, but also for *H or L visas*) - Roughly $6000 / long semester, $500 / credit in the Summer. *H or L visas are for workers, say, if your mom or dad are already on one of these visas, they can apply for your dependent visa*

**Cost of living**  
Well, it depends on where you go. Places like New York, LA, I'd say $2500 / month; Midwest like Indiana, Illinois, Ohio etc., you can probably live by with $700 / month.  

**Application**  
Most, if not all, Universities in the US don't accept SPM results as prerequisites for the admission. Reason being US primary education consists of 12 years whereas they consider SPM as 11 years of education. Most Malaysians take at least a year of American program (INTI and Taylor offer some really good courses) before coming to the US.  
You will also need to take any English proficiency test such as TOEFL, IELTS or SAT. Many universities also accept GCE-O Level English with grade of A.  
To apply as **Freshman**, complete one year of American program in a local college, then apply as Freshman. SAT is mandatory for Freshman admissions.  
If you stay longer in your local college (usually at least 2 years), you can as **Transfer**. I recommend people applying as Transfer because the process is much simpler, and save some money.  

**Deadline**  
For a typical Fall (August) intake, the deadline is January. I know Jan has already past, but you can't apply with your SPM result anyway, so hurry up and apply to one of the local colleges.  

**What program should I apply?**  
If your intention is to get a job after graduation or possibly emigrate here, go for Computer Science, the nerdier the better! Job prosperity for CS is so good that they even exceed those of engineering majors. If you do well in CS (very good grades + plenty of internship experience), it is almost impossible not to get a job in the US. Do NOT go for Cyber Security though, you can't get a job in cyber security as a non-citizen, Uncle Sam won't let you!  
Otherwise, follow your interests.  

**Visa**  
If you're lucky and you have immediate family members already living/working in the US, you can possibly apply for PR, H or L visa. (as a dependent)  
Otherwise, usually you have 2 options to choose from: F or J visa.  
In short, F visa has more restrictions during your study, but it allows you to convert to other visas later on with no restriction. F visa is generally better for those who have intention to work/emigrate to US in the future.  
J visa offers some work opportunity during school, but it has 2 years residency requirements. (meaning you must return to your home country for at least 2 years after you complete your study and you *cannot* convert to other visas during that 2 years) *there are ways, but a lot more complicated.*  
After you got accepted to a school, the school will ask you for the type of visa you wish to apply for. But sometimes they won't ask, so make sure you send the request yourself.

I’m currently planning to concentrate in Marketing &amp; IT. I’m a 3rd year transfer student. I have most experience in administrative work where I’ve worked at my community college’s testing center and now, at the Career Center. I volunteer on behalf of Cavs in the Classroom and I’m a member of WLDP, WBFM, and AMA. My resume’s been approved and looked over by career peer educators and counselors and I’ve managed to grab maybe 4 or 5 interviews.

Unfortunately, it feels like I’m not making any progress. I’ve applied to over 20 already and they haven’t reached out to me, or at least if I have a phone interview, it takes them a while to get back with me. I’ve gotten a couple emails rejecting me saying that they found other candidates, and it all just makes me feel discouraged.

I cater my resume and cover letter to these positions. I make sure I cater the skills I’ve learned to what they’re looking for. Idk if it’s the way I come across in my interviews because I try to be very patient and explain my skills and what I’ve done to show them I’m capable of doing my job (and especially for the type of job at hand by telling them the projects I’ve done and what I’ve learned in my curriculum), even though I get really nervous during the interview. 

How long did it take you guys to secure an internship? Any tips? I feel so discouraged and I’m afraid I won’t be able to get anything for the summer, and my marketing degree will just be in vain. "
84xg0p,3,2018-03-16,Had my second Lucid Dream just an hour or two ago! All within a twenty minute nap after 5 hours of sleep! How is this possible?,tgkennedy,LucidDreaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/84xg0p/had_my_second_lucid_dream_just_an_hour_or_two_ago/,"I am thoroughly shocked that I was able to have this dream, because under all circumstances, I shouldn't have!


Of course, we can't judge why it's possible without context, so here is how the day went:


I woke up at around 7 o clock AM, fell back to sleep for about 25 minutes, and then got up, ate my breakfast of eggs and bacon, and headed out. I was running on about five hours of sleep, and have actually stopped practicing for Lucid Dreams because I needed to fix my sleep first.


At tech school, I was worn out. I fell asleep multiple times throughout the 3 hour time span, sleeping through about half of it. Once lunch had hit, I up and went home. At home, I usually have lunch, and then take a nap that can range anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes depending on when I actually lay down. I was really tired of course, so I drank some apple juice and went to bed, talking with a few friends, before eventually passing out for a 20 minute nap at 11:45ish.


This is when weird things started happening. I was having MUCH more vivid images pop up in my head as I was starting to doze off, and I heard a buzzing in my head. This was after about 5 minutes. I tried to concentrate on it, but it faded. I started thinking, was this WILD I was close to experiencing? Unfortunately, I couldn't replicate it, so I just let myself fall asleep.


This is when it happened. Suddenly, I was up in a different bed in a different room in my house, with people talking around me. Immediately, I knew something was off, because I had just fallen asleep in my own bed right? That's when lucidity hit. I stood up, and found it very hard and fuzzy to move. I remember to rub my hands and spin around, which helped a little. I also planted my back against the wall, which also helped.


I tried to summon a sword by thinking it into my hand, but it did not work. I didn't mind though, I knew that I had to actually get my feel for this. I walked outside the room, and things started getting fuzzy again, this time a little more nerve wracking. Fear started to creep in, and as the mind starts to emulate things, I saw a large shadow creep from where my room would be on the floor. However, I knew this was just the trick of the mind, and pushed through, which caused it to disappear and for me to very quickly move into the entry way of my house. A family member was in the office nearby, but I didn't look at them.


That's when it hit me- this dream is *very* realistic. I rose my hands, and did a reality check. Finger through palm? Doesn't work. My finger collides with my palm. I then try to breath through my nose, and that also did not work, as I could not breath when I tried! Or at least, I did not notice it. Strange, because that RC supposedly always works in a dream!


The dream started to get fuzzy again, and I knew that soon, my alarm would wake me up. I wasn't sure how long I had been in the dream, but I decided that it was time to wake up. Hell, I didn't even know if I was lucid dreaming or not at this point, because both my reality checks failed. Maybe I was sleep walking or simply just delusional from sleep deprivation?


I wake myself up, and it is confirmed. I was in fact dreaming, as I wake up back in my bed. I perform a reality check, all is good, and no fuzziness. I still had time left, and I tried to maybe doze back off and re-enter the dream, but no luck. I get up once my alarm goes off, dress formally for my internship, and head out. Now I am typing you all here, and asking...


How is this possible? A 20 minute nap shouldn't be long enough to reach REM right? Could it be, that the multiple naps I took through the day, and then this one, somehow caught up and slowly transitioned me to REM sleep? I have also heard that apple juice helps a lot with dreams somehow, could that have been a factor?


**How is it, that only after 5 hours of sleep, and a few rough naps throughout the day, was I able to have a lucid dream all within the span of one 20 minute nap?**


Thank you all in advance. I'm honestly curious as to how I was able to do this."

My company has a law firm handling my work visa, etc.

Assuming that I'll eventually want to move back to the States (or at least want this to be an option), what's the best way to improve my US Credit score while abroad (assuming they differ by country). I currently have a 673, but the biggest mark against me is that I don't have a long credit history. I have about $20,000 in federal loans left (I paid them down aggressively during paid internships), and a single credit card with a $1250 limit. It started out as a secured card with a $200 safety deposit, but recently got upgraded after a year of no late payments. 

What kind of things matter re: credit internationally? For example, my first car is not going to pass Canadian regulations (too much body rust/frame rust). Will my credit score carry over to Canada, or should I buy a car before I leave if I want decent rates?

Lastly, I'm going to be making $75,000 a year + a 10k signing bonus, all CAD, with an option for a raise every year. Besides paying down my loans and coping with enormous Vancouver cost of living, what should I be doing with that money, considering I want to keep my options open with going back to the US?

Thank you :)"
84xonj,5,2018-03-16,What's next for our characters ? Work/school/internship...,Kilian7,htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/84xonj/whats_next_for_our_characters_workschoolinternship/,"**Annalise** : well, she has no idea, me neither. She'll keep working as a lawyer obviously, probably defending a different type of clients than she used to. But what about teaching ? She is a national star now, surely Soraya can do something.

**Bonnie** : seems like she will keep working at the DA's office. With our K4 troublemakers, they obviously need a mole in there. *Keating-Winterbottom-Delfino* will have to wait until Frank become a lawyer, if they are not all dead or in jail by then.

**Frank** : will be attending Middleton Law School. Damn, if AK could go back to teaching, that could be interesting to see poor Frank in that amphitheater, bullied by AK😂. I suppose AK will take him as an intern. 

The K4 :

My main concern : **Michaela**. Since Tegan helped with Jorge, does that mean she will forgive Michaela and take her back at Caplan &amp; Gold as an intern ? Honestly, with that new attitud of her, I want her and her childish and means manners as far from Annalise as possible. She has raised her ungrateful brattiness to a whole new level. I would gladly leave it to her 2nd *mommy* to deal with that.

**Connor** : since he didn't drop out but failed out, he can't take these summer classes he was talking about to join the crew in 3L, right ? I suppose he'll be back to working for AK as an intern. He deserves it.

**Laurel** : with the FBI lady, she mentioned her come back to the DA's office after her maternity leave... Is that the plan and we can have that Nate/Bonnie/Laurel working trio I expected to see this season ?

**Asher** : I suppose he'll keep working with AK as her intern.

So basically, we'll have Connor/Frank/Asher back with AK, Laurel/Bonnie/Nate at the DA'S office, Michaela with Tegan or AK ?? They'll still be split up, but far less than what we had in 4A.

84xss1,1,2018-03-16,How to take a close friendship down a notch without hurting feelings?,nvwls90,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/84xss1/how_to_take_a_close_friendship_down_a_notch/,"**tl;dr** Have friend who I would like to distance myself from/reject help from, don't want to hurt their feelings. 

I have a friend who I have known for half of our lives and while we don't always get along, we're always close when we do. 

She was very excited to learn that I was pregnant and contacted my mother about planning the baby shower, which I appreciated.

My mom and BF mom &amp; sister really spearheaded the project. My mom found the restaurant, got the cake, had candy made, invited most of the people &amp; paid for everything.  BF's sister paid for all of the decorations, came up with a lot of the ideas, rented a ridiculous light up chair for me to sit in while opening gifts, and set up the party.  They gave my friend one simple task:  Write invitations, send them. My mom provided the stationary and stamps as well as addresses, so she didn't have to do much besides fill in the blanks and drop them in a mailbox. 

She made a myriad of mistakes:

1. She didn't put my boyfriends name anywhere on the invitation, so many of his extended family and family friends who don't know me by my full name were confused as to what the invitation was for. 

2. She somehow forgot to send out for 25% of the people who were invited.  My mom only realized after several weeks when she wondered why she hadn't heard back from certain people she was sure she would have. Most of these people were family members who heard through word of mouth and were either hurt and confused as to why they weren't invited, or were told too late &amp; had scheduling conflicts.  My mom asked my friend about this, and being the kind of person she is, straight up asked my friend if she was high when she wrote them (I know that she was, actually. Her BF had just gotten back from CA with gifts of THC of her) My friend claimed that she ""had never been so insulted"" (How can you be insulted by being accused of getting high when you were in fact high?? ) and that she was ""trying her best.""  She literally had one job. Both my mother and myself were turned off by her unwillingness to take any responsibility for her mistake.  My mom stopped speaking to her at this point, I pretended I didn't know about what was going on to avoid getting involved between them.

3.  Laughably, she named herself the host.  This is a small point but, she had nothing at all to do with the organization of the party.  She didn't plan anything, she didn't pay for anything, she successfully completed less than 75% of the only task she had, but she felt it was appropriate to tell people she was hosting it. 

4. She didn't even actually send them. She wrote them out and gave them back to my mom, who assumed she wrote them out correctly and placed them in a mailbox.  We are both perplexed as to why she couldn't do that herself. 

Then there was the thing where it was supposed to be a surprise.  I told her I knew of the party but nothing else and wasn't supposed to know when it was or anything about it. The next words out of her mouth were her telling me the day, time, and place.  She did this to me with a mystery book I was reading 10 years ago. I'm still irked. Still though, I was not yet at the end of my patience with her. 

Then the day of the party, it's supposed to be a surprise so I had to get there a little later than everyone else.  She actually has the audacity to text me all morning complaining that she got there early, and she's so bored, and to pester me about when I was going to show up. Like, it's my baby shower, I have 50 other guests to attend to, and the LAST thing I am worried about is entertaining you. I felt it was rude and inappropriate for her to rush me and complain to me the morning of about getting there early to comfort her and keep her company. I ignored her texts. When I got there, an hour after she did, she was already drunk and high. She was the only person there who got drunk, out of 50.  She also started questioning the waitress about getting a part time weekend job, which I felt she could have done another time but whatever. 

Ok so baby shower was a success and it's behind us now. I managed to not say anything snappy to her and she has no idea that I was very annoyed by all of this.  My mom is also still annoyed with her. 

HERE'S THE THING.  We work together, kind of.  3 years ago she had a job she hated and left, it sounded like something I would love so she got me an interview and I've been there ever since.  6 months ago she got laid off from the place she actually wanted to work at, and came back to this company because she knows the hiring manager personally. They were reluctant to give her a position more than just an intern, and only did so for the convenience of hiring internally. The manager she had previously worked under told the owners directly not to give her another job.  She's somewhat lazy and sloppy in her work. Since returning, I've had to coach her on simple things like how to sound more professional in e-mails. She gets very defensive and angry when her manager is unhappy with her (which is always) and complains to me a lot, in her typical fashion, she will make an excuse or come up with a reason for why she hasn't done anything wrong and he's just too harsh on her. To be fair, I wouldn't want to work for him either, but I also wouldn't want her to work for me. 

I am going on maternity leave imminently and have been training someone to cover me.  The company's pick for my coverage is not ideal and has never done anything like my position before, but there was another uppity young woman aggressively trying to usurp my position and keep it, so I'll take this one who has no desire to keep my job after my leave is up.  My friend kindly offered to cover some of my work while I'm gone, anticipating the girl I'm training will be overwhelmed. I thanked her and left it at that. After trying her ""best"" she couldn't manage to send out party invitations, and couldn't even take ownership of the mistake, and her own manager is often displeased with the work she already has on her desk, so why would I trust her with my career?  Well, she is basically insisting upon it now.  It's one thing to offer, but she's brought it up once or twice a week every week and today went so far as to actually say ""I know my work ethic leaves a lot to be desired but can you tell Supervisor I'll cover some of your work?"" That's not even offering... that's straight up telling me to make it happen. I find the tone to be suspiciously insistent and can't help but wonder why she's so adamant. There's no chance in hell she could ever take my position from me, so I'm not worried about that, but it's weird and off putting that she seems so determined to cover my work. 

Anyway, the baby shower thing was just to illustrate why A. I don't want her touching my work at all. And B. At this point, I want some distance from her. 

But she hits me up literally every day all day. She'll text me from 8am - 11 pm.  I ignore some of her texts, she'll text again later. She's already asked if she can come visit me in the hospital after giving birth.   I'll only be there for maybe a day if there are no complications, so she wants to know if she can show up like immediately after I have this baby, which I see as a window of time best for intimate  bonding between myself, my BF, and our baby. 

She's not overtly malicious though and I do want to believe she has the best intentions, so I don't want to be rude or hurtful to her, but I would like some distance from her and I have no intention of letting her cover for me while I'm gone, but being that we see each other 5 days a week and she texts me 7 days a week for over 12 hours a day, I don't know how to reject her help and put distance between us without making it obvious and hurting her feelings.  

I would like to remain friends with her, but I would also like to take it down a notch.  We don't even really hang out outside of work anymore so it's not like I need to cut down on that, but we speak often. "

84y0d7,3,2018-03-16,Interning or not interning?,matthieum,Compilers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/comments/84y0d7/interning_or_not_interning/,"Source code is generally choke-full of user-defined identifiers.

When creating an AST, the ""naive"" solution is to embed either:

 - a range, referring to the start/end of the identifier in the source code,
 - a string, capturing the identifier.

And then use string operations when looking up identifiers.

A more advanced solution is to ""intern"" the identifiers, guaranteeing that any identifier is associated to a unique ID, and then use the IDs themselves in lieu of the strings.

Pros of interning:

 - constant time comparison,
 - memory consumption friendly (a 32-bits ID is likely sufficient),
 - memory allocation friendly (can copy IDs without allocating).

Cons of interning:

 - more sophisticated,
 - complicates testing,
 - complicates debugging.

So... to intern or not to intern?"

I applied at the beginning of 2018 because I wanted to get an opportunity to work in the US and having a MS from an acclaimed university will definitely help. 

However, what I failed to think through is how to finance my education. When I was applying last year, I was simply single-mindedly trying to get into a good university in the US and think about the financing part later. Now that I've allowed myself 2 days to celebrate the acceptance, I'm down in the dumps again worried about how to finance this expensive 10-month course. 

The total cost of attendance (tuition and board) comes up to roughly 80,000 USD. That is a figure that my family will never be able to afford. I come from a low-income background and my parents have never been to college. I was fortunate enough to get through undergrad with significant financial aid, so this Duke problem has become quite worrisome for me. 

I have a 4.0 GPA but my GRE scores are actually quite terrible (it's my fault for not investing more time into this). I have done quite a lot of internships and community service in the past, which is why I'm a bit surprised that Duke hasn't offered me any form of merit-based scholarship at all. 

All in all, I'm quite in distress right now because the prospect of not being to attend is weighing on me. I have until April 2nd to make a decision and the school doesn't offer any need-based financial aid. If anyone has anything to offer at all, please help! I'm in desperate need right now. 

Thank you so much! "

84z2w3,42,2018-03-16,My introduction post: why I'm uninviting my ndad to my wedding.,transatlantic_ndad,Justnofil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Justnofil/comments/84z2w3/my_introduction_post_why_im_uninviting_my_ndad_to/,"I've lurked both here and at /r/JUSTNOMIL for a while, but have never posted before. I thought I would post a background story (as short as I can make it) and end with the reason I've decided to uninvite my dad to my wedding.


My parents are from different countries. We moved back and forth a few times between the two countries when I was young, but for the most part, I grew up in my mom's country with her as a single mother. When I was about 8-years-old, my parents split up, and my dad moved back to his home country. We did not live in the same country again until last year, when I moved to his country for graduate school, but we did see each other for visits once or twice a year.


When I was young, I would ask him why he left, and he would guilt trip me about asking in the first place, saying things like ""I could move back to here, but I would have to take a bad job that would make me sad. I would do that for you if you want me to, but I would be very sad."" I was maybe 9 or 10 when he pulled that line, so I was immediately filled with guilt. This gaslighting is how over the years, he convinced me that living 4000 miles away was ok and totally out of his control. Also, this is important, he and my mother have a TERRIBLE post-divorce relationship and haven't even been in the same room as each other for nearly 8 years at this point.


I could fill a small novel with the emotionally manipulative crap that he has done over the years, and I'm sure I'll post more stories over time to vent my frustrations, but I'll move on for now to the reason that I am going VLC to NC (not sure yet) and uninviting him to my wedding.


About 2 months ago, my grandfather (dad's dad) passed away. He died the day before I left for a 2 month internship abroad (in neither of my parents' countries). Because of the timing, I was unable to attend my grandpa's funeral, which was devastating.


Shortly before my grandpa's funeral, my dad posted something on facebook about his parents, and for some reason decided that he needed to drag my mother through the mud as a part of his post. I confronted him via text, and his response was to post more on facebook about how my mom is ""a sad pathetic person who will die all alone.""


I absolutely adore my mother. She is a selfless, caring, loving parent, so I have always been very defensive when my dad talks shit about her. I tried confronting him a second time about the comments he was making on social media, and he said ""I am trying to mourn my father, and you want to talk about your mom. How very selfish of you. I will take this time to grieve my father and I will talk to you again after his funeral, if I feel like it.""


So basically he gave me the silent treatment leading up to the funeral that I was unable to attend. That funeral was well over a month ago, and he still hasn't said a word to me. He also hasn't called my younger brother post-funeral, which he ""promised"" he would. Luckily, my fiancé was able to attend and I am very close with my uncle, so I was not left totally out of the loop on the day of the funeral.


I arrived back home (my dad's country) a week ago, and today my fiancé received a text from my dad's gf saying ""He would like to know when she is coming home. He forgot."" I told my fiancé to just delete the text and not respond. If my dad wants to know if I'm home, he can ask me himself like a grown ass adult.


This alone doesn't necessarily warrant going VLC and uninviting him, but this is basically 10 straws beyond the one that should have broken the camel's back. He has never put in effort with me or my brother and has always chosen his own needs over ours. He is self-centered, condescending, and downright cruel to my mother.


I am finally done. I owe a lot of this strength to communities like this, that help me keep my sense of what is normal and what is out of line with an Ndad. I'm sure I will continue to read other posts and maybe make more of my own as this VLC or NC situation develops. Thank you all.


TL;DR: My dad made cruel comments about my mother (his ex) for the millionth time, called me selfish for bringing it up, and has been giving me the silent treatment for over a month now. I've decided to go either VLC or NC and un-invite him to my wedding, but am not sure how."

I would build a computer, but I'm bad at messing with hardware and currently don't have a lot of time to make sure I'm building something right. If you have an idea for something I could build that would be relatively easy/fast I'm open to suggestions. Priorities are ranked as follows:

1) **Modular/Sturdy:** It should be as painless as possible to upgrade or replace a specific component. I want a computer that I can expect to last for years to come.

2) **Performance:** I'm not a complete graphics snob, but I do a lot of video editing and it would be nice if games could run on high settings. I am also an avid multitasker, so something that can handle multiple intensive tasks at once (video game + large number of browser windows + GIMP, for example) would be more important to me than a system with a great graphics card. 

3) **Price:** I could go a little over the listed budged, but below is preferred. Gold star to anyone who posts something below budget that could adequately fill the needs I've listed, with suggestions for parts I could upgrade to over time.

4) **Portability:** This isn't huge, but I move around a couple of times a year between school and research internships. I should be able to work it out for most rigs, but keep in mind when making suggestions that I will have to transport/ship it relatively frequently. "

84zhgy,2,2018-03-16,Democratic Japan and Germany's 5 faction war,Kaderak89,hoi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/hoi4/comments/84zhgy/democratic_japan_and_germanys_5_faction_war/,"I started a game as USA with historical focuses off. I wanted to test the air combat system and started building planes and researching techs. Right off the bat Japan started down Democracy path and Germany started building infrastructure.

Over the next several months they focused on this part of thier trees and the rest  the world followed a basic course for any game. France built defenses, Russia started hiring new interns, and UK stayed out of everything. By the end of 1936 the world had 0 WT and was content.

Beginning of 1937 started with a civil war in Japan for democracy. They had enough support to control the majority of the home islands and the empire had Korea and the southern quarter of the mainland. A few months later Poland, as always, creates it's own faction and draws Lithuania in as well. Italy decides to start their own party and brings Hungary into the Pact of Rome. France dislikes these ideas and turns communist and joins the comintern.

I'm sitting here in the US just building planes and guns and watching the world. I'm hoping Germany decides to throw out Hitler and restore the empire but they have other ideas. Rhineland is finally complete and Senor Hilter decides to get frisky with Czechoslovakia. Taking half and then influencing Austria, the stage is being set for WW2. 

Romania decides to guarantee Poland and Yugoslavia and Russia decides to build it's infrastructure. 1937 ends with 18%WT and no war. 1938 starts with France declaring war on Germany and breaking through the maginot line in a few days. Russia influences Lithuania and absorbs them into the USSR. Now Russia has a direct front on Germany while France pushes hard into the Rhineland.

Lithuania falls rather quickly to the Blitzkrieg as Hitler completes Danzig. Then brings Romania into the war who joins the Comintern giving Russia another avenue of assault into the fatherland. Italy declares war on Yugoslavia who in turn joins the Allies bringing the UK into a war and raising WT to 40. There ends 1938 with Germany in a 3 faction war, The Allies at war with the PoR and the US still making planes.

1939 begins with resolution to the Japanese civil war with democracy ruling supreme. Korea is released with Mengoko becoming a puppet of Menchuko. Communist China makes demands of the warlords who all refuse and then tries their luck against Menchuko. They join the axis which forces CC to join the comintern. Russia invades Menchuko while Hitler decides this is the best time to declare on Belgium and the Netherlands.

This forces them to join the Allies bringing yet another faction against Germany and for some reason Luxembourg joins the comintern. Meanwhile France has yet to push much past the Rhineland while Romania with the help of Russian forces breaks past the Czech boarders and begins an assault into German country. Poland has held out against German forces by retreating to Warsaw. Only after Russian forces occupied the bulk of the German troops did they have any chance of pushing back.

Italy took Cairo and secured all of Africa for the PoR and Afghanistan decided to join the axis. I decided it was at this time that democracy had no power in this new world and started my path down communism. Still building planes and guns and now just enjoying the mayhem. Japan invites Korea into their faction "" Imperial Empire of Japan"" and declares that the Philippines should be free and demands that the US should release them. I refuse and nothing more from them for the rest of 1939.

1940 begins with a naval invasion of Germany from the UK, France finally starting to make progress on the western front, Poland pushing back to their own borders and Russia invading just west of Danzig and heading south. Menchuko capitulates releasing many Russian forces who head back to the German offensive. This allows Russia to take Berlin out from under the Allies nose. Two days later Berlin is retaken by German forces who then hand it to the Allies.

Hitler runs away to Vienna and declares on Switzerland. They join the PoR and bring Italy into the fray. Now Germany is surrounded by 4 factions. The Pact of Rome to the south, the comintern on the west/north/south east, Polish faction on the east, and the Allies to the north. By June of 1940 Germany surrenders and is puppeted by USSR. Italy takes a piece of Czechoslovakia and Poland takes the two states bordering Danzig.

The comintern now control most of Europe and the PoR and the Allies are still duking it out for Yugoslavia. Italy decides to take on Greece who joins the comintern dragging Europe into another war....

8503t7,1,2018-03-16,I don't know what I want to do with my life. Any advice from those who had/have the same issue?,PiPstein,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8503t7/i_dont_know_what_i_want_to_do_with_my_life_any/,"Hey, hope you all are doing fine this evening.

I'm at a time in my life where I feel like I'm at a continual crossroads. I'm 21, just about to graduate in the fall, and trying desperately to get an internship. I've applied to so many places (50+), have had four interviews, was turned down for three (one just today, in fact), and the other told me they'd decided not to do internships this summer after already having interviewed candidates even though they'd wanted to hire me. :(

I'm a Computer Science major, though I've realized I'm not the software engineering type and would much rather work in general IT and IT support. Like, I don't mind helping people with their general computer problems. I want to help people and work where communication and writing and service is important, as those are my strengths. I also wouldn't mind technical writing, as that also would be a great fit for my skills.

I technically do have a job/internship, but it's not working out so well. I interviewed for what I thought was a part-time front end web design job at my university and got hired, but my boss put me in back-end design, which is where I *definitely* do not excel. I've worked hard at it while juggling two other jobs and I'm willing to put effort in, but I fear I can't produce what he's looking for and I told him that.

Bless his heart, he said that was okay and just wants it to be a paid learning experience. I regret telling him that I felt I may not be able to finish the site in the time alotted, but I wanted to be honest. I didn't want to be that, ""Oh, sure, I can do everything! Yep, totally not lying!"" type of person. It's dishonest. I know employers like when you buttkiss like that, but it's not me.

But if I'm honest, I went into CS because I knew it would make money. I actually do enjoy general IT work, so it's not like my most hated field ever. But if I were to choose to do what I love, I'd be a fiction writer. But you can't make money at that unless you know the right people or are lucky.

I just... don't know what to do. I'm not good/smart enough to be a programmer, but that's where the jobs are and I'm too far into my degree to quit now. I have an English minor, so I'm thinking I may try my hand at technical writing, but it's difficult to get jobs. I'm also tempted just to finish my degree and then go to school for/get a trade school type job, like a plumber or electrician.

Any advice? Has anyone else been a similar position? Did you change jobs/careers? Did you stick with it? Help a young adult who doesn't know what the hell they're doing out, please."

I'm currently looking for work while I am in the earlier stages of my computer science degree and have taken only 1 programming course and only math classes so I'm not really qualified for internships yet.

So, I'm looking for a good part time job while I'm in school since I need to pay bills.

I have been doing delivery but it's taking a toll on my car, not to mention its poor revenue, so I need another job asap.

I actually did this for 7 months so that's a record. 

I generally quit most jobs after a month or so since they have been mostly warehouse and restaurant jobs. 

In restaurants there is too much stuff going on at once with no clear instructions and people always yelling at you.

In the warehouse, I feel like my head almost explodes from the noise and people usually get angry at you for no reason, when I'm just trying to work and get paid.

Anyone have good experiences with other types of entry level/minimum experience jobs as someone with aspergers?

What job was it?

Thanks!

850vy0,2,2018-03-16,"Me [25 F] with my husband [25 M] of 3 years, I need to learn how to change myself but it's so hard",Snxbc,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/850vy0/me_25_f_with_my_husband_25_m_of_3_years_i_need_to/,"I don’t know why I am the way that I am.

I don’t know how to change myself.

He says I need to grow up. That people my age have children and here I am always acting like this. That if I keep this up, I will push him away and I will regret it. 

He says that, like always, I will seek blame somewhere else. 

He says that I may be thinking that maybe he’s wrong in this too, but he’s not. He’s completely right. 

I wanted to wash my clothes tonight. I put them in the dryer before eating so that they would be done earlier and I wouldn’t want to do more work after cooking. He told me to start the dryer 30 min later. I got annoyed because he can do laundry whenever he feels like it, but every time I do it, he tells me to wait, either days, or like today. And then he says the laundry has been waiting a week. (But only because I’m not going to do it after coming home from work and because I know he doesn't like it).  

I tried so hard not to let the annoyance get the better of me. The thing is, when I am annoyed with someone, I don't want them to talk to me because then it will show. And I don't feel like talking to them. And so when he asked what I used for dinner, I shrugged my shoulders. And then he got upset because I showed him attitude. 

He gives me unwanted advice all the time, and one day, I got super annoyed. I don’t have any of the skill sets in the field I’m trying to get into, and I went to a counselor and she reaffirmed by belief that I should maybe look into internships. I’ve been hesitant about that because I need a full-time job, and our health insurance is through my employer. 

I asked him what he thought about that, and he went on a 20 min monologue about how I was selling myself short, art majors could get jobs at “the Big Four”, that I needed to push myself more, that the only person stopping me was myself. I told him that  I didn’t have any of the skill sets jobs in this field require. He said that wasn’t necessary because these big companies send you to get trained and that he had done his research so he knew what he was talking about. I told him that I didn’t even qualify for the minimum requirements for these positions, and he said that didn’t matter. 

I got super annoyed with him and told him that I had been thinking about the internship possibility for a while and when the counselor reaffirmed that, I thought I would bring up the possibility to him. He said that internships were for undergraduate students, that career counselors were for geared towards undergrads (and that he had never heard of a graduate student going to one, which btw, my school does have a graduate career services, which is what I went to). I don’t know why, but when he said that it was basically an undergrad thing to do, that stung. I left the room, and he followed me outside to rub salt on the wound a bit further. He said that he was sick and tired of me using him a scapegoat, and blaming him for me not doing things. He said that I lack initiative and that I couldn’t just wait around for things. 

I was basically trying to go to sleep on the couch, and he told me multiple times to stop throwing my tantrum and come back to bed. 

Today, he tells me that if I don’t grow up, I will drive him away and regret it. He said that people my age are having kids, and I’m acting like this. He said that I might think he may be wrong in this situation but he’s not. That he’s completely right. 

He scraped and dented the side of the car today and all I could think of was that thank God, it wasn’t me who did it. I went to Starbucks after work and I tried to finish the whole drink before going home because I thought he would judge me for going there. He asked me what I had put in the dinner, and I got even more annoyed because I thought if I told him, he would criticize it. 

Reading this over, I don’t know. I don’t know why I am the way that I am. I am always starting fights with him. Like when he didn’t do anything for our first 2 Valentine’s days. Or like when I told him I would like more kisses outside of the bedroom. Or like how, in the beginning, I would always bring up facebook and why he wouldn’t add me. He always tells me there’s a time and place to bring things up. And my time and place is constantly wrong. Valentine’s day? His brother had lost his job. Kissing? His mom and dad were going through a nasty separation. Facebook? Well, that has not been resolved and I’ve just let it go. 


I don't know WHY I act the way I do. My mom always told me that our spouses show us what we need to improve in ourself. But I don't know how to improve myself. We've been married three years and I still can't seem to handle my emotions. I can't keep living like this. I need to change. I don't know how. I don't even know why I'm like this and I have no idea how to tackle it. What can I do to stop being the negative force in this relationship?

tldr; I feel like I'm always starting fights with my husband over stupid things. I don't know how to control my emotions. How can I start to change for the better?"

Much.,poor_icarus,u_poor_icarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_poor_icarus/comments/8515vs/so_much/,"I took the train back home yesterday, something I had not done much since nearing graduation. I sat next to a man from Nigeria, he was doing his Ph.D. at the nearby university, which had something to do with humanity. He was very idealistic in believing that the world could be better, and that people were mere products of their environments. 

I wanted to believe him, but I did not know if I could—I was just glad that other people still had faith.

Funny, living in this valley for two years, I got to meet people from all the corners of the world, and they all had something different to say about this one world. Listening to them all almost made me feel several lifetimes older. Later when I graduate and move away, I was going to miss these fleeting moments, for sure. 

I wanted to tell you—by you, I meant everyone I ever met eyes with, talked to, loved—about how difficult this year had been. From learning how to drive, to sorting out my internship and final year project, to fully coming to terms with my sexuality. 

I went to the doctor, got my bloodwork done, and I was prescribed PrEP—a small blue pill, taken once a day could help prevent the infection of HIV. 

Shameful. But it was the final jigsaw piece that I needed to complete this era of my life and move on. I felt like now I had a real chance to live and be a part of the world. Start with the healing of the wounds left by society and reclaiming back the word ""Gay."" 

I never knew whether if I wanted to live, and why, and what was the world about, but now, I got to find out. 

It was true when they said life was stranger than fiction, because with life, you never really knew whether something was the beginning, the middle, or the end of your chapter.

851s5b,0,2018-03-17,[24/m] my girlfriend (26/f) cheated on me during long distance and I can't get over it.,boiyois,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/851s5b/24m_my_girlfriend_26f_cheated_on_me_during_long/,"Sorry but I'll write a long post, This is a fucking novel since I'm trying to vent out at the same time as asking advice. I'll try to be very detailed from my perspective of things and be honest so I can get the best help i can. I hope anyone that recognizes me would not spread this.

My girlfriend and I dated around 4 months before she left for her graduate school. I had just graduated as well and just before she left I luckily found a job before graduation. Even though 4 months sounds short, we always spent time together - around half a day every day or so. We still kept long distance relationship after that trying to do video calls and etc. Our relationship suffered quite a bit because of our long distance relationship. In my point of view I really had to endure her harsh words explaining to me how I don't care enough about her because of several things I did. Even before long distance relationship I was threatened several times by her that she would break up with me if I make her feel like I don't care about her. Since I love her very much I just told her that I didn't mean to hurt her and I will try to improve myself. This is my first relationship so I was ready to take the blame for the things that I perhaps lack. Maybe these things aren't really relevant.

Few months into the long distance I hear that my family member is terminally ill. She cried because she was afraid I will permanently move to where my family lives, which is another distant country. That wasn't my plan so I tried to comfort her explaining I won't. She tried to be supportive but to me it seemed that hanging out with her friends was more important than making some time to call me and keep in touch. I asked if we could schedule our calls but she said she doesn't want to because her friends might ask her to hang out. I thought that was very selfish.

I realized that she had left her facebook logged in on chrome (I use firefox). I knew I was doing something I shouldn't but insecurity got the better of me. Based on this I found out that she went to a guy's place, being offered some wine. I freaked out and confessed to her that I was looking at her account and told her to explain. She told me she just wanted finish some discussion about racism. She seemed to be truthful. Perhaps she was lying but it doesn't really matter.

After that I became rather insecure. I decided to log out and never think about looking at her account again since it will drive me crazy. Things went downhill since I felt that regardless of her cheating or not she was doing something she knew I wouldn't be comfortable with and hid it from me. She said she doesn't understand how there's anything wrong with it since she can control herself. I was very unhappy about that and after she talked to her friend and her friend told her she wouldn't be comfortable with that, and my girlfriend agreed to never do this again.

Because of my distrust towards her I think I made it very stressful for her and she started being very hurtful and more selfish. I tried to hide my distrust but it was probably obvious. When we argue she started saying things like I'm not even close to good enough or I don't even care about my family member who is dying. I tried my best to keep calm and asked her to not say those kind of things and that it hurts me very much. Whenever we have an argument the patterns is me apologizing about how I displeased her and how I didn't mean it, her still getting more angry and say hurtful things, and I try to tell her not to say it, then she keeps going and I find it unbearable and explain to her how much it hurts me because I love her. I demanded apologize from her afterwards but it seems that it simply made her doubt the integrity of my apology and made her angry. Our relationship was a mess. I tried my best to make her feel better by preparing handmade gifts that resemble her favorite doll that she always sleeps with. But it seemed that she was too angry to appreciate those things. After an argument, I told her that I would get her another gift as an apology. She told me with spite that she changed her mind about letting me choose it and told me she wants something from Tiffany. I told her I can't afford something over $1000. And told her that if she expects those kinds of gifts often I will try my best to try to get higher pay. This made her extremely furious and she managed to convince me that I don't care about her enough by being toxic. I got scared and offered her choices from Tiffany over $1000. She got angry again and said that she never asked for something so expensive and asked me if this was how I thought of her. I was genuinely confused and scared. The next day I told her that I really don't understand what's going on and that I was really scared but I showed her that I got one for her. She got angry again that I got it because I was afraid and told me to return it. I was going crazy at this point and felt useless.

She brought her male friend to her place once and ensured me that nothing would happen. At this point I was trying my best to show trust and told her its fine. Her male friend had a fiancee and I didn't think it would be a problem.

During Christmas I had a rough time visiting my dying family members when my relationship has taken a toll on me. after the incident she wasn't very enthusiastic about talking to me. She tried to show me support but I was too hurt from the previous incident in addition to facing my dying family members, and we argued again. I felt very guilty and wrote her a Christmas letter trying to tell her that I'm very sorry for being emotional because things are a mess. I drew her doll with a Christmas costume on the card and she said that it made her very happy, and that she showed her mom as well. She told me that she would write a new year's card in return. I feel hope and feel that our relationship can work out again.

On the new years day however I wasn't given the card. I was utterly disappointed and complained. She was apparently angry at first but upon talking to her friend realized that it was her fault since she promised. I'm very confused about this still. She promised she would write a card to me as soon as possible. then a week passed. I complained again. She says shes too busy. another week passes. I can't hold it anymore and burst out in anger. She surprisingly apologizes easily instead of lashing back in anger. She then confesses to me that she cheated on me with the guy with a fiancee. I have a breakdown and I asked her a question I really shouldn't have asked her - did you have sex? yes. how many times? 5. She was kind enough to provide unsolicited information that she has done it once even after she had received my Christmas letter. I go crazy and freak out. She tells me she still wants to go on and want me to give her another chance. Even after this I still feel that I love her and I said we can go on, but she really has to help me recover from this mental shithole. She tries her best to help but I'm getting swallowed up by suicidal thoughts. I vomit out everything that she did to hurt me, and seems that she quickly ran out of patience and started blaming me for the things I did as well. When I ask her to please stop saying hurtful things she starts talking about what she hopes from me. I just try to change the subject so she can actually help me get back on my feet. We set up a call for another date. On the day when she doesn't answer my call I can't bear the thought that she may be meeting with him again and I just keep chugging rum to get drunk. While I'm drunk I text her that I want to kill myself because I feel horrible. This unsurprisingly makes her feel terrified and soon makes her want to give up on helping me and continuing this relationship. We talk again and decide to not give up.

My suicidal thoughts don't go away and I become very resentful that my girlfriend ruined everything. The fact that she cheated on me even after receiving my Christmas letter that I put my heart into it eats me away and eats away my trust. After all, she told me that she realized there is no future with him. what is that supposed to mean I still don't know. if there was a future with him would she have left me instead? She needs to get a summer job at where I am in order to return since her degree requires internship. I said please try hard if you care about me. I offer her help with resume and cover letter. She procrastinates on it and I become very sad. It triggers an argument and it becomes heated. I let out all my insecurities that I built up after hearing about her cheating on me. Many of my insecurities are extremely unpleasant for obvious reasons. She lashes in anger since I have been prosecuting her and kept asking her ""why? why did you have to do it?"". She digs up things she was unhappy about me from the beginning of the relationship. Eventually she tells me that all I want her for is sex. I'm completely appalled and think that I was stupid for thinking that she actually cares about me. I tell her that I'm sorry for everything I've done to hurt you and write her a breakup letter of sorts and block her. Coincidentally it was valentines day soon so I used a valentines card. I discussed it with my friend who I didn't want to discuss with because I didn't want him to hate her. But now it doesn't matter because I supposedly broke up.

I didn't block her from my email, and she sends a few emails of apology saying that she really didn't mean what she said, and promised me that she would come back and stay with me no matter what. I ignore it. The day before valentines day, I receive a phone call. Apparently she flew to my place. After seeing her in her miserable state, I can't help but let her in. We cry together. Afterwards, we have a really happy time for a week, with her staying in my place. I'm a little obsessed about having sex with her since I feel that it will erase away the memories of cheating. Its stupid, but I had to make sure she likes having sex with me very much. Since a very long time we are actually very happy with each other.

She leaves and things go south again. I feel suicidal and empty again, and start doubting her again. She seems to be trying to help me feel better, even though she seems to have a bit of trouble. Then she mentions that she might go for a job at a different country, and I feel betrayed and angry since she promised she would be back here. I am barely holding on and feeling suicidal, and I try to explain that in a calm way. We have another argument and I think that I really will kill myself today. I send her a picture of me holding a knife against my throat. I am so pathetic and cruel to block off all communications from her after that. At work, I think about jumping off and try to open the door to the top of the building. The door opens easily and there is a second door with a warning. I decide not to open the second door and not to kill myself. I apologize to her and she gets very angry understandably. I tell her I want to break up because I don't want to make us both suffer and she tells me she really doesn't want to. I give in since I still love her a lot.

**TLDR: So here's the part where I actually ask for advice**
I feel very conflicted because many people around me, including her friend told me that its likely she would cheat again, even if she never cheated before cheating on me. I still love her and want to go on. However, I get crazy mood swings feeling extremely happy and feeling suicidal and feel disgusted and angry at what her did whenever I think about it. How can I erase this terrible feeling and doubts. Is the only way for me to feel better (and not make things difficult for her) to break up? Assuming she finds a job she will be back within a few months, we agreed to go to a therapist together when she comes back."

8522g4,7,2018-03-17,I had my abortion at 4-5 weeks pregnant ( in Germany ),Gunich,abortion,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/8522g4/i_had_my_abortion_at_45_weeks_pregnant_in_germany/,"I had my surgical abortion Thursday at 5 weeks pregnant ( it was a removal by suction(?) ) and want to share the experience to help others and to help myself. 

I'm german, 22 years old, in a loving relationship with my boyfriend ( 17m ) and mental ill ( GAD, depression ).  Not that it's somewhat important but maybe someone will find the info useful.  

Some background before the surgery part:
I got to know about it two weeks before.  Took two test.  Both positive.  It didn't hit me until next morning.  
I told my boyfriend, my mother and my sister. 
All of them instantly freaked out.  My boyfriend more intern then extern.  None of them pressured me to make a decision for one or the other option.  But I felt that me keeping it,  was not what they wished for. 
Friday I found out.  Saturday I felt intense sadness, knowing that I couldn't keep it do to me not knowing how to take care of myself, my medicine for my depression and GAD ( that I couldn't reduce or not take. I still depend on it heavily ) and me and my boyfriends financial and educational situation. 
After years of mental illness I just got on my feet,  finding a place where I, with my disorders,  could work.  My boyfriends situation isn't better either.  He is in a school where he is learning to be a gymnastic teacher.  
So my decision instantly was clear.  
I would terminat the pregnancy.  
I had to.  

In Germany the law requires you to get some stuff done before you legally can abort.  Without it, it is illegal.  
You have to take a consultation, in a place where you can afterwards get a document that says you had the consultation. 
After that you must(!) wait three days before you can terminate. To think all of this through etc.  It felt like hell.  
I wanted it to be over! To be over now! 

So before this consulting session,  I had to make sure that I really was pregnant. 
Without appointment I went to my gyn on monday. 
I had luck and after 45 minutes of waiting,  I got in the exam room.  The doctor made a ultrasound, asking me if I was happy after finding out I was expecting.  It felt like a train hit me.  It felt so out of place for him to be asking this as if it is always good news to be pregnant.  
I told him ""no,  I wasn't.  I know this will be an abortion not a baby""
No comment from him. He should habe said something.  This silence said the things I thought he would think. And it were horrible things.  
The assistant had a look of sorrow on her face, looking at my ""thing"" on the ultrasound.  
All in all it wasn't a pleasant visit.  
I left the exam room with some blood less in my body and the confirmation of my pregnancy. 
In the car I was devastated. 
There was no information on where to go,  where to get help from my gyn.  
I felt intensely lonely, helpless and sad.  
My doctor told me i was ca 3 weeks pregnant and that there were much time to get things done.  
I wanted this torture to be over by the end of this week. 
The weekend had brought up a feeling of love for this cell chaos in my belly.  
I had kept it,  if things had been different.  But they weren't.  And that broke my heart. 

So I,  all by myself, had to find help without my doctor.  I got an appointment for the counselling the next day.  That made me feel a bit of relief.  
knowing it got me one step further.  
Waiting wasn't for me.  
I got there the next day, Tuesday.  My father,  that I had told on Sunday about my pregnancy went with me.  
I had anxiety, not knowing what to expect.  If the lady would pressure me in any direction.  
The discussion went not as expected.  
I got all information and more that I needed and the important document. She even gave me the numbers of places near me that would do such procedures. 
Here in Germany it is very difficult to find these places by your own.  There is a law that makes it illegal to ""advertise"" abortion as one of the things you offer.  Hefty fees are involved if you are found guilty of it.  So the most places dont mention it at all.  
So I really was grateful for the numbers.  

The surgical abortion it would be.  I dont wanted to endure the time span of the abortion pill. 
I had to wait till Monday ( 3 day period after the counselling ) to get an abortion. That did not sit well with me. 
I got an appointment for a first discussion on monday afternoon.  
Untill then I was a very normal feeling pregnant woman. No symptoms, just some heavy tiredness , at all. 
But Monday it got to me.  It got to me badly.  
I woke up feeling ill.  My stomach did hurt and I had to throw up. I did trow up two times more, before my mother came and took me home with her.  The feeling of nausea stayed wit me all day.  I couldn't get up. I was only really endurable laying in bed or sleeping. 
So I had to cancel my appointment.  
I was really mad.  But there was nothing I could have done.  
The next day I got another appointment for five pm.  I was still feeling ill but went there. 
The abortion was scheduled for Thursday. 

Thursday morning,  after throwing up for days straight,  I went to the appointment with my father,  sister and boyfriend. 
He too was sad that we had to terminate but he,  as I,  also saw the need to.  
I was very frightened.  I never had anaesthesia.
But it went good. I fell asleep fast before I even could panic. 
The procedure itself was 15 minutes long. 
In the waking room I must have asked for my boyfriend,  because he was there when I came to conscious.  
I cried.  He held me.
The nurse brought my father.  I cried more and he held my hand.  Told me it was okay.  It was the right decision to make.  He went away for some time and my boyfriend held me some more. 
I felt free.  But I also grieved for what I had lost willingly.  It was hart.  
The pain was like normal period pain. The blood loss even less than a light period one. 
It just was really mental hard on me and it still is. 
I feel relieved.  But I also feel like someone special to me has died.  It is a process.  I will have kids some day.  I'm sad that this time had not been yet. I'm happy that this time will be. I more than before want children. 

I'm excited for the future.

8523zs,3,2018-03-17,F4M --- Roleplay based off TV/Movies. R34 Ideas inside.,Television-RP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8523zs/f4m_roleplay_based_off_tvmovies_r34_ideas_inside/,"No, I don't want to roleplay as a television set, apparently my name gives people the wrong idea. Anyhow, thanks for clicking! I would love to roleplay with characters from movies/television with scenes based off said media. Since you would be doing me a favor by playing a pre-established character, I feel it would be fair and fun for me to cater to your needs! Would you like a character with a big, bubble butt opposite of yours? Do you crave to have a busty, eighteen year old with your character? Or perhaps you want a particular race? The only things that I *will* not do in a scene are -&gt; Animals, ageplay, blood play, feet, force, futa, scat, watersports and anything *too* far out there. Feel free to ask if I didn't cover anything.

♥ **Marco Polo**; You would be playing... *gasp*, Marco Polo in said scene. Full knowledge of the series isn't required but a general idea of the character and show would be great. I would love to see him being seduced by a woman in the Khan's harem, or perhaps a dancer sent to entertain him. 

♥ **Game of Thrones**; Daario or Robb Stark would be my top choices. Maybe even Mero! I'd like for them to be fucking a Dany impersonator with a great curvy body. [For more information on this idea, click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6oinsu/f4m_the_queen_of_anal_daenerys_targaryen/)

♥ **Veep**; Dan Egan. Yep, that horrible douchebag. He's smug, an annoying know-it-all and an all around asshole. A senator's daughter getting rammed by him in a storage closet, trying to stay quiet to avoid being caught? Yes, please. Or maybe that eighteen year old girl in the gym he can't keep his eyes off is charmed and fucked by him in a semi-public place.

♥ **Trial And Error**; Josh the lawyer, please! A backwards little town with him fucking a gorgeous new intern or simply having a night of fun.

♥ **Great News**; A few ideas that mostly revolve around sneaking, fucking during a live broadcast, etc. If you play Greg, I would like to be a secretary, reporter, a celebrity guest on the show, etc!

♥ **A.P Bio**; Glenn Howerton does such a great job in this show! I think having him pound a student's mother would be fun. Whether she's a sweetheart, or a bratty PTA mother who needs to be humbled.

♥ **Suits**; Mike Ross with a cute new intern or secretary filling in for Donna. A late night case forces Mike to stay in the file room when the girl stops by for a visit before she's heading out. Of course, she can't help herself and has her hands roaming over his body, hoping to relieve him of any stress. 

♥ **Galavant**; You would be playing as Galavant in the scene opposite of many different choices. Maybe a wench at the bar? A princess who's room he had snuck into? Or the local farmer's curvy, yet gorgeous daughter who's been craving your attention for weeks. The choice is yours! ~ Singing/rhyming not included.

♥ **Community**; I would prefer for you to play Jeff in this scene. If you watch the show, there's more than enough ideas for us to come up with a fun scene together. My preferences would be Jeff fucking a librarian/tutor/new spanish teacher/nurse/etc.

♥ **From Dusk Till Dawn**; Not the movie version. I would want you to play Seth Gecko in this roleplay, I can't say I like any of the male characters. Seth having fun with a bank teller who can't resist his looks or one of the dancers from the infamous strip club?

♥ **Arrow**; Who could resist a scene with a hot cat burglar on her knees with her mouth full of the vigilante's hard cock? Is she getting her mouth fucked in an alley, or perhaps in a warehouse after he's cleared it out? Maybe Oliver's being seduced by his sister's slutty, eighteen year old friend?

♥ **Daredevil**; I'm solely interested in Matt! I would like to play as a female criminal such as Black Cat! Other than that, a secretary/intern/woman coming for help to his office would be ideal.

♥ **Luke Cage**; You play as... *gasp*! Luke Cage. I'm very open minded for this but that body of his manhandling a curvy gorgeous woman? Let's do it!

♥ **WWE**; There's a bunch of people I love there, both present and former! I can play people ranging from fans, to sexy referees, announcers, interviewers and new divas!

♥ **Limitless**; The TV show! Not expecting many people who've seen this but you playing as Brian would be the best!

♥ **MTV's The Challenge**; A bit of a niche show! If you're familiar with it, I'd love to discuss the possibilities we could play out.

♥ **Big Brother (US)**; ^ Read above!

♥ **What's Your Number?**; Easy. Colin + Hot, juicy assed slut = &lt;333. This scene can go in any direction, easy to get into some raunchy hot sex.

♥ **The Cabin In The Woods**; Holden/Jesse Williams is left alone with your choice of gal in the cabin. Ditsy blonde with a killer body? Voluptuous nerdy girl who's in need of a good fuck? Open and easy to dive in to.

♥ **Man Of Steel**; You would be playing Henry Cavill as Superman in the scene. I'd prefer for him to go up against villainesses that lead up to a rough hate fuck. Poison Ivy, White Rabbit and others would be the top picks. Also into playing other females such as Power Girl and so on. No Wonder Woman.

♥ **Man From U.N.C.L.E**; Illya, Napoleon or both! Having either or both pumping a sexy spy, informant, daughter of their target, etc for information is just too perfect, isn't it?

Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I would love to hear some if you want to play a particular character. **Give me a list of your shows/movies, I watch a lot!** I also have images for the no-named characters opposite of yours and I'm hopeful that they won't disappoint. Big kinks I love; anal, creampies, rimming(giving/recieving), roughness and dirty talking. I'll get back to messages ASAP!"

I am not saying the I am the most desperate person in the world. But quick looking to my past, I feel really unlucky. 

* I was a child, my grandmother was going to US to see my aunt and newborn cousin. Cause my parents were fighting a lot she wanted me to take with her. Guess what? 9/11 happened. I had to stay.

* I was preparing for university entrance exams, 3 weeks before big exam day, I learned that my dad has skin cancer. I was devastated and failed  miserably in the exam.

* My aunt who lived in US moved to Greece, and suggest me to go the Greece since the universities are free. I accepted this offer. Went to Athens after I officially learn that I failed the exam. Anyways, few weeks after I go to Greece, Syriza got elected and already bad economy gone worst. Universities were free but life got much more expensive

* Came back to home after staying 9 months in Athens, doing absolutely nothing. Started to prepare for upcoming university entrance exam. First one was in March, It was good. Last one in June. Morning of an exam day, my dad broke his arm. Had to take him to hospital first, then go to exam place. I wasn't late but all I could think was my dad's wellbeing. I kinda failed but had a grade enough to be a computer scientist.

* I fell in love with a girl. When we met, she had a boyfriend. Waited for her to break up with her boyfriend. She broke up. Few days later I met her in a nice place and before I say a word, she says she has a brand new boyfriend. Same thing happened with same girl for 3 times in 2 years. After that I leaved her alone. 

* I had to do an internship and I send my resume to one of the big software company. They wanted to do an interview with me. Everything was good. Guess what happened? Company fired lots of engineers. They probably gonna reject me. 

I am waiting for worse. The city where my university is extremely small and people are highly conservative. So there are no place to socialize. I am just waiting to lose my shit alone. Only worse thing can happen could an ICBM to hit near here. Wish there was a machine to stop this unluckiness. This were the major things that I can remember right now but I'm sure there are lots of them. Anyway. It was nice to write it out. I'm gonna drink a coffee. Peace to y'all."

I'm supposed to be in college but.. Can't afford that shit right now.

When I don't so the littlest things she literally screams at the top of her lungs and it's so fucking uncalled for. I know that she's having a hard time but so am I. She doesn't want me to get an internship for no damn reason so I've been stuck in the house doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING since like... July 2017.

 I just sleep and eat and I have no drive to do anything in life and then she comes back home and complains that I'm utterly useless and I should go and live with my father. But he won't take me in lol.

Everyday it's one insult after the other and there's no one for me to talk to it about. I'm depressed and lonely and bored at the same time, every day. I wish I could sit her down and explain to her that she has a problem and should stop taking it out on me but I doubt she'll even listen.

8532kf,1,2018-03-17,I'm sad because I don't think I'm living my life,cutebladder,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8532kf/im_sad_because_i_dont_think_im_living_my_life/,"I'm 21F and I haven't lived in my own country since I was 9 years old. After that, I lived in the Middle East for another 9 years, and now, I've been living in Europe. My first year in Europe was truly amazing because I had my own place, got to call my own shots and lived in a student building. But after that year, which has now been the past two years, I've been living at my boyfriend's parents place. 

His parents are really freakin' nice, and I have nothing bad to say about them! But, the longer I live there, the more I realize how hard it is to adapt to their culture.  I've grown up pretty spoiled my whole life, I never had to work for my own money, and where I lived, it was so uncommon for people my age to work. On the other hand, in Europe it's so common to have kids from 15 years old to start working. Now, the condition for me to live at their place is as long as I have a part-time job. I don't mind this at all, it's just the fact that I just finished my internship for 6 months, I'm approaching my graduation, and I want a fucking break by traveling to other European countries to meet my friends, or even, you know, enjoy life and freedom??!! The situation would be a lot better if I had my own place, but I can't due to the strict regulations here.

On top of that, because I am such an outsider here, nobody can relate to my problems. I have friends, it's just that all of them are scattered all over the world. I try so hard to adapt and because of that, it feels like I'm fucking losing myself. I tried to open up to my boyfriend's mom about this; how I want to spend more time with my friends because I am slowly losing them one by one. But the response I got was that it's a part of growing up, which is fair. She doesn't see it as much of a big problem as I do, and one of the reasons is because their culture is very individualistic, whereas mine has a more of collective culture.

Sometimes when I'm at home without my boyfriend, where it'd just be me and his parents, I can't relax the way I do when I'm at my own place. I normally enjoy being locked up in my room all day doing my own shit, but because I'm trying to adapt to their culture (out of respect), I can't fucking relax. I feel like I have to be active just like them, I can't help but worry about how they think of me. 

I guess I'm just so fucking frustrated, I feel fucking lonely and homesick. It fucking sucks that I don't have any real friends here. And the fact that nobody can relate to me, it makes me feel even lonelier and I feel that my problems are invalid. "
8532xu,7,2018-03-17,"Uncertainty about whether we( 19M, 18F ) can ever close the distance causing relationship to falter, along with physical contact issues",notalreadytaken2k18,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/8532xu/uncertainty_about_whether_we_19m_18f_can_ever/,"[LONG- but sorry I don't know how else to explain this] 

My gf and I got together at the end of high school and since then, I've moved abroad to study, while she stayed back in my home country. Although we live only 4 hours apart by flight, my University and internship schedules do not permit long visits back home. 

Can't close the distance:

I have two more years to graduate and I do not see myself going back home after graduation. I'll be working overseas(due to a scholarship obligation) and won't be able to close the distance with my gf. She is planning to complete her university education back home,so that gives us a sure 2+ years apart, after which I might be able to afford more long weekend visits back home since I'll be earning money myself. I'm not comfortable with spending my parents' money and frequent flights to visit her. 

Regardless of how things pan out, we don't have a date to close the distance. There's really no certainty about whether it's even possible. 

Intimacy issues: 

Over the last two years I've been able to visit about 6 times, and while the first few visits went alright, things took a turn for the worse somewhere. There would be times when I was home for weeks, but we'd do less than a few dates a week. This was always because her parents are highly controlling and conservative and don't like her dating, but I started feeling the lack of intimacy. 

We've always been in a highly conservative environment where public displays of affection,  and with her parents and mine not being in favour of dating it's really hard to have much alone time. It's only when we make out at movies and stuff that anything ever happens. But for one reason or the other, nothing happened over the last few visits ( always blamed on circumstances - controlling parents,  conservative society, ""I'm fucked if someone sees us making out""). It's now been a year since we even made out, and I don't know if we'll have time or space to be intimate even if I find time to go back. 

In the meanwhile I've been living abroad in a liberal university environment, that I suspect has made me realize how much more relationships can be when you're not so controlled. I've been living away from my family, and my sibling lives in another country for his work ( :( haven't seen him in almost two years ). All this has made me quite lonely, and being a person who has always craved physical contact ( cuddling, holding hands, making face-to-face conversation, and perhaps more sexual contact )  it's really taking a toll on me. 

I really love her, but I'm tired of feeling the need for physical contact and not being to do anything for about it. Sure we haven't exactly done many of the things long distance couples do to bridge the gap like falling asleep on Skype, sending frequent gifts, etc, but I don't know if do anything about the physical contact.i used to convince myself with ""one day we'll be ...."", but reality is making me question that will ever be a reality. That's leading to me to what I think is my worst failing. 

I've had fleeting thoughts about what life would be like if I dated someone in my own university- I see so many couples being so happy together :( I've even had some passing crushes on people I know well, and I've steered clear of acting on any of them. Have never said anything to those people, and just waited till those feelings went away. I've realized that this isn't doing any justice to my gf,who is an amazing person and deserves more. Unable to break it off because I know that if we were together life would be perfect....

I've told her this, and she says now that she'll do everything she can to make the future visits different, and I don't know if this will actually happen. In the past some visits have been super disappointing. 

TL;DR: 
Don't have a date to close the distance and haven't been intimate due to circumstances even on visits. Visiting is going to get harder, but she says she'll do everything she can to make my future visits different. Confused because I love her, but need physical closeness

How to prepare and get over the fear?,shesnothing,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/853aq5/nparents_are_older_reaching_their_70s_and_im_25/,"I have hoarding tendencies and my NParents have a lot of clutter that they jam in the closets versus me I have in my bedroom I'm organizing. NMom blame me they can't move when I moved a lot out. I know when they pass I'll have to throw or donate a lot, but I have difficulty making decisions. 

Since moving out I rely on them financially because my job isn't as well paying as my internship. I'd be making $70,000 if I had a job offer. Now I'm making less than $30,000 and majority of my income goes to living expenses. I'll probably have to get a second job. I've been interviewing for jobs $50,000 except my interviews get retracted because they end up hiring interns or already contractors.

I realized I can't depend on them emotionally, but I rely them on some things hence them being able to control me.

I try No Contact for a month each and I'm more productive. 

I appreciate them for adopting me, but they should've adopted me. I know I should go No Contact forever and move all my stuff out of there house (which I'm in the process of) but I have an emotional connection with them (at least as a child.)

I can't find one therapist that specializes in NParents or has empathy towards it. I'm getting better and I'm becoming more financially independent, but going from higher paying jobs to a lower paying job with higher living expenses is hard.

Visiting NParents this weekend was a shock. I didn't realize how old and sick they look like along with how unhappy things are. It makes me sad. Although it's not my responsibility to make them happy. I'm no longer their doll to control. 

I realized I'll never be able to make them happy. I don't feel emotionally close to anybody in my family except sometimes I talk to my brother thousands of miles away.

I'm +18 year old in real life and I'm seeking an fantasy with a equally +18 year old in real life roleplayer

 I'm more inclined to accept first the ones submitting their own suggestions rather than leaving me to pick everything, if you read the prompts you will realize I am flexible and open to all sort of things so please don't feel shy of pitching your idea. A bonus if it is something related to r/breeding r/impregPersonals or if you would love to corrupt/tease 

I am really horny now...so this case I'm available to chat as well

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the boys had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. In fact, this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unless he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that the intern was only (+18??) years old.

Who would like to play as her? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left aim charge of a few errands because as your parents have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**edging stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. You started to grow up to (?age), paying more attention to the opposite, boys started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way you saw her dad...which, after all, is everything you can wish for in a man of your own... Without realizing you started to imagine him touching you....kissing you...and even taking you on his bed...such as every night or so you hears your mum moan as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes you a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, your mum (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. You are at home waiting to have your man(dad) around to try something more than just imagining....today you are willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent young adult girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) Summer vacations and you invited 2 of your best friends. During the night sleepover you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them  and there is no internet available, some of your friends are more experienced but still doesn't quite satisfy you, also no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just not slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** (none are deal breakers) are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks) coupled with thick girls, being corrupted/mind broken, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.


Suggestions for *how you might look*: r/tinytits or r/slightcellulite r/ThickThighs/
*Things I would would like to see* r/girlsinyogapants r/seethroughleggings r/visiblepantyline r/cameltoe 


remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png 
Also it would be great if you can stick to describing things rather than just using pictures (both are welcome).


I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :).

Hello friends. 
I posted recently here and found all your responses super helpful so IM BACK! 

Tldr: Moving to Edmonton area in May for bf’s internship - need to be close to airport. 

We found a really cute place in Beaumont but the more I research, the more I hear how awful it is since its such a small town, there is essentially no transportation, not much variety in restaurant choices, etc. Im super concerned about not being able to find a job after moving there and without decent transportation, it would be a pain to travel to for work (won’t have full license until December).

What are your experiences living in Beaumont vs Leduc and which would be easier to find a job in? Many thanks in advance! 

UPDATE: We decided on Leduc! Location is perfect and buses are much more feasible than Beaumont. Thanks all!"

All I have is my mom at the end of the day. And she can be a little toxic. I have a few friends I can call to hang out with but they’re always late to lunches/dinners and when it comes to accommodating other friends when we meet up as a group, they’re okay if I can’t make it but totally cancel when someone else can. I’m not really the “important” friend; I’m the one who invites everyone out or drives people back when they don’t have a ride, but never gets approached first or has my kindness reciprocated. It sucks to feel like my friends don’t care about me, even if it’s true. 

It’s hard enough making friends at my school. I go to a small university and it’s attended by a lot of wealthy/upper-middle class kids. The nightlife is kinda dead and student activities are dead too. I’m lower middle class/working class and I’ve always had to work for things like a car, nice clothes, and it’s just hard to connect with people who’s biggest problems are having nothing to do in their dorm but hang out with friends. Like lol I wish that was my problem. 

I’m not always working, but i can’t afford to blow money like a lot of them do, and I don’t sleep in on weekends; I’m at work early in the morning so I miss out on the few social things my school throws on the weekend. I just feel so lonely at school. Even when I meet other people like me with similar backgrounds, we usually don’t have a lot in common. College is so much more depressing than I thought it’d be. I though this was the place to go to meet like-minded people, but I feel just like I did in high school. I’m either ignored or in last place in everyone’s books. My life is trash."

Simon woke three times on March 23rd, 2029—twice to an alarm clock and once to the realization that he had slept through half of his math class. He kicked his sheets away and rushed to the bathroom. There was no time to shower, but he could at least brush his hair and teeth.

Two minutes later, Simon changed into yesterday's clothes, put on his shoes, and rushed outside. The neighborhood was quiet, as it always was on a Friday morning. The sky was cloudless. A gentle breeze kept him from sweating as he power-walked uphill through his neighborhood. Most days, Simon had to wait a minute or two before he had the opening to jaywalk across the street separating his neighborhood from the university, like a violent river splitting two sides of a forest. He was lucky today. There were no cars to be seen. Even the air was void of the distant ambience of rolling cars. Today was a beautiful day, indeed.

As Simon walked through the towers of dormitories, he heard nothing but the occasional bird chirp or rustle of leaves being carried by the calm wind. No music being played through open windows; no student walking to class (granted, the 11 o'clock block of classes were still an hour from starting) or heading to the dining hall for breakfast; no maintenance crews driving around campus in golf carts. Such a serene day was being put to waste. Who could willingly spend their time locked inside of their dorms?

The clock tower rang as Simon ascended the steps to the Engineering building. It rang ten times, finishing just as Simon opened the door. A faint smell, rancid yet sweet, crept into Simon's nostrils. It was impossible to ignore it, although it was not overpowering. *Someone microwaved something terrible,* Simon thought. He went to room 109. It was empty. He checked the sign at the door again. 109. He had the right location without a doubt; did he have the time wrong? He checked his phone. 10:01 AM, Friday, March 23. Perhaps the instructor canceled class? He checked his email. There were two unread emails, one about internship opportunities and the other an automated message advertising the newest place to live, ""Just 10 minutes from campus!""

As if being an hour late wasn't stressful enough, anxiety made Simon feel lightheaded. A knot formed in his gut. Had they been released early? If they had, then every other class had been, too, since each room Simon ran by was empty. Then, certainly, he would have seen at least one person on his walk. The smell hit him again. Simon opted for mouth-breathing before learning that he preferred its smell over its taste. There was no getting away from the smell in this building. He traced his steps to the front entrance, picking up his pace as his panic picked up its own pace. He wanted to run outside and never stop until he saw at least one person. Someone to explain why campus was so empty; someone to remind him that this wasn't some kind of nightmare; hell, someone to just see. That alone could make up for missing an hour of Differential Equations.

As Simon pushed the front door open, he saw a light coming from the computer lab. There was always some group of students in there, working on a class project or arguing over their custom video game. That could explain the smell, too—there was a microwave and a pot of coffee in the lab. Simon turned toward the room, the wind pushing the front door shut behind. He peered inside. There were three students sleeping on their keyboards. Must've been a long night.

Should he wake them?

*Could* he wake them?

Simon decided he could use the coffee, and if he *just so happened* to be too loud getting the cup of hot caffeine, he would ask them, ""Is today a holiday or something?"" He opened the door and nearly collapsed. The source of the rancid smell was here. It was pure decay. These students were already rotting, no doubt about that. Simon lost his cravings for coffee and sprinted out into fresh air. He hopped down the stairs leading up the Engineering building two at a time. He ran for the library, hoping to find someone to report the corpses to, and once inside, puked on the carpet. Hundreds of students and dozens of library staff lie dead, rotting, hunched over their desks and tables and keyboards. Many covered the carpet, most of them face-down. He had to investigate, but the stench made each step feel like walking on a steep, pebbly hill. Simon threw in the towel and left, coughing relentlessly as he did so.

He dialed 9-1-1. It went to voicemail.

Simon checked his phone for any news. The people may have been dead, but the WiFi was as alive as ever. No news since last night on any major sites. He checked Reddit. Nothing new on the front page since over 12 hours ago. Truly, the world was dead. A voice began to speak in his head. It made him jump, then he realized it was coming from his Brain Chip.

""I hope you all have enjoyed your opioid overdose as much as I have enjoyed giving it to you. For any remaining survivors, you who I have spared, gather in London. We will build this world anew. We will do away with the mistakes and impurities of the past. This is Humanity 2.0, and you are its legacy.""

Simon stood still for over a minute processing what the voice had said. A deranged hacker? The greatest weapon of mass destruction mankind has ever created was an exploit on Brain Chips?

The message repeated itself every twelve hours for another week. Simon rummaged through the empty city, breaking into shops to fill his car with food, clothes, and camping supplies. He made a final stop at Henry's Guns before getting on I-70 East. A dead world awaited its justice, and Simon was going to deliver it.

For the past three days, I've been late to my job. The first two days, I was spending as much time in bed as I could because I was dreading working a ten-hour shift with a brand new intern that I would have to train on top of my normal duties. Today, I would have been on time had I not forgotten my uniform and had to drive back to my apartment through traffic to get it.

Like most shitty retail jobs, we have an attendance policy of verbal, then written warning for being late 3 shifts in 30 days. I already got a verbal a couple months back while I was adjusting to driving in a big city, and if I get a written warning, I can't apply for another job in the company for six months.

I can't work this job anymore. The customer service is exhausting, the hours are too long, and I no longer work with the same people I started with because they all moved on before I did. I still want to stay with this company because it's got great benefits and it has a wide range of job opportunities (right now, for example, there are four secretary jobs open, which is what I need), but I don't even know if I can make it through this shift right now, let alone another six months in retail hell.

I have a doctor's appointment in a few days and I'm meeting with my psychiatrist next week, but I need help now, before I do something really, really stupid like spend the rest of the shift saying my thoughts loud enough for a customer or passing out from not breathing during my hour long panic attack.  Any ideas?

Also shout-out to the coworker who overheard me saying I want to die and now won't leave me the fuck alone. I don't actually want to die, sir, I just would like my body to stop freaking out for like five seconds -_-"

I'm currently at Waterloo for Mechatronics Engineering which I worked my ass off to get into, but the combo of a snowboarding injury and all the sitting I was doing at Waterloo destroyed my lower back and had to take 2 years off.

Waterloo can be awfully depressing, 8 hours of lectures and 6 hours of studying a day, 7 days a week, combined with the poor social environment, and the fact that I had constant back pain really destroyed me both physically and mentally.

My back has greatly improved, but still isn't amazing, and the thought of going back to Waterloo really has me down. 

I've been thinking about switching to Queens as I hear you guys have a great community, but worry I might be throwing away a great opportunity at Waterloo, with the coop program and everything.

I'm also thinking about switching from Mechatronics Engineering to Computer Science since I find I really don't care much for the hardware side of things, and just love programming.

I'd like to hear what you guys think? How is the Computer Science program? How much free time do you guys have? How's the social environment? Internships? Job opportunities?

I feel like I could use some anonymous input, as I am posting anonymously. I feel desperate and drained.

As a child I used to be quite calm and friendly. Then I was bullied during whole elementary, 5th, 6th, 7th grade and 9th grade after I exchanged schools. This past few years, specially since college, I find my emotional and psychological state to be a complete mess. On a daily basis I argue with my parents, mostly my dad. We always clashed in some way. At the moment I intend to persue my plans to get a master's degree elsewhere, in a place where they seem to have the most fulfilling program in the area I'm interested in. However it is going to be big expense and I feel terrible, but I'm not sure if I can stand staying here much longer! I've always shared my room with my sister. Before yesterday we got into a huge argument because she aggressively yelled at me when I just after I told her I needed to sleep, while she was at the bunker staring at nothing and ignoring me. Yeah she has her issues but it's not like I don't have enough problems on my own already to even take crap from her!! For years we didn't always get along. She even said she wanted to break my face and I dared her to do so. But she didn't. I really wanted to beat the living shitty bitch out of her!! I fucking hate that I can't get one single drop of peace in this life. Right now I'm at my grandparents' house. They are gonna be out for a few months and allowed me to go here to study and paint. I have the feeling that I'm gonna be living here for a while... while I can barely stand looking at my roomate's face! Hell I no longer even dare to call my house a home! There I don't even have conditions to work on my projects and meditate. I get annoyed so easily by noise everywhere I stand!! The thought of staying there until October, before I go study, makes my stomach clench and get dizzy from my my head, specially since my sister will be free for a while after her internship. Summer for me is the aweful!! Not even going to mention Summer. 
But the worst is how deeply this affects me! Nothing is ever right, nothing ever feels right! I can't deal with conflicts! My reasoning gets easily brushed off by my emotional turbulence! I feel less stressed outside then in my own fucking house! I can't get a hold of myself. This makes me feel so impotent everyday, the fact that I have no control over anything, even my own emotions! I've been accompanied by a therapist weekly but it has barely helped. Even writing this I'm having the hardest time finding the words and transcribing what goes on my mind. I feel totally helpless, like I'm stuck in a loop. I try to get up but in the end I always get dragged by this wave of bad feelings and toxicity. If it wasn't for my studies and a project I'm colaborating on, I'd instantly get a fulltime job to get the hell out or at least spend more time out of the house. However, aside from that, I've aknowledged that I shouldn't give up my dreams for momentary comfort. I've been doing an effort to invest on myself but I'm afraid I don't even have space for that at this point. I can't feel like a whole person without my own space and sanity. Trough the years all this fear, anger and hatred have made me become a toxic person and then make myself look bad! This also might have costed me the chance of preserving good lasting friendships! I just can't, I just can't! When will I ever get my life on track if I keep stumbling??! I'm so ashamed to admit that I'm such a pussy. I don't want to face my family, I'm tired of argueing and getting nowhere. I wish I could live by my own will!! I want to be able to improve and love myself."

This past few years, specially since college, I find my emotional and psychological state to be a complete mess. On a daily basis I argue with my parents, mostly my dad. We always clashed in some way. At the moment I intend to persue my plans to get a master's degree elsewhere, in a place where they seem to have the most fulfilling program in the area I'm interested in. However it is going to be big expense and I feel terrible, but I'm not sure if I can stand staying here much longer! I've always shared my room with my sister. Before yesterday we got into a huge argument because she aggressively yelled at me when I just after I told her I needed to sleep, while she was at the bunker staring at nothing and ignoring me. Yeah she has her issues but it's not like I don't have enough problems on my own already to even take crap from her!! For years we didn't always get along. She even said she wanted to break my face and I dared her to do so. But she didn't. I really wanted to beat the living shitty bitch out of her!! I fucking hate that I can't get one single drop of peace in this life. Right now I'm at my grandparents' house. They are gonna be out for a few months and allowed me to go here to study and paint. I have the feeling that I'm gonna be living here for a while... while I can barely stand looking at my roomate's face! Hell I no longer even dare to call my house a home! There I don't even have conditions to work on my projects and meditate. I get annoyed so easily by noise everywhere I stand!! The thought of staying there until October, before I go study, makes my stomach clench and get dizzy from my my head, specially since my sister will be free for a while after her internship. Summer for me is the aweful!! Not even going to mention Summer. But the worst is how deeply this affects me! Nothing is ever right, nothing ever feels right! I can't deal with conflicts! My reasoning gets easily brushed off by my emotional turbulence! I feel less stressed outside then in my own fucking house! I can't get a hold of myself. This makes me feel so impotent everyday, the fact that I have no control over anything, even my own emotions! I've been accompanied by a therapist weekly but it has barely helped. Even writing this I'm having the hardest time finding the words and transcribing what goes on my mind. I feel totally helpless, like I'm stuck in a loop. I try to get up but in the end I always get dragged by this wave of bad feelings and toxicity. If it wasn't for my studies and a project I'm colaborating on, I'd instantly get a fulltime job to get the hell out or at least spend more time out of the house. However, aside from that, I've aknowledged that I shouldn't give up my dreams for momentary comfort. I've been doing an effort to invest on myself but I'm afraid I don't even have space for that at this point. I can't feel like a whole person without my own space and sanity. Trough the years all this fear, anger and hatred have made me become a toxic person and then make myself look bad! This also might have costed me the chance of preserving good lasting friendships! I just can't, I just can't! When will I ever get my life on track if I keep stumbling??! I'm so ashamed to admit that I'm such a pussy. I don't want to face my family, I'm tired of argueing and getting nowhere. I wish I could live by my own will!! I want to be able to improve and love myself.

EDIT: and now i just forgot muito grandparents' house keys inside! "

85824h,2,2018-03-17,Relapse (The Reunion Special),MahScoot,mikeomearashow,https://www.reddit.com/r/mikeomearashow/comments/85824h/relapse_the_reunion_special/,"Hello friends! You had to know this was coming. 

Although I quit listening to the show a year ago, I haven't been able to completely leave it behind. I have often thought about listening again, but always stopped myself. Now that I have made it one full year and revivals are so hot, I think I'm ready to check back in and see what has changed. 

It won't surprise you to hear that Monday had me worried. There were no obvious changes and nothing stood out as anything worth poking fun at. The latter is part of the reason for my absence in the last half of 2016. The show is actually too boring to criticize. You can only make so many jokes about Mike having a terrible experience every time he leaves the house or Robb at 45 thinking he's finally the cool kid at school when he is really just minutes away from being legally required to meet his neighbors. 

On Tuesday, I believed I was given a gift. This week's bonus show is free! Initially I thought that meant I’d have more content to pick through and I was pretty excited because at this rate, I was going to need it. But these guys don’t work like that. There was no Friday show because they were allegedly having work done on the studio. I don’t know why the guys can’t just change their shirts and record a second show one day to be posted as the regular Friday show AND give us a truly free extra show but that mystery has plagued us for years now. 

Robb likened this ""free view preview"" to going to Costco and getting free samples. He made no mention of Sunny, a Costco-employed foreigner he used to secretly record and play on the show for laughs. Mike chose to make this announcement by repeatedly calling the non-subscribers ""blood-sucking ticks."" He did not compare them to the 3 men who agreed to put a donate link on their website because they think the same fans who will not pay for more content would be willing to give them money for nothing. And strangely, they are. I learned this week that Pony is going to Japan, thanks to the Facebook fan club. These are the same people who sent Mike to the Masters, Robb and his family on a cruise, and wiped out Oscar's wedding gift registry. Say what you will about those folks but you do have to admire their generosity. If only Mike and co. appreciated it rather than begging for more. 

Tuesday was also when I realized it is strangely comforting how little the show has changed. It feels familiar and I like it. The feeling, I mean. Not the show. The mailbag has moved to a new day but Robb still obnoxiously repeats a chosen word or phrase over the intro song. And the segment still takes up a third of the show because unlike other podcasters, Mike likes his audience to try harder. He still likes to talk up records and still sucks at it but at least this time he only took one run at each song. 

Something else I noticed is that Mike still explains the other guys. When Robb started giggling for no reason as Mike read a letter, Mike immediately realized Robb had punched it up and said, “Look at how happy he gets at his own stuff.” Mike, we’ve been seeing it for over 8 years. Most of us have been with the show since day one and have managed to show up for more episodes than you have. We don't need anything pointed out to us. Mike repeated the Robb-added line and said he would do it until Robb stopped laughing. Robb shot back that they would be there all day. We know, Robb. Oh yeah. He still reacts to everything with this gagging, gurgling noise that is supposed to be laughter. Even the promos that I remember from over a year ago get a reaction as though he is hearing them for the first time. I definitely don’t miss that. 

The Friday bonus show was no different than a regular offering. Mike even opened it with a story we’ve heard at least a dozen times before. He shit his pants one time when he was 9. I can’t imagine why people don’t want to pay for this. Later in the episode Robb played a series of clips comparing Oscar from a year ago to Oscar more recently This was supposed to highlight his poor enunciation of late but ultimately showed that he has always had a bit of a mush mouth that really isn’t that bad. 

So what did I learn this week? I learned that although the rest of the planet has moved on, this group still thinks that Serial references are hilarious and relevant and they are still doing those “This is My Internship” promos with Maddie. It has been 2 years. How long is this internship? Anyway, I guess I didn’t learn anything. It was like going home again and I don’t feel like I was away. There is something to be said for that. 

See you next time."
858ari,8,2018-03-17,[residency] Starting intern year and finding roommates,ImlovinitMD,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/858ari/residency_starting_intern_year_and_finding/,"Congrats to all of us M4s who matched this past weekend! I will be starting intern year in the bay area (San Francisco) with no personal connections. Due to prohibitive housing costs, I know that I will need to find a roommate. I'm interested in rooming with other residents, since it'll probably be easier with our crazy work hours. I was just wondering if there are any platforms where new interns who are looking for housing can find roommates? I know, so specific, but just thought it was worth a shot to ask. Thank you lovely people! "

How do I survive?,globalwaffles,California,https://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/858qsq/im_a_student_coming_over_to_californiastanford/,"I’m a 22 y.o student from Asia and I was pretty hyped when I got accepted as a visiting research intern at Stanford. But the more I look into the costs, the more I realise how this will put a dent in my savings. Any tips to survive because I’ve never been accustomed to such high cost of living.

I’m not sure what are the best ways to get around, where to eat and how to save money in general. This would be my first time to the US"

859qmw,13,2018-03-18,Northeastern Computer Science,PrmGx,NEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/859qmw/northeastern_computer_science/,"Hi. I have narrowed my two college choices down to either Northeastern or UW-Madison for a degree in computer science and business administration, but am having trouble deciding between the two. Please assume paying for either college is no issue.
Northeastern
-Location in Boston 
- great for jobs, making connections, etc.
-Coop program, graduating with 1-1.5 years of real world experience is a great benefit to have.
-Not as strong of a CS program as UWM, but probably not as far behind as it looks in rankings.
-Social scene doesn't seem to be as big due to the coop program, city location.

UW-Madison
-Great CS program, probably better than NEU's for learning.
-Recognition is great for getting internships and jobs.
-Larger campus and student body, plenty of opportunities for clubs, sporting events, and other things that are part of the ""college experience"".
-Love the location, urban feel with plenty of nature.
-Oversaturated program, many classes even junior and senior year have 50+ kids.
-Research is one of the big selling points of UWM, but doesn't seem to be as big of a deal in the CS department especially in the undergraduate realm.
-Things seem to require more self motivation if you want to get them, probably a symptom of the program's oversaturation.
Choosing between these two school is tough, they seem very similar in their strengths with pretty weak downsides. I love both schools, my heart says Northeastern due to the location and coop, brain says Madison as it probably has a overall stronger CS program and is ranked significantly higher.
Thoughts? Anything I am missing or wrong on that could radically change my views on a school for better or worse? Also I don't see Northeastern being ranked well for computer science, any particular reason?"
85a7is,5,2018-03-18,[22M]-[22F] 2 years of relationship ended ego wars,just_searching,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/85a7is/22m22f_2_years_of_relationship_ended_ego_wars/," I had a lovely girlfriend. She was my first love in university. 2 years of friendship and 2 years of relationship ended all things messed up. 
She moved another city for just 3 months of internship. After the first month i decided to visit her. But she is seems not even excited, and this makes me more angry about her. I visited her in foreign city and she didnt care me at all. Last texts did we do is not seems lovely. She is just checking my messages and not answering them. In a hotel room she talked me about problems and she is just saying “I dont why, but im tired, also bored”. She said she found her personality in another city with her girlfriend which is going university in this city. I know this girl which is my ex bff and i hate her, but respecting because of my ex. 

These words that my ex said broke my heart into pieces. I think our relationship was perfect. We discussed of course but not serious things. She didnt even tell problems to me. And i thought after these problems not a big deal. She called me 6 months ago and she said have a break in our relationship. I said ok because i thought she had problems in her mind, and may be the self-time will cure for these problems. I am still saying again i dont see any problems still looking back to my relationship. And i said ok to this “have a break” thing. 

No contact rule in 2 weeks i called her and calmly just asked. “Who are those new guys in her instagram account?” they can be friends but i dont know who are they so why should i trust her or them ?. Literally in that time as a boyfriend my right is knowing who are they. After this question she got mad. And told me we are single now. And thats not of my business. These words make me like “Right in the face with a shotgun.” And i yelled her about something. Just to hurt her feelings…

We broke up 6 months ago but i still cant accept she dont want me. I used No Contact Rule which is not very effective in my situation. After 3 months i contacted her because university is going and we are in the same campus. First i tried not contact at all. But this hate make me worse and my psychology. She told me about 5 times “i wont accept you again. Dont ask me…”, the fact that i didnt even asked her a question about being back. 
I just said i want to know why you dumped me ? and she said.”You dumped me”… She said have a break and she said we are single now. But somehow i dumped her……..
Thing get messed up and after these 3 months still not contacting at all but i cant moving my life as a normal. She is trying to look powerful when i see her. She only have one friend in the World which this bitch who is living in another city. I am going to psychologist but about 2 months. 

Sorry for bad english but pain are universal right ? Thank you…

**TL;DR** I cant accept that my ex forgot me. Still trying to understand her feelings about me ?"
85a8iu,38,2018-03-18,Glhf,SoupRyze,RyzeMains,https://www.reddit.com/r/RyzeMains/comments/85a8iu/glhf/,"I’m bad at games. Any game, you name it. I was born a fragile little kid, and although I’m an average dude right now in terms of height and weight and everything, my reflexes suck ass. I constantly trip over myself when I walk, I tried every single sport and suck at all of them (learnt badminton for a year and got beaten by a guy who learnt it for a week). Even in video games, I suck and have to put a larger amount of time in order to “git gud” compared to my friends.

League was the first game I could play ok-ish with my friends (who were also Bronze scrubs) and have fun with them because I didn’t weigh them down, but I was always playing the simpler champs because I wanted to contribute (I was a Bronze Heimerdinger main, nuff said, and Orianna was the hardest champion in my opinion back then). But one day, I got fucked by a random Ryze and I decided to learn him. I fed my as off every single game, but I never gave up, and it was around the time when Faker won Worlds in season 6 that I can do half-decently with Ryze in ranked and started climbing my way through Bronze with this champion. I just wanted to get to Gold with Ryze, to actually get something I want to get “the hard way” because it’s “my way”. I spent countless hours in League grinding for that elo, I was known among my group of friends as “the hardstuck Silver Ryze main”, but eventually after 800-900 games, I got there, with mainly Ryze. The new runes came out, and recently the new AP items also came out, both making Ryze stronger than ever.

But it’s just not the same anymore. I find myself playing different champions more than Ryze, and I can’t do **the Zhonya’s Ult** thing that is pretty much the best fucking thing to do in League ever. Ryze just isn’t the same for me, and League isn’t the same. At the same time, life catches up to me: I’m now a sophomore who just plays video games in his free time on a MacBook, while many of my *peers* are out there getting internships and doing productive things. A lot of things happened to me for the last 2 years, I moved to NA from another continent to pursue someone else’s dream, and I play the game I used to play with my high school boys who I consider to be my family because I love that game and I just need an escape from my irl problems. And the more difficulties I run into, the more I play League, and before I know it, I spent way too much time on a video game just to get to a level where it’s considered to be “ok”.

I tell myself I gotta quit League, I can’t just keep running away from my problems, but ironically I was especially serious about getting to Gold with Ryze, and I have accomplished that goal, so now at least I feel like I have achieved something after all this time. I had a lot of fun playing Ryze, and I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to regret playing League of Legends all this time, as depression is a real thing and who knows what I could have gotten myself into if it hadn’t been for the sick Ryze plays that kept me going. I want to take control of my life, to live for myself and not chase someone else’s dreams. If real life is a game like League, and Ryze is a representation for what I enjoy doing, then I want to climb the elo ladder playing Ryze. I’m not even sure what I want to do in life yet, some kids just always know that they want to work in Walls Street when they grow up, while I live 20 minutes away from Walls Street being lost af in this rat race. But I’ll try. Meeting new people, munching books in the library, finally dragging my ass to the gym... I wanna make my boys proud of me, so that one day when we meet again, I may not be a **baller** but I’d be happy living life the way I want to whatever that may be. I wanna let her know that I’m a happy man now, and she doesn’t have to see my forced smiles again. I don’t have the talent to become a pro gamer/streamer, but I’ll just get a job and maybe game a bit when I have free time. Life goes on.

And maybe, after a couple of years, they will finally give Ryze a guaranteed escape to replace the good’ol Zhonya’s Ult and ya boi can finally flash forward to kill an ADC without being stuck in the middle of 4 scary enemies. Just wanted to say it out loud to the community that I have cared a lot about for the last year in my life. Probably the longest year I’ve ever lived. But I’ll be out there, grinding that irl elo trying to take control of my life, so until then, y’all just Hold My Soup ok? 

Glhf, and remember to always take Ravenous Hunter."

I’m the Dutch student who posted here around one month ago who asked a few questions about Indonesia. You guys were very helpful so I wanted to thank you all for the help. 


I think I just wanted to give a little update (for the ones who might care lol). Everything went great after I landed, exchanging money went easily, getting a cab to my place was also easy (and only paid 13 euros wow). The first time I exited the airport I was already blown away by how humid it was! Other than that, I think the weather is great and even though I am here for my internship, it feels like a little holiday. I met really nice people here, yay I made friends! The food is great (although one was so spicy I nearly cried). Traffic is bad though but I got used to it already. My office is really close to my apartment so I just order Gojek and go with the scooter. 


 I’ve mostly been out only in the weekends because during the week I’m too tired after coming back from the office that I just want to lay down. I had padang today and it was yummyy. Also, the people here are so friendly and try to help me all the time, but I feel like they also have a tendency to say sorry a lot, even though when I feel like they shouldn’t even say it haha. Maybe it’s the politeness of your culture idk.


Anyway, I tried to keep it short so nobody gets bored and of course I am not sure if people will care, but you helped me so I just wanted to let you know how it went and say thank you again.

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

85au2d,1,2018-03-18,University of Wisconsin Madison,PrmGx,UWMadison,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/85au2d/university_of_wisconsin_madison/,"Hi. I have narrowed my two college choices down to either Northeastern or UW-Madison for a degree in computer science and business administration, but am having trouble deciding between the two. Please assume paying for either college is no issue. Northeastern -Location in Boston - great for jobs, making connections, etc. -Coop program, graduating with 1-1.5 years of real world experience is a great benefit to have. -Not as strong of a CS program as UWM, but probably not as far behind as it looks in rankings. -Social scene doesn't seem to be as big due to the coop program, city location.
UW-Madison -Great CS program, probably better than NEU's for learning. -Recognition is great for getting internships and jobs. -Larger campus and student body, plenty of opportunities for clubs, sporting events, and other things that are part of the ""college experience"". -Love the location, urban feel with plenty of nature. -Oversaturated program, many classes even junior and senior year have 50+ kids. -Research is one of the big selling points of UWM, but doesn't seem to be as big of a deal in the CS department especially in the undergraduate realm. -Things seem to require more self motivation if you want to get them, probably a symptom of the program's oversaturation. Choosing between these two school is tough, they seem very similar in their strengths with pretty weak downsides. I love both schools, my heart says Northeastern due to the location and coop, brain says Madison as it probably has a overall stronger CS program and is ranked significantly higher. Thoughts? Anything I am missing or wrong on that could radically change my views on a school for better or worse? Also I don't see Northeastern being ranked well for computer science, any particular reason?"

I really need a clarification in hopes that maybe in the future I could help her out..

please hang on with me as the story will be quite lengthy..

first of all I regret that I flirted with her knowing that she has a boyfriend.. we got closer as months pass and eventually by the end of her internship in my workplace. she kissed me, the following day she confessed to me saying she likes me, but I told her it's not right to do so.. here's the first symptom (I assume)

she persuaded and talked her way into me.. saying love is blind and it's okay because we like each other.. we then proceed to be ""together""... as weeks and months pass by, things are picking up in both good and bad way.. her constant need of affection and reassurance from me to make sure I really love her.. instead of feeling guilty that she is cheating, she demands a lot and a lot of attention and affection from me..

I gave all to her, but at times we would argue because she said she felt insecure with me.. and I told her I'm sorry because I can't handle the guilt of her cheating on her boyfriend.. (I'm only human and I know what is right and wrong)

I tried to break it up from her.. but it doesn't work.. I guess this is the 2nd symptom..

Constant need of attention, affection, reassurance and insecurity.. &amp;

she knows how to manipulate and talk her way into me whenever I said I want to break up.. eventually I gave in.. and we continue our ""relationship""... entering the 4th month and so on, we would argue almost 3-4 times a week, be it small arguments or big ones like how to handle guilt and all sorts of issues.. She said she could love two person because two of us is different.. and she's okay with it..

Entering the 5th month, things are getting worse and worse, although the fun stuff/happiness is really great, but when argument starts, it's downward spiral of hell.. she would shout, flipped, scream and name-callings, asking me to die, she will suicide if I said I want to break up with her, will blackmail me saying she will make my life miserable, video calling me while she stands in the middle of the road with heavy traffics..

She loves it when we're in a middle of an argument, she will run away expecting me to chase her back, obviously I didn't.. she would came back, scold/scream/shout at me to a point she tore my shirt and pull my hair, hit me, punch me.. it just gets worse and worse..

In the end what happened? I tried to talk to her but it doesn't work... I stopped texting her, one day she just text me say ""It's over, I've moved on, I've deleted every single messages/pictures/memory of you, I'm going back to my boyfriend who is more caring and constantly giving me warmth.. although she said she loves me more and physical intimacy with me is better than her bf.. but she can't take all the hurt that I've caused her..

It has been 2 months since the break up, and I'm feeling very much like a shit because I missed her so much.. although she's a bit psychotic (If you would say...)

So redditors, help me out, is she suffering from BPD? Or am I over thinking? I tried reading up about BPD and some of it really matches her characteristics..

I was recently admitted to the above programs and I'm having a hard time choosing between the two. I want to specialize in computer architecture as I have had a couple of internships plus recent and relevant research experience in it. 

Looking at the courses, SBU seems to be more flexible because at ASU for CE you only get like 6 credits outside of the required CEN courses. At ASU I am mostly looking to complete a thesis under Professor Fengbo Ren or Professor Carole-Jean Wu as their recent publications and independent activities of their research groups match my interests. At SBU a lot of the professors that specialize in computer architecture reside under the CS department and not the ECE department which MS in CE comes under. So I was doubtful whether they will allow cross department thesis advising. 

Any help from the people here? Please help me choose. Both are equally good on the basis of amount of and depth of courses with SBU maybe slightly ahead with the amount of choices. Both cost nearly the same overall. Keep in mind I'm an international student."
85blz4,1,2018-03-18,M4M/M4T/M4A - The Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/85blz4/m4mm4tm4a_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Usual disclaimer of course - we're all adults here, right? This is just a fantasy, and if you're not old enough to be on this page I don't want to hear from you

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

Other kinks! https://m.imgur.com/MTINyO2"

85bupn,5,2018-03-18,"Doubts in question answering , NER , classification , corenlp and semantic parsing .",matib275,LanguageTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/85bupn/doubts_in_question_answering_ner_classification/,"Hey guys I'm working on a question answering project for my internship. It's kind of like a natural language interface to a structured data source (a API) . 

It seems [semantic parsing](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wcmac/sippycup/blob/master/sippycup-unit-0.ipynb) is usually used for this task , but since the number of intents/categories of my questions are small (2) I thought of not using semantic parsing for the initial trial. But this can be potentially be used in future.

I am using Stanford's [corenlp](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) for NER and classifier. 

This is how the architecture is , I run the questions through an NER and identify the required entities (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, TITLE) then I replace these entities to their canonical form . So a question like ""who knows XYZ from New York"" becomes ""who knows PERSON from LOCATION"" . This is now sent to a classifier which identifies the intent and then accordingly neccasary API calls are made.

Right now I have manually created around 200 base questions (has placeholder for entities). 

I have a few doubts regarding the NER and classifier

**NER**

1. I trained the NER on multiple copies of my dataset . I take my 200 base questions and fill it with different names in the place holders . This is giving me somewhat ok results but its highly overfitting . The main problem is that I can't find a dataset which has TITLE (eg. VP, CEO , manager, trader, etc.) tag . I found that [OKE](https://github.com/anuzzolese/oke-challenge-2016) has TITLE tags , but their dataset in github is very small. So I am planning to take some articles from [Bloomberg financial news corpus](https://github.com/philipperemy/financial-news-dataset) and manually annotate. Is this a good idea or should I stick to training on the questions itself ?
2. I have a basic idea of how discriminative models work , but I wasn't able to understand the documentation of feature templates in [NERFeatureFactory](https://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/javanlp/edu/stanford/nlp/ie/NERFeatureFactory.html) . I wasn't able to understand a few features such as useDisjunctive, useSymTags .
3. Is there an option to evaluate the NER only if it gets all the words of the named entity right , i.e. marking ""New York"" as ""New LOCATION"" should give a accuracy of 0% instead of 50% .

**Classifier**

1. I am using the [ColumnDataClassifier](https://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/javanlp/edu/stanford/nlp/classify/ColumnDataClassifier.html) . The problem of a small dataset haunts here also . The model is highly overfitting and exploiting patterns that I have unconciously introduced to the dataset. eg. I had the word ""people"" in a lot of sentances in class 1 , now when I was testing it I used ""people"" in a question of class 2 but the classifier made a error. When I printed the features I found that it had given high weights to the presence of ""people"" for class 1.  I tried to use the ""l1reg"" option , but I was getting an error that one of the QN optimization classes wasn't available ~~(I can't recollect it as of now , I'll add it later)~~ (edu.stanford.nlp.optimization.OWLQNMinimizer)
2. For tackling vairations and synonyms , I tried using GloVe . There is an option in the classifier ""useSplitWordVectors"" which just takes the average of the words in the senatance . Is there a better way to handle this . Since it's not regularized , the classifier is assigning very low weights to the word vector features . This  is causing the classifier to completely ignore those features.

  ​

**TL;DR**

1. Getting dataset for training NER to detect TITLE tags 
2. Handling variations of different questions using GloVe
3. Regularization for the classifier
4. Is semantic parsing more suitable here ?

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

I’m not happy with where I am or who I am right now, but I know that I can change it with hard work and gradual self-improvement. 

I’m going to state the facts, both positive and negative. 

Positive: 

* I’m still young. I’m only 21 and a junior in college. I’m committing to myself now, and I know that I can improve myself. 

* I made it out of a terrible family situation. Growing up I was abused by my father and my mother wasn’t in the best emotional state. I was homeless for a while, and now I go to a top 3 liberal arts college so I know that I have the drive and determination to rise above obstacles when I’m motivated. 

* I have good friends. I’ve lost a lot of them, but the ones who are still there are very good to me. 

* I’m studying abroad in a country I love. Life is good.
I have good grades and a good GPA, even after a really bad episode of OCD symptoms.

Negative:

* I have OCD, but I’m working on it. For about 9 months, starting from my sophomore spring and going until November I had a very bad flare up of symptoms that made me miss out on a lot. I couldn’t get a good internship last summer (I got one, but I didn’t like it), I self-isolated a lot, and I lived in constant fear of my own mind. I was convinced that these thoughts defined me, but I know they don’t.

* I can’t find an internship, and the ones that I can find are after the deadline for school funding (which I need to be able to afford an unpaid internship). I’m thinking about just working at a summer camp and studying very hard for the September LSAT, which would be very productive but not ultimately what I had hoped for this summer. Growing up I was literally homeless, so I don’t have any real connections or model for what I can do after college which makes my situation difficult. I’m networking slowly, but I feel like I lost a few months when all I could focus on was checking symptoms of various diseases because of my OCD.

* I’m overweight and am addicted to vaping (lol). I hurt my ankle very badly, and in the throes of my OCD episode I overate and didn’t exercise, so I gained a bit of weight. I’ve lost about 10 pounds recently, which is good, and I’m on my way back down.

* My relationship with my family is profoundly unhealthy. I just got off the phone with my mom, which inevitably makes me very sad. We all came up in a very tough situation together and leaned on some pretty unhealthy coping strategies and dynamics. Whenever I talk to her I feel like her release valve/therapist, which is fine, but whenever I try to bring anything that’s not positive with her she’s dismissive and invalidating. I love her a lot and know that she’s struggling, but it doesn’t make it any easier. Whenever I get off the phone or talk with her, I feel profoundly lonely and isolated.
 
All in all, it’s been a tough year. I know that if I succeed it’s from what I do from here on out and a little luck. Does anyone have any advice on where to get started? If this is rock bottom, I think I'll be okay. I've been given a very good opportunity through my school, but I'm afraid of not making the most of it.

I don't mind Jo that much but I just find Camilla's acting a little one dimensional. I also don't think Justin shines on his scenes with Camilla. He shines much more on his scenes with Mer/Arizona/Peds Patients. Romantically, Justin had way more chemistry with Kate Walsh (underrated ship) and Heigl. Alex and Izzie had romantic chemistry even when they were just laughing/joking and not dating. The way Alex looked at Izzie is not the same way Alex looks at Jo. We are told he loves her so much, but even on that last scene where she proposes, Justin wasn't on the top of his game. I mean, I think from what the writers have told us, Jo is the one for Alex, I just wish they could develop more onscreen so their chemistry could improve. I do think Jolex will be endgame and I will be happy - but instead of focusing on the interns or 100% on Jaggie, give us more Jolex. Alex has a huge fanbase and we all want him to be happy so just give them more screentime. Still, I just don't see them NOT being endgame given the fact that they are always saying Alex's chicks always leave or go crazy or die. "

85d697,0,2018-03-18,"Finally Employed Again: Car Purchase, Loans, and Savings",recently_reemployed,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/85d697/finally_employed_again_car_purchase_loans_and/,"Hi all,

Long-time reader, first-time poster. This is actually my first Reddit post ever, so please forgive any formatting errors.

# Me:

* 26, male, bachelor’s, 815+ FICO, not married

* 401(k): ~$15k, needs to be rolled into an IRA

* Roth IRA: ~$6300

* eFund: $12250

* Student Loan debt: ~$10750 left on $22k, 5% fixed, min. $233/mo, final payment due Dec. 2024

* No credit card debt, car payment, mortgage


Last summer I re-located from HCOL to LCOL with my girlfriend but struggled to find work. I freelanced, tightened down my budget, and made ends meet for about 6 months. I took a decent hit to my net worth, but managed to never dip into my efund.

I just got an offer for a 3-month contract position that is likely to extend to at least a year. It’s through a staffing agency, so no self-employment taxes, health insurance, or retirement plan. Pay is $30/hr, so I’m basing my budget on $3300 take-home per month to account for unpaid time off, etc. Now that I’m making money again, I’m looking for advice on how to balance killing my student loans, buying a car, and saving for retirement.


# Budget:

* Rent: $500

* Internet: $45

* Water/Trash: $45

* Gas: $50

* Transportation (Lyft/Bus): $50

* Charity: $25

* NYT/Netflix/Spotify/Subscriptions: $50

* Phone: $25

* Groceries: $175

* Eating Out: $50

* Alcohol: $50

* Entertainment (Movie tickets, etc): $20

* Medical: $100

* Dog food, treats, routine vet: $40

* Misc.: $50

* Health insurance: $250


This leaves me with about $1800 monthly for savings and loans.

# Car situation:

I currently share my girlfriend’s car. It is possible for her to take the bus to school (grad student) and it is possible, though inconvenient, for me to take the bus to my new job. This summer she will be taking an internship in a different city and will need her car, so I’ll have to buy a car by end of May. My ideal car is a small crossover/hatchback. She drives a Fiat 500 that isn’t large enough to move most things, including our dog crate, so I unfortunately might something bigger than a civic/corolla.


# My plan right now:

* Take ~$2250 from efund and add it to Roth IRA before tax day

* Allocate $250/mo to rebuild efund in case my contract isn’t renewed

* Up student loan contribution from $250/mo to $1000/mo

* Save $600/mo for a car

* Save $200/mo in Roth IRA

* In May, if my contract is not renewed, I’ll buy a beater in cash

* If my contract is renewed, I’ll buy a low-mileage hatch in the $8k range, make a down payment, finance it under 5%, and use my saved up car fund to pay down my student loan.


My goal is to be debt free by May of 2020, which is when my girlfriend will finish her grad program and I’ll be looking toward engagement and wedding expenses. A home purchase is a distant dream right now and not on the 5-year radar.

I’ll continue looking at other full-time jobs during my contract period in case it doesn’t get renewed.

Please let me know if I'm prioritizing retirement, car savings/financing, and loan payments well, and what else I might be forgetting. Thanks so much in advance!"
85d6ju,1,2018-03-18,First Big Boy Salary Negotiations. Help!,tossaside1232,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/85d6ju/first_big_boy_salary_negotiations_help/,"I got my first real deal adult job offer yesterday, and I need help negotiating the salary.

My background: 
I went to a university that highly encouraged internships. I unfortunately was looking into a career that was highly competitive (US foreign service), and at the time (2010-2012) had people much further along in their career/education path applying to entry level positions and never actually landed an internship, or job after graduation.

About a year after graduation I needed to really get a job, I decided the military would be a good first step into the career field I was looking for. I joined that Army as an Officer Candidate, and in the Army's infinite wisdom, they decided to make me an Ordnance Officer (Maintenance and Munitions). I was pretty disappointed, but was on a 3 year contract so had to learn to deal with it.

My first real position was warehouse Platoon Leader, which is a quartermaster job, not what I had been trained for. Ultimately I managed the warehouse personnel and operations. I learned some of the aspects of inventory control, shipping/receiving, convoy operations, demand forecasting etc.

With the help of my NCOs and Commander I figured out how to do the job, and about 10 months later was moved to the Maintenance Control Officer position. This job I had been trained for, beyond managing the maintenance personnel and motor pool oprations, maintenance schedule, the Lions share of my time was spent reporting maintenance efforts to superiors that didn't understand my job. At this point I embraced logistics, and decided I could do similar things in logistics that I wanted from foreign service.

After another 10 months I was moved to a position of greater authority as Company Executive Officer, which is effectively the operations manager, our company was made up of the 75 mechanics I used to manage, 60 cooks, 15 medics, and the headquarters element (certainly exercised some *managing up* skills) of 30 people with 1/3 of them outranking me.

I got my sweet honorable discharge in October 2016, took an extended vacation with my wife, and started the job hunt in earnest in February 2017.

I landed a position with the local port authority as a Finance analyst (something I had minimal experience with, but saw as an opportunity to add to my ""manager"" skill set). After the 6 month temporary hire my hire was extended and then extended again.

This employment opportunity.

After 10 months of looking I finally got a call for an interview for an operations superintendent position with a maritime terminal operations company. This was a surprise as I had not applied to the position, I got invited to the interview as a referral from an earlier networking effort. I got a call last Friday inviting me to interview on this past Wednesday. The interview went well, I had a solid answer for all of their questions, I feel like they were warming up to me already.

The morning after the interview I sent out my requisite 'thank you're email, quickly got an email along the lines of ""hey thanks for interviewing, if we choose to bring you in for a second interview we need you to fill out this application prior to"" this made sense, as I came in on a referral rather than an application. I filled out the application and sent it back Thursday morning. I expected a call maybe as early as Friday, but probably this coming week inviting me to a second interview.

I *did* get a call on Friday with a 'handshake' job offer. 7 days after getting a call for an interview and 36hrs after the interview I had a job offer.

The Job Offer:
$65k through the initial review period (6 months) then up to $70k, salary exempt (which is important because given the task-oriented atmosphere of logistics operations there is a pretty good chance I will be working more than the prescribed 40 hours a week)

Company pays 100% of medical/dental/vision (unsure if this extends to family)

Offers 401k, after 1 year the company offers 4% matching (it sounds like one-to-one) with nothing matched prior to the 1 yr mark, but no vesting period there after.

I think in addition there is a pension, averaging 9% of base salary (I dont contributete to this) that begins getting paid into at 1 yr, and then I am vested at 5 yrs.

I am uncomfortable taking the first offer on principle, and because I feel like this is a low-ball.

My three years of military experience are clearly relevant to the position, and in the military I was being paid more than their initial offer.

In addition, I feel like I have a position to negotiate given the haste with which it seems they decided to hire me. 

I intend to ask for 15% more than the ""permanent"" salary (so $80k) and be willing to settle for 10% more ($77k). I understand the ""probation period"" pay would be diminished due to them feeling me out, so I have no qualms taking $5k-7k below my floor ($77k) during the first 6 months from my time there.

I am entirely willing to walk away from this position for less than $75k, while I think the job would be exciting and fun, and start a path I would like to be on, it also will often require long hours, and potentially shitty shift/schedules, I am not willing to flip my life upside down and work 3rd shift for anything less than the $77k figure.

Does the hivemind of reddit think this is reasonable?  Is there any way I should particularly frame this to better my chances of success? Or really any advice at all?

TLDR Got an initial job offer for $70k, a week after being called in for an interview. Asking for 15% more as my counter offer. Is this enough? Too much?"

85dcxo,2,2018-03-18,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/85dcxo/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door.

I  managed to track her phone's location from 4.30pm to 1am but during these 8-9 hours her phone has always been in the same location, despite knowing the location, we can't find it because it's inside the mall and the location is too vague to pinpoint it directly. Asked my friends and her friends to keep ringing the person with the phone up but that sohai kia keeping rejecting our phone calls, I can guarantee we left at least 100 missed calls, texted him as well and even begged him to return but to no luck.

We traced it with Google's Android Device Manager app and her battery was around 40% when the phone suddenly disappeared off the map and we were very confused because the app offered a ""Lock"" mode in-case it got stolen but we weren't sure if it prevents the phone from shutting down or not. So now, all I see from the app is ""Last Seen x hours ago @ Cathay Cineleisure"". We made a police report already but I want to do my own investigations also to try and help her because her family isn't doing so well financially. So is it possible to trace the phone via imei even when if it has gone off-grid? Or we hit a dead end already and we have to wait until that person go online with her phone again?

P.S. I know if this is very far-fetched but if anybody found her phone please let me know, she has alot of important stuff in her phone since she doesn't have her laptop (her assignments, intern documents and project work). She has a black S8 Edge, with a black rubber casing and a white/black sticker saying ""Relax don't vex"" or smth like that stuck on the phone casing, wallpaper is a guy holding a dog.

85dk3a,2,2018-03-18,"I [24 F] am thinking of breaking up with my long-distance [22, MtF] girlfriend of 3 years, but can't trust myself",bloodymangata,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/85dk3a/i_24_f_am_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_my/,"**TL;DR** I  really love my girlfriend, but I think we're not compatible anymore. I am having a hard time deciding if that opinion is my own thinking, or driven by my family's disapproval of the relationship. 

**Background:**
* This relationship is my first dating relationship. I met her my first day at a religious university, and we bonded over being LGBT in a hostile environment. 

* At the time, she was trying hard to conform to her birth gender, and I was trying to convince myself I was straight. We started dating our sophomore year. She helped me accept my sexuality, and I helped her realize that being trans is not a hinderance to finding love.

* I am very motivated/career-driven/type-A. She is very laid back/unmotivated/type-B, just wants to have fun. Up until now, the dynamic has been very good for both of us: she makes me sit down and breathe, and I help her be more ambitious. 

* I graduated almost a year ago, and she graduated this last fall. We both moved back to our respective families, and are now in a long-distance relationship. 

* She doesn't have many friends, and in the years we've been dating, has come to rely on me as her primary social contact.

* My family situation is rough, raisedbynarcissists style. My parents are domineering and incredibly homophobic. I am not out to them, and neither is my girlfriend. For all they know, we are straight. 

* Her family situation is less rough, but her parents are transphobic and put her through conversion therapy when she was younger. Her family really likes me, and has frequently given me gifts/favors. Because they come from a higher economic class, these frequently feel very extravagant/generous, but I am unsure how much they mean to her family. 

* My parents have tried to break us up from day one. They don't believe my girlfriend is ""on my level."" 

**Current situation: **
After moving home, I had to push the majority of my personality back under the surface. It's a survival tactic to deal with my raisedbynarcissists just-no-mother. I go grey-rock and get by for the most part, but am looking forward to going to grad school in the fall. I currently work a full-time paid internship and go to school part-time to prepare for a master's program. I also volunteer with religiously homeschooled youth, in an attempt to help them avoid the mental thought patterns I internalized during high school. Needless to say, I am very busy, preparing for my future.

After moving home, my girlfriend has reverted to doing nothing. She plays a lot of tabletop games with friends from high school, and has gotten somewhat involved in her church's young adults program. At both of these social contexts, she's closeted. She recently got a job offer at Starbucks, but she's very lonely and doesn't get out a lot. Because she came to depend on me for social activities/friendship while we were at the same university, she doesn't have a huge social network to rely on. Consequently, she's been leaning heavily on me for all stimulation, validation of her identity, etc. I try to text with her/call her around my various obligations and activities, but she sulks if I don't text her while at work, or during classes.

Recently, she started talking about marrying me. When she started mentioning marriage with frequency, I realized that I ... don't want to marry her. It's not that I don't love her - I have a great depth of feeling toward her, both in gratitude for all she's done for me, and because she really is a wonderful, genuine, caring, emotionally-available person. She taught me to be kind to myself, and showed me what a family could look like. I can honestly say that she's made me a better version of myself in the last three years.

The more she talks about marriage, though, the more I realize that I'm not sure if our relationship should continue. It's clear that I am not providing her with the attention and care she deserves, and I honestly can't summon the emotional energy to support her while also protecting myself from my family situation. 

I don't think I am doing justice to the relationship, but I am unwilling to give up my dreams of grad school to be a better girlfriend to her. Over the last few weeks, I've felt myself become resentful of the little fires I have to keep putting out in our relationship.

I've also begun to realize that I don't want to be in a relationship where I am the single source of income. Whenever my girlfriend talks about marriage, she fantasizes about being my housewife, keeping house and working on her artistic pursuits. I like her carefree approach to life, but I take the idea of marriage very seriously, and can't see myself in a marriage with someone who isn't fighting just as hard for our future as I am. 

My final reason is that I'm not ready for marriage, and won't be for a long time. I'm also not ready to cohabitate.

My problem is that I can't separate these reasons from my parent's constant ploys to break us up. It's hard to tell what ideas are theirs and what ones are mine. If I'm going to break up with my girlfriend, I owe it to her to be sure that I'm doing it for my own reasons.

So I guess I have a couple of questions, driven by my lack of experience when dating: 

1. Are these reasons reasonable to break up with someone?
2. If I do break up with her, how do I do it in a way that is respectful of the length of the relationship, and minimally hurtful to her? I have no experience with this at all. "

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

- 22 years old, last 6 months of uni
- current living situation: $200/week including utilities, 20 mins from college by bus, 1 hour away from my work (I work 16 hours a week, but with commuting it's basically 20 hours...)
- private bedroom, but shared bathroom and living areas/kitchen
- I really, really dislike the commute even though it's not that much, but everything I do is in the CBD (gym, groceries, restaurants, university) besides work


If I move:
*  rent: 485/week including utilities, studio apartment so that's nice too, has a gym (so I can cancel my current gym membership which is $22/week
*  literally across the road from my university, 30 min bus ride to work, within 10 min walk to grocery store and restaurants
*  I would really like to move here because it would save me so much time 
*  the facilities are a LOT newer and nicer (it just opened the start of this year)


My finances:
*  25k in savings
*  1.5k/month from my part-time internship
*  2.5k/month allowance from parents (weaning myself off bit by bit since I have my own income
*  parents CC for random expenses if I choose to use it
*  monthly expenses at the moment (including rent all the way down to groceries and entertainment): $1800 (I pay for these from my own checking account &amp; parents CC)

The way I see it is, for the last 6 months of uni, things will be hectic with my final year project (engineering) and working part time as well, so it would be amazing if I could cut down commute time, and honestly I think I can afford living there because it's only 6 months and I have decent income/allowance and savings. My parents don't care what I do.

Please advise.

Edit: I have a job lined up after uni, starting in February that pays $65k/year if that changes anything. I will most likely be moving again then. "

But despite that, I still have the issue where I need to get something done be it finishing my almost-done essay due tuesday, or working on work (work at home). Hell, even drawing as a hobby. I can't and I don't know why. I have some lorazepam that I take which somehow helps but half the time I sit in my chair and zone out, staring aimlessly forward. 

This isn't just for priorities. This is for things I WANT to do too. Like drawing on my tablet. I sit in my chair and it's like my body tenses up and i get uncomfortable and can't move, can't get myself to function. I don't know why this is happening and I am tried of being unable to function like this. I after I hand in this essay all I need to do is study and do one easy essay. That's literally it and then I get my degree.

But I just can't. I have no drive. I can't function, I can't push myself to do things. The sad thing is is that when I WANT to draw or something, it's when I'm unable to (work, internship) and by the time I'm done working I'm so physically exhausted from being out for 16 hours that day that I just crash.

I don't know what to say. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Where you're finally out of depression but it's like the bad habits adopted from crippling depression have stayed with you and you are a useless shell of a human being? I used to be so driven, so passionate, so ambitious. Now I just sit and do absolutely nothing all day."

He kept saying how non-typical I was over the phone and again when he came in.  I'm about 40 when they usually see people at 50.  He showed me the official hoarding scale photographs and I rated myself about 4-5.

He was surprised about my eagerness to let him in.  I flat out declared that he'd seen worse.  He seemed a little weirded-out that I was so knowledgeable, like ADHD body-doubling.  Also how I grouped overeating and alcoholism as one direction related to hoarding and ADHD and OCD on the other direction.

He asked me to point out on the official scale where hoarding is a problem, and on the living room one I was pointing at the 4.  At 3, if someone wanted to sit down they could clear the couch.  I pointed out that I didn't have anywhere for him to sit.  (Truthfully, he could sit but I would have had to stand or dig out a chair.)

They have interns as well, and I should be pretty easy for them to work on.  I said that I was about ready to just start breaking stuff.

He was willing to take my microwave to Goodwill-by-pound, but we ran out of time.  I can call his team for pickups, which will help.  He did take a box of glassware for me.  He asked how I felt about it, and I admitted that we decided to get rid of it months ago."

I'm considering surgery and didn't know where else to turn for support yet. I have literally just started the process of looking into my options, going to seminars, calling insurance, and setting up an initial appointment with a surgeon. Thanks so much for reading this!

I'm a super short (4' 9'') 28-year old woman who weighs 260 lbs (and that's not my highest weight, terrifyingly) and needs to be somewhere closer to 100-110-ish pounds. I've been morbidly obese for almost all my life. I've been binge eating/comfort eating ever since I have memories. Surgery and the idea of all of the changes I will be facing are terrifying to me. But I also realize that I'm not really living my life to the fullest. So, I need surgery or at least some drastic change with a tremendous amount of medical/nutritional/peer support. 

1) The only person who I can really count on for some help post- surgery (like staying with me during or after surgery, etc.) is my mother. I'm really embarrassed and scared to talk to her about the possibility of my having the surgery. I'm not even really sure how to bring it up. She has always talked about all of the people she knows who've had bariatric surgery and had severe consequences. (She's a nurse in a rehab facility.) I either think that she won't support me or that her anxiety/negativity surrounding the procedure will make surgery even harder for me. Like, I'm afraid that if I have any struggles through surgery, my mom will say, ""I told you so."" I have no one else; I almost wish that I could do this procedure without telling anyone. Is anyone else going through this with their friends/loved ones?

2) I struggle with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. I self-medicate with food and am having trouble imagining a life where I can't do that. I'm medicated for the bipolar and am in intensive therapy for the BPD; my therapist/psychiatrist is at a point where he is supportive of my having surgery. Actually, my relative stability is one of the reasons why I'm feeling comfortable even considering surgery at this point in my life even though surgery had been suggested to me by two different professionals about 2-3 years ago. I'm worried that there is no way in hell I'll pass the psych eval. Does anyone here either have (diagnosed and treated/stabilized) bipolar or borderline personality disorders?

3) I'm afraid that I won't be able to handle all the changes that are going to be happening to me at once. I'm going to be doing my internship for my MA in Counseling, I'm applying to doctoral programs in Clinical Psych, and I'm in an intensive therapy for BPD which is emotionally exhausting. Will I mentally survive also going through a massive weight loss and all of the emotions that come with it in addition to doing all these other things in my professional life? How has the pre-op, the surgery and the post-op stuff been for you emotionally?"

Here’s the deal though: I’m a university student and I’m supposed to be doing work for classes. And I do, but last minute and do so in a very shitty fashion. In addition, I’m supposed to be working on my Python and Excel skills. I have a damn internship in the summer and I need to be completely confident with the prep work I was given. Also, I’m supposed to be committing 1 hour a day to learning Spanish. To top it off, I play college soccer and I need to be doing the offseason workout program: cardio and strength training. I’ve done exactly none of these tasks so far this year. Sure maybe one day I’ll piss around and get 30 minutes of python in. But I’m simply not doing the work. It’s not that I don’t enjoy these things because I do. Soccer and Spanish are two things I’m passionate about. Up until this semester I’ve always been a class work warrior. I’d put in long hours and do my best. And the excel stuff. That’s shit, but I know I want a good job and a stone to that reality is being successful this summer. 

One other thing I’m noticing. I set my alarm back like a bitch everyday. I got not will power, no strength, a very loser attitude. I’m desperate to break this cycle but I’m struggling to get my head right. Any advice would be appreciated.

Help!",coolest_alpaca,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/85gnmv/me_22f_with_my_boyfriend_22m_of_2_years_and_best/,"I am sorry, this might be a little bit incoherent and long. 

Me and my best friend (M) met 5 years ago. We were both studying abroad and we living with in the same house. We instantly clicked and pretty much a few months later became inseparable. After the year was over, she had to go home. People kept telling me that eventually we would lose touch but that wasn't the case. We pretty much facetimed every day, planned trips to see each other. She even moved back for a few months during her gap year. I have never had a connection like that with anyone. Once I had a rough week and she booked her flight immediately and came to see me the next day. A year later we went to two different universities but in the same city. Although we both lived in dorms, she pretty much spent all of her time at mine. People constantly teased us for being in a relationship. I wish I could put it into words how close we actually were. 

We did kiss a few times when we were drunk but we always said that it was just the alcohol. We pretty much travelled all around Europe whenever we could. Then on one of the trips, it escalated, and we ended up making out in the hotel room after we got back. I freaked out and pretty much didn't talk to her for a few weeks. 

However, we ended up moving in together for our second year of uni. In the meanwhile, I have always had a huge crush on D (my now boyfriend). I was stoked when we started dating. It was a little bit rocky in the beginning. 

One night when I was out with M and another friend who just recently came out. M confessed that she has feelings for me. I had no idea what to do in that situation as we were just one month into living together. I told her that I am in love with D. She told me that she is getting over her feelings anyway so let's just pretend it never happened. It was awkward. I felt very shitty. First of all because my best friend was hurting. Second of all because I couldn't talk to her the same way about D ever again. I just felt lost. Adding on to this, D and M never got along. 

A few months later I booked a trip for M's birthday. We were having a good time but she broke down and told me she can't take it anymore. She told me that she can't get over me and as soon as the year is over she needs to move out. We had a very long conversation filled with tears. I told her that this situation was hurting me as well, as it's putting a lot of strain on my relationship. I basically had periods when everything was fine with D but it was crap with M, or the other way around. I told her how sorry I am but D is actually a guy I can see myself with in the future. We agreed that I'd give M all the space she needs. 

I was devastated. I've never had a friend like M. I was lost. Suddenly, I didn't have anyone who'd understand me and support me like she did. Of course I have other great and amazing friends, but it's never been the same. On the other hand, M
my relationship with D was getting better and I was happy. 

When this academic year rolled around, M moved into my place for a short amount of time. Everything was great. I finally had my friend back, and my relationship was amazing. However, me and M had a fall out and didn't talk for a few months. I got over myself and reached out to her to apologise for how things were left and we met up a few weeks ago. 

Everything was the same. I feel the safest around her. I am truly myself in her company, and she makes me laugh. When she was gone I was craving the emotional closeness. 

Now onto the problem. I don't actually know if I have feelings for her. D and me are great together, but the closeness just about doesn't cut it for me. I can't help myself but compare them. I have so much love for D but he doesn't know me the way M does. M knows when I'm sad, upset or angry. She knows exactly what I need. She knows what to say to get me out of my bad mood. Also, I have never had conversations with anyone like I used to with M. Even after years of talking every day, we would stay up all night to discuss anything. We would analyse situations, debate ethical questions, talk about art, music or science. I know it sounds so corny and cheesy but if soulmates exist, she is mine. She is an amazing human being overall. 

D is great, too. I can talk to him about most of the things. I love spending time with him. The relationship has helped me grow so much. But I believe that because M was by my side during the adolescent years, she truly shaped me as a person. We always said that we ""grew up"" together, we made so many lasting memories together that we actually are so engrained in each other's personalities. Back to D, things with him are not so smooth. When we debate about things, it can get a little bit out of hand. Sometimes he can't let things go, he can't accept my opinion about certain things, disagrees with me and we can end up having a stupid fight about it. Sometimes it happens the other way around, too. I contemplated it a lot. It could be because M and I were just friends, and there was no pressure for us to have the same views etc. However, as D and I are thinking about long term things, we're both seeking more compatibility. 

Also, M and I used to have so much fun when going out. To this day, my most memorable nights were with her. We got up to so much. We did a lot of stupid and questionable things but they all made great memories. 
When D and I go out, we usually have fun but it's a different kind of fun. It has many times ended up with us fighting. When it's just the two of us going to the bar or having a bottle of wine at home, it's all fun and games. I love it. However, when we're with a group of friends, it's never as much fun. 


I briefly moved in with D over the summer. We were both doing internships in the same city so it made sense. It was so much different from living with M. Actually it was nothing like it. I missed having her around. 


So if you actually kept reading to this point, you might ask why the hell I'm still with D, and why I keep comparing the two of them. I know I shouldn't. I love him, he is a great guy. Smart, handsome, polite, nice and caring. Our sex life is great. He gets on with my parents. We are just not as close as I was with M. 

I always kept saying that I want a relationship like my friendship with M. I'm unsure if I was/am just a coward and maybe I'm bi, and the love I have for her is not just platonic. I did engage in making out, and once we almost went further but at the last minute I freaked out. 

I am confused. I miss the closeness. I really hoped that I could have that with D. Maybe we just need a little more time? I don't know. 
I miss M. I am lost. I don't know what to do. 

Has anyone had a strong connection like this with anyone? Can I go on and live my life that it's possible to be this close to someone and not have it ever again? Is it a once in a lifetime thing? 

**TL;DR** I miss the closeness I had with my best friend who turned out to be in love with me. Maybe I was in love too. I was hoping to have that closeness with my boyfriend. 


EDIT: It has been on my mind for so long. It felt really good to write it out. Also, let me just say that even though I'm not as close to D as I was to M, we're still pretty close. I know most of my friends don't even have this level of closeness with their SOs. He is an angel. We try really hard to get to know each other on every level possible. He makes a ton of effort to learn how to help me, support me or lift me up. I do the same. "

This was my income and expenses for the 2017 calendar year. I saw someone from the class of 2018 ask about budgeting for PGY-1, so thought I would post this from my actual data. I scrubbed some of the numbers to protect my identity, but some general info:

* The incomes are all gross incomes (i.e. pre-tax for those not financial-savvy), hence the ""taxes paid"" on the expenses end of the chart
* The loans is for the first half of 2017 when I was still a MS4
* I live in southern California, didn't spend much money on relocation
* Single, no dependents
* I share a 2 bedroom apartment with someone else
* Commute is 15-30 minutes (welcome to variability of SoCal traffic and distance to training sites)
* My program provides meal stipends
* I went on several vacations between Match Day and first day of intern year, hence the high travel expenses
* I drive a well-maintained sedan that gets 20-30 miles per gallon, that makes up the bulk of my transportation expenses
* Education includes step 3 fees

Edit: someone pointed out how I didn't make any repayments for my student loan. I filed my taxes in 2016, showing that I made $0 as a student. When it came time to start repaying my loans in 2017, my loan servicer saw that I made $0 in 2016 and said I had to make repayments of $0. Income-based repayment calculation always uses the tax documents from the year prior, so your monthly repayment is based on the previous year, i.e. PGY-1 repayments are based on MS4, PGY-2 repayments are based on PGY-1, etc. [Here's](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action) a calculator directly from the FAFSA website to help you recalculate how much you have to repay based on your loans.

I haven’t really written out my thoughts on this, so this will really help. I’m 23 right now, at 14 I started thinking I was bisexual. I come from a very religious background (nothing wrong with that, still religious, though in a different way)

I wasn’t out to anyone at all for a few years, didn’t think about my sexuality too much, and didn’t date at all. Around 16 I start to think I’m 100% gay, I honestly wasn’t as I was still attracted to women, but I did a good job of convincing myself I was. I felt that it had to be all or nothing, nothing in between (being bisexual) eventually came out to a couple of friends as gay. I don’t even talk to them anymore now. But that was it really. Mental health pretty much garbage at this point, did nothing to address it. VERY high levels of anxiety due to school. Only managed it by cheating, and I was a damn good cheater. This extended to college as well as the anxiety was too much, and stakes were too high to keep failing. 

Anyways, I start college and I’m back to being bi, at his point I haven’t dated anyone of any gender or had sex with anyone. I’m not out to anyone. 

My junior year of college I start coming out to some close people, including my now girlfriend. 

A few months later my parents find out. This happens because of 2 things: 1. they were very nosy, and tracked my phone all the time. 2 mental health state is dismal, it’s obvious something is up. I feel very violated, and still do, even though this happened 3 years ago. I’ve become a lot more private and closed off since, though I still do love my parents. I was mad especially since I haven’t had figured things out yet myself. And no, they weren’t approving of things, but didn’t hate me either. They thought it was a problem I had to get over. 

I eventually get an internship in San Francisco for the summer, I’m away from anyone I know, I figured now is the time to be adventurous. I have sex for the first time with a woman. Cool, great, and lots of fun.  I took this long as I was still in that religious mindset that sex=bad. 

A few weeks later I have sex with a man, and it’s just not what I thought. I liked certain parts of the sex, and I know sexuality can be fluid and all, but damn that shit really shook me and made me question everything. I haven’t been with a man since, but I’m definitely not attracted to men like I thought I was. I think if religion weren’t such a big deal, I would’ve sorted this out much earlier, as I would’ve dated/had sex with men and figured out it wasn’t my think much earlier. 

The thing is I’ve been tremendously depressed and anxious for the last 8 years, and that mental health state pretty much ruined life, including college. I fucking hated college, and wish I can do it over again. Ultimately most of my mental health issues and related issues (self harm/suicidal thoughts) I’ve faced were attributed to my false sexuality. A little bit to academics related anxiety as well. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, but I’ve grown a lot since I graduated 6 months ago, and I’m coming to terms with things, and I’m happy as I feel that life is just getting started, but I still have a lot of trouble accepting that I went through all of that shit for nothing? 

I don’t know what I want really, support or any advice or similar stories would greatly help. "

I also got a really nice financial offer from the University of Arizona, where I'll have only $22,000 in federal loans to pay off. However, I really would like to attend Stevens. I can't see myself growing in Arizona, and I feel like the internships, connections, and job opportunities I'll receive from going to Stevens is invaluable. I'd like to hear all of your opinions. I also did ask the financial aid office if they could give me extra aid, so I'd like to know if that actually works."

(Or, how I might need to leave university thanks to bulimia)",crumpet9,proED,https://www.reddit.com/r/proED/comments/85j0ws/when_the_consequences_of_having_your_ed_become/,"Today I am supposed to be doing a presentation for my senior thesis. This presentation is important, and worth 20% of my grade. But, I'm not doing it.

Bulimia has taken everything from me. It ruined and ended my relationship with a man I loved. It's made me resent friends and family for innocent comments and - God forbid - wanting to eat and hang out with me. My hobbies are gone. I look at pictures of myself with friends and all I remember is what I ate that day. I've had binge/purge sessions that make me lose days - vomiting is the only thing I do and I spend it disoriented and not doing anything productive. About a month and a half ago I overdosed on laxatives. Woke up sweating, vomiting, I actually was convinced I would die that night. &amp; yet I bought a brand new pack just the other day. I'm going into debt buying binge food, and then expensive restriction food to compensate. 

Last semester I reached attendance failures in every single one of my courses because my body dysmorphia would get so bad I felt like I couldn't leave my apartment, because I couldn't bear the thought of people seeing how fat and ugly I am.

And yet, that's all been fine. I've dealt with it. Until now. This is real now. I am fucking up and it's because of this disease. I am supposed to be graduating in May. I'm not. I'm supposed to be doing a summer internship. I'm not. I should be getting prepared for my presentation today, on a topic I am hugely passionate about. I'm not. I've never romanticised my disorder. I chose it so I've always felt guilt over it, but I've never romanticised it. But I've ignored every problem it's caused me. But now I cannot. I need to call my parents this week and tell them I probably need to do a medical leave. I had to email my advisor this morning and tell her that I will not be doing my presentation, and that could we meet so I can discuss my options?

And the most terrifying thing about this? Is that I still don't want to give it up. The first thing I did today after class was go to the store and buy ice cream to b/p. Forcing myself to vomit is not self care. It's not sustainable. I am lucky enough that I have yet to face health issues from this. But this disease wants me dead. I don't know if I'm ready for recovery. I don't think I'm fully prepared to lose all of this. But I'm ready for it to stop controlling my life. Bulimia is currently in control of me and I'm finally angry. Angry at who I've become, at every new low I've reached. I don't know where to go from here, I really don't. But for now I'm still here, and I think that's what matters. My ED has destroyed years of my life, but maybe it doesn't have to take it.

Thanks if anyone read this. Between here and Peach I feel so fortunate I have a safe space to vent this. Sometimes I feel like I'm living a double life."
85jjph,34,2018-03-19,Big addict checking in. This post is for accountability and addressing my faults.,bomicbon,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/85jjph/big_addict_checking_in_this_post_is_for/,"Hello everyone. M/23 here. I've been suffering from a myriad of maladies and developed horrible coping mechanisms for dealing with my shortcomings. First of all, I want to thank you if you're reading what I have to say. There are a bunch of toolfaces like me who pop in and out of this Reddit and struggle with sticking to the convictions of their higher self. It means a lot to me for being able to share my story to the only community that a guy like me can reach out to for something like this without shame, guilt, or judgment. Where can you find a place like that these days?   


Through a humbling experience in a tutor session with a high school frosh that wanted to learn React and Node with me, I began to experience a radical shift in my self-perception. I am bald without right eyebrow(alopecia), overweight by at least 100lbs, and play PC games and PMO for more hours than my part time job for each. I have an indulgent hedonistic attitude that instructs me to gorge far beyond what would generally be socially acceptable. And deep inside, I realized there is a really hurt dude that isn't being taken care of properly. A little guy that's being neglected by all of his more successful friends. A little guy that's being dismissed by femalekind as someone who's eye contact even would be deemed offensive and denigrating. A little guy that's invisible to all the companies posting internships and entry positions for new grads. Living in a mental space where I feel insignificant and inferior on a daily basis since my 6th grade crush laughed at me for asking her to the dance drained my livelihood like a toxic undergrowth for the large part of my life.    


From time to time, however, there is a small voice in my head that occasionally addresses my condition and situation with discontentment and tries to figure out what I can do better, and I try to diagnose the problem everytime. I read about autoimmune illnesses being majorly caused by wheat-based diets. I have tried multiple times to abstain from PMO since I was 14, but the longest I've ever went without PMO since age 10 was 7 days. I learned about how high carb diets keep ramping up leptin and prevent your body from activating glucagon, the fat burn hormone. I wasn't able to find a programming job after obtaining my CS degree, so I studied and earned an OCA (Java) last month. I also read a lot about fasting and did a 10-day myself and saw improvements in my autoimmune illness and fat loss.    

And now I basically want to start my NoFap by declaring this one concept that I've failed to acknowledge all my life: My failures weren't losses.  Believe me when I say this, there are times when I feel so cold in this dark and isolated world that I felt everything I've been through up to this point was absolutely pointless and that I should just throw the rest of my life into a casket, because it didn't look like things would get better. But each time you fail, it really is like having another tool or morsel of knowledge under your belt. And once you are aware of every fail-case, you become a master of troubleshooting. I will always remember Dostoevsky saying something like, ""I'll be damned if my sufferings go unredeemed."" Simplified sorry. But that is exactly the kernel or the catalyst for improvement for me at this particular moment. My life has been psychological torture to be curt, and I'll be damned if I don't at least help someone else who may be in a position that I have been in, because I don't want anymore of the kids, who should make up the bright minds and personalities to populate our futures, to experience such an abysmal and dismal young adulthood. Sometimes I tutor really young kids, and they're so happy it's almost like staring at the sun for me, but I honestly would never want that smile to go away for any kid. 


So if you're a kid out there who's going through puberty and going through teenage depression, I hope you are able to find an adult or a close friend you can talk to about the root of your inner sadness or anger or frustration. Whatever it is you're feeling. If it was that girl that rejected you or a bad test grade, please just connect with someone and don't isolate yourself and get lonely. I just wanted to say this, because I definitely peeped this subreddit 10 yrs ago in high school, and I wasn't particularly compelled by anyone's backstory at the time and the ""I fucked my wife way better"" stories. I couldn't relate to anybody here getting pussy after 3 days and already having girls leap and claw at them. Get the hell out of here.   



This post is really for my 13 year old self. What I wish he would've read before his habits would seize his life and mutate into other habits. I was such a happy and funny kid. I was a class clown. My friends would bike to my house and ring my doorbell on Saturday to see if I was free to hang out. But I took rejection from girls very seriously, and it formed like quicksand in my self-esteem  for years onwards. I kind of also want to say to him: you may not be able to fix it now, but you will be strong enough one day to champion your inner demons. You will be sick of getting what you want but not what you need. You're gonna need a real job. Real hair. A real body. A real life. Not one in digital servitudes of image boards and PC games.   



So to actually conclude and state my intents for this thing. I'm also fasted 1 day rn. And 2 days NoFap. With the withdrawal symptoms of a crackfiend, I've had a mind-splitting migraine for 36 hrs and not one blink of sleep by now. But I intend to fast for more than my previous 10 day streak and go cold turkey NoFap for 90 days. To replace my huge time investment in PMO and PC games, I'm going to make it my personal goal to walk 5 miles a day. I could walk to the gym instead of drive there. Get sun exposure and actually get an earnest sleep schedule. I'm not gonna log the digital flair thing. I plan on just spring cleaning my lifestyle and hopefully it'll be June or July and I'll just realize how long it's been at that time. Thanks again for reading. I truly appreciate having this space online to vent especially since I have no friends. "

85l8pd,6,2018-03-19,[Residency] Questions about AOA Recognition for ACGME intern Year,twogreendocs,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/85l8pd/residency_questions_about_aoa_recognition_for/,"I tried to google and search for this topic, but I didn't find anything concrete. I'm a D.O. grad who matched at an ACGME program into a specialty requiring a prelim year. For most states it doesn't really matter, but for family reasons I'm doing my prelim year in NY, and my advanced specialty in PA.

PA is one of few states that requires AOA recognition of your ACGME training in order to be licensed. I'm just not sure how this process works, and if there are specific rotation requirements that I need to try and ask for.

For example, the [AOA website states that they will compare the rotations of my prelim year against those of a ""traditional rotating internship or the AOA's OGME-1 specialty""](http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/Education/postdoctoral-training/Pages/recognition-of-pgy1-year.aspx). 

Here are my questions:

1. With the merger coming up, do I need to worry about this at all?
2. Are they comparing my prelim rotations against the OGME1 year listed for my advanced specialty, the TRI or will either one work? I ask because the requirements are vastly different. The only difference between the TRI and my intern schedule is 1 month of EM, and 1 month family medicine, while the OGME1 requirements for my subspecialty are much different (more specialty electives, some surgery etc.). [Here's the list of OGME1 requirements by specialty.](http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/Education/postdoctoral-training/Documents/Curriculum%20for%20Approved%20OGME%201st%20year%20of%20training.pdf)
3. How strict is the comparison? If my current prelim only allows for 2 weeks of EM, but the AOA requires 4, will it get rejected? 
4. If the AOA doesn't approve my ACGME year, will I be able to complete my residency in PA (assuming I decide not to practice there after residency)?

Hopefully someone has gone through this and can share their experience. Thanks!"
85lchh,1,2018-03-19,I [M/21] am feeling held back by my girlfriend [F/23],Throwerfromber,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/85lchh/i_m21_am_feeling_held_back_by_my_girlfriend_f23/,"I have been seeing this girl for over 2 years and we have had several big disagreements and arguments throughout our relationship but we are still together and love each other. 

I'm currently studying abroad and she decided to take an internship in the same city that I am studying in so she can be with me. 

I live in a large student accommodation building and she lives on the other side of the city with a family but she's easy to get to. I tend to be more outgoing than my girlfriend and enjoy drinking with people and talking all night, she prefers to stay in and watch movies. 

My student accommodation is very lively and I've made some great friends here. People from all over the world are here and it's great to talk to them and learn about their lives and countries. Most evenings, I would spend the night talking to people in a friend's room and having a few drinks. I would usually get back at about 12 and since my girlfriend works during the day she gets upset with me and tells me I should be spending more time with her. I like spending time with her but whenever I know my friends are somewhere in the accomodation having a good time I want to be there too. 

I think it will become a big problem because my girlfriend thinks I spend too much time with them. Back home, I could understand this argument but now I feel like: ""I'm on exchange so I should make the most of every second of it and do my own thing"". I'm aware that that's selfish but I think relationships should be something to enhance your life, not hold it back. I've tried to bring my girlfriend along when I could convince her but she doesn't enjoy it too much and always wants to leave early. It's getting worrying for me because I'm starting to dread telling her that I want to hang out with people because she feels that I do it too much and it invariably turns into an argument. 

I told her about the whole ""I'm on exchange"" argument I mentioned before and she said it's not fair to her because I'm not spending time with her alone enough. (Even though I feel like I do). She brings up how she came here to work to be with me. I know this sounds ungrateful and mean, but I never asked her to come, she just decided to so I don't feel like that's a fair argument. 

I understand that an SO is a different kind of relationship to a friend but what's worrying me is that I'm limiting my enjoyment of the exchange to please someone who's increasingly frustrating me. 

As I typed this out and saw what I wrote, I just feel like I'm being selfish but I feel frustrated and whenever I discuss it with my girlfriend I feel that we both want/expect completely different things. I'm feeling held back. What should I do? 

TL;DR: 

GF came to same city as me on a foreign exchange. She feels I don't spend enough time with her but I feel like I do. It's causing frustration and tension in the relationship. I'm feeling held back, what should I do?"

A bit of background before I get to what brings me here. I'm about to be graduating this coming May with a CS degree. Ive been a b-/b student through college, and have always struggled with concentration/focus issues. I've always found it difficult to focus on one job at a time, and just assumed it was a part of the way my brain worked. It's never massively negatively effected my studies (other than just making everything take forever) or my work, although I did struggle with this at my internship this past summer. Additionally, I also struggle with learning new technologies (I'm attempting to learn web stuff right now) but never wind up becoming proficient because I find it difficult to focus and retain things. The same goes for completing personal projects. I'll start off very motivated, but quickly lose motivation and become distracted. To this date I haven't actually finished a personal project that I've started. 

Just recently though I spoke with a friend and fellow CS major who was in much the same position as me. He wound up being diagnosed with adult ADHD and is now on medicine and has drastically turned himself around. Then earlier today I discovered this sub and saw a post by someone whose story sounded almost identical to my friend's and what I've been struggling with. This, of course, made me realize that maybe this isn't ""just how my brain works"".

So I called my mother on my lunch break to get her input, and while she thinks it would be a good idea to at least see someone she also gave me her usual speech about how this might be caused by technology and (insert daytime talk show here) did a segment on it. But she was still supportive of me talking to someone.

I think I do want to give it a shot (and will also wind up talking about my anxiety issues as well if I do make this appointment) but Im also nervous about it. If I do wind up needing medication (which I'm open to) I don't particularly like the idea of it potentially messing with my relationship via side effects that screw with my body in other ways. I haven't had the chance to do tons of research into medication yet, but I know I've heard of that happening, specifically with sex drive.

I figured I may be able to get more input here so... Here I am! Apologies for the probably rambling nature of this post--I'm on mobile and writing before I have class. I'd love to hear from people who HAVE gotten on medication and how it affected you aside from helping (and also how much it helped). Should I consider options other than medication if that's what I wind up being presented with? "

{1/17}: Your friend passes you the freshly rolled blunt he just spent the last three minutes rolling. As you spark the blunt, its piney aroma makes your nose tingle and your throat burn. You look off your balcony, taking in the beautiful view. A couple hits later, you look back at the same view; yeah you're high as tits. After passing the blunt back to your friend, you feel your phone vibrate and pull it out of your pocket. New email? Eh, probably spam. *opens Mail app*        
**Sender: Company X**      
**Subject: Drug and Background Test**        
Your hands immediately start sweating. Holy shit, your summer internship wasn't supposed to email you about pre-employment stuff till quite a bit closer to your start date in May. ""Please take the required **HAIR** drug test AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."" Oh man. Ohhhhhh man you're so cucked. You're so absolutely cucked. You tell your friend you're about to be hair drug tested and he starts laughing, ""You're fucking with me bruv, you'd fail that shit so hard."" As he gives you this encouraging sentiment, he passes you the blunt. Well you're fucked anyway, might as well finish this blunt right?    
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  
So at this point, I put in some work. First thing I needed was time. It’s January 17th. I checked the date of the drug test order and saw it expired February 1st. Hahahahaha looks like I'm takin this bitch on the 31st. Now I need a game plan. Catch me on literally every single drug test related website, trying to understand everything from the ELISA process (standard hair testing procedure) to the science behind the alleged detox methods. I surfed various shopping websites, scouting the ""catch all, always works"" Old Formula Aloe Toxin Rid. Hell nah I wasn't about to drop $250 for this bullshit, there has to be another way. I started looking on reddit and very quickly found a post detailing the ""Macujco"" Method. I'll go more into this later but essentially, the OP briefly mentioned the science behind this   method, and at the time, I figured it was solid; upon further research though, I realized that his reasoning was backwards and as a result, I now question this method's effectiveness. I then found my holy grail, the very reason I believe I was able to pass this hair test: **the JerryG method**. I began to write out a timeline, which involved a combination of both the JerryG and Macujco Methods. I'll get into all of that in a bit; first some science and shit.  
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  
Real quick, I just wanna say that while I did a good amount of research on all of this, please feel free to correct anything as you see fit. I know this is gonna end up being pretty long but I’m making this post in hopes that it’ll consolidate a lot of the info I spent hours     surfing the web for; the idea is that someone who reads this post can feel confident about the accuracy and the extensiveness of the information provided here.    
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  
Ah, so you snurfed some doobs. What happens now? I’m not a scientist so this is severely paraphrased but basically the shit ends up in your bloodstream and gets deposited all over your body, from your hair to your nails to even your fucking bone marrow. Yeah. You     ever heard of spine testing? I hope you haven’t because you’d fail the flying shit out of that. Now let’s look at a strand of hair in particular. The outer layer of your hair, known as the cuticle, is made up of a bunch of scales that can open and close. This is a key aspect of both the JerryG and Macujco Method, since both of them use different processes to achieve the same thing: open the cuticle to get to the center of the hair, where metabolites are stored. Now past the cuticle is hard keratin, which gives your hair its structure, and past     that is the money spot: [the hair cortex](http://www.hennaforhair.com/gray/graying1.html). When you intake THC, your blood deposits it as a THC-COOH metabolite in the   cortex of your hair follicle - the follicle refers to the hair when it’s still    in your scalp AKA not grown out yet. From there, it can take       anywhere from 5-14 days for the actual strand of hair to pop out of your scalp. So theoretically, you can smoke and pass a hair test if you take it before any new hair growth occurs, but the window of opportunity varies for everyone. Anyway, once the THC-COOH is in the cortex, it can deeply embed itself in your hair by binding with melanin. This is the reason why people with thicker, darker hair have a much harder time ridding their hair of THC-COOH. Thicker = more difficult to get past the cuticle and into the cortex &amp; darker =   more melanin and gives the THC-COOH a lot more to hold on to. Hair on your head grows on average .5” per month, which is where the detection estimate of 90 days comes from (required 1.5” of hair = 3 months). Also, body hair grows a SHIT TON slower than that and   thus can detect usage for a longer time span. **SO PLEASE DON’T SHAVE YOUR FUCKING HEAD.**        
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  
**Info on me:**      
Male. 6’0~6’1. Very fast metabolism. Active Lifestyle. 165~170lb. Extremely attractive (haha jk, but like not really though). South Asian = black, hella thick coarse hair. Religiously used dabs through fall 2017 up until December, then smoked at least a blunt daily all     through December and until mid January. So for a 90 day detection window, safe to say my hair was fucked.      
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  
**The Actual Test:**      
Now depending on what agency does the test, there are slight deviances in the process but it’s all essentially the same. They take 100-120 strands of hair (a pinch sized clump) using safety scissors, snipping flush to your scalp on the crown of your head. In my experience, she took all the hair from one spot but I’ve heard that sometimes they do three spots, evenly spaced on the crown of your head. From there, they take your hair to the lab, wash it, and dissolve that bitch. The washing prior is the reason why masking agents usually won’t work, not to mention that some places actually automatically fail you if they find a masking agent in your hair. Once dissolved, they perform an initial screen then a confirmation test: the first screen looks for the THC-COOH metabolite on a 1pg/1mg level.   That means per 1 milligram of hair, which is ~ 2 strands of hair, if you have any more than 1 picogram (that’s 10^-12 grams…...negative FUCKING TWELVE…..so a good 9 orders of   magnitude smaller than a mg), you’d fail the initial screen, and then your hair would be confirm tested for THC on an even smaller scope of 0.1pg/1mg. Pass the first one though and BOOM done, you’re clear.    
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  
**Methods**    
Now for the fun stuff. For these methods, note that their success depends on how much THC you can scrub away/destroy from your hair, so be very liberal with soaking and massaging that shit in your hair, from the tip to the root.    
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  
**Macujco:**  
*Things to Note*: From what I’ve seen, most people that passed with this method were very light users that probably would’ve passed anyway. The hair test is designed to find mid to heavy usage, and it’s common for light smokers who are paranoid to use this method and attribute their test success to it, while in reality, it probably didn’t make that much of a difference. There are accounts of heavy users that have passed with this method but I personally wouldn’t bet on it. However, if you choose to acquire the old Aloe Rid Detox Formula, you’ll probably pass regardless of how much you’ve smoked. The formula is part of the [original Macujco Method](https://weedinmypocket.com/macujo-method-pass-hair-follicle-drug-test-guaranteed/) and hella people online swear by that thing. I personally didn’t drop $250 and used a substitute process so I can’t speak to its success; the steps below assume you didn’t get the formula.      
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
1)*White Vinegar/Apple Cider Vinegar* (soak for 30 min) - supposed to open the scales on your cuticle, making it easier to access the cortex.        
2)*Clean and Clear Astringent with salicylic acid* (soak in shower cap for 30 min) - supposed to permeate the cortex and destroy THC. Make sure to massage immensely. Put a shower cap on once done massaging and keep soaked.       
3)*Tide* (wash out the acid &amp; vinegar and soak in Tide for an hour) - THC-COOH is water soluble and after using the acid, the metabolites should be exposed and detached from your hair, making   the Tide more effective. The original post I read said to make sure to   get Tide Original and that’s what I used, but I feel like Tide Bleach would be more effective for reasons stated below.       
4)*Conditioner* (wash out everything and soak in shower cap for 10 min). Now the conditioner won’t do much for the THC but it should make sure your hair doesn’t feel like plastic...just polyester :)      
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp; 
Now the reason I’m not sure about this method is because initially, the reasoning for the order of the steps was that acids, like vinegar, open the “scales” on your cuticle while bases, like detergent, close them. More research showed that bases actually open the scales while acids close them. For this reason, I used both the Macujco and Reverse Macujco Methods (3,2,1,4). That’s also the reason why I think Tide with Bleach would be more effective, because bleach is a base and would further help open the cuticle.      
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**JerryG**    
 Essentially the point is to damage your hair so much that the THC is destroyed. The process is pretty straightforward: bleach and redye your hair 3x. I did it a little different but that’s the basis. The method WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU STOP SMOKING. The first round of bleach/redye should be done either on or after the last day of smoking, while the last round should be done as close to the test day as possible. The span between the first bleach and the last bleach should be AT LEAST TWO weeks. That way, if any new hair growth occurs after those two weeks, you’ve stopped smoking long enough for it to be clean.    
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;   
*Things to Note*: shit fucks your hair yo. Use hella conditioner/ post treatment restorative masks after each round to make sure your hair isn’t royally fucked, just kinda fucked. [DATA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9228567) has shown that the first round of bleaching reduces metabolites by 30-60%, and each successive bleach is even more effective than the last because the hair is already damaged, leaving the cortex more accessible. 
&amp;nbsp;      
&amp;nbsp;  
**Timeline:**  
**(1/17):** Last Day Smoking      
**(1/18):** Macujco       
**(1/21):** Reverse Macujco      
**(1/24):** Bleach w 30 Vol Developer for an hour. Rinse. Hair was cheeto orange at this point. Bleach w 30 Vol Developer for 45 min. Shit almost brought me to tears because it burned so bad. Hair became very light yellow. I had to bleach twice for this step because I wanted grey hair but my hair didn’t get light enough to dye. If you’re planning on redyeing black though, you won’t have to bleach twice.        
**(1/27):** Dyed hair grey. It was fucking live, I felt like an anime   character. I waited a couple days to dye because my scalp was sensitive as shit after the bleaching. If you want to be as effective as possible, use ammonia-based dye (it’s a base).        
**(1/28):** Macujco Varied [for steps 1 and 2, instead of doing massage then soak for 30 min, I massaged then soaked for 20 min, repeating for an hour. For example, step 1 took an hour, where every 20 minutes, I massaged more vinegar in my hair and repeated this 3x.     Repeat for step 2. Step 3 stayed the same but for step 4 I left the conditioner/restorative mask in for 30 min. Hair became hella soft]        
**(1/29):** Got a haircut, thinned out the top and cut it to ~1.5” . Skin   faded the sides so the hair sample would have to come from up top. That night, bleach w 30 Vol for 30 minutes. Rinsed out with Clean &amp; Clear Astringent. This was me being intuitive. Well, something like   that. Bleach should damage and open the cuticle while the acid should destroy THC and close the cuticle.          
**(1/30):** Part A - Milk of magnesia and Baking Soda paste. Extremely basic and fucks your cuticle.**Looking back, I would not do part A.** Due to how damaged my hair already was, this step was me looking at my hair’s threshold and giving it a big ol’ fuck you. After this paste, some of my hair became weak enough to literally pull out with no pain. No doubt this works for opening your cuticle, so if you want to, you could use this paste way earlier in the process and it   wouldn’t be nearly as detrimental. You could even combine it with the Reverse Macujo as a replacement for the Tide. I’d just stay away though because I found this paste on a random forum and only did it because the test was the next day and I was desperate and paranoid.          
Anyway, I washed out the mixture with Tide and when I looked at my hands, covered in hair, I realized oh shit, this probably wasn’t a good idea and I should probably stop. Mama ain’t raise no bitch though and my hair was still a blueish grey, so I had to keep going. Bleached for an hour. Rinse. Massaged Clean &amp; Clear into hair. Rinse. Dyed hair brown~black. I didn’t go full black because apparently that look unnatural because natural black hair is slightly tinted. I also shaved everything nose down. LITERALLY EVERYTHING. Just in case.          
**(1/31):** Day of the Test: I didn’t do any cleansing this day. I used another hair restorative conditioning mask for like an hour. At this point, there was an small patch on my head that hair had fallen out of (wtf right lol), and I needed to make sure the tester wouldn’t see it. So I used some pomade and styled my hair to cover it up. What a time. The actual test was super easy and straightforward. I tried to make small talk by asking procedural stuff about the test even though I already knew the answers. She didn’t say anything about my hair, which was more brown than black at this point. The only remark she made was when she cut it and looked at the roots. “Hmmm, your hair is yellow at its roots.” I just kinda laughed along and she said “Whatever, it doesn’t matter.” She cut the hair from a little below and to the right of my scalp, an area I focused my treatments on, so I felt pretty good after.        
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp; 
**Things to Remember**    
No news is good news. If you don’t hear back after like two weeks, you passed. Companies expect you to pass and thus will only contact you if you fail. I got an email form the lab telling me my results were ready to view after a week, but ignorance is bliss and I chose to not view the results at the time, continuing to believe I passed. After not hearing back after a month, I was 95% sure I passed but I didn’t wanna make this post till I was completely sure. The other day, I received a Welcome email with first day information so I’m now SURE I passed &amp; here we are.       
After my test, I decided to cut my hair because I wasn’t trynna look like Patchy the Pirate so I got a bald fade. Now, it’s been a month and a half and my hair has been growing in very well and evenly. Hair is no longer weak and doesn’t rip out. No permanent damage has been noted. I had dandruff and pieces of my scalp were falling out for like a week and a half after but it quickly subsided with some Head &amp; Shoulders. AND NOW IMMA GET PAID. All in all, I gotta say it was worth. My life would’ve been seriously fucked if I failed that test. Dealing with the shitstorm that would’ve occurred with my parents while also trying to find another internship in the next two months…..ooooo man oh man. Anyway, I hope this was an entertaining read and helps anyone in the same situation. Don’t lose hope my fellow ents! Lose hair instead. 
&amp;nbsp; 
&amp;nbsp;
     
**TLDR:** bleached my hair 4x and passed my hair drug test only two weeks clean. hair lowkey started falling out but we're chillin now.    "

He interviewed for a full-time position at the same company. It's a big company with a lot of locations. After 3 months of dating, he moved back to his home state awaiting for the decision, and we started doing LDR. He said he would definitely choose my city if he had the choice. One month after that (4 months of dating), he told me that the company only offered him the position at a branch on the opposite side of the country. It broke my heart, but we decided to keep doing the LDR and I'll move to him in 1.5 years after I graduate.

Today, after 9 months of dating, he told me that the company gave him a choice to stay in my city. But he chose the other branch because he believed that it was a better move for his career. He didn't want to tell me then because he was afraid I was going to break up with him. It's been bothering him (5 months later!!!) and he wants to be honest, so he told me.

I feel lied to/hurt/betrayed/disappointed/lost. It was a near-perfect relationship. We've been very happy and compatible. And up until today, I thought he was the best thing that's ever happened to me. I don't know what to do. Is it worth it to break up over this? I feel that the part that bothers me most is the lying and manipulating. If he honestly told me the situation, I probably would've done what's best for his career anyway.

This was the question for the first interview. I thought it was a filtering question because it seemed easy, but the interviewer kept asking me how I could make it faster, and I panicked because I saw no possible way of doing that. Here it is:



You are given two 2D matrices A and B containing random integers. You have to ""apply"" matrix A (think [Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_\(image_processing\))) to B and return a new matrix C, i.e. for each cell in B, the cell at the same position in C should be the result of ""applying"" A to the cell in B. ""Applying"" A to a cell means aligning the center of A with the cell, multiplying all of A's values with the values around the cell (including the cell itself) and then adding up all the products.



After clarifying questions such as what should be done if A is bigger than the surroundings of a cell in B (think the case of B[0][0]) (if A is bigger then the overflowing cells should be ignored), and if A is always smaller than B (it is), I proceeded to code a solution, which was O(|A|*|B|) in time and O(|B|) in space.  I did it fairly quickly, probably in 15 or 20 mins, and after that the interviewer said it was ok, but wanted to know how I could make it faster.

Algorithmically I had no clue, so I just mentioned some small optimizations here and there, but ultimately nothing that could significantly lower the original time and space complexities. Has anyone got a similar question? I've thought about it a lot and literally have no clue how it could be more efficient."

The accounting program at my school requires you to get a master's and take the CPA exam. I'm also considering getting a bachelor of science in statistics in addition to the accounting master's.

I don't think I want to be an accountant necessarily. However, I'm interested in business and accounting is said to be ""the language of business,"" and it's the most competitive business program at my university, so I think I'll stick with this degree, especially since I've already sunk some time into it. I don't really know what I wanna do after I graduate though, and statistics seems really useful, especially with big data becoming increasingly important. I'm in my second stats class and not only is the material useful, but I find it interesting.

I spoke with the stats advisor and it seems that I'll be able to graduate at the same time as I was expecting as long as I take classes over the summer. She also told me that there are some computer programming requirements within the statistics degree, another super useful field that I'm interested in; I've taken an intro computer science course and liked it.

So, with all this context, does anyone have some advice for me about whether I should pursue the double major or not? I couldn't find any similar situations with my online searches, so hopefully someone here can help. Here are some other questions I have:

Will employers think the two fields are incompatible/not useful together?

Will taking classes every summer make it difficult to find internships?

I would be doing an ""applied track"" for stats, meaning I won't get as much exposure to calculus or other general math courses, and more focus is on specific stats courses. Should this factor in to my decision at all?

Another option I've considered is a minor in computer science. A major is pretty much out of the question for my situation, but would a minor in CS be better than the major in stats? I'm sure CS would be more desirable to employers, but does the ""minor vs major"" difference give stats the edge?


Any and all advice would be appreciated."

Help me touch up my letter to the campus police chief to request permission to carry on campus.,xMEDICx,CCW,https://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/85o89v/got_my_dc_ccw_permit_help_me_touch_up_my_letter/,"Before you tell me its not worth it, I'm interested to see their reaction and to start a conversation on campus about campus carry. I'd like to start with the best-written letter I possibly can to the police chief. This is what the Firearms policy says must be done to request an exemption. Please, any criticisms and suggestions are very welcome!

****

Dear Chief,

I am requesting an exception to the Firearms and Weapons policy currently in effect at UNIVERSITY to carry my concealed firearm because I have good reason to fear injury to my person. My reasons include two attempted muggings while commuting around the campus on my bike, having bike parts stolen from me while in class during broad daylight, and being in terrifyingly close proximity to one of the many armed / attempted armed robberies in LOCATION OF CAMPUS —last year’s attempted robbery of RESTAURANT IN DORM.

Since leaving CATHOLIC SEMINARY and moving to Washington D.C. in January two years ago, I joined the RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION, where I have made numerous close friendships which will last for the rest of my life. I also helped create and found my own political activism organization on campus—ORGANIZATION. I’ve had internships on Capitol Hill, with SENATOR’s PAC, the PRO LIFE LOBBY, and BEST FIREARM LOBBY. Now I have moved to Arlington Virginia where I live in an area with a lower crime rate and more practical support for my right to self-defense than LOCATION OF CAMPUS. I still maintain active membership and leadership in these organizations while attending class. In my time at UNIVERSITY I have never been in any trouble with the school and have always obeyed and respected both the law and the UNIVERSITY police department. I respect your desire to protect and serve our diverse campus, especially in your work to help prevent sexual assault and create an open and welcoming community for students.

I feel that the training I received during the mandatory sixteen-hour DC Concealed Carry training classroom time and during the mandatory two hours of supervised range live-fire training I received has provided me with the skills required to be safe carrying a concealed firearm on campus. Before moving to Washington DC, I also obtained sixteen hours of Missouri-state mandated firearms training. I would be happy to provide documentation of all training, in addition to providing my DC Firearms Registration Card and DC Concealed Carry Permit. I have hundreds of hours of concealed carry time and time hunting in which I have learned to carry my firearm safely and responsibly at all times. Further, I have never had a negligent discharge or caused any unsafe situation with my firearm. I continue to practice and train with my firearm several times a month, of which I can provide documentation going forward as well.

In closing, I feel that my service in my church community at the RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION in addition to my peaceful leadership of POLITICAL ACTIVISM ORGANIZATION serves as testament to my good character and responsibility. I take gun ownership very seriously and will of course only use one in a defensive situation if it is the absolute last resort. Accordingly I hope that you will see fit to grant me permission to carry my legal and licensed firearm.

Respectfully,

xMEDICx

Last year, as a college senior, I was sitting on a couple of acceptances to MD programs. I had worked extremely hard, sacrificing sleep, fun, etc. to get the grades, the MCAT, the ECs, and the research experience necessary. You'd think that I'd be as happy as a clam, soaking up the last couple of months of school, and stoked about going to medical school, right?

Wrong.

I was actually dreading the prospect of going to medical school. I was terrified about the nature of the first two years (memorization was never my strong suit...I killed the MCAT but only because I was good at logical thinking and knew scientific principles), terrified that Step 1 would be a memorization-fest that I wouldn't do well with, terrified about the sleep deprivation that would occur in 3rd year and residency, terrified at the $250k+ debt (I didn't get into my state school but did get into an OOS public) I would have to take. I was terrified that I would have no life, that I wouldn't have the time to date, get married, have a family. I was burnt out from undergrad and was barely showing up to classes. I trudged through my honors thesis without any enthusiasm, and was regretting everything I did, or more accurately, didn't do, in college, all because I was so single-mindedly focused on the goal of becoming a doctor.

But why, you might ask, would I have ever thought of becoming a doctor, in light of this? Shouldn't I have picked a different path from the start?

I'll tell you the answer: It was because of, literally, an anxiety disorder so severe that I thought that being a doctor (or healthcare professional in general, but I wanted to be the top dog and knew I had the brains to do the job) was the only way that I could be free from any worry of losing my job because of an economic downturn or due to lack of demand. I was so anxiety-ridden that I lacked the confidence that I could hack it in a scientific career, which I began to take an interest in when I did a research internship at a cancer center the summer before my senior year of high school (I was dead-set on clinical medicine before that and afterwards said ""I like research better but the career path is too risky""). It was also because I confused my interest in medical *science* with medical *practice*, and thought that interest in one will cause me to tolerate the other.

You see, I went to high school during the worst of the recession. I witnessed through hearing stories of my classmates' parents, how even people with ""good"" careers like programmers, web developers, accountants, bankers, teachers, and engineers were thrown into unemployment through no fault of their own. These were the so-called ""knowledge"" workers that political figures claim are desperately in shortage - and yet they were in fact in excess! Throughout all of this, I never heard of a single doctor or nurse being laid off. I myself came from a poor family (I got FAP for my AMCAS apps). Being the curious person I am, I checked employment statistics. The anecdotes fit the data - healthcare was still in high demand while engineering, science, education, banking, finance, and CS were facing periods of instability, go through periods of gluts, and workers, especially in CS and engineering, face age discrimination starting from age 45-50. I knew even then, that the common pre-med trope ""you can make money easier in other fields"" was a bunch of bullshit. This solidified my decision to do medicine.

This was corroborated in college when I worked in research labs, partly out of interest, and partly to get into medical school. The graduate students (chemistry) often complained about the horrible job market, how there are too few jobs for academia but industry doesn't want them, how people shouldn't do PhDs. I didn't need much convincing - as horrible as being a doctor in the modern era sounded (and I knew about all the drawbacks since high school), nothing could be worse than being unemployed or unemployable.

But I had an epiphany that summer, after I graduated, which had a lot of help from my extended family, who was always against my going to medical school. I knew that if all else being equal, I would prefer doing medical/pharmaceutical research or teaching (at the college level or higher) over clinical medicine. I knew that I could easily get into a PhD program. But it was only then that I realized that going into medicine just because of a fear of job loss and a fear of recession are not good reasons - especially given that while medicine has a lower probability of risk (not matching, academically unable to handle it, getting laid off), the consequence of failure is so high (enormous debt) that taking the gamble on things like science STEM PhDs, provided that you are careful about only going for fields and research areas that can be applied to industry and non-academic careers, are suddenly more worth it, especially given that you will be paid a stipend. 

Plus, one of the things that is not often talked about in these debates is the effects it has on the mental health of the individuals involved. While STEM PhDs are notorious for being pressure cookers as well, medical school is much, much worse because of the debt, the longer hours, and because any sleep deprivation is not ""forced"" in grad school (there are exceptions, but are usually rare) - you control your own hours, and while those hours will have to be long to produce good work, no one is forcing you to work 24-28 hours straight like they do in medicine. I have a mental health condition that is exacerbated by sleep deprivation and high-intensity environments such as hospitals, and though you could say ""do radiology/pathology"" (and yes, they were two specialties I considered), I found out that radiology's job market is iffy and pathology's downright bad, not to mention radiology has a competitive residency. The increased risk of suicide, burnout, and loss of quality of life have to also be factored into the assessment.

The debt became the last straw that broke the camel's back, but to be honest, I was only half-heartedly going through premed during the last couple of years. My interest in the science of medicine is genuine, but I realized that ultimately, job security isn't the most important thing in the world, that economic conditions are cyclical and seldom bad for long for highly-educated workers (they've been making quite the comeback in the last several years), and that you shouldn't have to go through a career that is a bad fit for you on a lifestyle level just because you're afraid that a couple of decades down the line you'll get laid off from a job and will never work again. I will be going to a health sciences-themed biology/chemistry interdisciplinary graduate program this fall, and while I don't know for certain how my future will end up and I sometimes feel a bit stupid for not realizing all of this earlier, I feel a lot happier now and am dreading it less than when I was due for medical school a year ago.

This may not apply to all of you, but to those of you who are considering medicine primarily for the job security, I would advise you to rethink your decision."

I have just learned how to use STK for a few weeks now, and still clueless about a lot of stuff. 

One of the task I'm doing is daily Tiangong1 tracking: The pass concerning my country, the altitude calculation and such. Normally these are done with STK, with SGP4 propagation.

Websites such as ESA and Satview, as well as Aerospace.org are referred for comparison.

However, I'm having difficulties trying to have proper reentry prediction. The STK lifetime tools provide SGP4 calculation and date prediction, which is one source/data list I can list down, but no coordinates.

I've noted on some papers, as well as pointers regarding using HPOP or Astrogator having much better results as well as possible reentry coordinates.

I'm also a bit stuck trying to project the possible path using daily TLE data for future ground path of the satellite just for pure speculation, but I probably can do it if I twiddle the right stuff.
 
I am rather clueless about the most parameters involved for these calculations, since this is a new topic for me.

If someone has any advice, or step-by-step tips, or possible alternative software resulting in similar outcome I'd love to hear about it. The most important thing is the possible reentry points, or at least the tracking the path for certain date/time.

Thanks in advance"
85p0jt,2,2018-03-19,"[29/f] Depression, anxiety, stuck in a rut with my fiance [28/m]",goldenhaired,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/85p0jt/29f_depression_anxiety_stuck_in_a_rut_with_my/,"Hi there, long-time lurker, first time poster.  I apologize if this is long and rambling, but I could use some advice.
My fiance [28/m] and I have been together since we were in high school, going on 12 years.  We got engaged two years ago, but we haven't set a date because I am still in school. We love each other very much, but our relationship is more companionate than romantic or consumate.  I somewhat understand this, because we have been together for a while, so I am not expecting endless passion and I appreciate the history and commitment we have.

One problem is that our relationship is sexless. I would estimate that we have had sex about 3 times a year for the last 7 years.  A major contributor to this was that he was addicted to opiates and then used suboxone (an opiate that you wean off under the guidance of a physician, kind of like methodone, but not.) for about 5 years.  The opiates really took a toll on his sex drive, and I got tired of getting rejected so I stopped initiating.  I wasn't exactly thrilled with this arrangement, but I understood his addiction and path to sobriety, so I went along with it.  He has been off opiates for 2 and a half years, and his sex drive hasn't recovered.  The only times he initiates sex is when he is drunk. 

The drinking is another issue.  He stopped using opiates, but now he drinks about 6-8 beers a night, more when he is hanging out with his friends.  He rarely appears drunk, doesn't drive drunk, and isn't a mean drunk, but I am worried about his long-term physical and mental health.

I am a student, an intern, and I work full time.  Since I went back to school, our relationship has really suffered. I am hardly ever home, so when I am home, I expect my fiance to spend time with me. But it is like pulling teeth just to get him to stop playing video games on his computer.  I have talked to him about this about a dozen times, told him that it hurts my feelings, told him that our relationship needs attention, told him that I do  not feel like a priority, told him that I miss him, told him that I will leave him if he cannot get his priorities straight. I realize now that it is wrong to threaten to leave, and I have stopped doing it. 

When I come home, he tells me he is almost finished with the round and will be done in 15 minutes.  Then he keeps playing for two hours. He will play until 2 am and then go straight to bed without ever saying a word to me.  I will ask him if he wants to go to happy hour, go for a walk, go to the beach, etc. and he goes, ""ehh, yeah, if you want to."" or he will tell me he is too tired.  I feel pathetic for having to beg my boyfriend to hang out with me, so I stop asking.  When I argue with him about this he will either cry and say he knows I am right and he's sorry and it won't happen again, or he will say that sometimes he just needs to relax because he works hard all day.  Just two days ago he told me that he has been having anxiety and feeling depressed, and being distracted by the video games takes his mind off of his negative thoughts. He said that he thinks there is something wrong with him and he feels like he is addicted to the video games. I have a lot of understanding when it comes to mental illness because I work in an adjacent field, so I have done everything I can to be supportive of this and also I am worried about him and want him to get out of the house!  

Yesterday I asked him if he wanted to come meet me at my work to have lunch with me and he lied and told me that he was going skating with a friend, which I thought was great because at least he was going to do something productive.  When I got home later, we talked and cuddled for a bit and then he fell asleep early.  I looked at his phone (I know some people are against this, but he knows I look at his phone and after going through his addiction I feel justified, right or wrong) and saw that he had never called or texted the friend he was supposedly hanging out with.  I looked at his computer history (I know... see above) and saw that he had been on the computer the entire time I was at work.  I woke him up and confronted him about it, and after trying to lie, he eventually admitted that he had lied to me.  I just don't know what to think about the fact that he would straight up lie to get out of spending time with me. It really hurts my feelings, and it is such a stupid thing to lie about, it makes me wonder what else he will lie about.  He said he was feeling too depressed to leave the house, which I try to understand.

My step-dad died six months ago and I experienced some serious situational depression because of it.  I crashed my car, twice.  My fiance was so absent during this time (playing computer games and hanging out with friends) that I was pretty much grieving alone.  I stayed with my mom for a week after my step-dad died, and when I came back home, I brought her to stay with us for the weekend so that we could be together as a family with my brother.  The night I got home, after being gone for a week, my fiance left as soon as I got back to go skating with friends.  He came back later that night and watched skate videos extremely loud in the living room while my brother, mother, and I sat in the dining room grieving.  I didn't say anything about it at the time because I was too exhausted. When I brought it up much later, he was surprised but eventually realized how awful he had been.  It doesn't matter though, because no matter how much I try to talk to him, his behavior does not change.

Whenever I bring up my frustrations he says, ""I know, I'm such an asshole"" and shuts down.  I tell him that I don't think he's an asshole, and I need to be able to talk to him about issues in our relationship without him taking it as a character assassination.

When he admitted a few days ago that he was feeling anxious and depressed, he also said things like, ""you and my family will be better off without me,"" and ""I should just leave."" I asked him if he has a constant worry that something bad will happen, and he said yes.  I know that this is depression and anxiety talking, and I know that these are things some people say before they attempt suicide.  I have arranged for him to see a therapist, which he agrees would be helpful.

If you saw I, Tonya, you might remember the line where the mother says that there is a gardener and a flower in every relationship.  I am realizing that I am the gardener, which makes me resentful because I think that after the year I have had I deserve to be the flower.  But I know that mental illness does not always work this way.  I also fear that he might be manipulating me so that he can play more video games.  I also fear that he might have relapsed, so I am drug testing him tonight.  He makes four times as much money as me, but somehow did not have money for rent last month.

I need advice on how to address the fact that he is neglecting me and this relationship.  I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I do not want to damage his mental health, but I also know that sitting in front of the computer is not going to help him either.

tl;dr: my fiance and I are stuck in a rut.  We don't have sex, he doesn't spend time with me, and he recently admitted to feeling depressed and anxious. How do I get what I need out of the relationship without jeopardizing his mental health?

edited to add: As I mentioned above, I told him that I was drug testing him tonight. JUST as I posted this, he came in and admitted to me that he has been using cocaine.  Not only that, but he had been using cocaine on the weekends for MONTHS but stopped for a while and then started again a few weekends ago so he ""could feel something."" He used to stay out all night on some weekends, which I hated, but I let him do it because I had trusted him.  He just admitted that whenever he had done this it was because he was doing coke."

I did not receive any W-2's this year, am a graduate student (paid tuition &amp; loan interest), and did receive ""Other Income"" in a 1099-MISC tax form for an internship I did. The internship was just a stipend for my time there, and was not taxed. I first attempted to use Turbo tax and H&amp;R free filing. They said that I owed $2,800 (started  at $3600 but deductions got it down) in taxes this year. They also kept asking questions as if my 1099-MISC was due to a business I started and that I was self-employed. I thought it was weird because I was neither, just a student who got an internship. When I then went to credit karma online filing they said I owed around $900 instead of the $3600. My other education deductions brought that down to $0 being owed for federal taxes. Does anyone know what is going on? A friend told me it was because turbo tax and H&amp;R block were assuming that I was self-employed/ small business owner as a full-time job, but I was just a student with a temporary internship. "

A few hours ago I had a phone interview for an internship that I really hope to get and it went really well. 

Just goes to show you that life without weed can be great. I know for a fact that I would not have had a day like this if I were still smoking weed. Much progress has been made and I am very happy with where I am headed. It's been 196 days since I quit toking and I don't regret it at all. 

Enough about me though...this is for all the people who feel stuck in the weed smoking cycle or have just recently decided to quit. Life gets better. Take time, be patient, understand what you are going through, and know that better days are coming. It may not happen over night and you may ask yourself why it's taking so long. Don't get down on yourself. Keep your eye on the prize (a better life) and do everything you can to make that happen. Quitting is the first step.  And it's a big one. Hang in there everyone. Don't be afraid to make the change. "

85shaf,4,2018-03-20,What's there to like about Aforce or Vision? (spoilers),kyrtuck,Runaways,https://www.reddit.com/r/Runaways/comments/85shaf/whats_there_to_like_about_aforce_or_vision/,"I've been a Runaways fan since 2011, a few things have drove me crazy, and I haven't had many people to talk about it since I didn't join reddit until this month.  I like to talk about things and have things make sense.  I'm also poor so I read TPBs from the library, so I'm always a little bit behind.

Naturally, I only picked up Aforce for Nico, one of my favorites.  I don't care for Carol Danvers who always struck me as a bland character.  Dazzler is a B-list X-men that few people care about, judging by her general lack of appearances in other media.  I never cared much for the Inhumans, especially since the original/main team could get real snooty.  And I think female versions of established male characters is demeaning, which is a part of why I like original characters like Nico.

Aforce is really not all that progressive, since Arcadia Afroce is subordinate to Dr.doom, and America Chavez, a Hispanic lesbian, is banished in the first issue.  In Hypertime, Nico is introduced in a very out of character manner taking a plane trip (which she's never done before) to Japan (which she's never been to before) to visit never before seen relatives and speaking Japanese (which she's never spoken before).  Whereas the white women get introduced doing things that they're known for.  Why not just have Nico hang out in L.A. by herself!?

The plots of Aforce are weak, the plot resolution is feeble, the antagonists are boring, there's no direction.  The attempts at drama fail precisely because the women don't know each other well.  Singularity spent less than one day in Arcadia, so her attachment to the others is weak, even if they are the first people she ever knew.  Dazzler having a disease is nothing but an advertisement for Inhumans vs X-men.  Thor-Dazzler was even stupider.  All the other killed characters come back minutes later for no reason.  The red glowing eyed mind control just looked silly.  The bonding over artificial limbs looked like a joke a ten year old would make.  And why do they act like a dragon is the most crazy wacky thing ever is She Hulk and Carol had faced Fing Fang Foom near the same time as Aforce!?  And Nico's ""cement shoes"" spell just looked like something she could have always done, why do they act like its her being ""stronger than ever before""?

And Nico's references to her past are insultingly inaccurate.  She says they called themselves Runaways (no they didn't) she says they lived in caves (both Hostels were well furnished and the second had electricity and running water) and she claims ""people I've trusted have constantly tried to kill me"" and ""loved ones have been killed by people we trusted"" (they barely knew Topher, Alex certainly did not want to kill Nico, he got killed by the Gibborim minutes later, and Gert got killed by Alex's dad).  Nico asks Elsa how she fights in heels, even though Nico once kicked Victor in the face with stilettos. And Nico somehow forgot her sewing skills and just uses spells to make or repair clothing.  And the staff randomly became two feet long.  How can a Nico fan truthfully tell me they enjoyed this!?

But even worse was Victor's role in Vision.  People said that it showed that ""some drug users are good people that just made bad decisions""...how!?  Victor's friendly interactions with the family are negated by him spying on them for the Avengers.  His internship is never shown and likely just a cover story.  His flashbacks with the Runaways are just him being punched in the face and fighting an alien invasion in New York, which is insultingly misleading with the Runaways being more focused on drama than action.  They make it look like Victor had no meaningful relationships until meeting Vision (and they imply that they first met in Avengers A.I. not in the Civil War with Young Avengers)  Victor speaks...lovingly...about his father Ultron, whom he only met once, when he killed Victor's mother.  Victor accidently kills his nephew because he somehow forgot how to control his powers and only says ""I don't know"" a bunch of times when discovered.  Victor's addiction is to Vibranium, an obscenely rare strong metal, and he just held it in his hand until the energy is used up, so most of the grounding in reality is lost for being a drug addiction story.  And Victor's death is played more like a black comedy than tragedy, from his heart being ripped out to his dumb last words to the unimpressive angles and panel layout.  

Also, they say that Chase ""inherited"" the Vibranium.  Not found, not stole, not discovered, but ""inherited"".  Thus implying that the Runaways are just dumb privileged layabouts, instead of the generally unlucky but clever and resourceful young people they are.

Other than that, vision was still dumb.  Vision himself is more cold and alien than any other story I've ever seen him in, despite him being around for many years and interacting with hundreds of characters.  His whooping thirty other superheroes was absolute bull.  His family looked creepy with their big round eyes and annoying habit of repeating words for no reason.  They can bring the dog back, and Vision works on reparing his wife, but somehow we're supposed to believe Vin was ""beyond repair""?  And the flashback where Vision and Scarlett Witch kiss behind a tree while their comrades in the Avanegers get whooped by a supervillain who threatens innocents just made them look like A-holes.  Granted, I did not read the first half of vision, but I doubt it will make me do a 180, especially if its mostly just Virginia killing a few people in secret.  

I thought both of these just shat on the Runaways, plain and simple.  How can you, as Runaways fans, say you enjoyed these, other than ""it brought attention to the characters""?"

Rebekah Mercer has been dubbed ""The First Lady of the Alt-Right” and Bannon called Breitbart the ""platform for the Alt-Right. ^[[17]](http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/wealthy-woman-who-got-trump-elected/news-story/d7b5880f8e55448818c663018e7e785b)  The Mercers were spreading discord by funding Alt-Right propaganda on a national scale through Steve Bannon, Breitbart, and Milo Yiannopoulos. ^[[18]](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/leaked-documents-suggest-secretive-billionaire-trump-donors?utm_term=.js3v16Kn3n#.toLJj5rg9g) They have recently been in hot water because they were also the money and some manpower behind Cambridge Analytica that is getting in trouble for using Facebook to harvest user data ways that are unethical at best, and more than likely criminal. ^[[19]](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/16/15657512/cambridge-analytica-christopher-wylie-facebook-trump-russia).  Here is a video they tried to get pulled from Channel 4 [Cambridge Analytica Uncovered: Secret filming reveals election tricks ^[20]](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/20/595124809/u-k-seeks-search-warrant-on-cambridge-analytica-ceo-seen-in-hidden-camera-report)

The Mercers were deeply tied to Milo, even letting him use their private security and even continuing to fund his ventures after he was fired from Breitbart for comments supporting pedophilia. ^[[18]](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/leaked-documents-suggest-secretive-billionaire-trump-donors?utm_term=.js3v16Kn3n#.toLJj5rg9g).  This was exposed by Buzzfeed because of [leaked emails. ^[13]](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism?utm_term=.thkzNmMRbR#.kmmz7AkOKO).  These emails between Milo, Steve Bannon, and some other members of the far right that were tapped for expertise in bigotry are pretty revealing.

The Paradise Papers reveal Bob Mercer to be the director of eight Bermuda companies “Some of the Bermuda companies appear to have been used to legally avoid a little-known US tax of up to 39% on tens of millions of dollars in investment profits amassed by the Mercer family’s foundation, which funded Bannon’s book (Clinton Cash)” ^[[21]](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/07/steve-bannon-bermuda-robert-mercer)  

The Paradise Papers provide further insight into Facebook. They reveal Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook’s connection to Russian tech investor Yuri Milner - who also funded Cadre, a startup that Jared Kushner co-founded and left off his security clearance forms.  ^[[22]](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/russia-funded-facebook-twitter-investments-kushner-investor)[[23]](http://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-white-house-forms-omissions-cadre-millions-679231).  It also turns out Facebook knew Cambridge Analytica had been abusing user data for *three years* and only suspended them when confronted. ^[[24]](https://qz.com/1231643/cambridge-analytica-illegally-obtained-data-from-50-million-facebook-users-to-run-trump-ads/)

Bonus A:  Cambridge Analytica executives created a company with the Executive Director &amp; Deputy Chairman of Erik Prince’s Frontier Services Group (similar to Blackwater). ^[[A]](https://medium.com/@wsiegelman/cambridge-analytica-executives-created-a-company-in-2017-with-the-executive-director-deputy-b803f27f84a2)  

Bonus B:  
&gt;“China’s largest state-owned conglomerate has expanded its stake in Erik Prince’s private security company with an eye to expanding operations across Asia, including western China and Pakistan.”  ^[[B]](https://www.ft.com/content/97c14e0e-2031-11e8-a895-1ba1f72c2c11)

Cadre is also in Peter Thiel’s portfolio. ^[[25]](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/donald-trump-peter-thiel-top-intelligence-advisory-post) Thiel, who was part of the Trump transition team, gained a role following his donation of more than a million dollars to Trump’s campaign within days of the Billy Bush tape release. ^[[26]](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13602026/peter-thiel-trump-transition-team-facebook)  
Bannon said of Thiel: 

&gt;“I cannot overstate his impact on the transition,” Bannon began, describing Thiel as a hidden hand in shaping Team Trump. “You will see in the near term that Peter will be taking on new responsibilities, like intelligence.” While Trump and his communications squad may rail about Washington’s permanent bureaucracy, especially those in national-security positions, Bannon talked about having been in the trenches alongside Thiel as part of an offensive against the so-called Deep State”^[[25]](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/donald-trump-peter-thiel-top-intelligence-advisory-post)  Although he doesn’t have an official post, Peter Thiel’s company Palantir was just awarded a $876 million U.S. Army contract. ^[[27]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-09/peter-thiel-s-palantir-wins-876-million-u-s-army-contract) 

Bannon wasn’t the only Breitbart employee interested in Thiel. He also initially had a connection to Milo Yiannopoulos.
&gt;Thiel invited the Breitbart tech editor for dinner at his Hollywood Hills home in June, a dinner Yiannopoulos boasted of the same night to Bannon: 

“You two should meet. … An obvious candidate for movie financing if we got external. … He has f#$%#d (Gawker Media founder Nick) Denton &amp; Gawker so many ways it brought a tear to my eye.” 

They made plans to meet during the July Republican National Convention. 

&gt;But much of Yiannopoulos’s knowledge of Thiel seemed to come secondhand from other right-wing activists, as well as Curtis Yarvin, the blogger who advocates the return of feudalism.  In an email exchange shortly after the election, Yarvin told Yiannopoulos that he had been “coaching Thiel.”  “Peter needs guidance on politics for sure,” Yiannopoulos responded. 
“Less than you might think!” Yarvin wrote back. 

&gt;“I watched the election at his house, I think my hangover lasted into Tuesday. He’s fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.”  ^[[13]](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism?utm_term=.thkzNmMRbR#.kmmz7AkOKO)

And then there was that “Villains and Heroes” costume party/fundraiser that everyone all seemed to be at: 

“… Mr. Thiel dressed as Hulk Hogan for the “Villains and Heroes” annual costume party last month, hosted on Long Island by the Mercer Family, who were big trump donors.  He shows me a picture on his phone of him posing with Erik Prince, who founded Blackwater, and Mr. Trump - who had no costume” ^[[28]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/fashion/peter-thiel-donald-trump-silicon-valley-technology-gawker.html)

Thiel dressed as Hogan because he secretly funded Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker that was settled for $31 million. ^[[29]](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/hogan-thiel-gawker-trial/554132/)  Thiel is on Facebook’s board and “Zuckerberg has continually defended Thiel’s presence on Facebook’s governing body as vital to the company, a balancing presence to stop the site from sliding too far in any one political direction.” ^[[30]](https://nymag.com/selectall/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html) Thiel helped lead a meeting to calm down conservatives that believed they were being “censored” including: Glenn Beck, Tucker Carlson, Dana Perino, and leaders from the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. ^[[30]](https://nymag.com/selectall/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html).  
That meeting seemed to ease much of their concern. They seem pretty cozy in this Gizmodo article titled - ""Facebook Threw a Swanky Inauguration Party With Garbage Website The Daily Caller"" ^[[C]](https://gizmodo.com/facebook-threw-a-swanky-inauguration-party-with-garbage-1791376499) This party boasted a guests including:  Laura Ingraham, Benny Johnson, Matt Boyle, Grover Norquist, Scooter Libby, and Martin Shkreli, who previously ran around with Alt-Right trolls and offered to bail out 4chan by joining it's board of directors.^[[D]](https://www.salon.com/2016/10/06/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-of-course-offers-to-bail-out-financially-troubled-4chan/)

According to a statement [James Damore (ex-Googler) made to Joe Rogan  at (1:58:40)^[31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ1JeII0eGo) (Youtube) there’s an underground conservative network in Silicon Valley.
&gt;I didn’t know so much about the underground conservative network before all this… there’s so much verification you have to join one of these… because there’s active attempts to infiltrate the groups.

Anthonly Scaramucci seems to agree with him because a new podcast from Recode.net is entitled: “Anthony ‘The Mooch’ Scaramucci: Trump has secret admirers in Silicon Valley” ^[[32]](https://www.recode.net/2018/3/19/17136200/anthony-scaramucci-mooch-donald-trump-reince-priebus-steve-bannon-kara-swisher-decode-podcast). By their own admission, sounds like there’s a connection here.

The finishing touches for this post came a few hours ago when Michael Cohen presented his side of the Stormy Daniel’s story in [Vanity Fair [^33]](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/michael-cohen-offers-his-side-of-the-stormy-daniels-saga)
&gt;In another Trumpian twist, **Charles Harder—the attorney best known for representing Hulk Hogan in his lawsuit against Gawker—is handling the case on behalf of Trump**.



It’s a small world.

85td65,12,2018-03-20,[22m] virgin. Not quite sure what to do to change this.,aldjfh,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/85td65/22m_virgin_not_quite_sure_what_to_do_to_change/,"I grew up in a really weird strict household that forbade me from interacting with women or dating.

I didn't shake a woman's hand till I was 19.


Anyways I'm 22 now and kind of hopeless. I'm doing ok in life as a whole in terms of career, looks and social skills which I am consistently improving. So no I'm not what society would deem a loser.



But my biggest problem is lack of experience and not having a social circle. I literally just go to work, lift and do some boxing. That's it. I don't talk to anyone in these places and their are no women there and they all already have established social lives. I have no friends and the few acquaintances I had haven't contacted me since I last left college for an internship this December. I stay at home most days and try to figure out what the fuck in doing wrong.



 I don't go anywhere outside the house cause really where can I? If I go anywhere alone I'm the weird one there cause everybody has friends and shit with them. Even if I did I have never dated and don't know the first thing to do around wome to get their attention. I'm not awkward or anything but I don't give off a flirtatious vibe or that feeling that I am dateable. However once I can engage somebody I have the social skills to do well and carry the conversation forward.


I cold approached a couple both got shot down fast. I haven't done shit since then besides Tinder which is complete garbage if your an average looking middle eastern/South Asian dude.

But yeah I just feel lost. I've done everything right that I could in my own personal life but the people around me just don't seem to reciprocate and nobody seems to give a shit. I'm always the one reaching out trying to be social or hang out. Its kind of annoying and disheartening when it comes so naturally to everybody and they have it so easy.

But yeah I really feel frustrated because of this. Any advice would be appreciated."

85tti9,13,2018-03-20,Aspie struggling for first(ish) job,Gromlech,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/85tti9/aspie_struggling_for_firstish_job/,"So, basic background. I came out of my bachelor's degree about 9 months ago with a 2:1 in mathematics. I had a 6 month contract as a temp. accountancy assistant during my gap year, I did okay in my A-levels and did quite well in my GCSE's, but these past 9 months have involved me doing pretty much nothing. I keep applying for all sorts of work, jobs, internships, grad schemes, apprenticeships so on, in different fields, finance/accountancy, teaching, computer science etc. but I've had 0 success and very few interviews. For one, I don't disclose my aspergers and don't know whether I should be doing or not, but mainly, I don't know what I'm meant to do at this point. I need some form of work, because I need to help out our household, but I get the feeling I'm gonna continue to not get anywhere unless I have a specific line of work in mind that I try and push for, get some experience and knowledge in to be in better standing on applications for example. I guess this is as much asking for job advice as it is asking what people think might suit me. I'm very weak socially, but I can still get on well with those I'm used to, so customer-based roles wouldn't work, but being with a dedicated team might. I found myself in the past, most enjoying tasks of a repetitive or systematic nature, we had a bit of experience with VBA, Matlab and SAS and outside of the fact it was all taught in a way that didn't gel with myself (or most anyone else on the course), I always really enjoyed just typing away lines of code for hours, but always came unstuck when I needed to know what a given thing was doing, what certain terms meant (terminology has always been something I fall flat on). We also had a basic introduction to cryptography which I really got on well with, it was almost puzzle-like. Sorry if this is a bit rambly, or if this type of question has been answered elsewhere, but I'm really unsure of what to do and I keep hearing people around me, tell me I need to get myself sorted already, but I feel like I can't do anymore than what I'm already doing each day, so rock and a hard place sorta thing."
85u16x,1,2018-03-20,Is he interested or not?,lostinlife7,u_lostinlife7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lostinlife7/comments/85u16x/is_he_interested_or_not/,"Hello, I am 19 y/o and last semester I talked to a guy that I found attracted via WhatsApp about an internship (Because I was too shy to make a move other than that) hoping that we will start talking etc. Note that this guy didn't know me we only used to exchange looks at uni. 
Anyways, we talked via text and we started saying hi to each other (mainly me) and I followed Him on instagram. After my Christmas break, I decided that I wanted to move on because he wasn't giving me the attention that I Needed and I  was doing fine until one night he requested to add me on facebook. And since then, he's been acting weird and I've been seeing him way more but we're not talking to each other. Last week, I saw him and he actually approached me and said hi to me and sat with me (common friends). Note that he doesn't have my friends on facebook and I found it weird that after a month of not talking he requested a friend request. 

Now, I am always thinking about him and don't know what to do. I know I already did a lot by following him on Insta and talking to him but I am really interested in him. Do you think he might be interested? What can I do more? "
85uqdu,1,2018-03-20,Looking for internship time,ZILtoid1991,codetogether,https://www.reddit.com/r/codetogether/comments/85uqdu/looking_for_internship_time/,"I'm running out of time in college, and nobody wants to give me internship due to ""lack of job experience"", which I couldn't get due to scarce job opportunities in my local area, which even worse for a college student (virtually nonexistent). I need some internship time thanks to some government regulation that makes sure ""I won't end up in the job market without experience"", but they didn't make sure to regulate hiring rookies, so even entry level jobs require multiple years of experience (some even needs 5, but that can be even work at fast food chains).

I can code in C, C++, C#, D, Java, and in PHP to a lesser extent, and I'm not very good at web design since I didn't want to become a web developer due to the lower wages they receive in my country. I can write a few stuff in assembly, but I tend to avoid that since modern compilers do a good job at optimization with some tricks.

My Github can be found here: https://github.com/ZILtoid1991

I'm willing to work for free, as long as I get a paper that proves my internship time. I reside in Hungary and can work remotely. I need 6 weeks at minimum, or I won't get my degree."
85v62q,1,2018-03-20,Background check,LaFlame612,careerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerquestions/comments/85v62q/background_check/,"Hi I recently got offered an internship for the summer for a larger company.

On my resume I lied about how long I worked for a company. 

It seems like they are in a hurry to fill position, and they have not asked me for references yet.

Is there any chance I could get by this? And what could I say if I did get caught? 

(I worked there for a about 6 months but said I worked there for about 2 years)

-Demanding I go to college without ever helping me academically, never doing basic research into college finances, or offering to help financially while trying to dictate where I go. 

-Criticizing the progress I make while paying $20,000/year between living expenses and tuition while trying to work full time (in relevant fields) and go to college.

-Saying “I wish we were in a place to help” or “We’d help you if you let us” while buying $50,000 dollar boats and other toys and living in a half a million dollar house. She also claims she has no idea what kind of support I need. My bank account is joint with her it would take 10 minutes to get a pretty good picture of where I’m at. But it’s my fault for “not being open and wanting to be too independent”

-Acting like she walks on water for making marginally small contributions (cell phone bill and insurance I recently found out I was a “free child” in until now) Claiming she co-signed all of my loans- she never co-signed any. She doesn’t understand what the fafsa is. Probably because she refused to learn and I filled out her info for her and she signed for eligibility. 

-Trying to sneakily apply for state aid in my name so my insurance would be free or very very reduced and in my name but she could pay premiums so she could remain the holy saint

-Refusing to respect that I can’t afford to go on vacation while supporting myself. She will dangle ideas in front of my face. These are her prime opportunities to ignore her children in a different location while posting photos so her Facebook friends know she’s a good parent. 

-One-upping. To a ridiculous extent. I came out of the biggest job interview I’d ever been in and was surprised she called. I got one sentence out before she started talking about vague “entrepreneurial ideas” and how she was going to come up with $10,000 to take the family to Hawaii. Then requesting I take 2 1/2 weeks off with a month’s notice. Without revealing literally any details about this business. 

-When she asks what’s new literally to find things to insult me about. Examples: “I’m applying to mentor children!” Nmom “Don’t you have enough to worry about with yourself? Why wouldn’t you just volunteer with big brothers big sisters?”(literally a partner with the charity I was applying for)
“Mom I’m asking for a raise that was scheduled when I was hired. Maybe you know friends in a similar field to add to what I’ve gathered about wages?” Nmom “You don’t even know how life works. What makes you think you’re worth the $15/hr you’re getting paid?”

-Asking why I spend more time with SO’s parents than we do with them. They have travelled out of state to see us more than my mom has bothered to drive to see me. And when I go to her house half the time she’s out drinking or working late even though I give a month of notice and offer multiple weekends. She will call me a week in advance when coming near my city for work and guilt trips me for a month for not getting out of-school, 2 jobs, and an internship to see her. 

“You’re lying to yourself. I never said that. I’m just trying to have a close relationship with my daughter. You need therapy (I WAS SETTING UP/PAYING FOR IT BEFORE YOU TRIED LYING ABOUT OUR PLAN THEN DROPPED ME) I need a chance to defend myself. We love you and care about you and there’s no lying that we want you to be successful.”

I want to believe this every time."
85vjoe,122,2018-03-20,Atheist in a Christian university... Considering transfer,tulatarantula,TrueAtheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/85vjoe/atheist_in_a_christian_university_considering/,"Disclaimer: I posted this in a university subreddit and got very little response before it was buried. I'd really like to have a discussion about this because as I understand it, many Atheists are somewhat forced into attending religious universities because the programs are the best in the area, or the benefits (like mine below) aren't found in public schools.

This year, I began a Masters program in Counseling at a Christian university. I am (have always been) an Atheist, but I attend this school for several reasons:

* I'm in my 30's and finished my undergraduate program 4 years ago without honors or an internship. I've since been a stay-at-home-mom, so I have no resume. I was afraid when applying to schools that I would be rejected, so I only considered those I thought I would surely get into with the two rec letters I was able to get.

* I have a child, but no childcare other than my husband when he's home in the evening, and this program's courses are set up for working adults (evening classes, one class per week, etc).

* I get a discount on tuition because of a special program they offer which other universities in my area do not (but some other schools are cheaper anyway).

* The campus is about 3 blocks from my house.

* I was assured by the program director (with whom I openly discussed my Atheism) that religion factored very little into the coursework, and was more of a general ""attitude"" of the school rather than a required area of discussion and study. She also assured me that they strive to admit diverse students, and many have different religious backgrounds.

* This counseling program is highly regarded and well-respected, with a very high NCE pass rate and post-graduation employment rate.

I'm starting to feel like I was ""sold"" this school for my money. I've become disenchanted and distressed about how much religion is proving to matter in the coursework, and I am starting to think the ""perks"" may not be as important as I thought.

In both (non-religious) courses I've taken so far, religious reflection has been a required part of the work. We are required to write about our spirituality, our beliefs, etc within the framework they provide, which has so far been Christian text. If it were just reflecting on my lack of spirituality, that would be one thing, but this school wants me to talk about my spirituality within the context of the Christian readings, and frankly I just don't know how to do that without coming across as argumentative or disagreeable.

Recently, a professor told our (counseling theories) class that she believes that all mental illness in the world comes from Satan, and that the only way to ""fix it"" is to walk ""God's path."" Many of our assignments in this course are centered on honest, genuine self-disclosure and examination in order to help us to know ourselves at a deeper level before we see clients - and they all require us to write about spirituality. I feel very uncomfortable being open with someone who holds such dogmatic beliefs and feels at liberty to share them in such a harsh manner with the class.

Finally, it is becoming clear that the other students also prefer to discuss religion rather than the course material. In required online forum discussions, 50%+ of the discussion is based solely on the religious readings, and they talk amongst themselves about God and their beliefs. I feel very left out here - not only are we missing out on a lot of meaningful discussion about the real material, but I can't really participate in most of their discussions either. I'm starting to really feel like an outcast.

I'm seriously considering transferring. Two other schools in my area offer great programs, but so far I'm not sure if they will have an option for evening study. They require a third rec letter and a resume, of which I have neither. I suppose I could go to my last professor for a letter, but that would be pretty odd (""hey, I don't like your school, help me get into another one""). Also, let's be honest, applying/registering/orienting to graduate school is a huge pain and I'm just not sure it would be worth all of the work and stress on top of the workload I have now.

Are there any other Atheists here who have attended Christian schools who could tell me if this level of religious course involvement is to be expected? What would you do? Talk to the department director, just go ahead and start working on a transfer, or suck it up and grit your teeth through it?


tl;dr : I don't like my school, it's more religious than they said it would be and I feel like a round peg in a square hole. I'm looking into transferring, but for now, I'd really just like to talk about this. Are other religious schools THIS religious?"
85wprw,1,2018-03-20,22 year old career planning?,waffleretard,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/85wprw/22_year_old_career_planning/,"I finished a finance degree in June of last year. I was taking classes until September, but had to stop taking classes halfway through the semester because of mental health issues. I was planning on finishing a financial math degree because I was pretty close. Afterwards, I was unemployed from around October until now. I will be starting a new full-time job on Monday and will be paid $17.79 an hour.

It will be a job as a negotiator for credit card debt settlement firm. I want to have a better paying job in the future, and don't know how would I go about going back to college. I would have to save money and continue to live at home. I hope to do well this time and land proper internships before graduating. I had a 3.5 in my community college and feel really screwed that I am stuck at this job now.

I'm a 23 year old guy from Austria and I need to tell you of the most amazing thing that has happened to me just a few hours ago. Sorry if this is a rather long post, I hope you'll bear with me.

When I was young I always had this dream of one day opening a restaurant or something along those lines. As a child this seemed like the grandest idea. Obviously I knew nothing of the hardships involved in being a professional cook so when I grew older I gave up on the idea, I thought I wouldn't be able to cope with the stress and all that.  
Also, I had it really easy in school, I never had to learn much (or anything at all) to get decent grades, so naturally, all my drive and conviction for anything (not just school) just sorta left me. I hadn't had much passion for anything left in me and basically went with the flow. Later in life, when I was about 16 years old, I thought, why not become a teacher. The idea seemed good at the time, I got along wonderfully with children, I had a knack for explaining things to others, I guess I just thought I'd be a natural or something. After school I started studying in the teacher's program of the University of Vienna and guess what, I still had no drive, I half-arsed everything and basically got nowhere with my studies. Somewhere a mild depression made itself known too, so that hindered me as well.

Anyway, last autumn several things happened to me at the same time, I started working in a store that specialised in cook books and spices (we import high quality spices and create our own blends, sometimes originals, most of the times we reinterpret classics). Also, my girlfriend of six years left me and I had to find an apartment. As you can guess, I was at a point where I did not really know what to do with myself. I stopped studying and just worked, met friends, and, again, just went with the flow.

But sometime in the past few months I started thinking. Why not pick up my childhood dream again, and start cooking professionally? Cooking is something I was always good at, something that was fun for me. I am really happy I never really stopped doing that. Last year, I also started using Instagram to share the food I cooked, I made meals for my friends and family, and I was always happy and somewhat proud when I did that. Cooking was one of the only things that actually made, and make, me happy.

So fast forward to today and the most amazing thing that has happened to me. We had a presentation of a cook book in our store today, a book that was written by a really good author together with a professional, who holds 17 Gault Millau points. He is one of the best chefs of Austria, probably Europe. Anyway, they presented the book, and some of his team were preparing food for all the attendees in the tiny kitchen of our store. After the presentation the food was served and I was one of those serving the food. So for the next two hours I went in and out of the kitchen, I served the guests their food, everything was moving smoothly  and I had so much fun! When the the sous-chef, the one doing most of the cooking today, finished, I went out for a smoke with him and we started talking. I asked him questions, like when he started cooking and all that, and also told him that I loved cooking and what-not. Later-on, when most of the guests had already left, he also asked me whether we had any good japanese books that I would recommend, and I showed him some. Japanese food is what I have been cooking most of the time in the last months, so naturally I was kinda passionate when I talked about the subject.

And then the thing happened. Almost everyone had already left and I too wanted a book signed by that chef, that guy holding 17 Gault Millau points. And as he was signing my book he said that he had heard that I was a passionate hobby chef. i was flabbergasted, who could have told him? Well guess what, it probably was his sous-chef. And then he asked me whether I plan on working in a kitchen in the future, and I told him that, yes, I had been thinking about it. And then he asked me whether I would like to come for a week and do something like an internship in his restaurant, to see whether I had what it takes to work in a professional kitchen.

He asked me whether I want to learn in his restaurant.

I was completely baffled. Then he went on that I should do something like that and proceeded to write his telephone number on a napkin and handed me his business card, all the while telling me that I should write him an e-mail and that we'll figure that out, that he will find a place for me to stay for the week and that I can see what it's like in a professional kitchen.

Well, as you can imagine, I was unable to say more than thank you, and yes, I'd like that, and, yes I will write him soon. And then he left and I was in shock, completely starstruck, unable to think properly.

So yeah, today, one of the best things of my life happened to me. That guy, that god of a chef, offered me the chance to work in his kitchen for a week.

I am still completely in shock. On the way home I also almost started to cry out of happiness.

**tl:dr:** I had no passion for anything, today there was a presentation of a cook book by a chef holding 17 Gault Millau points in the store I'm working in, I started talking with his sous-chef about cooking, he told his boss that I loved cooking, that kitchen-god offered me the chance to come intern for him for a week sometime in the near future. I am happily in shock."

For a few months now, my day-to-day life changed. 

I'm not out that often (once a month maybe) and feel listless. 

Weekdays I sleep anywhere from 6 to 10 hours, feeling tired. 

I'm not doing much. Not going outside or hit the gym.

My only thing I have fun with is my computer. 

Playing some games, which make me angry after an hour, and programming.

I'm learning networking in IT and some subjects are hard. 

School sucks because most of our teachers don't teach us and just give us assignments.

I'm not bad in school but not that good either.

Weekend is different.

I go to bed at 01:00 am and stand up at 12:00 am. 

I'm sitting on my computer all day everyday.

I don't want to do networking anymore and start an internship as a programmer, but that means I lost 2 years of time.

My parents paid 600€ for the laptop I had to get and 50€ for a small programmable computer and I am 'throwing it away'.

We have not a lot of money and it hurts me.

I don't want to hurt myself. Never will. 

It's just that I could sleep everyday and don't feel like doing anything. I have to write a resume but I'm not don't it for whatever fucking reason. I don't know if I'm so lazy or if my mind is making me do that. 

I'd like some opinions and help. I don't know where to start and if I actually suffer from depression. 

I don't want to be an attention whore and I'd honestly feel embarrassed if I would actually suffer from depression. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I had to get it out. I'm not an emotional person. "

I have internship this fall, but I should be able to work at least part-time once I figure out child care.  I also have a real estate license (but no startup capital).

We live in Colorado Springs in a good neighborhood. Home prices are only expected to rise and rent has skyrocketed.  I don't want to make any decisions that would be detrimental long-term and uproot my child unnecessarily.  We don't qualify for a home equity loan and rising home prices will prevent us from downsizing to something else.  So renting would be our only option.

85xzkz,52,2018-03-20,Alright... time to talk about Lily.,Swankified_Tristan,HIMYM,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/85xzkz/alright_time_to_talk_about_lily/,"I gotta say it; I’m pretty damn sick of the Lily-Hate-CircleJerk. I'm actually really sick of ALL the hatred on this sub but this post is going to be about Lily. She really isn't that bad! She has unpleasant moments, but she isn’t Satan and she’s also not half as bad as this sub makes her out to be.

Lily is the ""straight"" character of the show. Every sitcom needs one to keep things in line and make sure the stories never get too out of hand. *”how i met your mother”* has always been one of the more realistic sitcoms, and in my opinion, a character like Lily is exactly what the group needs. She’s never been secretive about trying to keep them all together. She’s the glue and it’s amazing that she constantly manages it. All her life she's been confused through her parents and upbringing, and is constantly haunted by the shortness of life. She's always wanted to prove herself, but life overwhelms her.

In Season 1, she ran off to San Francisco. She had been living the same life for nine years and had one day woken up realizing she’d given up on her dreams of being an artist. She had no intention of ending things with Marshall. At most, she wanted to postpone the wedding so she could figure things out. Marshall took it a different way though; she was clearly abandoning him and he couldn’t let her do it. 

Reason wasn’t being seen by either side really. It was a complicated scenario but Lily she did what she had to do; she took the leap... and fell. And dammit, I’m glad she did! EVERYONE should be happy she did. I’m happy she took the leap and I’m happy she fell. If she hadn’t, she’d marry into a life of constantly wondering “what if?” She’d never be completely happy with Marshall if she hadn’t made this choice. They never would’ve made it and the fallout would have been much worse; maybe even beyond repair. 

The crazy thing is she might not have even realized how important it was that she made the choice she did. She regretted her decision to go to San Francisco for the rest of the entire series. Marshall bringing it up in season 9 was really unfair in my opinion. It was a low blow. I'm not saying that she was completely in the right during that argument, but she definitely wasn't completely in the wrong. The fact that Marshall kept that secret from her was a big deal.

Everything that she does after the San Francisco trip, every manipulative thing that she does is to keep her friends together, because they've become her family. Does she always do it in the best way? No, the fact that she broke a few of Ted's relationships isn't good by any means but she was doing it for her friends. The family she grew up with was so broken and uncertain that at this point in her life, she's willing to do whatever she can to make sure she doesn't have to live in a divided family again.

Lily is complicated, but I refuse to let her be called selfish, a grinch, or a horrible person when in reality, she’s only human. She just wants what’s best for everybody and to live a happy life with her friends and family. 

She doesn't always go about it in the right way but that's what character development is all about and I think people really ignore the fact that the character actually evolves passed her bad qualities. Everything that's brought up about her pretty much ends after season 4. She has selfish moments, but always reflects on the consequences they may have and changes her mind before they can have too much negative impact. Again, I’m referring to post-season 4.

What she did to Ted and Robin’s relationship wasn't great, but I can see a lot of ways she could be coming from! Lily made a really strong case in that episode. Robin and Ted weren’t going to make it, but Lily didn't mean to break the couple up. She meant for them to talk about the problems she was foreseeing and whether we want to admit it or not, she was right.

After she's confronted on what she's done she feels terrible. It isn't one of those scenarios where she only feels bad because she was caught. She didn't even like doing it in the first place, but she thought she had her friend's interest at heart. And she never does it again. I can’t stress this enough; it wasn't the most moral thing to do, but she didn’t do it out of cruelty either.

If you need another example of her evolving past this stage, take a look at the finale. Robin starts to outgrow the group and feels the need to leave it after Ted and Tracy get together. Lily is heartbroken over this but does she try and pull off a manipulative mind trick to get Robin to stay? No. She lets her walk out the door because that’s what Robin has to do. As much as it hurts, she allows it to happen. 

I think what hurts the fandom's attitude towards her is the comparison to the other characters.
Marshall is an amazing, friendly, and all-around good person; the favorite of many… but he isn’t perfect. Yes, I said it; Marshall isn’t perfect. This sub usually says there’s nothing bad to say about Marshall but that’s far from true. Is he lovable and a great person? Of course he is! But he needs Lily to keep him grounded with all the time he spends in the clouds. 

He pushes Lily to have a relationship with her father when there was a very clear reason it had been broken. This was something that needed to be mended on its own and while he may have lit a spark, she needed to create the flame at her own pace. Marshall tries to force it though because his family is different. Things like that don’t happen in his family. He’s too focussed on that fact to see things weren’t perfect in Lily’s upbringing. 

Lily supported Marshall all throughout law school and when he finally got his degree, he quit his job (and burned that bridge), leaving them in quite the predicament. And yet, Lily kept calm and promised they’d figure it out. 

People constantly bring up how horrible it was of her to call herself the ""settler"" in the relationship but they always leave out what led to that ""conclusion."" Lily constantly told Marshal they were equal in their relationship during that scene, but he consistently pushed her. She finally gave him the ""negative"" answer to shut him up. And in that moment, it's what needed to happen.

Years later, another probably involving Marshall's career arose. He quit his high paying job to chase his dream of being an environmental lawyer and impulsively took an unpaid internship. 

The fact that people bring up that she almost ran away to Spain is just wrong. She had a moment of weakness and it couldn't have even been a few minutes after Ted left that she instantaneously changed her mind. Otherwise she wouldn't have been able to get to the party Marshall was throwing right after Ted.

And can we even entirely blame her for that moment? In the span of one day, her husband leaves his high-paying job to work for a company that doesn't pay anything and immediately starts forcing his non-paying work on their household. Before she knows it, she’s hosting a party for people she’s never met; people who are using her family for free labor. Still, she supports him. She supports him as much as she can before it becomes too much, and understandably so. 

But the truth of the matter is it never actually became too much. She had one mini freak-out and then immediately returned to his side before any consequences could even begin to take place because she learned from San Francisco and she really thought her actions through before doing anything recklessly.

...then the Judgeship happens. The big one! Lily is about to achieve her lifelong dream of living abroad and amongst art and culture as an art CONSULTANT! Everything is ready to happen when Marshall gets the offer to become a judge… and he takes it without even talking to her. He could have told the Judiciary Committee about the plans they had to move to Italy; that he needed to talk to his wife first. They were offering him a huge position because they clearly believed in him. I’m sure they’d be willing to wait a few days while Marshall had the talk with his wife but he took it right then and there. 

That was wrong. Marshall was in the wrong throughout all of Season 9 and he used Lily’s trip to San Francisco, a decision she’d constantly apologized and worked to make up for eight years against her. Marshall is a good man and a good husband but again, that was low! 

I won’t spend too much time talking about Ted or Robin. The show makes a bigger deal of Robin's childhood which makes the fandom sympathize with her a bit more, even though she has some selfish moments in the show as well. The fandom still judges her for reasons I believe to be unfair but that’s another post. Ted gets a lot of unfair hate towards him as well, but that's a totally different topic. He still gets sympathized with a hell of a lot more than Lily.

Barney is an asshole but he's supposed to be an asshole so we let it slide. And should we? I’m actually going to take a break from the main topic to ask this question; is Lily really the worst character on this show? I don’t mean to turn it into a “this character is better because this character is worse” sort of deal but it needs to be addressed.

Barney manipulates people (mainly women) throughout the entire show and breaks almost each of them through some sort of emotional impact. He even admits that he might have sold a woman and clearly doesn’t lose sleep over it. He cheats in relationships without a second thought, given the exception of a single time.

And let’s not forget he sleeps with Ted’s ex-girlfriend (and love of his life), a girl who is HIS close friend, when she’s in a very vulnerable place. Yes, she IS the love of Ted’s life (pre-Tracy) and Barney can’t seem to see that. He thinks that just because Ted has a new girlfriend, Stella, that he’s completely over Robin. But once again, we let it slide because he’s the funny character of the show. I digress. Let’s get back to Lily.

Her character is the one that did something huge and unpleasant all the way back in Season One and I think the audience, much like Marshall held onto it throughout the remainder of the show. She got the bad deal right from the start. She isn't the friend who tells it like it really is in a negative or pessimistic way. She says it because she wants to help. Lily's character is most of the time about helping people in ways that could have been handled better. She’s been there for Robin, Ted, Marshall and Barney without fail and I love her character!

85yekt,3,2018-03-20,I think my [29M] younger brother [23] is in an abusive relationship and I don’t know what to do,georyver,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/85yekt/i_think_my_29m_younger_brother_23_is_in_an/,"So, my younger brother started dating this girl about two years ago. She seemed fine at first. I think she smoked too much weed and was kind of a bad influence on my brother, but it honestly wasn’t a big deal. Other than that, she seemed fine for a while. 

Then she got stomach cancer. I think, “Wow that’s horrible, especially for her age” (20 I think at the time). She said was getting chemo but didn’t lose her hair which I thought was odd... but she said there was some other medication that prevented that. Sure, ok, I’m not a doctor. A few months later she was in remission and completely cured. Alright, glad to hear it. She also said that she never told her parents and absolutely didn’t want them to know for some reason. She’s a college kid who doesn’t get her insurance through an employer or the ACA... so our assumption was that she was on her parents’ insurance... so how would they not know? Whatever, none of my business I guess. 

Then she did something super fucked up. She was on vacation with her family out of town. My brother and her got in some kind of fight and he told her he wouldn’t be responding to her texts/calls the rest of the night. Fast forward to the next morning — she claimed that she had been raped by two men. And blamed my brother because he wasn’t there to answer her call for help. He believes her to this day, but me and the rest of the family are pretty convinced she’s lying. She never called the police or went to the hospital and was posting photos on Facebook the next day of herself smiling with family doing touristy things on their vacation. 

Fast forward maybe six months more. She now has ovarian cancer. She says it’s my brother’s fault because he gave her an STD (assuming she’s referring to HPV). Same story as before — she doesn’t want her parents to know. This time around none of my family believes she actually has cancer. We grill my brother for proof. The only thing he could give us was the fact the she had him drop her off at the hospital one time for treatment (but he didn’t go in). My theory is that she just went in and hung out long enough to make it seem like she got treatment. 

Another few months later, he graduates and gets an internship in NYC. We’re all really excited for him. It’s a great opportunity and seems like an awesome start to a career. The night before he goes out there to see where he’ll be living, she calls him and says that she’s taken a bunch of pills and is committing suicide. She tells him he’s abandoning her, calls him names, etc. (my mom witnessed this part). His response was to just keep saying “I love you” into the phone repeatedly. As you may have guessed, she did not die, and did not go to the hospital or anything as far as I know. My mom talks to him for a long time and gets him to admit, “I need to break up with her”. 

Fast forward two months to this past weekend. I get a call from him informing he proposed to her. I’m floored. The kid has no money. No career. No life experience outside of college (that was 99% financed by our parents). I’m sick to my stomach thinking how big a mistake he is making. 

At this point, I’m at a loss. I didn’t expect it to get to this point. I thought this relationship would run its course and that he’s wake up one day and end it. But that obviously hasn’t happened. Instead, he says he feels a “need to take care of her” because she’s had “a really hard life”. 

I’ve been in an (emotionally) abusive relationship before and this has all the indicators of one. But I don’t know what to do. We’ve tried reasoning with him. We’ve tried to point out just how unlikely all of her stories are. But he just will not level with us. “What choice do I have other than to believe her?” he’ll say. 

My question for you, Reddit, is this: what can I do? He’s my only brother and I love him... and I just want to help him. Are there resources or something I can point him to to get him to see the light? Should I refer him to counseling of some kind (if he’d even agree to go?). 

Thanks for your help. 

tl;dr — My brother just proposed to a person who I think is abusive and a liar and I don’t know how to help him. "

85yrty,20,2018-03-20,"First time poster, not sure how to title this, but want to know if I am being 'taken advantage' of at my current job...",connecticut06611,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/85yrty/first_time_poster_not_sure_how_to_title_this_but/,"Thanks for anyone who takes the time to read this. As some background, I am not a LCSW. Though I am very, very, strongly considering it hence taking this job. I have a bachelors and through a referral from my friends who are LCSW's, I was able to get a job as a mentor for a larger non-profit. I mentor young adults with a criminal history. 

The particular non-profit I work for has many different social services programs. I apologize if I'm not using the right language, I've been at this position for a year and am still figuring out the large web of social work and how all these different programs connect/ are funded etc.  

It’s overwhelming to know where to begin, thank you for your time reading this. 

1. When I started the job, they told me there would be mileage reimbursement. (My job consists of constant driving. I have to drive to the clients, and then take them places in my car to structured but fun activities / “behavioral activation” that is assigned by the therapist). Considering I live 22 miles away from where most of the clients are centered, and where the office is, I was very disappointed to find out that they start tracking the mileage from the office address. I then understood that can be typical, still not great with all the driving I do (to and from), but so be it. Recently, my supervisor told me they are going to stop giving me that tad bit of mileage from the office to the clients house, and ‘starting’ my mileage at the client's house. When I asked her why they were cutting the mileage back further, she wasn’t able to really answer. So now when I take them downtown or 3 miles away from their house to a coffee shop, I’ll get maybe a few bucks, even less than before. If I see a client for only an hour or two, it’s still about an hour to get there, and an hour to drive home with traffic. Lots Of Driving. Very little reimbursement, 

2. The clients always, always, want to eat and want food when we go out. That alone causes issues with my sessions but that’s another post. They have come to expect it, and my supervisor says the program encourages incentives in order to get the kids to participate in the activities. But when I don’t have enough (Of My Own Money) to buy them food, the clients will get upset and the session will not not be ‘productive’. They reimburse me of course, however I’m usually always out about $100 because I am always continuously paying for client activities out of my own pocket. When I get reimburse, the cycle starts all over again. Sometimes, my supervisor will cash advance me $20 or $30, but it’s never enough, and it never lasts. The therapists struggle with this too. They claim they cannot give us prepaid cards because they can’t track where the money goes? Even though receipts are required for reimbursement. One time I ate out at chinese place with one of my clients and they gave me a tiny receipt that was not itemized unfortunately. My supervisor said they couldn’t reimburse my $20. And when stuff like this happens, it is always done through PAINFULLY ‘bitchy nice’ passive aggressive texts and voicemails. 

3.After every session I am required to submit client logs that summarize and report on the content of the session, progress, etc. We use an online program that often is faulty. Recently I was told that many of my sessions were not in the system. I know I put those sessions in. Logging sessions easily takes 3-4 hours a week of my time, but they only want to pay us for 30 minutes. I’ve gotten away with putting an hour on my timesheet, but my supervisor says that’s all they can allow....The therapists who are there full time complain about this, but my supervisor still plays dumb with me and will ‘reprimand’ me if my logs are missing in the system. I think she gets pressure from higher up about documentation? But won’t just be honest with me. I think she’s often looking for someone to blame to save herself, at least that how it often feels. 

4. Clients often cancel on me last minute. I know this is common. I do my best to reschedule with them. Initially, I was making myself crazy being super available. I would be rescheduling and turning my other commitments and schedule UPSIDE DOWN in order to make the 2X 2 hours a week with clients.  If the client’s cancel, I don’t get paid unless I would have driven there (an hour for me) to physically make sure they are not at their homes or wherever. To avoid driving an hour and back for only $16, IF I’m able to confirm with them through text or phone that they aren’t down for a session that day, I will save myself the long drive. I have another job as there’s no way someone could live off of this job alone. So if the client’s can’t meet in our agreed upon scheduled time, I can’t risk my other part time job to try do so. Even though I initially did. 

5.In terms of the clients cancelling, there’s a lot of pressure from my supervisor to make sure I see them (understandably so). However, I am told very often never to ‘play the bad guy’ by telling the clients I need them to try to honor our session times together. The clients run the show, and I don’t know ‘why’ they would allow this. They don’t want me to piss off the clients by setting boundaries and expectations about sticking to the schedule. 

6. The job is an independent contractor position. I feel I do *a lot* for the very, very little I get paid. My check’s are never over $300 a month. And they expect me to do a lot more than they initially talked to me about for no pay. 

7. I am told very clearly that as a Life Coach I am the fun mentor, not the therapist. Of course, and no problem. I enjoy the actual session times with the clients. However, there’s been many times I’ve been blamed for the clients not wanting to finish their GED for example, or not getting a job. I do my absolute best to encourage the clients and support them in any way that I can as their Life Coach Not Therapist. Despite my ‘laid back role’ in the clients life, if the client hasn’t achieved their main goals by the time discharge is nearing, they place blame on the life coaching sessions. Suddenly... the Life Coach role is now Results Driven. There was one time I was working with a client who did *not* want to complete their GED. I took them through the whole sign up process, sat at the DMV on 3 separate occasions and got their state I.D. so they could register for the exams, and took them to the study sessions 2X week.  They showed resistance throughout the entire process, but my supervisor and their therapist were really pushing me to ‘push them’ through this. Eventually my client had a breakdown and called it off. Their therapist urged me call their mother to talk about it, which another therapist told me was not my role and I shouldn’t be involved with the parents. This was early on, so I really had no clue and just did what they told me. I pissed off the mother, and my client as a result. 

8. They require a Bachelor’s for this position... Which as I said I have.  I’m sure they have their reasons, but for the average person nobody wants a job that requires so much extra work for such little pay, and putting ridiculous mileage on your car. This job would be fantastic IMO as an internship for someone nearby in one of the colleges studying psychology, social work, or a related field. 

9. Rules regarding how many times and in what format to contact the therapists to fill them in on the sessions changes OFTEN. Then, it ends up with me receiving passive aggressive texts and emails. Communication overall is extremely poor. 
My supervisors definitely play into the bleeding heart/ compassion aspect when asking me to do extra tasks.

So, I want to quit. I’m already looking for other jobs. I wanted to give it a whole year which I did to see if it improved. I’ve never had a job in the social work realm before and just didn’t know what to expect. But is this experience typical in Social Work? I know social work is vast, and there are many different types of jobs. But lately I am not so convinced I want to pursue a masters in it. 

I’m sorry for the length. I am new to this I have no one really to affirm how I’m feeling (extremely worn out and taken advantage of). I don’t know what to expect, or how I can put down boundaries in this setting, if it’s even possible? I feel like my supervisors just come back with, ‘well this is the field, social work doesn’t make money’. ARE they taking advantage, or is that the wrong way to look at it? Is this just ‘typical’ social work at this level (sans masters?)

Any insight, thoughts, advice, relatable experience anything is appreciated. 

TLDR. Love the actual time helping clients. BUT AT WHAT COST? 

edit: sorry the numbers are messed up, I typed it in google docs first.

I would love to speak to companies probably smaller ones about internships and job opportunities but I'm unsure how to properly go about it. I know E3 isn't about networking or maybe it's good there I honestly don't know!

I know I would need a portfolio I have a design document I've worked on in my class and by the time E3 comes up I'll have a playable demo of the game I talk about in my design document.

85z5ta,1,2018-03-20,NC with Ndad?,darkracerx,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/85z5ta/nc_with_ndad/,"Im a 26 year old man (soon to be 27) with a career and a professional license. Despite all of this, my self-esteem and self-confidence remains low. Why? Because of how they treated me (and sometimes still do) growing up. My dad and I almost got into a fight about why I have been ignoring his texts. I told him its because I do not have much time on my hands like I did in college, and also because of his criticisms about me (about my weight mostly). Granted, yes I've made some immature decisions in my life. Although, not anything dangerous or illegal. For example, during my sophomore year in college right after finals, I rode my bike to a nearby river and actually went into the river because of how bad things were. My mom found me the next day with soaking wet clothes. The only reason she found me is because she saw a note on my dorm room door, which I wrote. Had a cold chest, but not enough to be hospitalized. I was deeply depressed because of how bad my grades were at the time. Granted, I could have handled this more maturely. My parents furiously confronted me about my ""stunt"". Another time was when I bought unprescribed pills (as in not approved by the FDA) in an attempt to increase my processing power and therefore boost my academic performance. It worked wonders and my GPA went from 2.7 after 3 semesters to nearly 3.5/3.6 at graduation. Understandibly, they were concerned about my safety and health. However, the reason why I don't really contact my parents is because I don't really feel comfortable around them. Like sometimes, my dad would be in a bad mood and take his stress out on me, and would be patronizing at times, especially as I was close to leaving the nest. My relationship with my parents deteriorated severely despite doing well in school, and earning and completing internships. I mean seriously?! For what?! My parents made me come with them on a family trip, which I absolutely hated because my dad spent the whole trip criticizing my brothers and I and lecturing us about the importance of school, and how grateful we should be (at almost 23 years old mind you with good grades and internships lined up and one completed). After I got hired for one of my internships, my dad groaned about the fact that I would not be able to go on the trip instead of congratulating me like any father would. I literally avoided spending time with him or contacting him after that. Its pretty depressing for a 23 year old to feel like they're walking on eggshells around their father. There are more incidents, but for this post I'll keep it short. When I was a teenager, my dad would sometimes yell at us, but he stopped as I got to around 16. When I was 12, he yelled at me for being lazy. Though, I am actually quite grateful for that one. A few months later he made me sleep in the garage for the night after I mouthed off to my mother in an argument. In fairness, I've had many good times with my father. We both share alot of good memories and joke with each other ever so often. However, I've also had memories whereby I've felt patronized, criticized, and walked on eggshells around him. Even when I left home, became a professional, and started a career, their attitude continued. Always criticizing me, correcting me, questioning me telling me what I did or said was wrong. I just want my parents to be proud of me, or at least see me as an adult and take me more seriously. I mean they do, but not at the level that I would want. I mean I have no criminal record, except for a single speeding ticket, and a professional license (CPA if anyone is interested). I understand how hard my fathers childhood was and that he went to bed hungry every night and that his father would sometimes abuse him, his siblings, and mother (my grandma) but it at times seemed as though he would take out his frustrations out on me.I am depressed about it to the point that I sometimes self medicate with food. I’m almost overweight now because I just cannot stop eating. Why? Because of the emotional void that I’m trying to fill. I refuse to go to therapy because I’m not sure I’m I have the money for that and plus I think it’d be a waste of time. There are many more incidents that I would like to list on this post, but I’ll explain that in another post. Anyway does anyone have any suggestions or opinions on how to deal with my parents and my depression.

85z8ql,11,2018-03-20,"HELP! PIMO JW HERE, UNBAPTIZED TRYING TO JOIN THE USMC!",pgomnomnom,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/85z8ql/help_pimo_jw_here_unbaptized_trying_to_join_the/,"Hello reddit. I've been lurking for 3 years now and in all honesty, I've been having these thoughts since I was 12 and learned about the right to every US Citizen's Religious Freedom. Since I found out about that, I've wanted to be involved in some branch of service. Well, now for a backstory because who doesn't like reading those?

I'm a born in JW with extensive military history in my family. My great great great (i've honestly forgotten the greats) grandfather was one of the few soldiers who survived the defeat of the Alamo. I have members on both sides of my family who participated in the civil war, WW1, WW2, and a lot of other war stories I was told when I was younger on the lap of my (oh thank god) WORLDLY grandfather. 

When I was 10, I moved to California which is where I was born, and enrolled in an online school like so many other JW kids around me were. I then developed an interest in military based games, (not your average FPS games) and I practically idolized them. I eventually got pretty good with working on computers servers and networks as my JW 'friends' were all either getting DF'd or they were so devout they were in service all the time. This led to me having solely communication with the outside world and distancing myself from the people in the religion.

I've felt something off about it since I was little because I was never like other people. And not in a good way either. So one night, I got fed up with having no real life friends, and basically being dragged into meetings and field service every day I had no schooling to do or my servers were running good. I ran away, for 6 months on and off to go see my worldly girlfriend and her family. Before I talk about them, this is what happened to me.

I lost all my oh so dear 'privileges' and not too long after, all of my JW 'Friends' I've grown up with who have known me since I was born literally 5 blocks from the KH. This just confirmed my suspicions as the borg being a fucking cult. (oops sorry for the language!) 

So I fell in love with this girl and her family. I was actually getting treated like a human for once is honestly the only way I could describe it. I could freely discuss and explore my religious beliefs and own moral compass without having to worry about judgement or shunning from my own family.

But, I had to move. I lost the only girl and family who treated me human, and the reason we moved was because of me seeing them on a regular basis, running away because my parents forbade me even speaking to her. I'm in Texas now, and my parents are pushing harder than ever the religion down my throat. I have no communication with any of my old internet friends either because well, I can't buy decent internet. All I can do is maybe go on youtube and post here on reddit. I can't really play multiplayer games because of it either to try and make new friends.

So, 16 year old me thought: ""Let's make the best out of a very very very shitty situation."" I started working for Google Fiber as a network support technician, not as an intern, but as an actual employee. But soon thereafter, my parents didn't like the work environment as google is a very worldly place to work. I refused to quit my job, so they made the cops show up at my workplace if i was not out of my place of work within 5 minutes. (My job required overtime.) I explained the situation to my manager who was really supportive of me and she said ""No bridges are burned here, I'll give you a good recommendation. But get out from under that fucking thumb your asshole parents and cult has you under."" (Her words, not mine! Again, sorry for the language.) 

As everyone here knows, JW's hate college, but I want to be a network engineer. This means certifications, and a computer science course. I cannot acquire these under my parents roof. I need to be in a class to learn, I just learn better that way as opposed to reading something off of a screen that is outdated, and with no teacher to ask questions to. So, I'm joining the military. Specifically the United States Marine Corps. I'm joining the USMC because I need to be taught self discipline, respect, and how to achieve a moral compass all while serving the greatest country on this planet, the United States of America. (And also the benefits are REALLY fucking good too. again, sorry for the language.)

My plan is to go in under the 0600 field to work with networking communications, which will help me in the civilian world when I get out. Then go to college, get a degree in computer science, move back to the Bay Area, and live a long, happy life. Here's the catch though: I have no idea how to bring up me leaving for the marines to my parents. I also am having a hard time with talking to my recruiter incognito from parents. I do need a place to crash until I get to boot camp unfortunately, and with being in the middle of bumfuck nowhere Texas, (sorry for the language!) it is nearly impossible to just go to a friend's house to crash until boot camp because *shocker* no worldly friends.

Help a guy out reddit. And thanks for helping me wake the fuck up. (Sorry for the language)"
85zgjf,2,2018-03-21,"Frustrated as a 21M who has never had a relationship, yet all my friends are getting married, or have great success",Death_AllHisFriends,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/85zgjf/frustrated_as_a_21m_who_has_never_had_a/,"
###**BACKGROUND**

20M (soon to be 21) and in my third year at college, and I've never had a real relationship. 
I am a introvert who has never kissed a girl, let alone held a girls hand. I am not ugly, I don't think,[but I'm just an average 5/10 probably it seems] I'm not a loser, or have the stereotype ""gamer"" who gets nervous talking to girls. I have a good 4 really good friends who all hang out together. And they all have relationships. Used to be just one other, then another got a girlfriend, and then before you know it I am the only single one. Annnnnd Its been years since I've even had mutual flirting with a girl.

**I've been told *Don't go LOOKING for something, just talk to people, befriend girls and work on yourself***

So I have. I spend days playing pickup basketball for hours at the gym because its my passion and I am pretty good for the most part. I picked up working out since I've always been skinny and wanted to become better and well... look good tbh. I went from a twig 120lb senior in highschool to a still slim but stronger person. I went from being scared to walk into the gym to being about to squat 220lbs as a skinny guy, who most people would doubt I could even do, which is something I'm proud of for myself even if it is still nothing compared to experience lifters. And I finally am liking how I look

I focus on school and have a good GPA, have a good part time job, and now have offers for internships and full time jobs. I have even picked up guitar and starting to learn a new instrument, even though it can be pretty hard at times.

I am a CS major so my classes are 85% male. Of the 15% females, some are pretty... weird lol. many others hardly talk English and the rest are normal girls. Ever so often there is a really pretty girl that I find attractive too. (CS has a bunch of nerds so its not littered with attractive dudes and girls)

There have been about four/five girls this year that I've struck interest in but every single one ended having a boyfriend.

What I want to get off my chest is being frustrated and pretty lonely hearing about my friends relationships. I know people will say ""don't worry about their opinions"" but its not their opinions. I care. ***I*** don't want to be single anymore. And yes, I am okay with myself. I just want a connection for once. 

Two of my friends are talking about shopping for a ring to propose with. One friend just got out of a long 4 year relationship, which was awful when it happened. Within a month, he has talked about going on 3 dates, having sex 3 times, and having a girl ask him out. Out of fucking no where, surprising all of us.

I am trying hard to be the best person I can be like I mentioned above, yet as a 21M I still lack having any connection with anyone.

My last really close friend tried out tinder, and thats how he met his SO, and he recommended it to me. Well I paid the extra monthly to see who was liking me... no one. 2 Fucking people. TWO women. that is it. 

The group is often talking about relationships and it just makes me more depressed to not ever have anything in my life.

20M (soon to be 21) and in my third year at college, and I've never had a real relationship. 
I am a introvert who has never kissed a girl, let alone held a girls hand. I am not ugly, I don't think,[but I'm just an average 5/10 probably it seems] I'm not a loser, or have the stereotype ""gamer"" who gets nervous talking to girls. I have a good 4 really good friends who all hang out together. And they all have relationships. Used to be just one other, then another got a girlfriend, and then before you know it I am the only single one. Annnnnd Its been years since I've even had mutual flirting with a girl.

**I've been told *Don't go LOOKING for something, just talk to people, befriend girls and work on yourself***

85znti,14,2018-03-21,What I had wished for Grey's Anatomy. Would that be your wish too?,GreenAwareness,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/85znti/what_i_had_wished_for_greys_anatomy_would_that_be/,"long vent with a lot of ""I wish"" but bear with me...

...

There have been a few excellent posts/replies lately that have inspired me to write this. The latest ""missing the boring moments"" thread made me realize in a very clear way what I would have really wished for the show and why I find myself so dissapointmented on how things progressed.

...

I wish Shonda had written the show with a focus on an enseble cast, and not simply on keeping Meredith/Ellen on the show. I don't mind the show being called Grey's Anatomy. I do think it's smart to start the story with one character's POV. However, I wish that Shonda had the 5 orginal interns as the core of the show. I wish she would have realized that MAGIC's journey was the focus of her show. The magic of the show came alive because of these 5 flawed, completely different yet endearing characters' chemisty and journeys. I wanted to have followed the ride they took together until the end. I know that the 5 of them weren't unanimously loved. Some disliked Alex, some disliked Izzie, some disliked George, some disliked Meredith, and some even disliked Christina at times. Heck, I was annoyed at each one of these characters on multiple occasions. But the 5 together? Never. The 5 together were MAGIC. Hindsight is 20/20 but I wish I could have valued those moments more. Those 5 characters more. I wish Shonda was not only focused on Meredith (not blaming Ellen) and actually cared about the five original interns the same way. I wish it had not been Ellen/Mereith or bust for Shonda. I wish it would have been MAGIC or bust. I wish she had listened to Katherine, Sandra and TR's ideas and complaints just like she listened to Ellen's. I wish she believed that the show was about these 5 interns and the great ensemble/supporting cast they had. I mean, Shonda had Isaiah Washington, Patrick Dempsey, Katherine Heigl, Kate Walsh, Sandra Oh, Sara Ramirez, Eric Dane... She had industry forces. Now we see her getting rid of Sarah and Jessica and leaving us with the DeLucca actor, Camilla, Kelly and it's like, sorry, but these new actors do not hold a candle to what you had before. Neither do their characters. Did Shonda really prefer to let go of an ensemble of great actors just to make this show purely about Meredith Grey? That was Shonda's biggest mistake. The show should not have been purely focused on keeping Ellen/Meredith. It should have been an ensemble, with the 5 interns all being treated as indespensible. One of the two most iconic shows of our generation: Friends and Sex and The City did that to perfection. It was about the orginal cast and the show ended with the central cast intact. The efforts to keep Ellen should have been the effort to keep the 5 original interns. We saw the show through their lenses, through their journey. I came to the realization that if for Shonda Meredith is what she needs to make the show work, for me MAGIC was what I needed to make the show work. I'm not saying they didn't need the supporting characters (Derek, Burke, Bailey, Richard and co). All I'm saying is that the primary focus should have been in keeping the 5 original interns at all costs. If it was my art, my creation, I would rather it ended on top, with the same quality it started then dragged for years while further tainting the show.

...

Yes, I know some will say that Sandra, Katherine and TR wanted to leave. They did. However, I really believe things would have been completely different if Shonda made it clear from day 1 that there would be no show without ANY of the 5 main characters. If Shonda had decided to go this route from day 1, Ellen would't feel the need for such a high paying character. If she wasn't the only one that mattered, her expectations would have been adjusted accordingly.

...

Like I said, the creators of Friends and Sex and The City were able to do so very succesfully. Eventhough Carrie had more notoriety, Sex and The City would not have been Sex and The City without the dynamic of Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha and Miranda. For me Grey's Anatomy was not Grey's Anatomy without Meredith, Alex, Christina, Izzie and George. Of couse they had some other interesting storylines after Cristina/Izzie/George left. However, the show was never the same again. The series finale had to be with the 5 of them reminiscing on their intern days at that bed in the hospital hallway they first interacted after their first day."

I'm tired of being the scapegoat and I'm sure my nmom senses that I'm taking back control of my life, and it frightens/threatens her. She does discourage me and make me feel bad by talking about some people i knew in past (exfriends, terrible family members) and how they are successful and gotten places but I haven't. Once I even cried because I got hopeless about my future, but instead of motivating me she insulted me and physically hurt me, saying that I should stop acting like a child and stop crying.

But for the past couple months, I've been at my best. I've started making small changes which now come across as powerful (to me at least). I'm getting places with school (masters in guidance and counseling psych) and internship (in my faculty) (she looks at at as how great she is as a mother). 

One thing I've noticed though is that I feel a closeness and motherly like role from my professor. She is the sweetest person I have ever met and she is so motivational and encouraging. Unlike my mother that uses my accomplishments to reflect on how good she is as a mother for making me so successful, my professor uses it to introduce me to more professionals and get me more opportunities to work with them or at least for them to know me and how hard working I am. She also repeatedly compliments me in class in front of my classmates and tells them that I should be a role model to them. My grades have been the highest ever because I've been working real hard and that I'm always wanting to impress my professors. (GPA 4.00)
I'm working as a part time English teacher and getting paid but not telling my mom about the money I'm making. I'm going to hide it from her and maybe tell my students to do the same.
I've been rebelling in small ways like becoming more vocal in my stance as a person (atheist, something nmom lowkey disapproves of), I've even started swearing at home (which was really difficult for me to do before and would end up in physical abuse). I'm taking back my life one step at a time. 

I still don't have the financial capability to move out but I'm working really hard to gain control of my life. I want to move to Canada (currently in istanbul) so I'm always on the lookout for job opportunities. My parents are against it but I care about myself, my brother and my dog, and nothing can stand in my way at this point!

 I read success stories on this subreddit to have hope that everything is possible once you set your mind on something you want, believe in yourself, and take action. I wish the same for you, the readers of this subreddit.

Have you guys made little changes in your life too?"
860sft,1,2018-03-21,/u/zacharyan100 on Do you believe that the investigations into President Richard Nixon should have been shut down?,rightwingnews,DebateConservatives,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateConservatives/comments/860sft/uzacharyan100_on_do_you_believe_that_the/,"Relating to the defense of aggressively closing down all forms of investigation into Russian election interference

I don't know of anyone that holds this position. As someone who didn't vote for Trump, I agree that there is no Trump/Russia collusion. It's gotten completely ridiculous at this point, which is why the media and the democrats switched gears to ""obstruction of justice,"" which there is also zero evidence occurred. Firing James Comey is not obstruction; he's not an investigator, he's the boss of the investigators, who are still employed and continue investigating. Now, should he fire Mueller? I don't think he should, but it would not be illegal. Should he be impeached? No, because what has he done? All that being said, Russian interference should still be investigating, but not with the intent of trying to ""get Trump."" It's not the FBI's job to ""get Trump.""

Do you think that the impeachment of President Richard Nixon should never have been allowed to get to the point where it threatened a sitting President?

I'm not really sure what you're asking here. Impeachment is not a legal maneuver, it's a political one. You can impeach a sitting president for combing his hair the wrong way; it's just something congress has to agree to do. No crime needs to be committed for impeachment to take place. That being said, to borrow from John Nolte:

Within two days of the Watergate break-in, the media had already connected a crime to an employee on Nixon's re-election campaign. Within six weeks, the media connected the break-in directly to the president's re-election campaign. Within six months, two officials on Nixon's re-election campaign had already been convicted

Now even if we grant (which we don't) that there was some form of Trump/Russia collusion, what exactly does Russia get out of the deal? Trump has been way tougher on Russia than Obama, who teased Mitt Romney for labeling them a geopolitical threat. We do have evidence of Russia engaging in unsuccessful pretend-grassroots campaigns through social media, both pro-Hillary and pro-Trump, in order to stir up polarization.

Do you believe that President Bill Clinton should have been removed from office for lying?

Banging interns in the Oval Office, and perjury, are grounds for impeachment if congress deems it worthy of impeachment. If you show me Trump doing the same things, you'd probably have grounds for impeachment. But, everything scandalous about Trump came out before the election. He didn't fool anyone, everyone knew he was kind of scummy. To impeach him based on what the public already knows, and voted for, would be Democrat political suicide.

It's also worth reminding everyone that Bill Clinton is an alleged rapist.

Do you see how your overlapping positions might possibly be seen as absurd from anyone reading this from future generations?

Short background story: I am a 22 year old Belgian guy studying information technology. I have 1 more year to go before I graduate and I have been learning Hungarian for a few months.


I am writing in English since that way it's easier for me to get my message across.


For several reasons I want to move to a foreign country, preferably a country with lower living standards than my own. Since I really like Hungary and I am trying to learn Hungarian I consider looking for a job in Hungary. Also I know there is a shortage of qualified IT staff in Hungary.


I want to work either in programming (.net), database design or software testing. 


Beside my study I have 1 year full time work experience as a web developer (php) and beside my study I worked part-time in web development. I also had a 3 month internship designing apps and databases.


I speak fluent French, fluent English, decent Dutch and basic Hungarian and German.


Before I make serious attempts to get jobs I am looking for your advice;


- How likely am I to get employed in Hungary, given my background, and what would my salary be compared to native Hungarians?

- What is the salary range of IT developers in Hungary, and is there much room for growth?

- With parties like Jobbik and Fidesz growing in popularity, and some anti-EU and anti-migration sentiments going on, am I likely to face hatred/racism by people if they know I come from a foreign country working in Hungary (thus potentially 'stealing' the job from a Hungarian guy)?


Thanks for your answers!"
861p8b,3,2018-03-21,No contact with NDad?,darkracerx,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/861p8b/no_contact_with_ndad/,"Im a 26 year old man (soon to be 27) with a career and a professional license. Despite all of this, my self-esteem and self-confidence remains low. Why? Because of how they treated me (and sometimes still do) growing up. My dad and I almost got into a fight about why I have been ignoring his texts. I told him its because I do not have much time on my hands like I did in college, and also because of his criticisms about me (about my weight mostly). Granted, yes I've made some immature decisions in my life. Although, not anything dangerous or illegal. For example, during my sophomore year in college right after finals, I rode my bike to a nearby river and actually went into the river because of how bad things were. My mom found me the next day with soaking wet clothes. The only reason she found me is because she saw a note on my dorm room door, which I wrote. Had a cold chest, but not enough to be hospitalized. I was deeply depressed because of how bad my grades were at the time. Granted, I could have handled this more maturely. My parents furiously confronted me about my ""stunt"". Another time was when I bought unprescribed pills (as in not approved by the FDA) in an attempt to increase my processing power and therefore boost my academic performance. It worked wonders and my GPA went from 2.7 after 3 semesters to nearly 3.5/3.6 at graduation. Understandibly, they were concerned about my safety and health. However, the reason why I don't really contact my parents is because I don't really feel comfortable around them. Like sometimes, my dad would be in a bad mood and take his stress out on me, and would be patronizing at times, especially as I was close to leaving the nest. My relationship with my parents deteriorated severely despite doing well in school, and earning and completing internships. I mean seriously?! For what?! My parents made me come with them on a family trip, which I absolutely hated because my dad spent the whole trip criticizing my brothers and I and lecturing us about the importance of school, and how grateful we should be (at almost 23 years old mind you with good grades and internships lined up and one completed). After I got hired for one of my internships, my dad groaned about the fact that I would not be able to go on the trip instead of congratulating me like any father would. I literally avoided spending time with him or contacting him after that. Its pretty depressing for a 23 year old to feel like they're walking on eggshells around their father. There are more incidents, but for this post I'll keep it short. When I was a teenager, my dad would sometimes yell at us, but he stopped as I got to around 16. When I was 12, he yelled at me for being lazy. Though, I am actually quite grateful for that one. A few months later he made me sleep in the garage for the night after I mouthed off to my mother in an argument. In fairness, I've had many good times with my father. We both share alot of good memories and joke with each other ever so often. However, I've also had memories whereby I've felt patronized, criticized, and walked on eggshells around him. Even when I left home, became a professional, and started a career, their attitude continued. Always criticizing me, correcting me, questioning me telling me what I did or said was wrong. I just want my parents to be proud of me, or at least see me as an adult and take me more seriously. I mean they do, but not at the level that I would want. I mean I have no criminal record, except for a single speeding ticket, and a professional license (CPA if anyone is interested). I understand how hard my fathers childhood was and that he went to bed hungry every night and that his father would sometimes abuse him, his siblings, and mother (my grandma) but it at times seemed as though he would take out his frustrations out on me.I am depressed about it to the point that I sometimes self medicate with food. I’m almost overweight now because I just cannot stop eating. Why? Because of the emotional void that I’m trying to fill. I refuse to go to therapy because I’m not sure I’m I have the money for that and plus I think it’d be a waste of time. There are many more incidents that I would like to list on this post, but I’ll explain that in another post. Anyway does anyone have any suggestions or opinions on how to deal with my parents and my depression."
8622oy,1,2018-03-21,Elev-philiac,curewritewounds,curewritewounds,https://www.reddit.com/r/curewritewounds/comments/8622oy/elevphiliac/,"Leaving the office holiday party was always an adventure. People would drunkenly weave back to their desks, grope for keys and wallets, then hobble their way over chairs and each other to the elevators. We’d crowd as many of us as we could into any given car, exhaling enough alcohol into the metal box to give the unfortunate DD at least a contact drunk. We would laugh or cry, sing or shout, pressing into each other the whole ride down. When the doors would open on the ground floor we’d slosh into the lobby like the spirits in our aching guts, and all this was just the prelude.


Illicit workplace romances are no secret. If you think where you work doesn’t have one, then you’re not looking hard enough. They sprout around the office throughout the year and this moment, just after the holiday party, they all bloom in some kind of boozy springtime. Some furtive glances between desks would turn to something more, though on the average they turned into something less. During my time here, there were whispers that some of these relations got ugly – but hey, as long we still get the job done during the 9 to 5, how serious could that be? Besides, with the job market being what it was, there’s something to be said about grinning and bearing it.


My own post-party escapade started on the ground floor. We had an intern join us at the start of our fourth quarter. I had heard she was nineteen, but I made sure never to verify that for myself. It's hard to claim plausible deniability when you know you’re handing drinks to a minor and not just doing a solid for someone who ‘probably just misplaced their wrist-band.’ When we got off the elevator she was barely hanging on me the way a wispy piece of clothing dangles on a clothesline. A few of the office girls tried to help her off me, but I waved them off.


“Smile betch!” she shouted as a tiny LED flashed in my eyes.


“Jeez. What’s that for?” I asked, as I watch her tap away on her phone.


“Ma frands!” she shouted again, dropping the phone into my hands. In the photo, you could see straight down the neckline of what probably passed as a dress in the colleges around town.


“Why don’t you text that to me?” I said as I typed in my phone number, making sure to press ‘send’ before handing it back.


“Yeah, whatever,” she said, not so much leaning on a wall as barely not sliding down it. I waited about a minute for the vibration of my phone that would tell me I had the photo and, more importantly, her number.


I waited a minute before realizing I had left the office one cell phone lighter than how I went in. “Fuck,” I spat. I spun on a heel and bounded back to the elevators. Another group of staffers spilled out of a car and into the lobby. Some of the younger ones picked up my date and carried her to the doors. “Fuck,” I groaned twice under my breath, the second time stretching until the doors closed. I got off at our floor and bolted for my desk. The motion sensor lights flickered slowly, like drunken eyelids fluttering over fluorescent bulbs. I’d get my phone, call her, find out where she was going, and then hook up with her there. My gut sank after I opened the last possible drawer at my desk and still couldn’t find my phone. I walked back to the conference/party room, the motion sensing lights coming on as I entered, and searched there too. I had no idea how long I was there for, but the cubicle area lights had gone off by the time I gave up. I walked in darkness back to the elevators. This time, I guess, the lights were too tired to come on a second time for me. I’d blown it. Netflix and chill had turned into YouTube and just me.


I pressed the down button for the elevator and watched the inner doors rise through the centimeter crack in the outer ones. They split faster than I expected, nearly blinding me in fluorescent light. When my eyes adjusted I looked down and saw my phone lying there, next to some booze probably left behind by someone else. How that might have fit after we had packed the car, I had no idea. Had this even been the car I took earlier? I turned my phone over as the doors shut behind me. I checked my alerts and my messages, nothing. I knew I had sent a text to myself from her phone. There was no way I was too drunk to mess that up. I paced myself, I made sure of that. Sometimes reception died between floors. That was probably it. That had to be it.


I pressed the ground floor button. I’d run outside, get reception, get the text, make the call, and save my night. This is what I thought as I heard the cables that moved the car go quiet and then stop. I pressed the ground floor button again and again, maybe a dozen times, before pressing all the others. Nothing. I flipped the call button and braced myself for an alarm. Silence. I searched the elevator for a service number. I found it almost completely scratched out, not that it would have mattered as the ‘No Reception’ alert told me I was in one of those dead zones between floors. Which floors, I could not tell you, as the LED board had decided to stop telling me where I was.


I leaned on and then slid down the elevator wall. I reached for a cup by the forgotten booze, a half-empty carton of juice, and some plastic bottle vodka – then I waited for someone to pick me up. I probably should have set my phone to airplane mode or something, as the pointless searching for signal and service quickly drained what battery I had. When my phone died all I had left were my thoughts and the liquor. If I timed things right, I’d run out of both at the same time. There’s a kind of grey area where your brain is still deciding if it wants to be party to what your body is doing. I got my brain to that point pretty quick and then drowned it in angry swigs of cheap vodka.


All I remembered next was through a lens of alcohol. I felt something slither against my leg. At least I think I did. I kicked at it, and whatever it was left me alone for a moment. After a bit I felt it again, firm and weirdly warm, pressing into the small of my back. “Fuck off!” I yelled as I flailed like a rag doll, knocking it away. I peeled open my eyes to the light of dim, red emergency bulbs. I looked around for a rat or whatever it was that kept trying to nest in the warmest parts of me. I didn’t so much search the elevator as knock into things until I gave up. Crumpling back into a corner, my eyes drifted up to the ceiling and a gap between tiles that almost looked like a zipper. Something dark seemed to poke through it, and the harder I tried to focus on it in the crimson lights, the fuzzier it became. Then, like a fist made of shadows, it hit me. And it hit me again, and again. I raised a hand, to cover the heat spreading across my face, and felt the pull of binds over that hand and then the other one. What could only be hoses and tubes spilled through the split in the ceiling, wriggling and writhing over to me, grasping with every loop at every limb. I pulled and they became tighter. I took in breath to scream, and they wound around my neck until all that squeezed through was a pathetic wheeze. As I cried, it dragged a greased cable over my face and smeared my tears across my cheek. More and more cords spilled into the elevator until I was drowning in the foul smelling plastic that seemed to swallow the flashing red lights. Then I could taste it as inch after inch of filthy cable filled my mouth and wriggled down my throat.


I woke coughing and retching in full fluorescent light, driving fists into my gut at the command of some survival instinct. With the relief that only comes through vomit, the next thing I felt was cold. My whole body ached. Every joint I bent sparked fresh pain. My mouth was sticky and my throat was raw. Every time I breathed I could feel the fruity film of booze, and other things on my tongue, thicken. It seemed the harder I tried to force saliva into it, the worse it became. I found my jacket on the floor beside me. Balled up in a corner were my pants, shirt, and everything else. How hard was I trying to sleep? I turned, as if on reflex, to the ceiling, searching for the split that spilled. Instead, all I found, nestled in a corner was a small hole with a red LED on the other side. The blinking red light didn’t pulse but instead seemed to wink at me in an off pattern. It might have said, “Oh, you’re still here,” in Morse code for all I knew. When I looked at the LED board, I saw the letter G was lit. I got into my clothes despite every pain receptor in my body going on rapid fire. I had barely finished mis-buttoning my shirt when the doors split open and I felt a draft from the well ushering me out. I grabbed my shoes and stepped into a puddle of half-digested mush. I limped into the lobby and out the front door, wincing with every step. With my phone dead, I hailed a cab and after a few passed me and my aching arm, one let me in.


“Where to sweetie?” the cabbie asked. I gave her my address and she took off. I put a hand over my eyes to block out the morning rays that were like nails of light being hammered into my sockets. The sound of automatic locks going off could have been a hammer meeting an anvil.


“Rough night Mister Handsome?” Every word she said pounded on my eardrums. I peeked through my fingers to see her eyes settling one me instead of the road. I’m no Hemsworth, but I take care of myself. I might have been flattered if I was in any kind of mood for that. Seeing her eyes drift down, I fixed my pants and re-buttoned my shirt to stop half-exposing my midsection. This seemed to disappoint her and she shrugged massive shoulders. I almost spat some words back, but glancing over the barrier I saw a mass of muscle and bone almost crumpled behind the steering wheel; if she wanted, she could have stretched her legs, broken her seat, and pinned me back there.


So instead I said, “Yeah,” and tried to look down and away. I supposed she took the hint because the rest of the ride was spent in merciful silence. This made the sensation of my heart shoving blood through my liver just barely bearable. When we got to my apartment, I swiped my card and waited for her to unlock the doors.


“How about a smile, sweetie?” She said more than asked, looking at me through her mirror.


“Excuse me?”


“C’mon, such a handsome face is wasted pouting.”


I slid my fingertips over the lock, trying to find some purchase on the tab that receded completely in the door. “Are you kidding me? Let me out.”


“Nah-ah-ah,” she scolded me – Scolded. Me. She wagged a black gloved finger from the other side of the barrier, flicking something on among the aching darkness in head. I spotted the cab company phone number and pulled up my phone to dial when I remembered it was dead. “C’mon,” she cooed at me like I was a puppy, “Just one smile.” Four black shapes curled over the barrier and her black turtleneck started to twist.


I don’t know if something kicked in or something else didn’t, but I felt the sudden curve of my lips and saw the reflection of the cabby’s gaze. I heard the click of the door unlocking and leaped out of the car. As it peeled away I brought my phone up to get the plate number and nearly threw it into the pavement when I realized, again, that the battery was dead. I limped up the stairs to my apartment, my body struggling with every step. In the full-length mirror that faced my front door I saw myself, hammered, hung-over, and wrecked in more ways than one. There were long, red welts that ran across my face and more that seemed to wrap around my wrists and arms. When I touched them, it felt like lighting a fire on my skin. I hobbled to the bathroom and plugged my phone in. I flipped on vanity lights, which flashed on like a half-dozen suns, and vomited again. Mixed with the hummus and pita chips, clear and dark liquor, were dark flakes that I struggled to focus on before washing the lot of it down the drain. I crumpled onto my bath mat, picking at some black residue under my nails. When I had the strength, I brushed my teeth and more black flakes fell out of my mouth. I spent the rest of the day dealing with the hangover phenomenon of my entire digestive system working in reverse. I wrote a colorfully worded e-mail to maintenance about getting their ‘god damned retards’ to fix their ‘fucking death machines.’


When I went back to work a week later, I caught myself frozen in front of the elevator well. I watched the four sets of doors coming and going with any number of men and women at any given time. Where everyone let themselves be swallowed and spit-up by the elevators with blind trust, I found eyes flickering among the four illuminated doors, my subconscious seizing control from the rest of me until I knew which of these cars trapped me that night. It wasn’t until I saw a large group of people come through the front doors that I willed myself to pack into a car with them. I maneuvered myself into the middle, keeping as far away from the walls as I could, even as the car continued to fill. I even kept myself turned away from the door at an angle where the elevator camera wouldn’t catch my reflection. Floor by floor people got off, the number of bodies between me and the elevator shrinking with the opening and the closing of the doors. At last it was just two: me and a woman who worked a couple floors below me.


I could feel my body twitching, either from unconscious nerves or something my body was doing to accommodate the aches that still wracked me. I could see that she saw from the way she stole side-glances at me the whole ride, the frequency of glances grew the fewer other passengers there were. I wanted to apologize. I wasn’t starring at her. I starred past her to the only angle where the camera might still see me. I didn’t want the elevator to see me. I couldn’t let it. I felt my hands clench into clammy fists as we approached her floor. I’d ask her to stay. I’d beg. Just ride a couple more floors with me. When the doors opened on her floor, I grabbed at her.


“Stay away, you fucking creep!” She yelled. I could feel my eyes turn to saucers the moment her head moved and I saw the red, flickering light in the corner, blinking with the timbre of laughter. She slapped my hands away and shoved me into the back of the car. I heard the sliding of metal on metal and watched a ceiling panel fall open, dropping thick rubber cables onto me. In an instant I was tangled. I clambered for the door, clawing through tubes and cords. There was a moment of elation when I slipped my fingers through the door. I filled my lungs to shout when the doors slammed shut. My shout transformed into a scream. I heard the gears whirl around me and felt the undeniable sensation that something was pulling me through the door. I felt air whipping over my fingers. I could already feel the sensation of my hand grinding against the elevator shaft, my fingertips being ground down into stumps. I screamed and screamed, clawing at the door with my free hand until they burst open and I fell upon my co-workers who looked on with concern. I scrambled out of the elevator, turning as I felt the doors clamp on my ankle, screaming again as I fell. I saw through the elevator doors as they stuttered apart – no cables dangled, no loose ceiling panel swung, just a normal elevator with a recessed camera that blinked right at me as the doors closed again and hut.


I grasped at my foot, pulling down the sock to reveal a fresh, wide, red welt that already ached – a welt that matched one on my hand and all the others from the night of the holiday party. I hobbled to my desk, trying to pretend like everything was normal, that my outburst hadn’t happened, that today was just a normal day. I picked out flecks of black rubber from under my nails.


Word did not start spreading that day only because word had already been out. Some fragments of footage of naked body in the elevator were already making their rounds and must have been in every e-mail inbox of every other person in the building, likely courtesy of whomever was at the other end of the e-mail I sent to maintenance.


“Why not just call for help? Jeez,” was one of the kinder exchanges I heard around me. “He was drunk and just kept drinking, what did he expect?” “I don’t understand why he was alone in the first place.” “He’s only got himself to blame, really.”


“I heard he blew chunks in the elevator.”


“Oh gross. Which one?”


“Did you see his ass though?”


“Where would you put him on the crazy-hot scale?”


Even the intern got in on it, “Should have just left his phone and come home with me. I wouldn’t have let this happen to him.”


“Seriously, just get your phone in the morning. Or get a replacement. Phone insurance is like nothing.”


I managed to track down most of the footage that was circulating. I’d need to get help tracking down who sent it, but I didn’t want any more humiliation than I was already getting. I rode the elevator down that night, surrounded by people who seemed to keep away from me as much as I kept away from the car walls. When I got home I stitched all the videos together into a six-hour film of my drunken episode.


I watched myself pick up my phone from the floor and the doors close as soon as I’m inside. I watched myself pour cocktail after cocktail until I’m pouring the remnants of the vodka into the juice, chugging it until my head simply rocks and then stops rocking. Then there are three and a half hours of sometimes swirling static. This is followed by me huddling naked into a corner, balling my clothes into a pathetic mattress, pulling my jacket over me not so much for warmth as hiding from the camera. I see myself heaving as the jacket rises and falls like tidal waves until it goes still and my body splays out across the floor.


This is not so upsetting as what I know I can see in half distorted flashes in the three and half hours of swirling static. In the noise I see myself screaming. I catch glimpses of thick cables dropping through the ceiling panels, grasping and binding me, immobilizing my shrieking, flailing body as yet more fall through and wrap over and over me, squeezing and covering and prodding every inch of me. It happens over and over again until all I am is shivering flesh.


I rode the elevator again the next day, shivering as the recessed red light winked at me.  


I ride it again the day after. On late nights and early mornings, when I have to ride alone, I hear the gears turning different. I try not to look at the ceiling panels that rattle apart above me. I tell myself that the cables creeping at my feet aren’t there and that the tightening feeling around my body isn’t happening. My coworkers call me, “Elev-philiac,” when they think I can’t hear. I tell myself that nothing is wrong and everything is fine. I grin and bear it. I need this job."

By The Rev. Jason Cox
from the Episcopal Digital Network Sermons that Work series.
Palm Sunday (B) – March 25, 

Episcopal Sermon Palm Sunday

[RCL]: Isaiah 50:4-9a; Psalm 31:9-16; Philippians 2:5-11; Mark 14:1-15:47

How did this happen? How did Jesus’ life of peace end in such a violent death? We stand at the edge of this moment, looking on in horror and confusion — just as Jesus’ followers did on the day he was crucified. The violence we have seen is numbing: it robs us of the ability to think clearly. Like Peter in Pilate’s courtyard, we are afraid. And fear will always lead us astray. So it’s a difficult moment to try and puzzle out the meaning of what happened here.

The familiar formula — that Jesus died for our sins — raises more questions than it answers. First, exactly how is Jesus’ death connected with our forgiveness? Why does this terrible thing lead to that wonderful thing? And who is it that wants this sacrifice anyway?

Some are content to say that God does. But surely God cannot need such a sacrifice. Consider what the prophets have to say about the offerings and sacrifices made in the temple. In Isaiah, God says, “What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? I have had enough of burnt offerings… I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.” And in Hosea: “I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.” And on Ash Wednesday, we began Lent by reciting this line from Psalm 51: “The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.”

Throughout his ministry, Jesus questioned the authority the temple claimed as the sole arbiter of God’s grace. Every time he broke one of the rules by healing on the Sabbath or eating with someone considered unclean, he was saying that God’s love embraces everyone. No one controls access to God’s grace. God’s love is bigger than you think it is.

But if God did not desire Jesus’ death in this way, then who did? Why did this happen?

To answer that question, we have to fill in some of the story that’s missing from the Palm Sunday liturgy. We began this morning by waving our palm branches in the air, celebrating Jesus’ “Triumphal Entry” into Jerusalem. Jesus and his disciples have come from the countryside, where his ministry began, to celebrate Passover in the ancient city. Jesus knew the crowds would be there — he wanted to bring his message to as many people as possible, and to confront the religious authorities in the temple head on.

Mark’s timeline for the whole week of Passover is surprisingly precise. Because of this, we can work out that Jesus would have entered Jerusalem on the Sunday before Passover. The Palm Sunday liturgy then skips over several days of that Passover week, and several chapters of Mark’s Gospel, and the next thing we know, it is Thursday evening. Jesus’ disciples are preparing the Passover meal, as Mark says, “on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed.” But it’s what happens between Sunday and Thursday that helps explain why the authorities — both Jewish and Roman — were so keen to have Jesus killed.

Let’s fill in some of the missing pieces. First of all, Jesus’ so-called triumphal entry: although the crowds shouted Hosanna to greet him, it seems perfectly obvious that Jesus’ procession was anything but triumphant. He chose to ride into town on a young colt, the foal of a donkey. If this is hard for you to picture, imagine a large and friendly dog, about three feet tall at the shoulder. Jesus has no armor but the cloaks of peasants, and he is lauded with palm branches and leaves instead of golden eagles on spears carried in procession by Roman soldiers.

You see, it was Rome that really loved a procession. Rome excelled at using a military parade as a demonstration of its dominance, to keep its subjugated peasants in awe. And Jesus knew that Pilate, the Roman Governor, made a point of riding from his capital city on the Mediterranean coast every Passover, to make sure these crowds of peasants in Jerusalem stayed in line. Picture Pilate on a magnificent war horse and surrounded by a legion of Roman soldiers in red and gold armor, marching in lockstep as they enter the city gates.

Jesus’ little street parade, in contrast, with the donkey and the palm fronds, is an anti-imperial protest. He’s mocking the empty pomp of the empire, questioning the brutality with which Rome ruled the peasant class and kept Judea impoverished.

After taking on the empire, Jesus goes straight to the temple. The day after that peace demonstration, Jesus takes over the temple courtyard, the heart of the action during Passover week, and stages a teach-in. Remember Jesus overturning the tables of the money changers? Well, that’s what he did on the Monday before Passover. He tells thinly veiled parables about the religious leaders which cast them in a very bad light. This goes on for several days. By the time Wednesday has come around, Jesus denounces them openly: “Beware of the scribes,” he says, “who like to walk around in long robes, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces… They devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearances say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”

They devour widows’ houses: that is Jesus’ accusation against the religious authorities. They think they control access to God’s grace by controlling the temple. The only way to get a little of that grace was to pay up: all those money changers were there to facilitate your purchase of the correct sacrificial animal, which, for the right price, the priests would offer to God on your behalf. The price was the same whether you were a poor widow or a rich merchant.

From the start of his ministry, Jesus’ central message has been, “The Kingdom of God is at hand!” And that is a dangerous message, for it challenges both the secular and the religious authorities. If God is King over all, then Caesar is not. And in Jesus’ vision of God’s Kingdom, God’s love is not mediated by priests at the temple but is free and available to all. Is it any wonder that both the Jewish and the Roman leaders wanted Jesus dead?

Nailing him to a cross was supposed to be the final solution. Get rid of the rabble-rouser, silence him, and his message would die with him. Crucifixion was the world’s way of saying no to everything Jesus stood for.

The world says no to Jesus — but God says yes. This is the good news that Peter preaches on the day of Pentecost: “God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified.” It’s the first attempt at explaining what happened on Good Friday. The world rejects Jesus’ message and tries to silence him in death — but God vindicates Jesus and raises him to life. The horror and violence we inflict on an innocent man shows the depth of human evil and the ultimate defeat of human power, by revealing the moral bankruptcy of human beings left to our own devices. But God’s love as revealed in Jesus is life itself: Love that can never be silenced, never be killed. Love that will restore our lost humanity.

Out of this terrible violence, God has made an opening between heaven and earth. At the very end of the Passion narrative, at the moment of Jesus’ death, Mark tells us that “the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.” This is the veil in the temple that separated the people from the power and love of God — the veil that contained God’s presence, and behind which only the high priest was allowed to go.

This veil was torn asunder, and God’s love is no longer contained in a temple. Jesus’ redeeming work was to confront those who tried to keep God locked up. Jesus’ life and teaching have shown us a new way. The scandal of the cross is that now, God’s love can go anywhere and reach anyone. Even those who are different from us. Even those who don’t deserve it. Even those who don’t believe. God’s love now permeates the whole universe and continually pulls us from death into life, with each breath we take, from the beginning of time until the end.

Amen.

862f2u,296,2018-03-21,Anthony Yigit - I wanted to share the story of my boxing career and the struggles that comes with it.,DigItYigit,Boxing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/862f2u/anthony_yigit_i_wanted_to_share_the_story_of_my/,"I’m sitting in my one room apartment in Las Palmas, Spain, getting mentally prepared to go out for a run even though all my muscles in my body ache. Luckily all I got on schedule today is this 45 min run and then some technical work in the evening. It’s nothing too demanding and it gives me the opportunity to work on things I need to improve. 

I love this life. Ever since I started boxing I’ve been traveling to get a better understanding of what it means to be a fighter.

 After only six months of stepping in to the boxing gym for the first time I got sent to one of the former soviet countries: Moldova – the poorest country in Europe. Even though the nation only has a population of 3 million something people they’ve always been competing on the world level in amateur boxing. I was going to stay there for two months (my whole summer vacation). I could barely box and I remember the first day we got there and we all were going to sparr. I didn’t last long in the ring with any of them. They were too good with years of experience so we had to cut the sparring short. There were lots of people there watching. Even the Moldovian Olympic head coach and the Olympic team was there. I was so embarrassed and I vowed to never give up or show any weakness like that in the ring again.

 The camp was a success. I mostly worked with and sparred their 49 kg Olympic bronze medalist (I was 60 kg at the time) and got my ass whooped a lot but left Moldova with experience I know I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere else. I dare say this was a great boost to my confidence and experience. This was back in 2007. My trainer at the time always sent us to training camps in Ukraine, Moldova, Poland and the sorts, where boxing has a really high standard. I was used to going places and get my butt kicked but somehow, even as a 15-16-year-old, I knew that it was going to benefit me in the long run. It did.

 I won the Swedish championships and got a place in the national team. As a kid from the Swedish suburbs where economic and living standards still are high compared to real suburbs in, let’s say America, England, France or other Industrial countries, the social problems were many. Drugs and gang related crimes – also mostly about drugs were high. Therefor was it important for me to find some kind of success in something I did. It allowed me to dream. To realize that I write my own destiny. I really believe boxing saved me from falling into that pit of violence, crime and gangs that were surrounding us. I’m not violent by nature and I know the ones who chose to join gangs weren’t either. – no. “Chose” is not the right word for it. I’ve seen the drugs and violence consume my friends slowly until it ended up killing them or leaving them almost unrecognizable. They were victims of a society that chose to not help those who needed it the most. I’m not going to debate politics or how a social structure should be built or look like because I know nothing of the sort. All I know is: I had to fight the hard fight to get out of Jordbro - the place where I grew up but I know a lot of other talents and smarter people than me that didn’t have the same luck. I was lucky, yes, because I had great teachers in my school whom knew the situation in the area where they were working and they kept that in mind while teaching us, making sure we knew that the gangs and drugs were a life for losers. I had grown up friends from the gym whom I could look up to instead of the big boys with guns from our neighborhood. I still did a lot of shitty things with my friends when I was young but somehow I always dragged my ass to the gym. Sometimes I hated it. “Aww, man, I wanna go party but I need to get up early and train tomorrow.” I hated it but I did it. I’m thankful for it now. My coach also grew up in Jordbro and he did his fair share of shit when he was younger so he knew what the streets were capable of and the temptations for 16-year-old me. He could call me up at 2 am, when I’m home sleeping, making sure I’m in fact home and not out partying or causing mischief. He was strange, his old life caught up with him so he took pills and stuff but I do have a lot to be thankful to him for.

 I continued boxing and got a summer internship at the gym where I trained. I trained in the mornings, cleaned the gym, trained in the evenings, locked up and then also slept there. The gym was about an hour away from where I lived so it made sense to stay over. I had the keys and everything. It also gave me full access to the cash register. I didn’t steal much but I could take some money and justify it by saying “lunch money”. My life started to revolve around boxing. I skipped school a lot for the right reasons: training, fighting abroad and tournaments and so on. I really believed I had something special. Something most people didn’t have. I was willing to train HARD and commit 110%. I made sure I trained the hardest. I could wake up in the middle of the night, panicking because maybe someone, somewhere were training while I was sleeping so I would go out for a night run just to fight my demons in my head and get that extra training in.

 By being part of the national team, I got to go to the European championships and I got to the quarter finals. It earned me a spot to try to qualify for the 2012 Olympics in the 2011 world championships in Baku.

 By this time I got kicked out of home and moved to my aunt who was living off of social security. My conscience wouldn’t allow me to stay there and eat her food because I had no money and wasn’t working. So I crashed at several friends houses and my then girlfriend. I managed to qualify to the Olympics in the world championship after winning two fights and then losing to the Brazilian whom later became world champion.

 I was so proud I had qualified. I quit high school and moved to my trainer whom have moved to Spain so I could give my 100% in training. I had one chance to do something with my life and I was going to take my shot. I was going to eat, sleep, train and live boxing for a year, make my statement in the Olympics and then take it from there.

The Olympics came. I was the first Swede to win an Olympic boxing bout in 16 years (I’m also the last swede to win an Olympic boxing bout to this date) and after what was regarded as one of the best fights in the 2012 Olympics against Ukrainian Denis Berinchyk, which I lost in a close decision, the Olympics were over for me and I was thinking about going back to an ordinary life in Sweden. You know, Study, work and all that. However, I started to get a lot of professional boxing contract proposals, also from the states but I finally came to an agreement with Sauerland Promotions in Germany. 

There was still a curfew on Pro- boxing in Sweden at the time so I did most of my fights in Denmark but I also fought on the Froch – Kessler II undercard in the UK. That was cool. Sauerland were trying to resurrect boxing in Sweden with Swedish star Erik Skoglund as the front man. It was actually working but because of Swedish laws it was still hard to get most fights approved by the commission. That’s why I fought most of my fights abroad. I fought Danes in Denmark, brits in the UK and Germans in Germany. I was getting used to being the away fighter and that’s why I wasn’t getting any recognition back home. I didn’t have a steady fanbase. Because I wasn’t seen enough. I DID have a main event in Sweden, defending the European title against Spanish Sandor Martin and I really gave the Swedish crowd a fight they perhaps haven’t seen in decades. By being the first Swede in over 50 years to defend the European title you would think I would get recognized more but boxing is such a small sport in our country.

 I love being under the radar though. I get to connect with people whom really matter the most to me. My fanbase is small and I know most of them by name (or Instagram name) and I love coming here to reddit, commenting and see what you guys write and think about my fights, other fights and so on. The reason I’m writing this is because you’ve all heard when people say “all you see is the glory, you never see what happens behind the curtains or in the gym, leading up to the fight or the world title”. I’m training hard and sacrificed so much. It’s a very ungrateful sport and you must be really crazy to do it and to love it. The hard part is not to train hard or stay disciplined. The hard part is life in itself. Life is going to throw so much at you and it’s going to be so tempting to just quit and be able to blame It on something or decide to do something that has a higher success rate. I mean, let’s be real: I ain’t even world champion (yet) and I’m scared to know how much more I will have to sacrifice to get to where I dream of being. I fight with doubts and insecurities everyday and there isn’t really anyone I can turn to because I got to where I am all by myself so I had to rely on and only trust on myself and my instincts.
 
With all this being said: I love my life and I love the decisions I’ve been taking because I’ve met so many true friends that share my goal along the way. I’m in a much better place now than I was 5-6 years ago and that’s why I feel like I can share this with you and It IS boxing related so I feel this belongs here. 

Btw, next fight is a title defense (again) 5 may In Paris against french Franck Petitjean and then moving down to lightweight as planned and hopefully a USA debut soon!

862mfv,1,2018-03-21,Far Left Nut Michael Tomasky at Daily Beast Says Mueller Investigation is Worse than Watergate – He’s Right But Not in the Way He Thinks!,peterboykin,TheMAGANetwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMAGANetwork/comments/862mfv/far_left_nut_michael_tomasky_at_daily_beast_says/,"Guest post by [Joe Hoft](http://www.joehoft.com)

### Yesterday the Drudge Report linked to a report from the [Daily Beast’s Michael Tomasky](https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-this-is-going-to-be-worse-than-watergate) that states that the fraudulent Mueller Investigation is ‘going to be worse than Watergate’ – Nutty Lib Tomasky forgot to mention that fellow [lefties at Buzzfeed are being sued](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-suing-buzzfeed-fusion-gps-over-dossier) for millions for their fake news reporting of the Trump dossier – the entire basis behind Watergate – er, the Mueller investigation.

**What a nonsensical piece of fiction** – Tomasky quotes nutty liberal NYT reporter and “[Hillary Flunky](http://freebeacon.com/politics/trump-calls-nyt-reporter-maggie-haberman-a-hillary-flunky-says-she-is-not-given-access/)” Maggie Haberman in his article.

Haberman apparently believes she has the psychic telepathic ability to know what Trump is thinking and so she clearly fits well in Tomasky’s soliloquy:

The temperature’s rising. _The New York Times_’ Maggie Haberman [reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/trump-tweets-mueller.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) that this president feels he really knows how to do this job now, and from here on in we’re going to see Trump unchained. So the Trump we’ve been seeing has been chained? God help us.

**Leftists like Tomasky and Haberman have a lack of understanding of history, let alone current events.** These rare gifts, along with grandiosity of immense proportions sustained by fellow leftists who attend their cocktail parties in Manhattan lead to their reckless reporting and inability to accurately predict Presidential elections, let alone current events.

**Leftists conveniently forget that the last President who was impeached was none other than Hillary’s husband (in name only) Bill.** He lied and obstructed justice but felt that this was little reason to resign from office, let alone for stopping the flow of teenage interns into the White House.  Fortunately, a small fraction of the small crowds that attended Hillary rallies in 2016, reminded us all that “Bill Clinton’s a rapist”, no doubt jiggering memories of the former President’s glory days.  Even CNN had to admit that Bill Clinton is also a redneck.

Tomasky believes that dirty cop Robert Mueller’s investigation is worse than Watergate:

Where are we headed? If Trump fires Sessions and brings in whomever, and that person does fire Mueller, we will be in the midst of a major constitutional crisis. The standard line is “the worst since Watergate.” But this one is looking like it could be far worse than Watergate. Why?

Because in 1973, we had a Republican Party with some independent-minded lawmakers in it.

**Sure thing Michael.**

Because of Tomasky’s blinders he is unable to see that half the Republican Party was not and is not behind the current President. Trump won because Americans wanted him, not Democrats and certainly not all Republicans.  Does Tomasky realize that “NeverTrumpers” were not Democrats but Republicans?

Tomasky also is unable to see the criminal actions taken by the deep state and leftovers from the corrupt Obama Administration who are fighting like hell to remove the President from office.

**Jeff Sessions recused himself for no reason other than to blindside the President only days after swearing in as AG.** The Assistant AG, Rosenstein is knee deep in Uranium One along with the crook he hired to run the Trump – Russia collusion investigation, Robert Mueller.  Mueller has more conflicts of interest than any appointed special counsel in US history.  Mueller’s entire team is Obama – Clinton radicals.  Mueller met with former FBI Director Comey before the latter testified in front of Congress.  Comey and Mueller are bff’s.  No way is this an independent and objective investigation.  Any professionals with the conflicts of Mueller, Rosenstein and Mueller’s team would recuse themselves from this “Witch Hunt”, but not these crooks.

Rosenstein’s two sentence directive for Mueller was unconstitutional and Paul Manafort is suing Mueller, Rosenstein and Sessions as the Head of the DOJ because of this. Rosenstein, Comey and McCabe signed off on the fraudulent FISA warrants that were awarded to spy on the President while he was a candidate.  The dossier used to support the illegal spying was created by the Hillary campaign.  Rosenstein apparently has no problem with this conflict but believes Sessions who bumped into a Russian before the election should have recused himself?

Mueller’s investigation has found nothing to date. His top investigator was having an affair with another member of his team.  They apparently only had time for sex and texts.  When their thousands of texts were found, Congress requested them, but only a handful of the million or so documents requested from the FBI and DOJ have been provided to date.  The latest texts show that members of the Mueller team were dining with one of the FISA Court judges.

Mueller continues to abuse his power and run rampant in his never ending witch hunt. He has no oversight, other than crooked Rosenstein, so he really has none.  God only knows how much Mueller is spending of tax payer dollars.  God only knows when he will end the witch hunt.

### Yes, but Tomasky and Haberman continue to believe that this is worse than Watergate. It actually is – but not in the way they see it for sure.

862u1k,61,2018-03-21,Late last week at Rockstar HQ...,UnclePab03,gtaonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/862u1k/late_last_week_at_rockstar_hq/,"So Dave, what's the verdict? It’s Thursday and New York is pushing for an answer.

Bad news. The clipping issues with the new vehicle type were fixed, but the Naval Operations Center failed QABeta again. It seems the size of the model is causing problems. We probably should have opted for something stationary in retrospect. In any case, this entire content package revolves around the NOC, so we need to start looking at alternatives. You have a moment to go over some options?

Make it fast. I have a meeting in 15 minutes.

The hotring filler content is done, and we could probably add a few vehicles to transform races. But really the only option we have is to release at least some of the content from the Naval Warfare package next week.

Ugh… what a disaster. Fine, but not more than half a dozen cars from Naval. I’m also fine with just a helicopter or a sea plane but nothing weaponized and certainly no hovercrafts. Naval needs to be the new meta upon release and not before. Just include some more sports classics and maybe an electric super or a rally car. Also, our designers can usually provide some shelved content if you push hard enough. They scrap way too much as it is. Have I ever told you how I barely managed to stop Thomas from deleting the Torero model that was created by one of the interns? Imagine his face when it still sold for almost a million!

Yeah, I’ve already asked Design for shelved content. There’s a list of cars, but we’ll need another week to address some concerns. To name a few: the Vulcar Fagaloa is good quality, but the engine model is still a work in progress. The GB200 doesn’t have functional rally fogs so that one still needs to be updated to current standards. Thomas still hasn’t finished the new suicide doors for the new Entity and the Jester classic never received any liveries since it was put on hold. Finally, the look and feel of some of the shelved supercars were deemed to be either too controversial or too crude. Design wanted to take a further look at them first.

Listen Dave.. our players should be happy that we even release the Jester after shelving further development of the Benny content package. Just add the generic tuner engine model to the Fagaloa and release the rest as is. Nobody cares about working fog lights or suicide doors, and the looks of those shelved supercars will probably appeal to our younger players. Just get it done Dave. I need to be able to tell New York that we will release something after the weekend.

Okay.. But to be fair, Marketing is going to struggle with this. It’s quite an inconsistent list of vehicles and no substantial content.

Nonsense Dave. Its mostly cars right? Sell it as a racing update. Just name it something like San Andreas.. ehm.. Super Speed … Sports. Series. Or something. Yeah, that’s gold. Write down that name and have the marketing boys create something around the Hotring content. Also, make sure our designers add more transform races within the next couple of weeks.  And some race suits! Any generic design in a few different colors will do just fine for now. We’ll just have to make do.

Got it. Thanks.

Oh and Dave… add one of the Warstock vehicles as well. Something we don’t expect to be a sales hit anyway, like that new technical. Better get some returns on it before we release the new stealth vehicles, so bump the price a little will you? And make sure we do what we can to drain player funds in the coming weeks. Put the Dump on sale or something, it seems to be popular on Reddit. Or change the sell limit to flush out some more cheaters. And have Annie at Social put some fan art or something about Pogo on twitter. That should calm things down. People love Pogo."
863cct,1,2018-03-21,industry full time/internship vs summer research internship?,musiquesublime,foodscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/863cct/industry_full_timeinternship_vs_summer_research/,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I will be graduating from my school this May and have no idea what to do next afterwards.

I changed my major to food science (originally undecided) at the end of my sophomore year. Most of my summer breaks were spent taking classes in order to catch up and graduate on time, so I haven’t had any industry internships yet. I’ve been applying to both internships and full time jobs since the beginning of the school year; I’ve had some phone interviews for product development and technical sales, but otherwise I keep sending out applications, reviewing my resume/cover letter, and haven’t had any luck yet.

This year, I also wanted to get some more research experience, so I started working in one of my professor’s research lab for food microbiology, and I really love what I’ve learned so far. I asked my professor if my university offers research opportunities to students who have graduated, and he offered me an opportunity to intern at his lab for the summer and is also willing to pay a stipend to help with housing arrangements.

I’m super excited for the opportunity, since this is a lab that I am seriously considering to apply to for graduate school in the future; but I’m also really nervous about failing because my professor will use the internship to see if I fit as a potential graduate student; and I feel like I still have a lot to learn with the background material, since his research uses more biology and biochemistry lab techniques/concepts that my food science classes haven’t really gone over.

I also know for my major in particular, getting industry experience is really important, especially when it comes to finding full time jobs, and I’m honestly interested in every aspect of the field (e.g. product development, sensory, food safety, etc.); and based on what I've discussed with my family so far, it seems like they don't really want me to do this research internship and think it's better to go home and find work in industry. So I’m wondering which one would be better to pursue?

Tl;dr: Undergrad food science student, and will be graduating in May. I’m currently applying to full time jobs and summer internships. My food microbiology professor also offered me a chance to work as a summer intern in his research lab, but I’m scared that I am going to fail and have a lot of catch up work to do if I want to make progress. Between the two options, which one would be better to continue pursuing?"
863qi7,77,2018-03-21,[MF] Co-worker in Vegas [cheating],PM_YUR_PIERCINGS,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/863qi7/mf_coworker_in_vegas_cheating/,"Just booked a trip to Vegas for a work conference and spent a few minutes remembering this encounter. 

While in Vegas for a conference a years ago my female co-worker and I were the only ones spending the last day there to break-down our booth and attend a few more workshops. 

We were also the youngest on our team. I was 29 and the lowest level manager, she was 22 and recently promoted from intern. She was a petite blonde that obsessed over her body, and always said she wanted a sugar daddy to actually give tits since she was barely an A-cup. 

As were were the only two on the last night, we decided to grab dinner and drinks. It started off pretty tame at a Mexican/sushi fusion place with two pitchers of margaritas and some great fish. 

From there I managed to get us passes into the casino's night club since I had been gambling pretty hard the last few nights with clients. Once in the club, Alex decided she wanted to only do vodka shots since she didn't want to dance with a drink in her hand. Whatever. The shitty electronic dance music pumped, she did shots, shouted ""woo hoo"", and I enjoyed watching the go-go dancers in lingerie dance in cages. 

Then she went to the bathroom, and came back with two foreign looking dudes. 

""This is Ahmed. He has Molly!""

I was all set but figured she could do what she wants. An hour later and she's a complete mess. Ahmed was trying to convince her that she should come back to his penthouse suite to party, blah, blah, blah. 

I pulled the trigger and pulled her away. She was sweating and her eyes were the size of dinner plates. She was high as could be. Just holding her arm I could feel her heart racing. I got us out of there. 

Once in my room, she wanted to keep dancing. I gave her water and told her to take a shower to cool off. I decided to pour myself a mini-bar drink. 

I was shocked when she came out of the bathroom a few minutes later naked. Her ""jam"" had come on the stereo and she needed to dance to it. 

Her obsession with her body showed and I was mesmerized as she gyrated in the middle of the room. Her hands rubbed all over herself and her pink nipples were hard on her tiny tits. Her abs were still wet from the shower, and she had the tightest little ass. I loved seeing she had a tiny blonde bush that matched her hair color. 

She grabbed a bottle of water and chugged it, but lost herself in the moment with the bottle in her mouth. She opened her eyes and looked right at me. 

""I want to suck your cock.""

I was technically engaged at the time, but it was a relationship in shambles. We hadn't had sex in 4 months, and a few weeks later I would find out she was cheating. This naked woman was begging to blow me, and I couldn't say no. 

It started with her on her knees. First sucking the tip, then bobbing her head all the way down, some absent minded stroking as she kinda weaved to the music. 

We moved to the bed so she could get a off her knees, and I stripped naked myself. The molly had her going from enthusiastically blowing me to simply holding my dick in her mouth. Her hands were all over me, and I just took it all in. At times it was like my cock was going to save her life, and other times she just forgot about it. I would go from on the verge of cumming to resetting. 

With the lack of rhythm, and her desire to have something in her mouth, the whole thing lasted 40 minutes or so. I finally told her I was going to cum and she mumbled ""in my mouth.""

The load that exploded into her throat didn't phase her, and she sucked my soul out of my body through my cock. She went on the balcony to continue dancing, and I passed out. 

The next morning I woke up first and she was passed out naked on the suite couch. My cock was hard again and I stood in the middle of the room staring at her jerking off. When I finished I covered her with a blanket and jumped in the shower. 

Her hangover was brutal and she stayed in the room all morning while I did all the work. 

We never spoke of that trip except one time she thanked me from likely getting raped if she had gone home with Ahmed. "
864oj3,1,2018-03-21,Last year I was IVC'd and I can't see a future from here,dierabbitdie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/864oj3/last_year_i_was_ivcd_and_i_cant_see_a_future_from/,"Be warned- long post ahead. 

Back in the summer of 2016, I was put on antidepressants from my family doctor. I've suffered from severe depression for as long as I can remember, and was finally ready to try some medication.
Obviously, I wanted to be seen by a real psychiatrist to evaluate if I needed to be on this medication, if it's the correct dose, etc. So I decide to go to my university's counseling center; it's free, easily accessible, and they'll work with my class schedule. 

Before I can see the psychiatrist, I must see a counselor for a few sessions. It seems fair and i agree. I get matched with an intern- I'm not too fond of his counseling style, but decide since it will only be a few visits, I'll suffer through and see if there are any suggestions he can offer as well.

Finally, it is our last appointment. Here, he will be conducting a psych assessment which will go to the psychiatrist upstairs when I begin my treatment, probably within the next week. 

We begin the assessment. Apparently I don't do too well.

Looking back, I should have been more careful with my words. I should have understood the situation I was placing my counselor in. I shouldn't have been as honest.

He asked how my day was, and I told him. I had had a bad day. It was the first official day of the spring semester, and the class I was excited for got cancelled. I went to my other class, but before I can even go, I slip on a giant patch of ice outside my car. Since I am running late, I leave anyways and head to class, cold and soaked.

The class is awful. A lot of bullshit, really. I'm upset and when it is over take the campus bus back to my car. 

The campus bus misses my parking lot. Just skips it, both ways. I try to say something to get him to stop, but I'm anxious and don't. I get off the bus where I boarded, and proceed to angrily walk towards the parking lot.

I reach a crosswalk that leads to my car. It is a law that cars must yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, and the speed limit is 20 mph on this stretch of road. I am angry. I think to myself ""fuck it, let a car hit me.""

this is considered a suicide attempt.


My therapist is concerned. He tells me he would like me to be further evaluated at the local crisis center, as they can probably find a psychiatrist to see me sooner than the schools. I agree, although I do not really have a choice. My friend drives me to the center as I am not allowed to bring my car (should have been my first red flag). I wait two hours to be seen. I text my SO, tell him where I am, and not to worry- I should be home for dinner. My phone dies, and I write his name and contact information on my forms as my emergency contact.

Finally, I am to be evaluated by another professional. She has been told I ran into traffic, and sees my side of the story as me attempting to minimize. She asks me if I would consider inpatient care- and I tell her no. Because from what I have been told, I am here to find outpatient care. She asks me some more questions, and keeps leaving the room. Checking her phone, goofing off with her intern. She asks me if I;ve ever hurt myself before, and I tell her yes- for the last time when I was 14. Six years ago. 
She again asks me if I would consider inpatient care, this time if she recommended it. I again told her no, that I was excited to start my semester and really didn't think it was necessary.

 If there was ever a mistake, there it was.

She tells me considering the circumstances, she'll have to talk to her boss to decide where to go from here. I am to wait in the waiting room. Again, I wait for two more hours. Eventually, I have a cigarette with another individual waiting. As we are smoking, a police officer arrived.

The other individual assumes he's there for him. The officer informs us the papers he has are actually for me. Out comes the woman who assessed me. She tells me because I did not volunteer for inpatient therapy, I have been involuntarily committed. 

Obviously I am disheveled. The cop is very nice, puts me in his car and drives me to the emergency room in another county- about forty-five minutes away.

On the way there, he tells me about how this crisis center does this all the time when they are about to close. They just send everyone to the ER so they're not held liable. That I'll see a doctor and be home by midnight.

We reach the emergency room, and the waiting game begins again. After another hour and a half, a nurse comes in to collect a urine sample and all of my personal belongings. I wait another half hour until a doctor eventually shows up (sidenote- bless these cops. stayed with me the whole time up until this point. they gave me hope and helped advocate for me)
He asks me if I know why I am here. 

I tell him- quite frankly, fucking no! 
I was told I was going to the crisis center to receive outpatient care, and now I've been IVC'd. He takes this as me being delusional, and possibly having a psychiatric break.

He tells me he has to take a phone call and leaves the room. Shortly after, a security guard comes in and escorts me down the hall, into another room. 

Immediately after I enter, so does the doctor. He tells me that this is a locked room, and I will not be able to leave until I am seen by a psychiatrist and properly evaluated. They'll be here in the morning, so I will be sleeping here tonight. 

I am a young woman, and I was placed in a locked room with four grown men with psychiatric conditions to sleep. 

I ask to call my SO, and am told the phones actually  cut off at ten, and it's ten thirty, so no. At this point. I break down. I throw a goddamn fit, and they give me the phone to shut me up.

It turns out, he found out through the friend who drive me which hospital I was at. He left work early, drove to the hospital, and was told they had no record of me- even though I listed him as my emergency contact for this particular visit. 

I am livid, and he talks me down. Tells me it will be okay, and he'll come pick me up tomorrow when I see the psychiatrist and this nightmare ends. The nurse makes it obvious she wants the phone back, so we end our call and I proceed to try to sleep. 

The next morning, the psychiatric nurses evaluate us. When it comes my turn, again- ""you seem fine! you'll be out of here in no time when you see the psychiatrist!"". 

But the psychiatrist never comes? All day long, every other patient is seen, but I am not. 
Every other patient is also given their meds- I am not. 
I ask five times for my medication and ask when I will see the psychiatrist. I never do see the psychiatrist, but my meds do come. At twice the dosage I am prescribed. I tell them, and take half. 

Finally, the nurse tells me that a sheriff will be here for me shortly. That they have found a bed for my at a psychiatric hospital over three hours away.

I am livid. I have not seen a psychiatrist, and now a sheriff is coming to take me three hours FURTHER away from my home? I ask to speak to a patient advocate. The nurse **tells me this regional hospital I am currently in, does not have one.**

Before I know it, the sheriff is here for me. She puts me in shackles, and marches me out of the emergency room in my paper scrubs. Everyone stares at me like I am a criminal. She puts me in the back of her car and drives. She does not speak to me. She is not as nice as the police officers who drove me to the ER. 

I finally reach the hospital where I will reside for about five days.  Although I have my complaints about this particular hospital, compared to the experiences before my admittance, I am pleased to be there. 

I am released, and although angry, exhausted, and properly traumatized by my experience, I feel ready to really attack my mental health problems.
I look forward to my meeting with my therapist at the end of the week. I need to discuss what happened to me. 

I get a call from the schools counseling center telling me I will not be seeing my normal therapist. That I will have to make a different type of appointment.

I oblige. And at this appointment, they release me from their care. I am told not to come back to the counseling center, and given a list of potential providers- none of which take my insurance OR are accepting new clients. 



Fast forward to this year. I have not seen a mental health care provider sense. I feel scared, I'm failing my classes because my medication is making me oversleep. I have panic attacks at night thinking about when I was ""abducted by the state""  and worry it will happen again. I'm now terrified to even see mental healthcare provider. I feel like i have no autonomy in any of those offices, I feel that I cannot trust a therapist ever again. 

I don't know what to do. I'll never be successful if i don't get the help i need, but I'm terrified to get it at this point. My entire experience has made me feel even more helpless to my mental illness. I feel like this is something I will never be able to overcome, that it will always have a grasp on my life.

""The release of DSM-5 in 2013 garnered much controversy.  Dr. Allen Frances, chair of the APA task force that oversaw the prior edition, criticized the new effort for its medical/biological bias, and for expanding the scope of psychiatric disorders in ways that shrink the range of normality.  Thousands of mental health clinicians and researchers signed petitions opposing the new edition for similar reasons.  The NIMH declared it would no longer use DSM diagnoses in its research, because DSM definitions were products of expert consensus, not experimental data.  Like psychoanalysis before it, the new dominant paradigm, psychiatry as a ""neurobiological"" specialty, had also overreached.""

SUICIDAL AND HOMOCIDAL BECAUSE OF THE DRUGS

Regularly we hear in the news about some psychiatric patient that has committed murder. They never mention the fact that most of these psychiatric patients in question have become homicidal because of the prescribed psychiatric drugs.
The manufacturer of Prozac (Ely Lilly) knew already in 1978 of these adverse effects of Prozac. In 1988 an intern report of Ely Lilly showed that 38% of the users of Prozac suffered from “reactions”. Not only are studies of the psychiatric drugs manipulated, but also judicial trials: https://www.cchrint.org/2012/07/20/the-aurora-colorado-tragedy-another-senseless-shooting-another-psychotropic-drug/
The following article explains how this works, including at least 35 school shootings with 79 killed (including the 1999 Columbine high school) and at least 25 other acts of violence with 251 dead (including the airplane crash on March 24, 2015 in France that killed 150): https://www.cchrint.org/2012/07/20/the-aurora-colorado-tragedy-another-senseless-shooting-another-psychotropic-drug/
The actual number of violence related to psychiatric drugs is much higher: between 2004 and 2012, there have been 14,773 reports to the U.S. FDA about psychiatric drugs causing violence. The FDA estimates that less than 1% of all serious events are reported.
Here´s some scientific looking evidence to proof that psychiatric drugs cause violence. The following report shows that from 484 evaluable drugs, 31 cause violence, these 31 drugs accounted for 1527 out of 1937 cases of violence (79%): Varenicline (place 1), Fluoxetine (Prozac, place 2), Paroxetine (3), Amphetamines, Mefloquine, Atomoxetine, Triazolam, Fluvoxamine, Venlafaxine, Desvenlafaxine, Montelukast, Sertraline, Zolpidem, Escitalopram, Sodium oxybate, Citalopram, Aripiprazole, Oxycodone, Bupropion, Ziprasidone, Methylphenidate (Ritalin), Mirtazapine, Gabapentin, Levetiracetam, Diazepam, Alprazolam, Duloxetine, Clonazepam, Interferon alfa, Risperidone (Risperdal), Quetiapine (place 31). See Moore et al, Prescription Drugs Associated with Reports of Violence Towards Others (2010): http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015337
One of the drugs that make patients/victims homicidal is Wellbutrin (also known as Bupropion and Zyban), although it´s not even in the top 31 drugs of Moore et al.
Here´s the connected story about how GlaxoSmithKline settled a law suit for 3 billion dollar regarding the illegal promotion of the drugs Advair, Avandia, Paxil and Wellbutrin in situations that were not approved by the FDA. GlaxoSmithKline paid TV-doctor Dr. Drew Pinsky (of “Lifechangers” and “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew”) $275,000 in 1999 to advertise Wellbutrin on his shows: https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-allege-glaxo-paid-dr-drew-dollar275000-to-tout-anti-depressant


ECT - ELECTROSHOCKS

Not so long ago I found out that even these days psychiatric patients get tortured with ElectroConvulsive Therapy (ECT). It is known that ECT causes memory loss and confusion, which apparently is the desired effect.
Here’s a literature review on ECT Read and Bentall “The effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy” (2010): http://www.mindfreedom.org/kb/mental-health-abuse/electroshock/ect-review-2010-read-bentall.pdf


LOBOTOMIES

In the mid-19th century they already stopped performing lobotomies (surgery to remove part of the brain), because it only had negative effects. In the 1940s this was reason to reinstate lobotomies in all its glory (using an ice-pick for the operation). The Nobel Prize committee awarded António Egas Moniz in 1949 for perfecting the art of lobotomies.
By the late 1970s, the practice of lobotomy had generally ceased (on mental patients), but have returned under a new name, lobectomy, which is only used to treat epilepsy (and other seizure disorders). Here’s a good story on the history (and present practice) of lobotomies: http://www.wired.com/2011/03/lobotomy-history/
There are even now psychiatrists that want to reinstate lobotomies in all its glory.



EXAMPLES

In the Rosenhan experiment in 1972 8 mentally sane pseudo patients complained about voices in their head and were admitted to institutions. They behaved “normal” but the only way they could escape from the claws of psychiatry was to admit they were sick and take the medicine (which they dumped in the toilet). They eventually escaped with the remarkable diagnosis “schizophrenia in remission”; one of them was locked up for 52 days.
In 1943 Ezra Pound was sentenced for treason for his support of fascism in the 1930’s and 1940’s while living in Italy. Instead of standing trial, he was declared insane and locked up in St Elizabeth’s hospital from 1945 until 1958. Pound was called a terrible traitor to the USA (“worse than Hitler” according to Arthur Miller), fascist, anti-Semite and insane (he wanted the usurping banks stopped). Judge two of his papers for yourself: http://vho.org/aaargh/fran/livres8/PoundCausesofWar.pdf

https://www.economist.com/node/4400883

Nobel Prize winner Ernest Hemingway, a protégé of Ezra Pound, committed suicide in 1961 because they tortured him with ECT.
One of the few horrible examples that’s reasonably described is Garth Daniels: https://www.madinamerica.com/2016/05/psychiatry_garth_daniels/


THE FUTURE - NEUROSCIENCE

For many years psychiatrist keeps telling that horrendous practices are a thing of the past.
There are plans to use new high tech neuroscience to treat psychiatric patients (with electroshocks) much more efficiently, while technology could also be used to diagnose mental disease. If everything goes according to plan, the new psychiatric patients/victims can be found without some human psychiatrist that might actually try to help a psychiatric victim: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/22/brains-neuroscience-prozac-psychiatric-drugs

PSYCHIATRY TO CONTROL THE WHOLE POPULATION

Because of psychiatry the number of psychiatric victims is steadily rising. Robert Whitaker describes that at the beginning of the 20th century less than 2 out 1000 Americans were mentally ill; by 1955 this had jumped to 3.38 per 1000, while in 2003 this was 19.7 per 1000. The number of mentally ill Americans has dramatically increased from 3.7 in 1987 to 5.7 million in 2005: http://www.cchr.org/sites/default/files/Anatomy_of_an_Epidemic_Psychiatric_Drugs_Rise_of_Mental_Illness.pdf
Psychiatry has nothing to do with mental health care, but is an extreme form of population control.

LITHIUM

Lithium is interesting from a historic perspective because it was already used in the 19th century to treat psychiatric patients. In Denmark the brothers Carl and Frederik Lange started using Lithium for the treatment of melancholic depression in the mid 1880s. But wasn’t used in the first half of the 20th century (possibly because it wasn’t effective?). The modern revival of Lithium began in 1949 when John Cade in Melbourne, Australia started experimenting with lithium on his manic patients/victims. The real breakthrough began in 1952, when Erik Strömgren, in Risskov, Denmark undertook an experiment on the effect of Lithium in the treatment of mania: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3712976/

Lithium blocks the functioning of the nervous system to result in a drowsy, lethargic and slowed up (zombielike) feeling. On the short term this stops the exited, manic state in manic-depressed people, but on the long term there’s only adverse effects (like all psychiatric drugs). Lithium causes permanent memory and mental dysfunction (dementia), depression, a decline in neurological function and quality of life. Long-term lithium exposure also causes severe kidney failure. Withdrawal from Lithium can cause manic-like episodes and psychosis.
Also interesting, regarding the broader subject of an out of control psychiatry. George Winokur found out that in the USA between 1934 and 1944 psychiatric patients with an episode of mania had a relapse at a rate of 15% per year. Margaret Harris and David Healy found that in a North Wales asylum in the 1890s, the relapse rate was 20% a year. In the 1990s, people with manic depression had a much higher average relapse rate of 31% per year: https://joannamoncrieff.com/2015/07/01/reasons-not-to-believe-in-lithium/


BENZODIAZEPINES

Some of the effects of Benzodiazepines are: sedation (tranquillity), cognitive impairment, extreme agitation, homicidal, psychosis, paranoia, depression, aggression, and addiction. But the withdrawal effects are possibly even worse: anxiety, insomnia, psychosis, agitation, aggression, and even seizures.
One study showed that Triazolam has even worse adverse effects than other Benzodiazepines (temazapam/Restoril and flurazepam/Dalmane). See the following report by Peter Breggin: http://breggin.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/analysisof.pbreggin.1998.pdf

The following meta-analysis shows that benzodiazepines results in cognitive impairment - Barker et al, Cognitive Effects of Long-Term Benzodiazepine Use (2004): http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.4030&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf


LEAD

What I’m trying to describe in this thread is that psychiatry is in fact using poisons to make the lower classes inferior. Lead poisoning is very interesting in this context, because it’s mostly the poor that suffer, and because the half year life of the lead in the brain is 2 years (while only 35 days in the blood), the effects are especially large on the functioning of the brain.
Lead has been used in many poor households: in toys, house paint, gasoline, and in the water supply. Lead infection has a variety of adverse effects: disrupts neurotransmission, impairs the brain, and impairs the cognitive and neuropsychological development. The adverse effect in children are even worse: neuropsychological impairment, poorer reasoning, less verbal skills, slowed fine motor speed, clumsiness, abdominal cramps, anorexia, irritability, behaviour problems, vomiting, stupor, coma and seizures, and can even cause death or make them retarded. It is clear that because of lead (poisoning) in childhood, the intelligence is severely impaired, but there are differences of opinion on the size of this effect.
See Lidsky et al, Lead neurotoxicity in children… (2003): http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/brain/126/1/5.full.pdf


From the 1970s on lead has gradually been removed from houses, drinking water and gasoline, but who knows what new toxics do the most damage. And what about all of the pesticides in our food or fluoride?

The recently appointed Prime Minister of Britain - Theresa May - is advocating the (mandatory) review of all children and adolescent across the country for mental health so that Britain can become a “shared society”: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38548567

Is this the “shared society” where the poor do all the work while the rich get all the money? When you only look to the figures on psychiatric problems some 100 years ago it’s easy to see the errors – notably her claim that 25% of adults have a mental illness.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force has also recommended the screening of all children between 12 and 18 years of age for mental disorders: http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/22620-feds-seek-mental-health-testing-of-all-children-adults

Even the Sandy Hook hysteria has been used to advocate that more people should be treated by mental health care: http://www.courant.com/opinion/hc-op-wolfgang-mental-health-screening-not-for-all-20130308-story.html
Naturally mandatory tests for mental health would be useless without forced psychiatric treatment.

I will compute what this mandatory testing means based on the following example.
I will take for the estimated percentage of the population with a psychiatric disorder 0.2% in accordance with the percentage at the beginning of the 20th century.
I will assume that the tests for mental disorders are 85% reliable; that is if either 100 “sane” or “insane” people are tested for a mental disorder 15 are put in the wrong category. I am convinced that the assessment of mental disorders is nowhere near this (high) reliability.
The reason that the tests to establish mental disorders are unreliable is because the objective of psychiatry is not mental “health care”, but population control. Here’s an article by Bruce Levine that has reached a similar conclusion as me - anti-authoritarians are labelled mentally ill for political reasons: https://www.madinamerica.com/2012/02/why-anti-authoritarians-are-diagnosed-as-mentally-ill/

I will compute the percentages for 1 million people which means an estimated 2000 (0.2%) are mentally ill and 998,000 are “sane”.
Of the “sane” 998,000 we can expect that 15% are erroneously labelled mentally ill – 149,700.
Of the “insane” 2000 we can expect that 85% are rightfully labelled as mentally ill – 1,700.
In this example the mandatory assessment of mental health (that the government is pushing for) results in a percentage of 98.88% of psychiatric victims that are forced to psychiatric treatment without a psychiatric disorder.

If you don’t believe the reliability of the psychiatric assessment is “only” 85% you still have to conclude that mandatory testing would lead to many victims that get tortured (poisoned) by psychiatry without reason.
If you believe that 25% of the adults suffer of a mental disease you could very well be one of the unlucky 0.2%."

(Help?)",cranbarrier,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/865t06/decisions_decisions_help/,"I have 5 (holy moly) offers from various HCI (Human-Centered Computing, Information Science) programs around the country. I would love some feedback on making the decision. I love the cohort and students at each, so culture is not a huge factor for me. Although I am leaning towards two schools, in particular, I will post my top 3 and the situation at each:

* UC Irvine (Informatics):
When I applied initially, this was my top choice. However, I was not paired to be advised by the faculty I had applied to work with, and was assigned to a new junior faculty member who has not published much in the HCI space (ACM conferences and such). He seems very excited to work with me, but I am a bit nervous about establishing connections in the field and gaining internship and career help because this faculty member is very new and not well known. I have reached out a bit to other people I wished to work with and they are currently at capacity or on sabbatical. I also love the weather and the housing situation is great there, though the city of Irvine is stale.
 
* UC Boulder (Information Science):
I am paired with faculty who have very close research interests in mind and we seem to click really well. The program itself is junior, only 2 years old, but the two faculty are founding members and are well-known in the field. There are also some HCI heavy weights who are in the program already. I loved CU Boulder when I visited, because of the climate, proximity to both nature and Denver, and walkablility to restaurants. I am mostly nervous that there have been no PhD graduates yet, thus no internship or job data. Boulder's housing situation seems to be the most problematic of all the schools.
 
* University of Michigan (Information):
One of my faculty pairs in particular is a great research match and has ideas for my project I would love to do. There is another faculty member I am not paired with but really like as well. The funding package is also amazing here. Faculty also great really great research and job connections as it is an old program with a great track record. I like the walkability of Ann Arbor, as well. The only major downside is the weather and location. It is pretty far from the bigger cities and real nature (plus, it's flat). The snow in the winter is the worst part, though. And my partner has expressed really not wanting to move north.

I would love some insight from everyone here on these decisions. Thanks so much!"

Been lurking this sub for a while and am finally planning my first solo trip!

First of all, I am a 21 y/o M and I have in internship in Nice, so I HAVE to be in Nice on May 6, this concludes on May 20th as a travel day.  I want to go to Paris, London, Dublin, Amsterdam, Prague, Munich and Greece.  I am aiming to come home around mid-week June 20th.

I am looking for advice on the most cost-effective/travel friendly route?  Also is this doable with a total budget of $3,000?  (housing in Cannes is paid for, the 3k would be for flights in and out of Europe, travel between countries, hostels, food and other expenses) (I also potentially have a free place to crash in IRL and GRE but TBD)

I recently found a flight from the states to Nice, and then back to the USA out of Paris for $530 (anyone have experience with the reputability of fare boom.com?) and was considering doing Cannes-AThens-Prague-Munich-Amsterdam-Dublin-London-Paris.

I am having trouble figuring out the most cost effective route since there are so many possible permutations.  Is it better to get the cheapest flight in and out of Europe? or could the savings of traveling a cheaper route within Europe based on a differnent end point mitigate extra money spent on inbound/outbound flights to Europe?

Thank you so much! I sincerely appreciate any and all advice, places to stay, things to see, resources to use, I welcome it all!

This will also be my first solo travel experience, anything I should prepare myself for or expect?

I know this is definitely a loaded post, but the beginning plan Ning stages are hectic and overwhelming for a first timer.  I do not expect long responses to every point, rather I appreciate any helpful hints or tips you'd like to share!

Hello /r/Germany,

I am a United States citizen and will be interning in Berlin this summer and just learned that I will need either an Aufenthaltserlaubnis or a Visum as my internship will be running exactly 90 days. I [read online]^^1  that if I intend to start working immediately (my internship starts four days after I arrive in Berlin), I would need to get a visa from the consulate as opposed to obtaining an Aufenthaltserlaubnis. My original plan was to obtain the Aufenthaltserlaubnis the day after I arrived in Berlin, but I also [just learned]^^2  that the following is also required to apply for an Aufenthaltserlaubnis:
&gt;eine Anmeldebestätigung des Einwohnermeldeamts

It doesn't appear to me to be very likely to be able to visit both the Einwohneramt and the Ausländerbehörde on the same day, and would be a huge risk if something didn't go right and I couldn't start working the following Monday (I will be arriving on Thursday evening and I presume the government offices are closed on the weekend).

The reason why I am hesitant to get a Visum is that it is an expensive (for a college student) 6 hour one way trip that I would much rather not have to do with my full time schedule of work and school. I guess I just have a few questions:

* Has anybody been in a similar situation, where either an Aufenthaltserlaubnis or a Visum are both options for being in Germany more than 90 days? Why did you pursue one option over the other?

* I will be living through an arrangement made in WG-gesucht. There has been no exchange of money and no contract, how do I obtain the proper forms that are needed by the Einwohneramt?

* How long does the Visum process usually take? [The consulate website]^^3  says that it normally takes 1-3 months. I will be interning in a little over two months. Has anybody had any experience with the Visa timeframe?

Many thanks for your help! Mein Deustsch ist nicht so schlimm, wenn das eine Betrachtung für die Aufenthaltserlaubnis gegen das Visum ist. Ich würde mein Deutsch als ""Flißend mit einigen Grammatischen Fehlern und eine Wortwahl die meine Herkunft verratet"" beschreiben.

Vielen Dank für eure Hilfe!

I posted this over in the Canadian sub, but since my question isn’t totally linked to location, I figured I’d see what you fine folks had to say about it as well. 

So I’m a University student in Quebec (relevant because our education is super cheap). I’ve recently realized that as much as I try to stick to a budget, or track my spending with something like a bullet journal, I always give up after a few days because those quick, “tap” credit/debit card purchases add up so fast. 

To resolve this and hold myself accountable, I want to start withdrawing cash at the beginning of each week and only using that. I don’t want to set an unattainable budget, though, and end up giving up after the first week. 

Relevant info: 

- I’m a full time student
- I work an internship that pays me about 700$/month
- I get a bursary of 400$/month during the school year
- My tuition and books are paid in full by my bursary
- I live at home
- I don’t have a car
- as of May I will be working at my internship full time, making about 2,500$/month

- My monthy expenses are:
        - 110$ (phone)
        - 70$ (gym)
        - 110$ (public transit pass)
        - 40$ (assorted: netflix, apple music, adobe, etc)

Total expenses: 330$/month
Total income: 1,100$/month

I am planning on moving out for the next school year, as I’ll be starting law school. At that point I also may not receive my bursary for monthy expenses nor tuition, so I really need to save right now. I expect my rent to be roughly 800$ all in, plus another 100$ in groceries (at least). I’ll probably need to take out a loan from my line of credit, as I don’t think I’ll be able to work part time. 

So: for now, what should my weekly limit be for food, drinks, activities, etc? And, if you’re so kind- should I raise it when my income jumps in the summer? 

Thank you all so much!"
866uo3,1,2018-03-21,[22/f] I have a very strained relationship with my younger sister [19/f],0384209834023423,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/866uo3/22f_i_have_a_very_strained_relationship_with_my/,"My younger sister is extremely spoiled. My parents are both wonderful people and really tried to do the best by both of us, but somehow my sister and I ended up very different. I'll iterate through a few anecdotes, and I want people's opinions on how I should proceed with my relationship with her. 

I'll tell a few stories from the past year. So about a year ago I had a boyfriend who I was very excited about. I brought him home, and ended up in the house with just my sister and him. I had previously promised my parents that I would not allow boyfriend in my room, and I would not do anything physical with boyfriend while we were in their house. I obliged. Boyfriend and I were sitting on the couch watching a movie, he had his arm around me but that was literally it. My mom comes home suddenly looking like the devil himself was chasing her. Kicks us both out of the house, gets my super depressed boyfriend in a depressed state that ended up ruining our relationship. Ruins my relationship with my entire family for several months (I do not talk to any of them, they wont respond to my messages) And what happened? My sister evidently called up my mom ultra conservative and religious mother and told her that my boyfriend and I were doing drugs and having sex in the tv room. And my mother believed her. Over time my mom apologized, my dad apologized. My sister slowly started talking to me again but everytime I try and resolve that conflict she shuts down and ghosts me for a few days. 

Let's see. Next one would be a few weeks after I regained contact with my family. I am home from college for a week before I go off on an internship. I basically dump my clothes in my room, run over to my friend's house and spend all day there. My sister in that time finds one of my dresses, tries it on and breaks the zipper. Crappy of her, but nbd, just own up to the mistake. I call her out on it a few days later and when I'm at my internship and realize the piece of clothing is ruined, and she ghosts me for a solid 3 weeks. 

While coming home from my internship one weekend, my parents ask me to swing by and pick her up from the summer camp she's working at. Here I find out that my little sister (who strained my relationship with my mom and dad over drugs I was not doing and sex I was not having) is smoking tons of pot, and has a ring of hickies all up and down her neck. She keeps saying she can't wait for me to buy her alcohol and weed up at college. I don't smoke but whatever. I bit my tongue because I want to be her friend and cool sister. She also asked me when I first started having sex. I lied and said that I was a virgin (which was almost true at the time. I'd had sex maybe 3 times before, with the boyfriend who SHE scared off). 

Now the semester's starting. I have a new boyfriend. She wants to hang out with me and my friends (I love all my friends dearly. And wanted her to hang out with them too) So I buy some wine and hold a game night. She gets drunk pretty quickly. Had fun. Asks to hang out the following night with us. My bf is throwing a party, sure let's go hang out there. She gets reallllly drunk and starts picking fights with me over nothing! Bf takes her out into the hall and tries to talk some sense into her. She gets mad and storms back to her dorm (45 minute walk). 

She apologizes a lot the next day. Fine. I forgive her. She wants to hang out again next weekend, so I set up another drinking night. She gets wayyyy too drunk and ends up trying to fist fight me. Now my friends want nothing to do with her. Fine. Stop inviting her to things, and our relationship is reduced to her calling me crying because she got too drunk and made out with some guy and me telling her she should really cut that out. 

So my parents for my birthday gave me season tickets to a sporting game at the university. I couldn't go to all the games because of other obligations, and my mom said if I couldn't go to a game that I should offer the ticket to my sister, and if she couldnt go either, I was free to do whatever I wanted to do with it. Cool. First game I couldnt go to comes up and I offer the ticket sister, she said no. So I sold it. Sister then contacts me asking for the money. I explained to her that she was in the wrong. She gets mad and calls my mom, and my mom explained to her that she was in the wrong. I get blocked on literally EVERYTHING by my sister. Whatever, I'm pretty upset but for the most part I don't give a crap. Let her figure herself out. 

Well two months go by and my sister keeps contacting my bf about her random drunken makeout sessions that she keeps having and how much she regrets them. He keeps warning her to knock it out and control her drinking. 

Well. I go about studying and living. Don't hear from her. Life is good. Then I get a random text from her saying ""hey come over to my apartment I need to tell you something"". I go over, and she tells me about how she was raped. Well damn. I feel really bad for her, tell her to get counseling. Sit with her while she cries. Then tell her some coping strategies, tell her to report it. I invite her to a few of my social gatherings. My parents find out and freak out. And we start getting her the support she needs. It'll all be fine. 

But it wasn't fine. She drops out, refuses to do any of the paperwork associated with getting any of her tuition back. Goes and lives with my parents. And is awful towards them. Yells at them, treats my mom like her servant, picks fights with my dad, monopolizes things like the tv and couch. Forces my mom to make her vegan meals. I could go on and on and on. My parents meanwhile are saints to her. They get her the counseling she needs, provide her with anything she could want, and don't force her to work/ pay rent. They asked her to shovel the driveway when it snowed and she freaked out and refused. It's been 5 months of this. 

So I'm annoyed at her for that. Then comes my relationship with her. Once she went home she called up my best friend and bitched and screamed at her for a few hours. Then she has been exclusevily hanging out with my other best friend (who is in my hometown). Which rubs me the wrong way. She called up and bitched to my bf, and was actually one of the main reasons he cited for breaking up with me a few weeks ago. (she's now destroyed two of my relationships). 

Whenever I come home, she tells me how great I am CONSTANTLY and if I don't return the compliment she gets mad and avoids me (and not just a gentle avoids me. She makes sure I know that she's avoiding me). She's super easily offended. I can't bring people around her, they all hate her and tell me that she's a brat. 

I think the last straw was just before I started this post she texts me a picture of a dog someone was trying to get rid of. She asked if I wanted it. I asked if it was house trained, then she responds I'll ask! A few minutes later she says that we're first in line for the dog. I told her that I did not want the dog, and she blew up on me. ""I just said I'd take the dog. You can't take back your word"". 

""I did not say I wanted the dog. Read the texts""

""You know what! I really don't want to deal with your attitude right now.""

""I really don't understand how you jumped the gun so quickly and assumed that I was going to agree to this dog while knowing nothing about it.""

""Fuck off"". 

So yeah. Guys please help me. I want a good relationship with my sister so badly, I want to love her, but her lack of maturity and her selfishness are making this almost impossible. She ruins my relationships and friendships, she's a huge stressor on my parents, and she's extremely toxic on even her best days. What am I doing wrong? What can I do to help her and through her me?

867usg,4,2018-03-21,Sports nutrition,sconnieluv,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/867usg/sports_nutrition/,"I’m a current undergraduate student interested in sports nutrition. I feel like it’s a pretty emerging field and I was wondering if there is anyone on here who has experience in sports nutrition that could answer some of my questions. 

First, what kind of jobs are REALLY available? Is working with professional athletes hard to come by? What types of places would commonly hire a sports dietitian? My goal is to work for a professional sports organization but should my expectation be geared more towards health clubs (at least to begin)?

Also, as I am looking through internships, I was wondering if there are specific programs that are more reputable for sports nutrition? Going along with this, would it be better to focus more on sports nutrition dietetic internships or is the clinical route sufficient to get into the field? So far I’ve looked at Florida State and Ohio State but nothing more extensively. 

Are there any classes I should consider taking as an undergraduate that would make me a more competitive applicant towards sports internships? I’ve thought about picking up kinesiology or marketing with some extra credit I have to spare. 

Finally, is it important as a sports RD to have been an athlete? I grew up participating in dance team so “regular” sports are less familiar to me; However I have been watching sports for my entire life and understand the rules/demands but not the ins and outs of what it really means to compete in a more traditional sense. 

Any information is much appreciated! Thanks!

867wvp,0,2018-03-21,(M4F) Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/867wvp/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you.

(I must specify that any roleplay done with other individuals does not promote violence or hatred towards women. I am also only interested in roleplaying with 18+ individuals only. Anyone not 18 will be reported to DPP staff.)"

Edit: I also remember it being a “young boy” as Ron put it while telling Fez “You know what happens when you drink....sexual advances towards a young boy...” and then saying “Filthy...filthy disgusting” to Fez; lol I doubt it was an actual underage kid but I remember that because the filthy disgusting part made me laugh so hard.

It’s really interesting how Slexie is so popular. It was the ship that caught us by surprise. And we all loved them so dearly.

Alex/Izzie and Jackson/April have some pretty startling similarities. They both started as interns together and were going to the same things. I think it’s because they come off as realistic. It wasn’t about the hotshot attending falling in love with the new intern. They were equals and I think the public reacts better to storylines that are more realistic. "
868key,184,2018-03-21,I spent 5.5 years studying a field I hate and now I can't find a job.,cscareerthrowaway130,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/868key/i_spent_55_years_studying_a_field_i_hate_and_now/,"No ones gonna read this but I dont really care. I got a bachelors and masters in computer science from an Ivy League university. I've had internships at reputable companies, including one at a Big 4. Now I've been out of school for three months and I have no job. I've been sending applications to companies large and small and even a government lab and I've failed every interview that came my way. I've done hundreds of leetcode questions and still can't solve them in the interviews. Nothing is working.

The truth is that I hate this field. I hate programming and I hate problem solving and I hate contorting my mind to think that I like this shit. I was only ever a mediocre math student and programmer, and I can't design algorithms to solve problems. My last two internships, including the one at the Big 4, were total failures where I was unable to finish the project assigned to me despite staying for long hours and trying to grind through the problem.

My resume is totally unfocused. I have a lot of breadth but zero depth. I don't remember half the shit I've worked on, or even if I've worked on anything at all. I'm looking back at the commit logs for some of the group projects I've put on my resume and I honestly didn't contribute all that much to any of these. I can honestly say that if I were interviewing me *I wouldn't hire me.*

I can't think straight anymore. I used to have an amazing working memory; now i can barely hold problems in my head. I have an adult ADHD diagnosis. I take Ritalin and used to take Vyvanse. Neither has helped much and taking it probably ruined my brain. It took me a year away from school on a leave of absence to man up and start taking these meds, and they still haven't helped me focus.

I'm sitting here crying after yet another onsite in which I was yet again rejected. I dont have the problem solving skills required for a software engineering job. I cant learn new things. I dont want to look at a computer ever again for the rest of my life. I have no transferable skills and no working brain. Hell even if I did manage to get a job I would perform poorly based on my internship performance. I dont see any outs. I am ruined as a human being.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who replied. I'm seeing a lot of different avenues now, and the morning has cleared my head. Also, I'm currently 24 years old."

**Canton Docks**

Charles FitzSimmons had managed to become what lesser people might describe as “lost” in the dockland area of Canton, where he’d headed after essentially robbing the newly-dead Cornelius Thrax of a variety of classic films and long-play records. FitzSimmons had been trying to make his way back to the HMS Imperator, however it turned out that after a certain time of the day, half of the streets in the Canton docks were flooded in order to allow larger vessels access to the city. Regardless of the fact that this was clearly an example of some government scheme child being allowed to design the city’s architecture during his or her period of internship (otherwise known as slave labour), it actually seemed to be considered normal by the residents of Canton, and so FitzSimmons had found himself, with no warning, staring out over a vast expanse of water between where he was and where he wanted to be. This on its own would have been hateful enough, but in the water was a black gunship, carrying the gimpish flag of Roman the Accursed, which was easily identifiable because it was simply a shit deviantart drawing of Ronan the Accuser from Guardians of the Galaxy. As FitzSimmons was contemplating commandeering one of the smaller boats sailing around Canton Bay and sailing over to jihad Roman, the Prime Minister and Duke of Wellington rounded a corner and came bounding up to him. 

**CORNWALLIS:** Charles, whatever are you doing standing here, looking like some kind of lost little lamb?

**FITZSIMMONS:** Aye, that’s me - “lost little lamb”. My name’s Madeline fucking McCann. For your information, I actually just like the colour of the water. The strange mix of blue and yellow reminds me of an ocean full of piss. 

**CORNWALLIS:** Right, well, we’ve no time to indulge whatever latent urine fetishes you’ve developed. Hit him with the golden shower of information, Arthur!

**WELLINGTON:** After consulting with an order of bird-men, and gazing into their magical egg playing music by the band Jew Order, we’ve learned the truth about Roman the Accursed, the man who so underhandedly tried to off us during the Great Egging. Roman is actually an American actor by the name of Lee Pace, apparently a homosexual, who acted as Ronan the Accuser in that awful film from about fifty years ago, Guardians of the Galaxy. 

**CORNWALLIS:** His homosexuality is apparent when you consider the fact that he now runs around here in a gauche gimp outfit pretending to be the antagonist from his awful Marvel film. He looks like an own-brand Avatar. 

**FITZSIMMONS:** Avatar?

**CORNWALLIS:** It’s this strange furry empowerment movie from around the same time as Guardians of the Galaxy. As I remember my professor telling me in the one-month film class I took at Cambridge, it was about this crippled fuck who decided to have sex with a race of blue adult smurf cat people, and it was directed by Cameron.

**FITZSIMMONS:** Are you shitting me? Cameron directed that shite, and then people still decided to elect him again? This is a reject who not only fucked a pig, but he directed a movie about spasticated failures having sex with cats. 

The Duke of Wellington naturally felt that the conversation was getting off-track, and decided to interject.

**WELLESLEY:** Christ, can neither of you see that David Cameron’s fetish for pigs and cats has no importance here?! We’re trying to have a conversation about the true nature of Roman the Accursed! What if he were to show up right here, and right now? We wouldn’t be prepared in the slightest.

FitzSimmons turned around and pointed at the vessel currently steaming through the Cantonese harbour.

**FITZSIMMONS:** You might want to adjust your line of questioning, Darcy. 

**CORNWALLIS:** You know, if this was one of the films that Pace starred in, we would probably be expected to go like: “oh, shit!” or “christ, that’s a big bugger” right now, but we’re not going to do that, are we?

FitzSimmons and Wellesley made vague noises in agreement, although in truth, Charles had been looking forward to pulling out some kind of cinematic line. 

**WELLESLEY:** Well, I think it’s time to pay.

869dz0,1,2018-03-22,[24F4M][Flirting][Forbidden Fruit][Lust][Love]Daddy's Handsome Best Friend,courtneylovebug,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/869dz0/24f4mflirtingforbidden_fruitlustlovedaddys/,"My Dad's best friend has been around since I was 15. And was the first man I ever had a crush on. He's ten years younger than Dad. But when they had a business merger, which made them a lot of money, he invited his new friend and business partner over for dinner. Mom was happy to meet him as well. Anyone who made Dad richer made Mom happy. Meant she could get away with going shopping on her credit card more. And then just make it up to my Dad later. In private. Since I knew she really liked to use Dad's foot fetish against him. It's kind of hard to forget when you see your Dad on his knees in front of your Mom doing that. The flashy heels. The  licking. The heavy petting. And then scaring them because they were caught. All because their only female child had a nightmare and wanted to be comforted. The thought of that night and others like them still make me shiver. 



Dad's best friend though. He was like a man's man. You could tell that he kept himself in shape. And he dressed well. In tailored suits. So they would hug every part of his body just right. And give off that clean and well trimmed appeal to clients and being the Boss of his firm.  And it probably also got women to notice him in a crowd. If he went to the right bar. Seeing him like that time after time for dinner just made me melt inside and, well, between my legs. Sometimes it felt like he didn't know the affect he had on women.



When I graduated from High School he sat with my parents. Cheering me on alongside my parents as I walked across the stage. Making butterflies flit about my stomach even more. And he stayed for the graduation party that my Father threw with Mom's party planners help. There was elegant food and plenty of picnic tables in the yard for everyone to enjoy the nice weather. Dad was proud of me. I had graduated as the number one student in my class and had written a speech as valedictorian. And I had been accepted to the college my Father went to for the Fall. Yale. When he found out he was over joyed. I mean I was happy too. I was going to a really good school. So, unlike my older brother, I could follow in his footsteps and work in field of law. I wasn't sure if I was going to be a lawyer. But I knew I could figure it out at Yale. 



Dad's friend and I had a moment alone at the party. I had gone to my room to be alone for a moment and he was there. Looking around in my room. He had a black bag in his hand. Holding it by the strings. He looked up at me with a smile. Which made my face flush and my knees weak. I walked over to my desk so I could lean on it. So I wouldn't fall over in front of him. Then he moved closer to me. Looking me over with those dangerous eyes that any girl could fall into. 


""Your speech was really great. Full of wisdom I didn't expect from a 18 year old woman. I think it was the perfect send off for your class."" He said. 



He held up the bag to me.


""Would you open my gift here?"" He asked. 



I nodded and gingerly took the bag from his hand. I turned my body a little and set the bag on my desk. I opened it and there was a card on the top.  I smiled. I opened it. There was a gift card to my favorite store. For $1,000. Which made my jaw drop a little. I recovered and then noticed something else under it. I put the card down and took out the thing in bag. It was hoodie sweater. I let it fall open. I smiled when I saw that it said Yale. And it was one size bigger than the usual size I bought. How did he know that I did that?



I looked up at him and there was a sparkle in his eyes. Like seeing my reaction had made him happy.



""Um..Thank you. For all of this. It means a lot. I honestly didn't even expect you to be here."" I replied. ""So thank you for coming and thank you for the graduation gift.""



""Its not a problem. I'm happy to be here. I was happy for you when your Dad said you decided on Yale.  I went there as well."" He replied. ""So I feel like its a right of passage to get you the sweater. And the gift card is so you can get some clothes that are respectable for a college wardrobe.""



I smiled. I was trying to resist the temptation to push myself up off the desk and kiss him. To show how thankful I really was. But I didn't I stayed put. Trying to make sure I was breathing right. He licked his lips briefly. Then he leaned in to kiss my cheek. But I moved my head and his lips landed on mine. I kissed back. Which led to more kisses. My arms wrapping around his neck. Chest to chest as we kissed. Then we heard foot steps and broke apart. I looked at the card. My Dad walked into my room. Rambling about this is where we had been hiding. That Dad and him needed to go to Dad's study to talk a little business before going back to the party. 



When they left the room I went to the bed and hugged myself. I had gotten to kiss a man I had lusted after for so long.  The party ended at midnight that night. Sometimes I would catch him looking at me. But I tried to focus on having fun with my friends. Enjoying the food. The cake. And etc. Summer was over before I knew it and I was packing up for college. Mostly with clothes I had never worn before. Because of the gift card. I moved into my dorm. And had an awful roommate my first year. Second year wasn't so great either. Third year I got lucky and had my best friend as a roommate. But it was summer again. And I had to do a internship at a law firm. 


Which my Father, of course, got me a prime one at the firm he co-owned. And the person I was to report to and help all summer was Dad's friend.



This was going to be a long summer. As a 20 year old female intern. And being around a man whose touch I longed for again. That no college lover or Boyfriend had been able to make me feel. Compared to how it felt that night at my graduation party.  



I looked around my college dorm. I was all packed. Dad and him were using their cars and mine to get my stuff home. Where I would be staying for the summer like always.  Seeing him lift boxes and plastic tubs of my stuff was somehow sexy. And I was aching between my legs. Oh. How I wanted that man. 



Between our 3 cars everything got home and unloaded in the same day. I spent the next few days unpacking what I needed. My mom had surprised me one day with a shopping spree for office appropriate outfits for the summer. Since she knew I had none and Dad approved it. Mom didn't stop until I had enough to rotate through in month. To keep myself looking fresh. And, of course, shoes to go with them. 


And now here I was. In front of his office. Setting up a desk that had a plaque with my name on it. I was nervous and excited all at once. Because I had been working very hard in college on my courses to become a lawyer. 

All I had to do was survive being this close to him. Every week day this summer.

___________________________________________________

So at this point in time she is 20 years old. Her Dad is 45 years old. So the male lead is 35 years old. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. This character needs to be played as the Alpha type. That knows what needs to be done in his public and private life. And very much so knows what he wants in his love affairs as well. 

So..How will you play this character and get her to fall into his idea of fun? While keeping appearances of being professional at the office? While dealing with the struggle that they are falling for each other? And what her Father will think?


Turn OFF's: Anal, scat/piss, blood, rape, heavy S&amp;M, Deep Throat blow job,and being degraded.



Turn ON's: Light biting and biting back, kissing, Having my earlobe bitten/suckled on lightly, having my boobs played with, Oral Sex(Giving and getting), breeding kink, cream pies, moderately rough sex, Cuffs for the wrists, under the bed wrist/ankle cuff system(With consent/safe word), Lingerie, and fingered on my g-spot.

869fgi,1,2018-03-22,When you make a bold move on a girl... at the wrong time,youngmoneyduke,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/869fgi/when_you_make_a_bold_move_on_a_girl_at_the_wrong/,"So recently, I make a move on this girl named J.K. What a cute name, right? 

I like this girl because she seems to be the one full of energy. Plus, she has beautiful green eyes, and she has a beautiful smile as well. I love a girl like this. She makes me think of B.Z, a cute high school girl who go on dates with me during the summer.

Well, there was this one day when she was eating in the cafeteria, and I also go there to grab burger like every other boring day.

The night before that, I listened to a pickup book (""Cracking the Woman's code"" kind of book) and I felt pretty pumped that morning. Seeing JK sitting by herself, eating her lunch, I decided to ask her if I could sit, cuz she was all alone by herself. That was the best chance to make moves on a girl, right?

WRONG.

And here is why... I was trying too hard to impress her, at the wrong time.


(30 seconds after I saw her and say hi)

I asked if I could sit with her. I couldn't even believe I said that. What the fuck am I going to say to her? ""Alright, let just be chill and think about the things that I have learned"". So I hit her up immediately, trying to be cool by showing some confidence in my voice, applying all the technique that I recently learned in the book. I demonstrate my values, show skeptical face when she is talking, making jokes, looking at her in a challenging way, smile at her, cold-reading her (heck, this is my favorite thing, and I did it so damn well she was surprised), etc. In fact, I did it so well, that I even got chance to touch hand with her when she tried to put her hand close to mine. I thought everything is going great. I am building a lot of attraction. I can easily move on to build trust whenever I want to.

But soon after that, I hit the dead-end of the road. After 10 minutes, she lost all of her interest and started looking at her phone. WHATTTT? What did I do wrong? Why did she suddenly sick of me while I we were having some good conversation?

The problem is I did all of these things at the wrong moment. She was trying to have lunch. And that is all I should do as well: Trying to have lunch. I make moves at a very bad moment. The sad part was that I get obsessed with her after I walked away from that conversation, for about a week. I was probably expecting to get something out of that conversation which I tried so hard but fail. At the moment when she stopped interacting with me, I know I have lost, and as a last resort to try to salvage some dignity, I told her I should get going soon because it was at 11:10 and I had the internship started at 11:15. I tried to give her a high-five, thinking that would create some memory out of this conversation, again, that was such a disastrous move. She still gave me a high-five, but I bet that she rolled her eyes after I left. Why? She probably hates it when a crazy fuck just jumped on her table without any permission, trying to impress her for no reason, while she just wants to enjoy her meal. I have probably ruined that girl's day.

It explained why a few days later, she tried to avoid seeing me or making any contact with me. She afraid and disgust of me like a plague. Why is that? Just as the analysis above has shown, I did not tune in to the environment. I have the nerves made of steel to sit where she was at and made the move, hands down to that. However, not being able to sense when is the right time to make the move was what killed it. I still have to learn more about social cue and thinking about the environment around me. I must try to sense what people are thinking because obviously, I have no clue about that at all. 

What would have been a better course of action? What would I do if I have the chance to redo that day, that moment?

Here is what I would do. I would politely ask her if she wanted me to sit with her. I don't want to eat by myself either. And then we will talk about life like normal, without any effort trying to impress her with lines or mental game. All of the game things don't work sometimes. For a girl like JK, perhaps genuine is the most important thing she looks for in an ideal partner, not some weirdo trying hard to be cool. Try hard to be cool has never been a successful strategy, yet guys like me, novice players, fall for it all the time because we are afraid that we will lose the girl if we did not do something impressive. WRONG. In the book Attract Woman Through Honesty, Mark Mansion said that the most attractive man is the man who does not even have to try. All of the attraction comes genuinely from his personality, who he is, out to his action and his words. At no moment does the attractive man not feel relax. In that book, ""DON'T TRY"" is probably my most favorite quote. In life, it is easy to forget things that we have learned if we did not experience those lessons in a hard way. The encounter with JK is probably a hard knock for me, but I am grateful for it.

Next time when I see a beautiful girl I want to get to know, I will just come talk to her like everybody else I know, without thinking about her beauty too much. This is probably the reason why a lot of guys fail in front of girls, as they focus too much on the person they are talking too. Just being yourself, be relax, be humorous and keep it cool, without thinking about the outcome of the conversation, is actually the best way to build attraction. Of course, techniques such as cold reading, push-pull, skepticism, all of them could work out well. But we should always be aware of when is the right time to use them. Doing a full session of cold-reading intentionally during the day when the time to be with someone is only 15 minutes like my situation with JK is probably a terrible idea, and should never be repeated.

86a5v9,14,2018-03-22,[Request] I've recently had a best friend pass away. I've had to go from full time studying to struggling through one subject and am now dealing with my recurrent bipolar issues cause of the stress. It's been a really hard time and a card just to make me smile would mean the world. [Australia],aw_hellno,RandomActsofCards,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/86a5v9/request_ive_recently_had_a_best_friend_pass_away/,"I thought I'd experienced the worst of life with my bipolar and some other mental health issues, the depression, the hospitalisations, the isolation, everything. But apparently nothing can prepare you for unexpectedly losing someone you love. 


I was doing really well, I was finally studying full time and confident about the work load, Id lessened all the meds cause my bipolar was seemingly more stable, I was enjoying a new relationship, Id finally gotten out of an internship I hated and things were looking up. Then a close friend unexpectedly died and my world felt like it fell apart. We're both in our early twenties and I just thought there was all the time in the world. Due to some other issues in my life Id had a hard time making close friends and opening up to people, theres very few good friends in my life and he was one of the most important to me. He was one of the most selfless, loyal, funny and unique people ill ever meet and I hate i didn't get a chance to tell him how important to was to me and I never had a chance to say any last words to him. He would make it clear that he was always there for me, he was incredibly busy with several jobs, uni, family, etc but told me if I was having any issues with my bipolar or anything at all he would always make the time for me. 


Ive come to realise you don't know what you have until its gone. Its been a sad few weeks, sorry this is probably an incredibly heavy post and I was hesitant about writing it because Im never really one to ask for help or talk about the issues going on in my life. But I guess I'm reaching out for a pick me up, I'm also happy to exchange cards. Thanks in advance."

I was looking for some tips or advice on my upcoming interview. It’s for a S.A.N.E.  position- requirements are three or four days of call a month. It would be concurrent to my full time position, at the same facility. I’d be a part of a pool of SANE nurses. It would require 40 hours of didactic instruction, and a skills day in an OB GYN office.

My background includes a year in the ER as an intern, a year in intake administration at a psych facility, and a year and a half on progressive care nursing. 

I’m interested in doing SANE because I’ve always had an interest for forensic nursing, and feel like I’m able to keep a rational head, pay attention to the need for meticulous detail, and at the same time be a soothing presence and source of information for the patient.

That being said, I want to be prepared both for the interview and what the job entails. Anyone have any insight? Research I should conduct before hand? Additional resources both for side education whether or not I get the job?



Thanks in advance!"

It's not something your company usually does, but I'd begged him and I guess he'd begged you because one interview later I'm sitting at the desk outside your office. My desk. It's a little dull, entry level stuff, my main job seems to be taking calls but I'm also getting very well acquainted with the copy machine and the backlog files that are slowly migrating to the storage room.

Oh, and you.

It started off innocently enough, brushing a little too close to me if we passed in the hall, or your hand lingering against mine as you accepted the files I'd hand you. I won't pretend I didn't like it. It was flattering to think a man like you would be interested in me. And maybe I played into it a little. Maybe one or two buttons would come undone on my blouse throughout the day, maybe I spent more time on my hair and makeup and yes I'd started wearing heels most days instead of the much more comfortable flats that now sat unused in my closet, but that didn't mean anything, did it?

I tell myself it doesn't. I tell myself it didn't mean anything when you'd complimented me on my skirt as I bent over to pull something from a bottom drawer. I tell myself it didn't mean anything when your hand lingered on the small of my back as you lead me into your office. I tell myself it doesn't mean anything when you ask me if I can stay late tonight. I just wish someone would remind the butterflies in my stomach of that.

""You sure you're okay staying late, Nora?"" my dad asks, walking past my desk with an arm full of folders he's taking home with him. ""You don't have to just because he asks.""

""I know,"" I answer, ""I just want to make a good impression, you know what it's like trying to get a job, this internship is going to help me later, I just wanna make sure I get a good reference.""

""Well, just call me when you get home, alright?""

""Promise."" I tell him, watching him leave, and the last few stragglers follow soon behind him. The quiet makes me uneasy, the office feels strange without the low buzz of chatter or the sound of copies running and phone ringing. There's just the quiet sound of my fingers on the keyboard and the soft tapping of my foot beneath my desk.

Every few moments my eyes are pulled away from the emails I'm answering to look at my phone. Any moment now that button is going to glow red and I'll hear you calling me in. You'll just want me to dig out some files, I tell myself. Or set up a few dozen copies of something to get overnighted. That's all. What else could it be?

But still my heart skips a beat when that light goes on and I hear your deep voice come over the phone's speaker telling me to come in.

I stand, straightening my skirt and smoothing my blouse. ""It's just a project."" I whisper to myself, taking a deep breath before crossing to your door. Pressing down on the handle the dark wood swings in, and I step though. ""You wanted to see me, sir?""

Hey, I'm looking for someone to play my father's boss, who has turned his eye towards his innocent little intern. Maybe my father's screwed up and I need to make it up to you, or maybe you just want me to show how much I appreciate this opportunity. However it happens you'll see to it that I'm bent over your desk begging for your cock.

I’m looking for something long term, so take your time getting a reply in. I'm happy to discuss details, but like to see at least some of your writing before hashing out the details.

86bwv4,1,2018-03-22,Study/career advice on situation,Gouden_Eeuw,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/86bwv4/studycareer_advice_on_situation/,"Hi all,

Regarding my future career and bachelor’s I am in quite some uncertainty right now. Study related, which I handed in and which I passed for, suddenly wasn’t the case anymore. This was caused by a teacher in my university who despised me. As a result I had to cancel and postpone my internship position that I was planning to do abroad in Canada and I had to do certain assignments all over again. As a result I crashed in December and had a burnout. 

I booked myself a small solo vacation for April to relax in the US. To get out and further recover and prepare for the big load of work coming the next months. 

Right now I am working hard to fix all the missing parts and am planning to do my final internship in May to finish my bachelor’s. I will be finished 4 months later as planned, because of the forced postponing. So that’s manageable, however there is a chance that this won’t be the cause due to the same teacher. Who might want me to wait start my internship later which will make me finish in 2019. That would be a disappointment.  Why?

If I am done I can finally move out of my parents house and get a full salary, instead of my current small income I have with my side job. At the age of 23 I am really fed up with this. My parents are divorced but still live together and to be honest are very demotivating and draining to be around. And furthermore, if I finish in 2019 more time will be wasted while gaining nothing and staying with my parents. 

In case I am forced to get postponed again. I am looking for maybe doing a masters for next university year, which I could do at the same time as finishing up my bachelor’s, so that would mitigate the time loss and still make my time useful. If not and no other plans besides finishing my bachelor’s, I would really lose time and not get any step further. 

What would you do considering or your advice be considering the situation?

TLDR: 23 year old, almost done with bachelor’s, had some letdowns,not sure when I will finish and might take longer than expected, what’s the best use of time career/study wise and looking at really wanting to move out?"
86cksn,4233,2018-03-22,I met this girl on tinder and she looked nothing like her pics and brought some...surprises.,trustmeimdonaldtrump,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/86cksn/i_met_this_girl_on_tinder_and_she_looked_nothing/,"So i'm chillin in my room right? It's like 10 at night and I'm on my shitty laptop playing runescape trying to just figure out what the fuck I'm even doing with my life.

I was talkin to this girl on tinder and things were going pretty fast. As a pre-face to this: I had just moved to this city because my dumb-ass was trying to go back to school after being unwillingly cucked by my gf. She fucked my friends, I lost my mind, dumped her ass and moved. So I didn't know anyone except my roommate. Which never showered :( He smelled like cheetoes.

Well I match with some hunnies on tinder and none of them were really going anywhere except for this one girl. We'll call her Bri. So Bri and I talked for maybe 45 minutes, she was this 20 yr old who was doing some internship for an amusement park. Right off the bat she was wanting to hang out. This to me was pretty sketch because every girl on tinder ever is usually very skeptical about meeting up. You could match with 1000 girls but maybe only 4 would actually be down to meet up and most of the time it was in public.

I sent her a dick pic &amp; my address - just like that her ass was in her car driving over to come see me. Bird up.

About 20 minutes go by and she texts me asking me if I wanna go sledding. I'm like bitch it's fucking 11 at night and it's the middle of summer what are you talking about? She's like LOL ok nevermind. I'm ???ing in my mind because now I'm thinkin this bitch might be crazy. Whatever though as long as I'm getting some version of laid we'll be aight.

Bri shows up. But with a friend...I'm like nigga you didn't mention anything about some ugly ass friend. Whatever though. I go outside to meet them. Now her car matched the description but when both of these hoes got out the car I verbally said ""oh sorry I thought my friend was here! I guess y'all drive the same car my bad""

They both started laughing and she was like...u/trustmeimdonaldtrump it's me Bri. I'm looking at her and i'm like...no you aren't. She's like yes I am! She reaches into her purse and pulls out her shitty iphone4s with our tinder conversation. I'm like oh...I guess it's dark out here my bad. At this point it's fucking awkward as shit. We're standing out in the parking lot not saying anything, she brought a friend when she never mentioned it in the first place, I didn't even tell my roommate what was going on &amp; this girl looked like a completely different person. I'm not a noob at tinder - I know the runaround when it comes to checking to see if someone is legit or not so I was very surprised.

I'm like whatever dood come on lets go back to my crib. We start walking back and she's like are you okay?? You look super uncomfortable. I'm like nah nah I'm just shy around new people or whatever just trying to bullshit something so I could at least get these two lying sacks of shit back to my room to see what the deal is.

We get back to my room and I realize that she IS the same girl, she just gained like a hunnid pounds and dyed her hair.

Y I K E S

I offer the hoes some beer and I REALLY start contemplating what the fuck I'm even doing with my life. I was praying that whoever built the apartment's foundation did a good job because we are seriously putting it to the test tonight.

We get into my room and not even 5 minutes in both of these girls are asking to see ""that fat dick in person"".

????

First off - My dick is whatever but it's definitely not going to be shit in comparison to your pear shaped bodies. I mean if you're a normal sized human being it'll do the job. TBH my dick doesn't really get hard to sociopathic liars who couldn't even post a pic from this fucking century so I knew that wasn't happening.

Also do you realize how fucking crazy you have to be to walk into someone's home at 11 at night on a wednesday with an unmentioned, uninvited friend asking to see some dudes dick you've only known for 5 minutes?? Ok yeah you can judge me I sent a pic of my dick but whatever dude, it's snapchat, there's no face &amp; and even if they screenshotted it I can deny till the cows come home (literally) that it's mine.

At this point i'm visibly uncomfortable. I'm thinking these girls are going to rob me at dick point or something because of how odd this situation is.

So after awkwardly trying to change the subject Bri basically spills the beans and says that they wanna do coke off my dick. ""Remember when I asked you if you wanted to go sledding?""

Oh shit. Damn..I mean these girls aren't hot by any means but they wanna do coke of my dick. You realize how much street cred this could possibly give me? I'm kinda cool but damn i'm not THAT cool you know?? Was I ever going to have this opportunity again?

""Shit ok if y'all want""

They were all excited and shit. I was fucking terrified. But I HAD to get my street cred. I could win every game of never have I ever with this shit.

I pull down my pants and her friend just grabs it and starts jerking me off. She was fucking eager. Bri is just sitting in the corner watching while she was grabbing the bag of coke out of her purse.

I'm having trouble getting hard at first but then Bri comes over and puts it in her mouth. Well as long as I don't make eye contact and pretend it's someone else this should work just fine. They start passing my dick back and forth to each other and I can't decide if this is the most awesome or worst thing that's ever happened to me.

I then lay back in the bed (her friend dries my dick off ) and they start putting this line on my dick. I don't know how much coke they had with them but I'd guess it was an 8-ball because I'd never seen a sack that fat before.

They took turns making the line, snorting it, and licking up the parts they couldn't get and repeating. Not gonna lie it was kinda tight and I swear I was getting a little coked out too but maybe it was like contact high? Not sure.

So you're probably wondering...how did that end?

Well. Bri went into the bathroom for like 15 minutes while I got my dick sucked by her friend. I came and they left. Bri felt bad because I didn't get any coke since they did it all... so she left me like 8 xanax pills. I'm like uh yeah that's a way better deal imo. She puts the pills on my desk and I walk them back out to their car.

-hugs me- we should do this again sometime!

uh yeah sure

A couple weeks later Bri called me in the middle of the night saying she was coming over. I was like uhh yeah please don't I have school tomorrow. I fall back asleep. 6 in the morning I get a knock on the door and it's Bri completely fucked up out of her mind screaming at me for not answering my phone. I slam the door on her and go back to sleep. My roommate was fucking pissed.

I never saw bri or her ugly friend again.

I ended up failing out and moving back home.

We still snapchat sometimes - she even lost weight.

So yeah. Basically... beware with tinder and maybe meet at a starbucks or something before giving out your private address.

edit: so scumbag...we gotcha. hehe.

in all seriousness thank you to everyone who's sent me positive messages (for those telling me to kill myself, cmonBruh). it really means a lot in these tough times. I'm trying to eventually release the stories I post on r/drugs onto a physical print. I'll have more info on that as time goes on. Thanks everyone again &lt;3.  "
86cnui,7,2018-03-22,My (27F) friend (28F) is moving away and I feel weirdly responsible but don’t know how to talk to her about it.,movingfriendtaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/86cnui/my_27f_friend_28f_is_moving_away_and_i_feel/,"I met my friend “Julie” about 4 years ago. We met on a dating site, so I went into our first meeting feeling like it was a date and honestly I was wowed from the minute she walked in the door. We had such a good time, I was totally infatuated, I went home that evening certain I wanted to pursue something with her. But neither of us had much experience with other women (both bi) and so we were kind of in an awkward limbo for a while. I couldn’t read her at all and felt too shy to make a move. 

Finally I texted her telling her how I felt. She took almost a week to respond, and gave kind of a noncommittal “I like you but I’m not sure in what capacity but I do want to keep hanging out” response. Cue a year of mixed signals. We spent a ton of time together and did lots of date-like things, and sometimes when we drank she would get really affectionate (holding hands, putting a hand on my thigh, nuzzling me etc). But it never progressed and we never talked about it. We’re both (by our own admission) pretty conflict-averse and bad at communicating. We were also definitely each other’s closest friends during this time; neither of us knew a lot of people in our city. 

To add to the weirdness, at one point in all this she suggested we move in together to save money. That didn’t pan out, but definitely made things more confusing for me. I guess in all this I felt like the ball was in her court and I was waiting on some kind of answer, which I realize now is silly. 

Finally I gave up hope and started dating another girl, but it was long-distance so didn’t affect my relationship with Julie much. I still had some feelings for Julie, which was unfair to my girlfriend, but I tried to put them aside. 

Girlfriend and I broke up last spring and I was single for the summer before meeting a guy and falling incredibly hard for him and vice versa. We’ve been together 7 months but are planning to move in together. I’ve definitely let my relationship with him take away from my time with Julie. We still text a lot but don’t hang out as often (I’m also in grad school and have an internship and a part time job so I’m pretty busy). 

Now Julie is planning on moving away once she lands another job. I know she’s been unhappy in her current job for a long time, so it feels crazy and selfish to wonder if this has something to do with me...but part of me is asking “is this because I met my boyfriend and have been so unavailable? Did I abandon her?” I’m so anxious at the thought of her leaving, even though it will be a good opportunity for her. I want to ask her if she’d still be moving if I hadn’t met someone but even that question sounds crazy, to assume I have enough influence in her life that she makes decisions based on my level of availability. 

Through all this we’ve maintained our pattern of being avoidant and never really talking seriously about things. I’ve worked hard to change that in my other relationships but it’s harder with her. If I could do this whole relationship over again I would have been more direct and told her how I felt and maybe even escalated our physical connection. But now it feels too late to talk about any of that and I think I’m feeling a lot of regret and worry that I neglected our friendship. I’d welcome any insight or advice people have. "

I have a crazy toxic adviser and i'm in the process of leaving his lab. But its killing me.

I wish I had spoken up sooner or seen that he was an abusive person back when i still had my own level of confidence but now i just feel completely torn down. I feel like i can't be normal around people and lately that's been turning into suicidal thoughts.

That's not at all what i'm going to do but it's seriously putting a damper in my productivity and ability to function. it's like my brain is fuzzy and unfocused and my grades are slipping.

I'm not getting a lot of support from the school either. what i keep perceiving is that they're encouraging me to drop out and consider a Master's program instead. I also get the distinct impression that they're protecting my professor though i haven't said anything about filing a complaint or for corrective action. i just want to change to a lab with a better personality fit.

i went to therapy for a few months last fall when i started having panic attacks. Now with the serious depressive episodes i finally went back this week. it did help to talk to someone but i still feel crazy and isolated.

some things are looking up, i have an interview for an internship today, and i'm meeting with a bunch of people this week. being proactive helps but getting moving isn't doing it for me. i'm so tired and its absurdly hard to get up when i wake up.

I'm trying to decide if i need to tell the graduate student resources advisor what's going on or why. I'm afraid to. last fall i went in to talk to a counselor about getting tested for ADHD but ended up staying to talk about depression and ptsd. 
 I can't tell my advisor about this (see: he's literally insane and i hate him.) , and i don't know how to bring up this topic with anyone else. i'm afraid that if i do bring it up i'm just going to be pushed harder to quit and I don't want to do that. 

Being in school is making me happy. it really really is. I am so happy to be here. but i'm exhausted.

i don't even really know if what i posted right now is me looking for advice or just rambling. I know things will get better, i've got some good prospects popping up, but riding this episode is just horrible and I can't seem to burst through the fog for more than a few hours at a time."

It is supposed to be alternating between inpatient and outpatient, but so far I've only been working outpatient. I try to be open with the director, and I asked them if I'll eventually get trained for inpatient, and they told me yes, in due time. 

Today, the director approached me and told me that one of the chemo pharmacists retired and she thought I might be a good fit for the positionfor me considering my experience as an intern in an oncology sattelite. I asked if it's an inpatient sattelite? And I was told no, its an outpatient setting, as the entire hospital is heading towards more ambulatory/outpatient and less inpatient. I said yes I was interested in checking it out.

My goal is to do as much clinical activities as possible, which to me would probably be an inpatient sattelite. The director was somewhat vague, so it wasn't clear to me if all I'll be doing is chemos or if it will be more involved than that (there are a total of 2 chemo pharmacists in the hospital which makes me doubt that it does. 

I did say I'm interested because this would expand my skillset, and also to not show the director that I would straight up decline opportunities. But at the same time, if it turns out to be a position where all you do is make chemos, I would not enjoy that. But I don't have much info so I'm not sure. Also are there any safety concerns?

While I certainly missed what I expected for water cooler conversations (sports, cars, etc.) it was made up with the fact that I was surrounded by beautiful women all the time. Having just turned 18 and with this as my first internship, I considered it quite the benefit!

Trying to make a good impression, I never raised an eyebrow when the ladies would cordially ask me to literally do all the heavy lifting, such as helping arrange office furniture and moving boxes around. It's funny that the AC was never on those days as it made me sweat a bit and sometimes even remove a layer of clothing. They were always so supportive, watching, directing and vocally supporting me (even cheering sometimes, these ladies loved to have furniture moved). I also did not expect them to be so touchy-feely! Perhaps they were simply uncoordinated or simply unaware of the concept of personal space, because it seemed like they would always brush up against me in the break room or rub my arms while having a conversation or laughing at one of my jokes.

And boy was I really surprised at how casual they took business casual! My goodness, I would have a hard time focusing if my very own mother were to strut around in those types of heels, those short of skirts, and those low-buttoned blouses.

As you can imagine, when the offer was on the table for me to accept full-time employment (surprisingly after a mere 2 weeks of interning, I must have killed it!) I found it difficult to find reasons to say no. I cannot wait for the future adventures to be had in my career at the Miller and Ingram Law Firm!

But I'm open and willing to take this in a number of different directions and have a lot of details about a number of characters you could play. Medium/Long foreplay &amp; realism (it can be oversexualized, just in a realistic way) is a MUST. Prefer 1st person perspective, but willing to do 3rd as well.

Limits (because it's easier to list them rather than kinks): toiletplay, gore, animals"

I thought this seemed like a good place to write about this subject.

I couldn’t get to sleep last night, for a million reasons. But simplified, the ADHD symptoms were strong. I laid in bed fluctuating between excitement, anxiety and boredom. Unfortunately, the hyperactivity went on until 4:30 in the morning, and I was simply felling too ill after my awakening hours, later to go to work.

I’m an intern on the verge of full-time.
(I got my Bachelors and did an internal interview for salary job... but I’m caught waiting on final decisions to be made)
I can’t afford shitty misadventures like this happen too frequently for too much longer. So what can I do in the meantime?

The culprit as I see it: not taking my Melatonin every single night.

This my mistake. I take Adderall XR in my roster of meds. A doctor once told me I could expect the XR to last 8 hours or so, but I laugh at that. I could still be rolling on the effects for 2 days at maximum.

I absolutely need to take Melatonin at the same time each night, even when I’m tired.

Otherwise, I could be up for hours. My brain seems to hyper-focus sometimes when it’s tired, and it’s difficult to control.

I’ve set up an alarm for 9:15p each night, and I have to take the melatonin to be ready by at least midnight to pass out. Otherwise, at this point, the consequences are too burdensome. "
86eex1,10,2018-03-22,I'm a college student who has never had a job and needs 12k in a year and a half. Need some advice.,PoorieThrowaway,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/86eex1/im_a_college_student_who_has_never_had_a_job_and/,"So I'm a Computer Science junior in Texas that just found out that I will need to take one extra semester of college before I can graduate. That's pretty devastating news for me since I've been able to avoid all debt thanks to my 6.5k per semester scholarship and FAFSA grants. Problem is, the scholarship only lasts for 4 years and this extra semester will be after that length of time. My parents have their own debt to deal with so I don't even want to consider asking them for any money. I also can't get a full time job during the summer since I have to do the community service hours to upkeep my scholarship and take summer courses. All things considered I think I would be able to at least work 4 hours a day during the summertime and during semesters. I would really like to not have to go into any debt but if saving up this amount of money in this period with my time constraints isn't possible I supposed I'll have too. I've never had a job before and have no clue how possible it would be for me to save up the approximate 12k (which is a bit of an overestimate with the tuition, housing, and all things considered). Is it realistically do-able? Is it worth how hard it might be and how much of my free time it'll take up? What kind of salary and hours should I be looking for? Should I start looking for a job right now or can it wait until summer? Thanks in advance.


**Edit** : God I feel so much better after reading everyone's advice. Looks like the route i'll be taking is a part time during the 2 summers (maybe an internship during the second summer), and a loan for the rest. Thanks to everyone for the comments and advice!"
86ejee,2,2018-03-22,Advice on how to help my intern during patient interview and with critical thinking.,jnbeatty,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/86ejee/advice_on_how_to_help_my_intern_during_patient/,"My intern is two weeks into her first clinical rotation. She has been progressing well and has strengths and weaknesses like any of us. Currently, her biggest weakness is during actual patient interview/counseling. She will ask the normal “scripted” questions (somewhat effectively) but then really struggle to probe further to get information needed. For example, a patient can be going on and on about his visual impairment and she just takes it at face value and moves on to her next scripted question, failing to connect the dots and ask pertinent follow up questions like do you require feeding assistance etc. I’m trying to encourage more of a discussion during interviews rather than a questionnaire during interviews but I’m not seeing any improvements whatsoever. So far the tactics I have tried are the obvious ones a like having her shadow me, shadowing her and then asking patients questions she missed, discussing what could have gone better and providing immediate feedback, asking her to tell me about the patient and making a ‘plan of attack’ before we enter the room. I plan on trying some role playing and also having her with one of our different dietitians for a day to see if that helps any. I understand she is still very early on, but I am concerned enough to ask the Reddit’s for any advice (from students, interns, or clinicians!). "
86f99t,3,2018-03-22,Post College Grad depression,Jackster15,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/86f99t/post_college_grad_depression/,"Well, here goes... I'm 23 years old. I graduated last may with my CS degree. College was great, I went out every weekend, I made a lot of friends, I had a part time job, I grinded out long sessions in the library, I was motivated to get that degree while having a good time doing it... and I did. 

Then culture shock got me, I moved back to my hometown to live with my parents, to find a big boy job, to start paying off the student loans, saving up enough money and then moving out to live on my own. At least that was the plan...

It started with the job hunt struggles, not feeling confident in phone call interviews, not having that desire to really grind it out and successfully land a job that my skills/resume would enable, this went on for months, jobless at home with my parents with little friends around anymore to hangout with. I felt ashamed of myself. Depression kicked in off/on depending on the day, losing sleep, mental breakdowns in my room alone, etc. After those long summer months, of minimal social media, minimal contact with friends, minimal physical activity, minimal EVERYTHING. (mostly video games and watching sports and just being around my mom and dad). I decided to open up on one text to a friend, I told him about my struggles, his mom heard and had known me since I was a kid. She said she needed help at her office with administrative work, an internship. I reluctantly took it, a measly 12$/hr, 29hrs a week job that has very little to do with my degree/skillset has been the most stable thing in my life the past 7 months. Depression still hit me weekly.

Which brings me to today, March 22, 2018. Today I woke up feeling really depressed thinking about how much of a waste of life I've been this past year. I went to my car during my lunch break and just sat there for an hour having a mental breakdown, just to walk back into my work acting like everything is fine...

I'm back where the struggles started. The job hunt, it's really hard for me for some reason. Part of me feels ashamed for opting to start applying for desktop support jobs (which is considered the bottom of the totem pole for where you can end up after earning my degree). Social media has been non existent since graduation because I got tired of seeing all the good in everyone's life while mine has been nothing but disappointment. 

Its been really hard to open up about these struggles to anyone. In fact, that lone text I sent my friend has been the only time I have. This post will be my 2nd time sharing. I hope that soon I can snap out of it since its prime time to job hunt. "

I'm a P4 graduating in May.  Back in November I accepted a job offer from one of the big chains.  Due to some logistical issues on their end, I just started working as an intern with them a couple weeks ago, with the intention to stay on post-graduation. 

My issue is, I matched to a pgy1 residency, and I don't know when I should let them know I won't be staying on as a pharmacist.  I accepted the position because I didn't want to leave myself with nothing if I didn't match, given the state of the job market, but I thought I would have started as an intern at least a few months ago.  The timing right now just has me at a loss for what the best to proceed would be.   

At this point I don't know if it would be worse to work for them as a intern for a couple months and then leave around June, or just let them know now before we've gotten to far into my training and part ways.  I don't want them to feel like I'm wasting their time training me if I'm not going to work for them as a pharmacist, but at the same time my store is really understaffed, so I wouldn't mind working as an intern for a bit if it would help them out.

I'm very excited, but I have the unfortunate situation of not having a car. The company I'm talking to has already mentioned I'll probably have to do coffee runs every once in a while. Also, given the industry I'm in, I'll probably have to do a good amount of work outside of the office, which will require more driving. I don't have enough money to purchase a car, and my parents can't help me with my situation. 

Ridesharing will get expensive if I'm doing this on the daily, and while riding the bus where I can is an option, the bus doesn't offer the flexibility I need.

Is there any place that offers long-term car rentals for an inexpensive price? Or perhaps any redditors that are willing to negotiate a price for lending me their car for the summer? I've never been in an accident and I'm a safe driver.

If anyone has other ideas to help out my situation, I'd appreciate it."
86g7rh,23,2018-03-22,I think my therapist is attracted to me and I'm obsessed about it.,hahathisguylol,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/86g7rh/i_think_my_therapist_is_attracted_to_me_and_im/,"Long post but I need help figuring this out or advice in my situation! I am a fairly attractive male in my late 20's and seeing an also fairly attractive female counselor about the same age. I'm seeing a counselor for help with a mental health disorder and not for anything relationship or trauma related. We've had a few sessions so far and there's been some things she's said and done that make me think she wants a relationship with me outside of a clinical setting. I've fallen in love with her and I think she's in love with me too. Here's some reasons why.

1. **We're both ex-mormon (cult) survivors.** We both grew up mormon and have left since. She attended BYU in Provo, UT to get her degree and while in college discovered the church to be more and more a cult instead of a religion. I left the church at 18. For those of you who haven't been mormon, to me the church is like a cult and getting out of it leaves you a scarred. It takes away your family and friends and everything you've built your life on.

2. **She believes fate brought us together.** She asked me at the end of our second meeting these exact words: ""do you believe it's fate you and I met? Because I believe things happen for a reason."" I've only had a few people in my life ask me about fate and it's always been in a romantic context. 

3. **She divulged personal information.** In my experience with any kind of mental health professionals in the past, they hesitate when any sort of personal question gets asked their way. They answer briefly or not at all and redirect the conversation. In the first meeting, she told me where she grew up (coincidentally 10 miles away from each other and now again in another state), what school she attended (though I already knew because of her degree on the wall) and that she had grown up mormon and left the church. She's told me about her dogs, classes she's taken, family issues and more.

4. **She offered to meet more frequently.** We currently meet once per week. She's said after awhile and if I need more time with her we could do 2-3 times per week and her schedule is open. She didn't say anything about meeting less often. She didn't infer it would be outside of the clinical setting though.

5. **She's an intern counselor.** She graduated with her master's degree in social work less than a year ago. I think that means she's less likely to be as guarded and know what to do if she's attracted to a client physically or emotionally.

6. **She wears a ring on her right ring finger but isn't married.** All of the other biographies on her multi-person practice talk about them spending time with their family, hers just mentions hiking with her two dogs. The ring doesn't have any gemstone on it and is a simple silver or chrome-plated ring that I'm assuming is to prevent people like myself from hitting on her. She's mentioned siblings but no relationships. She knows I'm available. I don't know if she has a boyfriend.

7. **She wears attractive clothing.** The first time I met her she wore long slacks and a blouse with a jacket, fairly conservative. Every time I've seen her since then she's worn a dress or a skirt and sleeveless or short sleeved top. It's also starting to be much hotter in the daytime around here so that might be a factor.

I haven't been able to get her out of my mind and I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm reading this all wrong. If i'm reading this right, what should I do? I'm scared she is interested in me but won't pursue anything because of our clinical relationship. We get along great and I'd really like her to be an intimate part of my life in every way. 

I feel like she loves me but I'm afraid that it's only because I pay to see her. Am I just seeing what I want to see instead of the reality? I imagine her thinking of me every day but maybe she just forgets me after every session until I see her again.

Am I just hoping for something that can never happen?"

My boyfriend broke up with me on Christmas eve, it's been nearly 3 months and I still can't cope with this grief and doubt.

He broke up with me first of all by saying he needed to be single, my mental health issues (depression and anxiety and ocd) made him feel like a carer and not a boyfriend. He told me it made him feel suicidal.

This was coupled with cheating. I cheated (kissed) someone at the very beginning when we started seeing each other. He later after 5 years rang a prostitute, had phone sex, asked a girl to meet him when we were going back to our home town for Christmas bla bla.. Nothing physically happened as far as I know, but after this I kissed 2 people, wrong, i know, told him straight away cuz couldn't handle the guilt. He said this was the reason he ended it too.

I later found out he had been having a relationship with his intern (he was  marketing manager of  a company). He was older than me already, 33 I'm 25. The new gf is 22. Why does this make me feel shit? Should I feel washed out at 25?!

But anyway, how do I stop doubting everything I do and feeling like I'm so horrendous he had to leave me? I can't function, I think about this constantly. I send desperate messages, I cry, I drink every night. "

Over the past couple of months I have experienced a downward spiral into sleeping way too much, lost interest in most things, and feeling a little low.  I was thinking that this was more a depressive episode (something that has happened before and I dealt with), but I went to my own therapist and was told that I am not taking enough time to unwind mentally and that I am exhausting myself from overthinking about my clients and constantly evaluating my own performance mentally.  

This is true, I know I do this, and I am doing my best to apply self-care, but the problem is, I have no energy for self-care.  So I post this just because I want to know if it is truly even possible for me to be experiencing burnout this early on as a student?  I was shocked to hear it.  I LOVE meeting with my clients.  I just hate my nagging thoughts about whether I am doing it right.  And whether I did enough each day.

I also post to ask, have any of you been in a similar situation and how did you redirect yourself to get back on a healthier level mentally and physically?  I want to be confident and do this well without feeling so exhausted like I can't enjoy my time outside of this work.  I need to get a handle on this now so I can set a healthy pattern for my future career.

Would appreciate any thoughts.  Thanks for reading."

We are actually partnered with the schools. I thought it would be a great idea to start a lunch group with about 6-8 4th graders. Most of them rather spend their recess with their student advocate and I, so we would spend half of their recess and half of their lunch doing group. In group, we usually talk about our highs and our lows of the day and have guided discussions about the school climate. Recently, our group has been getting into trouble for various reasons. Disruption in their classroom, disrespecting teachers, and walking out of the class without permission. My field instructor asked that we helped out in the classroom as much as we can, and I cannot believe the behaviors that are coming from our clients.

When I returned to field, I was informed that our group came into our office the day before, while no one was in there and door was closed. While they were in the office they decided to go through their snack bags that were supposed to be passed out 30 minutes before dismissal and ate them and trashed our office. The student advocate was not to happy about it, so we came to an agreement that we will not be having group this week. I feel bad for taking away something that they look forward to, but I cannot agree to some of these behaviors. Many of them like to come in our office and go through the drawers and cabinets, which I don't mind, but it is a constant thing. Do I just let them do whatever? I tried to set some boundaries but it continues. I'm only there twice a week. How should I change? How should I address this issue?  "

After high school I moved to a different time zone and entirely different culture. He developed a crush on one of the girls from our school who was younger than us. Through social media and texting, I was helping this guy get that girl, but after about 2 months of intense crushing on her, he finally realized that she wasn't interested. I helped him get over the crush and motivated him to focus on his career. After 4 months, he indirectly proposed me and I rejected. I instantly sensed that this rejection meant that I was losing the only friend I had at that time, and I told him that I would maybe accept his proposal in the future. Then one thing happened after the other and we were in an actual long distance relationship. Because the distance and the time difference were a lot to handle, and I had a lot to do for my career path, the relationship was very rough and I struggled to find time for him. Also, it was a secret relationship because my family doesn't approve of dating and all, that added to the difficulty of finding a comfortable time and space to talk to him. I was doing extremely well in my career, and I was trying to drag that relationship because it made me happy and satisfied. But my ex wasn't satisfied with the amount of time I was giving him and he used to fight with me for only the time thing. I would still give him 2 hours everyday - where I wasn't doing anything else, just lying in bed and talking to him - and that was the time I was supposed to sleep. Still wasn't enough for him, and he fought with me almost every week and threatened me to break up. I  always managed to calm him down and he was the sweetest person ever once I apologized and said sweet little things to him. I never had any issues with him as he was supportive of my career and we even had each other's facebook passwords. 1.5 years passed like this, and I started a new internship and one week into that internship, I was logged into his facebook account and I saw his pictures with the girl he had a crush on before our relationship started. I wasn't friends with him on facebook because of my family, and they both were really active on facebook like tagging each other in things, and posting stuff for one another - not necessarily like a couple but like best of friends. And the facebook history was about 6 months old at that time. I got really mad at him, I told him that I couldn't trust him anymore and I blocked him on all social media - this all happened when he was sleeping. He never made any effort to call me or contact me and talk about this. A few days later I got into this conversation on facebook with one of our common friends and I told him that my ex didn't even care that I deserved an apology, so she did her job as a friend and got him to talk to me. I was mad at him, I yelled at him, I don't use abusive words but I told him all the bad words I knew. He listened to everything and apologized - and eventually convinced me to give him another chance on the condition that he will never talk to that girl. Things started to pick up but I wasn't happy in that relationship, I had trust issues every time he was not responding or not keeping me updated. We would talk for 2 days, and I would bring that other girl's name and we will fight really bad and break up. After a week or so of not talking, the cycle began again. I tried really hard to give him one more chance every time because I knew that I loved that guy. It wasn't lust at all, because there was nothing physical in the relationship and we didn't want anything before we got married. He used to say ""I love you"" way more than I did, and I also strongly felt that he really loved me. But no matter how intense the love was on both sides, the trust issues I had kept coming up and he got extremely angry every time I said I couldn't trust him. He fell for my smile while we were in high school, but now I had stopped smiling. Nothing made me happy - no career achievements, nothing that he or anyone else did for me. He got really frustrated with that and the constant cycles of talking and then breaking up. This went on for another 8 months - which will be upto January 2018. I was talking to him like another cycle, and I told him that I wasn't gonna marry him because I didn't trust him; but I just can't stop loving him. At that point, he did something that had the potential of destroying the slightest possibility of us getting together that was left. I took the help of one of my other friends to make me break up with him for good. That was the last time I talked to him, but I have not been able to get over him. My guts have hated him for the last 10 months for what he did to me, but I just can't stop loving him. When I picture my life without him, I don't want to have that kind of life. And when I think of getting him back, I always question myself that will I be able to see that face who betrayed me every morning? It has always been clear that I was a little better than him in everything (like education, looks, financial status etc) and he wouldn't be able to find another partner that could out-compete me. But I still wake up every morning with the feeling that something is missing, and the next thing that pops into my mind is his name. I also don't have any friends I can be completely honest with, because all of my friends think that I was wrong to be in that relationship in the first place. I have minimal support and I miss my ex so much - even if he doesn't deserve me, thinking of breaking my promise to love him forever feels so wrong and shaming to the purity of my love. I don't feel I will ever be able to replace him or love someone else as much as I loved him. Should I try to stop loving him - of course yes! But why does my love for someone needs an approval from them? Those are my feelings, so why should I change something that I strongly feel? - This is just an example of the kind of thoughts I have. But I wanna get out of this loop and be happy again. Please help. "

A little background: I am a 3rd year student majoring in Finance and am looking to be an actuary as a career. I decided a little late into my degree so I decided to take my actuarial exams recently. I passed both Exam FM and Exam P in the past 6 months and am thinking of taking the new IFM in November 2018 given my current knowledge in corporate finance and derivatives. However, I am a bit stumped.

I'm not sure if i should attempt IFM in November without having an actuarial internship because I heard that having too many exams without experience is not advisable. I was not able to find a actuarial internship for the summer so I am currently looking for any office internships. 

So my first question is: Should I attempt IFM even if I do not land an actuarial-related internship this year? Should I slow down my exam progress and wait until I obtain an actuarial-internship before taking more exams? I will be looking to apply for Fall 2018 internships.

Recently, I did a Private Equity interview and I was asked what was my long term career plans. My answer was that I wanted to work in insurance but I felt that saying that was disadvantageous.

So my second question is: How do you guys respond to interview questions similar to those regarding career goals? I do omit my exams when I apply for non-actuarial jobs.

Thanks again for your feedback and advice /r/actuary!

Grew up in financially illiterate home and want to get it together.",Medusa789,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/86i4wu/debt_23_senior_in_college_with_20000_in_debt_not/,"Background:

As the title says, I need to move out from my moms next spring and my financial life is obviously in shambles. To make a long story short, I grew up in a household that was financially illiterate and left a 4-year abusive relationship at 19 years old. In order to leave the relationship, I had to break an apartment lease and couldn't afford our car on my own so it ended up getting repossessed. The individual I was in a relationship with does not care about his financial health, so there is no hope that he will be paying any of this shared debt. I went through a difficult time with substance abuse after leaving the relationship and had several hospital stays which I couldn't afford. A decent amount of time has passed and I've really started to build a more responsible life of my own, however, I am financially screwed and not sure where to start. I would really like to become financially responsible and be able to manage my life and I’m ready to accept responsibility for my past decisions but I'm entirely clueless as to where I should begin. 

More about my finances:

I will be starting an internship in a couple weeks working at $12 per hour 10 hours per week until May, at which point I'll be working full time till august. I've been sorting through and trying to sell off any items I have around the house and I have a super part time research gig making $10 an hour that's holding me over until my internship. 

I have a judgement against me and am unable to utilize my bank account. My credit card was recently maxed out to make a repair. I have no savings. I had a decent job, but my grades were suffering and I couldn't manage the heavy hours with class. Basically, everything's a disaster. 

A couple small things - I realized that one of the accounts on my credit report says that it was ""opened"" 12/17 but this debt was definitely from 2013. Can they just restart the debt? And why is it that only 3/10 of my collections are on the Equifax report? (10/10 on Transunion) 

If I would like to be in a better position to move (even if I'll need to find a room for rent) where should I start to knock out some of this debt? The judgement? My credit card (fix my credit?)? Savings? Knock out the current/active debt first? I'd also like to get as much of this taken care of as possible for having to start paying back my student loans.

**Today in Scottish History**

On 23 March 1923, Roddy McMillan, the Scottish stage and TV actor, was born.
His credits include the TV series, The View From Daniel Pike, and the play, The Revellers. However, he will be most fondly remembered for his portrayal of Para Handy, the captain of the Vital Spark in the much loved television series of the 1960s.

On this day in 1848, the Free Church of Scotland settlement at New Edinburgh, New Zealand was founded under Rev Thomas Burns, a nephew of the poet Robert Burns. The settlement later became Dunedin, one of the largest towns in the country, and one which still retains a distinctive Scottish character.

I saved my self, but it costed me my internship and a couple of thousand dollars in scholarships. I came back and made all B's this past Fall semester and I am on track to doing the same thing this semester. However, this semester couldn't be any worse for me outside of academics. My mom passed away the first week into classes, the doctors weren't able to determine an official cause of death since she passed away in her sleep. It was all so sudden I didn't know how to deal with it so I just decided to put all of my focus on school to get my mind off of it. I spent three weeks at home so coming back wasn't easy at all. Once I did come back I met this girl in one of my classes, lets call her Sarah. Sarah was extremely smart, funny, and pretty. Basically my type, we went on a couple of dates then when I asked her if she wanted to hangout with me one weekend she said she was going to visit this guys house for the weekend. Normally I wouldn't be too worried because I believed she was a strong enough woman to get out of sticky situations on her own. Unfortunately, Sarah said the guy she was visiting was her boss and is at least double her age...She said she usually goes to his house on weekends and he even asked her for ""professional"" nude photos once (She said he does photography on the side, but all she saw was a Rebel Canon T5i and that automatically makes him a photographer for some reason). So I did stalk the dude on the internet just to be sure he wasn't a sexual predator or something and nothing turned up. So I decided to trust her on it and let her be, even though I told her I really don't approve. So we go on a couple of other dates then spring break comes around. She goes back to her hometown for her grandfathers funeral and I stay at our University. Throughout the entirety of spring break, she doesn't call me and she doesn't respond to most of my texts. I was sure at that point she either lost interest in me or found someone else. So once she does get back to our University I was just swiping through tinder and I see her on there. I know I shouldn't be swiping through tinder at this point, but at that moment I really felt as if all hope of being with this girl any longer was gone. At that point I realized she was using me and I was using her. She used me to try to satisfy her own pleasures while I tried using her to patch a hole in my heart from when my own mother died. Between the beginning of spring break and now I've cried more times than I can count on one hand. So yesterday I was really happy to see her in class. But in class she didn't say a word to me and was flirting with this other guy the entire time. We usually walked to classes together or would talk after class, but she went with the other guy instead. I couldn't hold back the tears so I went to the music building and sat in a single room with a lone piano and played my heart out. It really didn't help all that much, if anything it just made me feel worse since the notes weren't played to the degree they were supposed to be played. I don't know how to describe it but I was able to hear the sorrow and frustration in my playing and it only made me even more irritated. At this point I am at a loss for words, after coming this far life has chewed me up and spit me out yet again. I went to church for the first time in a long time on Tuesday but even then I felt like I was truly alone. My mom would definitely tell me how to handle this situation, she's the one that kept me from attempting suicide around this time last year. And now that she isn't here I don't know what to do. Like why is life this complicated for me? I don't want to do this anymore, it's all so pointless. I have an exam in 12 hours, I'm probably going to fail since I've been crying for the last 4 hours. I just want to know why is life like this? It's honestly the worst feeling ever"

86ipzu,1,2018-03-23,INFP needs advice on a lost friendship with an eNFJ :(,2wyked,enfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/86ipzu/infp_needs_advice_on_a_lost_friendship_with_an/,"Hi guys! I'm an INFP that needs advice on a past friendship I had with an ENFJ. Sorry if this gets long, I will try to keep it as short as I can. 

Okay, I first met ""Amy"" when I moved to my new city for school and started my new restaurant job. She was the bartender there and I was a server. We became fast friends, we just clicked so well. We later became roommates - BEST living situation I ever had. we never had any issues, never got into any fights. before moving in with each other we were friends for about a year. Amy honestly was the best friend I always wanted. I really felt like we understood each other so well and I felt like she really cared for me more like family than a friend. I'm very introverted and shy, she dragged me out of it and introduced me to all of her friends which made me feel welcomed, as this was a new city to me. We were always together 24/7. We both would say we were basically soulmates, which I truly believe even to this day. I never met anyone who I felt 100% myself. I just really loved her and I know she loved me too. So I was going to school full time, working 5 days a week, working at an internship, social life, and had a bf. She only worked as a bartender full time. I was pretty busy at this time in my life, which I don't think she understood how much stress I was under. One day we got in a fight at work because she said I never made any time for her and our other friends. I got defensive and said I'm just really busy. A few hours later when I got home I texted her a huge text apologizing saying I realize I haven't been making any time to hang out, I'm just really busy, but I will work on it and I'm sorry if I haven't been around. she never texted me back. A couple of days later I fly out of the state for a mini vacation and then come back like a week later. we hadn't talked at all. basically, we ignore each other for like two months. During this time she made 2 new friends at work that she basically replaces me with. We are both extremely avoidant when it comes to problems and confrontation. At work she becomes really aggressive to me and starts posting really petty stuff about me on fb (it didn't actually say my name but it was so obvious it was about me). I had seen her be aggressive to other people but I never thought she would direct it at me, so I became even more avoidant which kind of snowballs into a bigger issue. this entire situation gave me a LOT of anxiety as I didnt know how to confront her. she eventually tells me shes moving out with her boyfriend, we kind of talk about what happened with us and we apologize. Later we get into another fight because I wasn't there to move the couch, she got really nasty with me, even though I moved EVERYTHING else out and deep cleaned the apartment. I struggle with this because, even though I didnt act perfect, she really started becoming aggressive towards me at work and online. I found the way she acted was really immature and caused me so much anxiety.

now I realize we both didn't act like adults, I should have confronted her right away instead of sending her a text. Or I should have confronted her when I came back from my vacation instead of avoiding her. I know I hurt her feelings since I wasn't around as much, I think she felt I was paying more attention to my bf which is fair. but she also hurt my feelings. It was all around a shit show. 

Its been a year now since this all happened and I still think about it all the time. I've never been good at making friends so I think this really affected me. we had a great friendship and with one fight it all disintegrated. I dont know if I should just move on or if I should make an attempt to reach out to her? I dont know. any advice?

If you read this thank you!

86jfum,0,2018-03-23,"My partner [26F] of 3 years is an enigma and seems to not want to commit or depend on me [26M], which really hurts.",greyt333,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/86jfum/my_partner_26f_of_3_years_is_an_enigma_and_seems/,"I [26M] have been in a relationship with my partner [26F] now for almost 3 years. Living together for almost 2 years, but now long-distance for the last year.

I love my partner. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. She's a wonderful, caring person with a heart of gold. She's my best friend. I love hanging out with her. She is wicked smart. Way smarter than me. I remember waking up once to her doing math problems on my couch in her underwear, after we first started dating. She's attractive, though she doesn't like to admit it. The sex is great. I can trust her. We both love dogs. We disagree on politics, but we're able to look past that.

Here's the problem though. She's an enigma. I don't know what she really wants. And now it's making me not know what I want.

What do I want? I want a partner that loves me. That shares similar values and wants to raise a family together. Someone that can depend on me and that I can depend on. A healthy marriage. A partner for life. 

My partner and I have talked a bit about marriage. In the past, we've always agreed that it's a ways out. I'm usually the one that's brought it up. And more recently, I broached the topic of kids. I said I wanted to have 4 kids. She countered with what I thought was a very weird response, almost like a negotiation, and said what about 2 kids and adopt 2 more.

In any case, we've not been living together the past year. We've been doing a long distance sort of thing. I moved to Canada, then she came with me. But after 6 months of not finding a job, getting super depressed, I observed it wasn't working and told her she should move back. It's worth noting that the place I moved does not have a ton of job opportunities, so I didn't want to limit her career.

Now my partner has found an internship. She's paid $18/hr. She's also working towards her masters, but sort of half-heartedly as she does not really know what she wants to do career wise.

On the flip side, I am quite successful for my age. I started and sold a business coming out of college. I have enough savings that I could take the next 2 years off, travel the world, and still have plenty of money to start a family and my next business.

When we were living together, we shared expenses. And money was never really an issue of conflict between us. She was very adamant about paying her ""fair share."" Even though I had more income and would have happily helped out while she was getting her career started. Heck, I even offered to help pay for her masters but she didn't want it b/c she didn't know what she wants to do.

Anyway, the reason I am sharing this context is because I feel the stages of where we are each at in our careers, creates this dichotomy holding back our relationship. In some ways, I feel I am 5 years ahead in my life. I have a vision for what I want both professionally and with a family. Her mindset is much different though. Like someone just coming out of school, on a ramen diet, that doesn't know what they want to do yet. And not just not know what she wants to do, but she is unwilling to depend on me.

The fact that she is unwilling to depend on me hurts, to be honest. One time I asked her what her biggest fear was and she said being homeless when she's 50. And that really hurt, because with me, I would never let that happen to her. Ever. I have worked very yard from a young age and been very responsible with my money and just with my life. So not only was it insulting. But it shows her lack of thinking about my success, as ""our"" success.

To add some more drama, I have recently bought an commitment ring (a really nice one, like engagement quality). But now I am having second thoughts about giving it to her. I am not confident that she is confident in me. I feel like there's plenty of women that would want to date, or even marry someone in my situation. But my partner is so focused on her self and her own career, she fails to see the bigger picture of ""us.""

Something just doesn't feel right. At this point, I'm wondering if I need to find a woman that's more traditional and would be happy with me being the primary breadwinner. Or heck, maybe I just need to go travel the world for a bit, get some more ""experience"" in other relationships, and what other guys my age usually do. 

By the way, I actually asked my partner if she wanted to go traveling the world with me for 3-6 months. I have never really a chance to travel, since I've always been working on my business even through college. Her response though? That she thought I should go solo. But she might do a week trip with me. And when I pressed why, she said b/c she feels behind in her career and wants to get another internship.

So my question for the community is, should I hold off on committing to my partner? Until she has more clarity about her life and career?

**tl;dr I want to commit to my partner, but she is more focused on her career than the concept of ""us""**

86jstf,0,2018-03-23,My [M/21] first relationship in 4 years ended because I let my fears control how I felt about my gf [F/18] But I still want to get back with her.,howdyeehaw,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/86jstf/my_m21_first_relationship_in_4_years_ended/,"This is a long read so I’m sorry but a cowboy really going thru it.

I met her through school, we’re in the same program. We had a few projects together and our friendship grew into an attraction. I’m a pretty particular person when it comes to dating but when I first met her I knew I was going to end up fucking myself over somehow.

The first couple months went great, all of the dates were great, she’s humorous and witty and is a much different person than I am which is exactly what I was looking for. She’s into theatre and is a much more social being than I am, her intelligence strength definitely lies within being a people person. Her family life is really rough, her parents are in a loveless marriage, her dad only works late nights and her older brother violated her.

Her family life reminded me a lot of my mothers family life, since both my parents came from broken homes, I felt an immense bond for this girl, and I wanted to help be a support system for her. The conversations we had from the jump were extremely engaging and she’s the first person I’ve met since high school that I actively sought out to talk to.

But yeah typical chummy honeymoon phase stuff. Our first date was on Halloween and it was really great lost my virginity to her early on and things seemed to have no ceilings. And then my immature tendencies started rearing their ugly head around, I had not been in a relationship or dated a girl in 4 years and that lack of development and experience really caught up to me.

With her being more social than I was my biggest fear was being cheated on. While there were red flags to validate my feelings I held those over her head throughout the rest of the relationship. [she spent thanksgiving with a guy, they dated for like a week before we started going out, behind my back without telling me] And I had to find out because she left her google photos account open on my computer which in turn made me feel like shit for snooping. But absolutely pissed me off I should’ve pulled the plug then. The second red flag was she got drunk at a Christmas Day party and kissed her friend(girl with one arm) and her friend’s sister which, while she is bi-sexual and it’s really more funny than anything it did cause to me to question her decision making in general. Which that was literally the day after I had introduced her to my entire extended family.

So yeah, the relationship is kind of in a super rocky place but then it’s New Year’s Eve and we go out to Dallas and I bought a hotel room and yada-yada a lot of sex. She told me she had never felt how I made her feel that night and coming from her, as someone who has had a lot more experience than me, it made me feel really great. 

Back to reality the Spring semester starts and my insecurities about her just talking/texting new theatre guys starts damaging the relationship and makes it unbearable. Every time we hung out I would only talk about the relationship and how we needed to be better people or whatever the fuck etc. while not being direct about what was really bothering me. I was behaving like a high schooler because that was the only other relationship experience I had ever had. She made it clear that while she has had a promiscuous past she’s not one to cheat, but then for me I started thinking about those red flags. In hindsight, I should’ve been much more happier about the fact that I was the dude that got to be with her.

So then around that point my tangents about the relationship got in the way of us going out and consistently having a good time, which in turn led to her losing sexual attraction toward me because i was behaving irrationally and just yeah super not fun times for about 4-5 weeks consisting of me calling her while she’s just trying to go out with the theatre group and go and enjoy shows and just be a young person and have fun. 

It got to a point where “she wanted to take a break” meaning she was afraid of hurting me. So that went on for like two or so weeks. We go out to Denton on one Sunday since that’s where I’m transferring to school next semester and she’s thinking about going there also, but yeah I just broke down again and went on another annoying ass tangent about the relationship which I acknowledge is dumb as fuck of me. So yeah that was shit, she wanted to dump me that night but came back around and wanted to “fix things”

Valentine’s Day comes around, I pull up on her buying weed brownies from a dude in her theatre class, which yeah she’s attracted to him but again the thin amount of trust I had for her was still there. And I just made a joke trying to make light of mine and her’s situation and it just did not land. That night I learned I am no Billy Burr. So that Friday I had just landed an internship and was feeling great went to her house to do brownies, which woulda been my first drug experience and she just pulled the plug.

Which was the right thing to do, both of us were burnt out and miserable and felt like the relationship was holding us back.

I even made the post break break up unbearable, it was about two weeks of me destroyed and just calling her to talk and I had to delete her number off my phone twice and everything else just so I could somehow tame my impulse.

I sent her an awful text message telling her all of the things that I saw were wrong about her, and said she only sought validation through the attention of guys etc fucked up scum bag shit that i still feel awful about. It was just me trying to “win” 

dumbass caveman behavior type shit.

So now it’s been about a month of extremely brief contact, very rusty just robotic non human shitty twitter dms and like 30 second run ins at school trying to repair the friendship. Ive gone to both of her theatre performances and ive really loved watching her be free and just use that as a stress relief but in turns it fucks me up because I became that unneeded stress in her life, which she did not need on top of her family life.

She’s already dated multiple guys and gone on a spring break trip/partied all of that, which initially I was mad about it which doesn’t make sense because she’s not my girlfriend, and her vagina is her business. But now I just feel empty because her and I had planned on a lot.

Im currently losing the fight against my impulses to check on her social media constantly and seeing her spending time with her new theatre dude fucks me up blahblah and it’s just wack it’s another immaturity of mine.

In hindsight, the mistakes I made in the relationship range from irrational spending [ballpark $1500 for someone who had maybe $2200 saved up at the time], allowing my fears to control how I acted and behaved. And overall just taking her for granted, her temperament was exactly what I needed, someone not as overly analytical as I am. And someone who allows things to figure themselves out instead of  forcing everything.

I’ve definitely grown from the relationship and I’m better for having had the experience and I’m super grateful I went through something as shitty as this with a person like her. 

I’ve started working out again, learning Spanish and after effects and I’m trying to get into playing the piano and singing so I’ve attempted to fill the void and but I just keep running into the hurdle of knowing that I potentially had something really great slip through my fingers.

She had picked up the theatre classes as an aside thing anyways because she wanted the fulfillment that she didn’t get in high school and I just let that take control of me as an act of changing or whatever the fuck just really wack of me.

I regret trying to force her to be a different person, it was just kind of along the lines of priding to be more productive because she does have motivation flaws and she’s not extremely consistent with effort. But that was really the basis of my awful tangents that would poor out of me while we were just trying to peruse the aisles of a mf target.

Right now I’m just focused on rebuilding the friendship with her that I neglected that ultimately led to the relationship deteriorating.

What I’m hoping for is that she will see how I’ve grown through my bullshit and that we’ll try again once I move to Denton. Because right now expecting her to drop whatever stoner laid back dude she’s with now just isn’t gonna happen. And I’m not mad about that.

Look, I’m 21. I don’t know shit. I don’t have much relationship experience. I’ve never been one to seek girls to fuck around with, I view it as empty experiences. I’ve tried pursuing to date some other girls since I’ve got dumped and there’s just no emotional fulfillment happening. And the idea of just meeting a girl to have sex with and nothing else sucks. And I’m like a 5 too haha I’ve just really stacked the cards against me.

My point though is at this time in my life I want to be with this girl she’s the only viable partner I’ve found. Like I said I’m a picky mfer.

My main quarrel is am I fucking myself over by waiting for another chance with her. If I continually just work on myself while having false hopes of getting back together am I doing myself harm. 

She’s the type of girl to cut people off that she doesn’t want in her life, like it’s some ruthless shit. But the fact that she’s directed an iota of her personality back in small flashes toward me gives me hope.

The thing is I was filled with false hope while we were on our “break” which was really just her afraid of breaking things off which I feel like shit for making things hard on her. 

We talked about driving to her family in California for her birthday because she does it annually but I just feel like I’m going to end up having all these hopes and it’s just going to end up with her going with the theatre dude.

And for clarity’s sake I understand how trivial a lot of this shit is, but as someone who has consistently neglected their social life, she was just the kind of social person I always looked for, so it’s just been rough.

With her being the girl that I lost my virginity to, and with her being my first adult-ISH relationship with I’m sure that has a significant impact on my bias, I’m both aware and not-giving-a-fuck at the same time.

Please help me, I’ve asked everyone I trust for guidance, I just need to know if what i plan on doing now is just another irrational step down the rabbit hole.

TLDR: I let my fears control my relationship, which ultimately ended my relationship. She’s seeing someone else but I still want to get back with her.

I am currently working at a small company as an electrical engineering intern and they've made me responsible for a lot of spreadsheets with production information from all the field teams.
The company is small but growing fast and I've been trying to optimize my work and make all data more accessible to everyone.

Recently I came across IIs and after a few tries I've made a spreadsheet avaiable on the company's intranet. The thing is I have NO experience with HTML, webhosting, IIs and etc, but I've been studying a lot and learnt a few things with Python and WebScrapping.

My idea is to gather all the data avaiable and display the important information in a easily accessible way (most workers here are not so tech-savvy). Is IIs a good option for this purpose? Could someone more experienced give me some tips and procedures for managing and displaying this data?

Most files are avaiable as Excel files and are filled and formated by me. The data comes through manual gathering or Python Scripts. All help is welcome since I wanna learn and become more useful to the company.

Cheers

I angrily tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves. For a moment I’m reminded of some Asian girl whose name I’d already forgotten. She was prettier when she cried.

I sigh loudly – more of a growl – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns arriving any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up.**

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing when guests arrive is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one.

I was, however, in prime position to watch a master at work. I came into a big multinational company as an intern, and got invited to sit in on a meeting for experience. This meeting wasn't particularly important in the grand scheme of things, but did involve serious conversations with one of our service providers (hence why it would be a good experience). 
My manager explained that we were having issues with a product that the service provider had developed. Basically, it was still in the early documentation specs part of the project - their first deliverable. But the document they had produced was utterly terrible. The expert from inside our own company had sent it back four times for revisions, and the service provider had consistently failed to met the deadlines. This was their last chance before some serious penalties would be applied to their contract.

My manager and I meet up with the expert, who is a young woman (relevant only because this is a fairly tech-intensive field, so she ended up being the only woman in this meeting), and the service provider's specialists who are meant to be writing the document. 

And the service provider's client support manager. And the service provider's contract managers. And the service provider's managers' manager. This meeting ended up having 9 people in it. On our side: 3 people. On the service provider's side: 6, including big names who are clearly gunning for a fight.

Expert takes charge of the meeting fairly quickly, and immediately hands out copies of the document in question to everyone. It's about a twenty-page document, with maybe 15 tabs marking out parts. There are also comments in the margin via microsoft word, giving what seemed to me to be very clear explanations as to what is wrong and how to fix it.

Our Expert then says that the service provider had requested the meeting, and asked if they had any particular questions about the feedback. They say they'd like to discuss everything, and Expert turns to the first tab in her copy and reads out the comment. Given its at the start of the document, it's something to do with the scope listing three types of information as in scope, and excluded a fourth that was very important to clearly document.

At this point, the service provider contract manager immediately argues that Expert is being too pedantic, and that it's unreasonable for them to continue to make minor changes. It seems pretty clear that this is leading up to some kind of argument, and my own manager begins to respond.

Then Expert pulls out a NEW set of documents, and hands them out to everyone. The original version of the document had about 15 tabs over 20 pages. This has something like 40. They're color-coded.
""The other version has those issues that I believe are most significant, and that need to be resolved to meet the minimum standard. However, I am perfectly happy to go through every issue I found, and every way that this document does not meet the company standard and style guide that you agreed to follow, and have all of us discuss which of each of these issues are required for acceptance.""

And then Expert starts to do so. The first issue is on the title page; they've labelled an acronym wrong. Surely problems on the front page are enough of a poor reflection on quality, and so easy to fix, that it can be resolved before the document is accepted?

After maybe 15 minutes of this detail, the service provider's contract manager pulls a different tactic. He argues that they've done several iterations already, and that Expert keeps identifying different things to change - he says she's moving the goalposts.

And so Expert pulls out a THIRD version of the document. This one is twice as long, because its a legal blackline comparison from an earlier version of the document. It also has twice as many tabs as the second one. These tabs have symbols on the ends as well as colors.
Expert now wants us to go through this version of the document, and she will demonstrate that her feedback has remained consistent throughout the iterations, and that the service provider team has either failed to address it, or have implemented new, undiscussed changes that had issues. And also go through the fine-tooth comb and negotiate which of the many issues are 'significant' enough that they're show stoppers.

All nine of us were in that meeting room for 90 minutes before the the service provider's contract manager's manager decided that Expert clearly knew what she was talking about, and they were just going to take her word for it on what the bare minimum was and do that.

Expert refused. She said that since there had been so many issues with this document and getting it up to scratch, it was clearly important that they go through all the issues so that everyone could understand what level of quality was expected. (I was also there and had to read through every comment Expert had, so take my word for it when I tell you that her ire was well-founded. It was very badly written, and even had random half-sentences scattered throughout it.)

It took two hours to go through the document. The service provider walked away with 25 changes to make, which was more than what Expert had initially presented them with. 

I checked her work bag when we were done with the meeting; there was at least one  more version of the document in there that she was prepared to pull out if the service provider kept trying to be difficult.

TLDR; service provider tries to argue about the changes our expert wants made to a document, so she pulls out a more detailed version TWICE, and makes them go through that instead. The service provider management are forced to spend 2 hours reading through extremely detailed feedback - extending a 30 minute meeting into 2 hours - and leave with more work that our expert had originally wanted them to do.

EDIT/UPDATE: I asked the Expert what was in the fourth copy of the document. She says it is the 'cross-referenced version' to other emails, evidence and documents that have already been developed, and regulations that our industry is obligated to follow."

I'm a senior Business Analytics &amp; Info Systems major w/ three internships at the same company (IT, Business Intelligence, and IT Project Management) that I'm considering sticking with, if possible. 

The reason why I'm a bit hesitant to continue is because I found in my research that the position is primarily based on coding. I know a few languages, but my knowledge of each of them are pretty basic (not anywhere near good enough for any type of programming position, imo). I also saw there's a pretty brutal coding exam/technical interview, so I almost immediately don't want to waste time in applying. Ideally I'd like to go into security, but I've just been looking for sysadmin positions to gain some experience. 

Would you recommend for me to still apply for the position? Again, I'm just going off of research on Reddit/Glassdoor, so I could be entirely wrong. I definitely don't mind learning on the job, but as it stands, I just don't know if I'd be wasting time to continue on.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Using a throwaway since my fiance is also a Redditor. 



My fiance ""John"" and I have been together for a 5 years, engaged since last spring, and living together for 3 years. We have a pet together, and are getting married this summer. Our relationship is going so well--we went to couples therapy last year to work out conflict styles, and are in a very solid place. 



HOWEVER (and if there wasn't a however I wouldn't be here)... John is a graduate student, due to graduate this May. He went back to school a few years into our relationship, and chose to leave a good job to pursue his degree full-time. I also hold a graduate degree, so although I wasn't thrilled about having to adjust to a semi-student lifestyle again, I supported his decision. Part of what reassured me is the program he chose boasted amazing job placement stats, with really good starting salaries. 



Graduate school has definitely put a strain on our relationship (part of why we went to therapy), and last year he wasn't able to find a summer internship. He was one of maybe a handful of people in his 100 person class this happened to. He was really upset about it, but I wasn't too worried since it wasn't a requirement and it's not like he has no working experience (he worked in corporate jobs in the same general field for all the years after undergrad). 



Well. Now we're 1.5 months from graduation, and he has had zero job offers. Most people in his class have had offers since the fall. I don't blame John at all... he's been having lots of first interviews, reaching out and doing informational interviews, going to their career resource center, etc. He just can't seem to get past the interview stage. 



Last night he told me he didn't get the job at the one place that seemed serious about him (he had 3 interviews including a 3-hour panel interview last week). I am gutted. I thought he was going to get it. And I know he is losing hope and steam in the job hunt. He's becoming cynical and upset. I am too!



This morning I had a full freak-out about what we will do if he graduates jobless. I work in an under-paid field.... I make okay money, but it's not enough to support 2 adults, especially if I need to add him to my health insurance (it would be a $300+ expense every month). I already struggle to pay my student loans and car payments.... I cannot pay both of our rent portions and the extra insurance/food costs. On top of that... we're planning a wedding! Luckily our parents are paying for the whole thing, so we don't need to worry about canceling it... but it's still added stress. Not to mention we had talked about using any money from the wedding for a down payment on a house but now I'm worried we'll need it just to stay afloat. 



I know that he must be feeling 100x worse and more panicky than me (and yes, he's expressed his anxiety and sadness over all these job rejections and questioning why he even started the program)... so I don't want to dump my anxiety onto him. My question is this: How can I help him? How can I help myself? We're a team and we will get through this. I don't want to add to his burden right now but I can't focus at work I'm so freaked out. He noticed I was super sad this morning and said he didn't want me to worry but I can't help it... so how do I make sure I'm not increasing his stress over this and also manage my own? I need to be his rock through this. Please help me find some zen, or come up with an action plan :( 



TL;DR: My fiance is amazing but struggling to find a job before he graduates in May. My income is not enough to support two people comfortably and I'm panicking about what will happen if we need to live on my income. Please help me figure out a way to manage my stress or come up with a plan so I don't stress out my SO more!"
86llvr,1,2018-03-23,How do I [22F] get my boyfriend [22M] of 5 years to pick up the slack with chores while I finish school? Or at least realize that he has more time than I do?I’m starting to build resentment.,bfnotbusythrow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/86llvr/how_do_i_22f_get_my_boyfriend_22m_of_5_years_to/,"To preface: My boyfriend is an great dude, and we get along very well. We’ve been living together for around 8 months now, and it’s been  pretty good, but we’ve had some issues with the transition mainly due to chores. For a while it was fine, but now as I’m getting close to graduating, I’m getting more stressed. 

He graduated last semester and works part time, around 28 hours a week. I am graduating in May, and I work an internship from home 18-20 hours a week, go to school for 13, and I have four semester projects along with homework for my classes due to it being my last semester. So, just with that, I’m super exhausted and stressed and I don’t have much time to spare for much else. 

As I mentioned, we struggled with chores in the past, when he was still in school. And if I’m being honest, we’re both have a tendency to be messy, but I will pick up after myself more often than he does. We’ve talked about it before, he tends to leave dirty and clean laundry everywhere, or have friends over who leave trash and cups everywhere or throw or move the couch cushions. 

As for what we do ourselves: he does most of the cooking, which I really appreciate. We both enjoy it, but he has more time than I do. We alternate washing dishes (and sometimes I will do dishes while he is cooking). We do our own laundry. 

Last semester and early this semester I had more time and would usually use every other weekend for some cleaning. This includes things like tidying up spaces, vacuuming, sometimes wiping down appliances and bathroom. And really, I don’t even mind cleaning honestly, I find it kinda gratifying.

However, lately I haven’t had the time to do this cleaning, because whenever I have any spare time, I honestly just want to sleep. I’ve been pulling a lot of late nights trying to get stuff completed. My boyfriend mentioned how we need to clean and that he wiped down a  small portion of the bathroom sink. I said “Yeah, I know, I’ve just been so busy with everything lately I haven’t been able to get to it.” And he said “yeah I know I’ve been busy too” 

While I didn’t say anything at the comment, (I didn’t really want to be snarky and I actually had to finish a project so I wanted to get back to work) the more I think about it the more resentful I become. It feels like a slap in the face, because I’m so exhausted and stressed, and most of the time I’m working/doing homework I can hear him in the other room playing video games or watching the office.

After writing this, I don’t even know if I care that he doesn’t clean...just that he realizes he’s got way more free time to do so. Like, just be honest! You’re not busy! You have way more free time! I don’t really care that he plays video games or watches Netflix a lot. I just hate his excuse of being busy when he isn’t. I let it slide last semester when we had this argument  because he was still in school, and he leveraged I spent more time at home anyway because I worked from home (which I realize now it super dumb because I was working...) 

So my question is, how do I bring this up/talk about this without getting pissy? Or how do I confront this the next time if he says he’s busy, without being rude about it? I don’t really want an argument, just to make him see.

TLDR; I’m in my last semester and super stressed with work and school. The house had been getting dirty and I haven’t got time to clean it, like normally. Boyfriend told me he was busy like me, whenever he plays videogames/hangs with friends/Netflix for hours. I’m resentful because he’s obviously not busy. How do I bring this up/confront this for the next time without being rude?"

&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
Het EU Joint Transfer Pricing Forum publiceert jaarlijks statistieken die  
zien op Advance Pricing Agreements &amp;#40;APA’s&amp;#41;.[1] Nederland levert hiervoor  
jaarlijks de beschikbaar zijnde gegevens aan. Daarnaast publiceert ook de  
Belastingdienst zelf jaarlijks het aantal APA’s dat is afgesloten. De meest  
recente cijfers zijn terug te vinden in het jaarverslag van het APA/ATR-  
team dat is gevoegd als bijlage bij mijn brief van 18 februari jl. Hieruit  
blijkt het aantal afgegeven APA’s in de afgelopen vijf jaar.  
&amp;nbsp;    
|      |2013  |2014  |2015  |2016  |2017 |  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingdienst houdt niet centraal bij hoeveel lopende APA’s er zijn  
per einde van enig jaar. De gemiddelde looptijd van een APA is 4 tot 5  
jaar. Het kan echter zijn dat een APA eerder eindigt bijvoorbeeld omdat de  
aan de APA ten grondslag liggende feiten en omstandigheden zijn gewijzigd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Hoe is het mogelijk dat u in antwoorden op vragen immer stelt ‘dat  
Nederland bijna aan alle afspraken voldoet’ die in bijvoorbeeld in de  
Europese gedragscodegroep zijn gemaakt?  
   
Vraag 3  
Waarom noemde u Nederland als onderdeel van de ‘coalition of the unwilling’  
in de gedragscodegroep “een oud beeld”, als nu blijkt dat Nederland zich  
eenzaam onderscheidt in het niet delen hoeveel belastingafspraken er zijn  
gemaakt? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vragen 2 en 3  
Zoals weergegeven in het antwoord hiervoor, ben ik van mening dat Nederland  
wel het aantal afgesloten APA’s openbaar maakt. Ik deel daarom de  
onderliggende strekking van uw vragen niet dat Nederland zijn afspraken  
niet nakomt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Kunt u aangeven hoeveel rulings er de afgelopen jaren zijn afgegeven met  
als basis of onderdeel de concernfinanciering-constructie, ook wel fiscale  
begeleiding genoemd, en nu nog actief zijn? 3&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 4  
De rulings over concernfinancieringactiviteiten, zoals beschreven in  
bijlage III van de brief van 18 februari jongstleden, zijn eind 2016  
verlopen.[2]  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
Is de werkwijze van deze constructie gemeld of afgestemd met de  
gedragscodegroep en/of de Europese Commissie, vooral omdat de fiscale  
begeleiding een constructie verving die gekenmerkt was als staatssteun? Zo  
ja, wanneer? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 5  
Er was geen aanleiding om de Europese Commissie te informeren omdat, er  
immers geen sprake was van voortzetting van het oude CFA-regime. Ten  
opzichte van het CFA-regime was namelijk een andere situatie ontstaan. Het  
op verzoek verstrekken van zekerheid vooraf betrof de reguliere uitvoering  
van wet- en regelgeving met name op het gebied van verrekenprijzen en de  
deelnemingsvrijstelling. Dat betekent dat er geen sprake was van een  
‘voordeel’ waarover afstemming met de Europese Commissie was geboden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Is er toen per 2010 het Concern Financierings Activiteiten &amp;#40;CFA&amp;#41;-  
regime werd afgeschaft, actief ingezet op het bieden van de fiscale  
begeleiding/ concernfinanciering? Zo ja, met welke argumenten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
Sinds het in 2003 bekend werd dat het CFA-regime afgeschaft zou worden, is  
er door het Ministerie van Financiën nagedacht over de beleidsmatige en  
politieke implicaties daarvan. Dit heeft enerzijds geresulteerd in de  
uiteindelijk toch niet ingevoerde wetgeving rond de &amp;#40;verplichte&amp;#41;  
groepsrentebox. Anderzijds werd de Belastingdienst geconfronteerd met  
fiscale vraagstukken van bedrijven die overwogen hun  
concernfinancieringsvermogen over te brengen naar het buitenland. Als  
gevolg daarvan hebben mijn ambtsvoorgangers beslist over de lijnen  
waarlangs de Belastingdienst voor de periode 2007 tot en met 2016 op  
verzoek zekerheid vooraf zou geven over in de dat verband opkomende fiscale  
kwesties.  
   
Vraag 7  
Klopt het dat uit het WOB-verzoek is op te maken dat er al in maart 2011  
getwijfeld werd of de afspraken die de Belastingdienst maakte wel in  
overeenstemming waren met de geldende wetten en regels? Zo ja, waarom is er  
dan doorgegaan met het maken van belastingdeals met deze constructie erin?  
   
Antwoord 7  
Zoals ook blijkt uit openbaar gemaakte stukken bestreed de Belastingdienst  
ook al in 2011 constructies waarbij sprake is van het stallen van  
immateriële vaste activa in tax havens &amp;#40;STIATH&amp;#41;. In 2011 is door de  
Belastingdienst een mogelijk verband gelegd tussen  
concernfinancieringsactiva en immateriële vaste activa die betrokken zijn  
bij STIATH omdat in beide gevallen sprake is van vermogen dat wordt  
aangehouden in een laagbelastende jurisdictie. Daar stond tegen over dat  
concernfinancieringsactiva een ander soort activa zijn dan immateriële  
vaste activa die betrokken zijn bij STIATH.  
Concernfinancieringsactiviteiten vragen minder functionaliteit dan het  
ontwikkelen, exploiteren, onderhouden, beheren en beschermen van  
immateriële activa. De heersende opvatting in internationaal verband was  
aanvankelijk dat aan treasuryactiviteiten met betrekking tot  
concernfinancieringsvermogen een relatief minder groot deel van het  
rendement toekwam dan het deel van het rendement dat toegerekend moet  
worden aan het ontwikkelen, exploiteren, onderhouden, beheren en beschermen  
van immateriële activa.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In OESO-verband is tijdens het BEPS-project de discussie ontstaan welk deel  
van het rendement kan worden toegerekend aan het  
concernfinancieringsvermogen dat in handen is van een lichaam zonder dat in  
dat lichaam de bijbehorende functies worden uitgeoefend. Uiteindelijk heeft  
de uitkomst van deze discussie zijn weerslag gevonden in de BEPS-rapporten  
die zijn gepubliceerd in oktober 2015 en de aanpassingen van de OESO-  
richtlijnen voor verrekenprijzen in 2017. In OESO-verband wordt op dit  
moment nader overlegd tussen de landen over de zakelijke beloning voor  
financiële transacties.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
Kunt u aangeven waarom in het WOB-verzoek veel passages zijn weggelakt  
waarin wordt aangegeven dat men twijfelde aan de houdbaarheid? Waarom wordt  
zo een advies gezien als een ‘persoonlijke mening van een ambtenaar’ als  
dit relevante onderdelen van de beleidsafweging moeten zijn geweest?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 8  
Het ministerie van Financiën maakt in Wob-besluiten geen persoonlijke  
beleidsopvattingen ten behoeve van intern beraad openbaar. Dit geldt voor  
alle Wob-besluiten en in dit geval was er geen aanleiding om van die  
gedragslijn af te wijken. Deze gedragslijn is afgeleid van het  
afwegingskader dat van toepassing is op Wob-verzoeken, zoals vastgelegd in  
artikel 11, lid 1, Wet Openbaarheid  van Bestuur. Daarin wordt bepaald dat  
bij een verzoek om informatie uit documenten, opgesteld ten behoeve van  
intern beraad, geen informatie verstrekt over daarin opgenomen persoonlijke  
beleidsopvattingen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
Hoe is er na het besluit in september 2015, om geen zekerheid vooraf meer  
te geven over de transfer pricing aspecten van de  
concernfinancieringsstructuur, gehandeld met toen geldende belastingdeals  
of deals die afliepen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
Is het mogelijk dat er toch nog belastingdeals met deze constructie  
verlengd zijn in 2016? Zo ja, hoe verhoudt dit zich tot de gestelde  
ommezwaai van de Nederlandse regering in de gedragscodegroep? 4&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 9 en 10  
Omdat in 2014 de internationale ontwikkelingen nog niet volledig waren  
uitgekristalliseerd en om de bedrijven die eerder zekerheid vooraf hadden  
gekregen over hun financieringsstructuur in staat te stellen zich aan te  
passen aan de ontwikkelingen, is een uitfaseringstermijn gehanteerd van 2  
jaar. Deze termijn liep eind 2016 af. Daarna zijn geen rulings meer  
verlengd. Indien na deze termijn het concernfinancieringsvermogen wordt  
aangehouden door een buitenlandse vennootschap die verder geen enkele  
functie uitoefent, neemt de Belastingdienst in voorkomende gevallen het  
standpunt in dat ten hoogste een risicovrij rendement aan het in het  
buitenland aangehouden concernvermogen kan worden toegerekend.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11  
Heeft u het idee dat het inzicht in de rulingpraktijk echt boven tafel is  
gekomen met het onderzoek dat u heeft gedaan naar de procedures van  
afsluiten? Zou het niet veel beter zijn om alle rulings op inhoud te  
doorzoeken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 11  
Ik heb de onafhankelijke commissie met externe experts die onderzoek doet  
naar rulings afgegeven door het APA-ATR-team gevraagd te beoordelen of  
volgens haar de gepubliceerde stukken over de APA/ATR-praktijkvoldoende  
inzicht geven in de APA’s en ATR’s zoals ze worden afgegeven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In mijn brief van 18 februari jl. heb ik een herziening van de  
rulingpraktijk aangekondigd die gericht is op het verder waarborgen van de  
kwaliteit en robuustheid van de praktijk.[3] De aangekondigde herziening  
ziet op zowel het proces als de inhoud. Daarnaast loopt op dit moment een  
inhoudelijk onderzoek door de hiervoor genoemde onafhankelijke commissie  
met externe experts naar rulings afgegeven door het APA-ATR-team. Dit  
onderzoek zal jaarlijks plaatsvinden. Ook zal de Algemene Rekenkamer in  
2019 onderzoek doen naar de rulingpraktijk. Buiten het feit dat een  
onderzoek naar de inhoud van alle rulings veel capaciteit zou vergen van de  
medewerkers van de Belastingdienst, zie ik op basis van de hiervoor  
aangehaalde initiatieven geen aanleiding om alle rulings waarbij de  
procedures juist zijn gevolgd op de inhoud te controleren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 12  
Kunt u deze vragen beantwoorden voor het plenaire debat over  
belastingontwijking dat voorzien is in week 13?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 12  
Ja.

86m06k,5,2018-03-23,Financial Aid,cluesthecat,UMBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMBC/comments/86m06k/financial_aid/,"So I am an incoming student for the Fall of 2018 and looking to get into the Computer Science program. I am transferring from Carroll Community College Cybersecurity program and already have my schedule of the classes I need to take.

I am still waiting for the financial aid package to be presented to me from UMBC to see how much I am going to have to pay to go to this school. Unfortunately, since this was my first pick of schools, right when I was accepted, I went ahead and accepted the offer to go to the school. With the amount of required classes in the CS program, it looks like I am going to have to go for at least 3 more years, if not up to the complete 4. So the amount that I have to pay is a big reason that I may have to withdraw my acceptance if I don't get enough financial aid. 

Towson university has already sent me their financial aid package and they are covering half the tuition in grants/scholarships which is incredible. I talked to UMBC's financial aid office and they said that they were working on the packages and they should be out soon.

Basically, how much should I expect to receive? I'm 25 and married with my wife in pharmacy school. I live with my in-laws and have an internship at a tech company working part time. 

TLDR: How much do transfer students usually end up getting in financial aid when it comes to grants/scholarships? Will I have to withdraw my acceptance and lose the $450 is cost to accept?"
86m3ec,18,2018-03-23,What is a good way to assign dollar value to certain hobbies/events/outings?,hagrids_a_pineapple,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/86m3ec/what_is_a_good_way_to_assign_dollar_value_to/,"I am a 22 year old college student and will graduate in December. I have about $2800 in my checking, and have an internship starting this summer that pays well. 

I consider myself to be financially responsible, sometimes to a fault as said by my mother and girlfriend. I have a tough time shelling out money for events or outings such as going out to the bars, going skiing, movie theaters, etc. because they are very expensive for how long you get to enjoy them. For example if I buy a video game, I can expect usually at the very least $1/hour of enjoyment from the purchase. Movies are like $10/hour. Going to bars can be like $20/hour. Skiing is $25/hour. People also want to do these kinds of things multiple times a week which I think adds up super fast. 

I’m just kind of teetering between “this stuff is too expensive for what I get” and “if I won’t spend money then my life will just be video games and cheap food”. For example I want to get into backyard astronomy, but a $200 telescope is a lot of money. Will I spend 200 hours outside to make it $1/hour? Or is this hobby WORTH $4/hour or something else? Are going out to the bars worth spending $20/hour?

I do spend money on these types of experiences but I typically fight the opportunities. I also worry about having money after I graduate. Doesn’t it make sense to try and save this kind of money until I have a permanent source of income in case I need it?

I’d just like to see what other people do to manage spending money and how they decide if it’s worth the money to do something. Thanks!

86mgop,2174,2018-03-23,I met this guy on tinder who looked nothing like his pics....and also brought me a few surprises.,iamthebri,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/86mgop/i_met_this_guy_on_tinder_who_looked_nothing_like/,"So...there seems to be a story going around about this ""Bri"" &amp; her friend giving this dude head while they did cocaine off his dick.

Let me be pretty blunt with you: that was me &amp; my friend Carrie. I received a text message at 3:30 in the morning last night from Carrie and we both knew that this fool just tried to put us both on blast not even changing my actual name. 

For those that haven't read the story...read this before coming here. If you don't it might not make any sense

 https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/86cksn/i_met_this_girl_on_tinder_and_she_looked_nothing/



Let me keep it ten toes - this story is a fucking lie. How did my friend Carrie know that it was about us? Several reasons but mainly because of the interaction in the parking lot. The interaction in the parking lot was basically spot on...except for it was completely backwards.

I'll start from the beginning. I was doing an internship at Disney working at the theme park and taking some classes. For those of you that don't already know, the girls that are part of this program are crazzyyy. They party very hard and drugs are readily available among all of us. We stay in these teeny tiny apartments where we have 5-6 roommates at a time. So we get a lil crazy and definitely find anyway to spend time away from the apartment. So u/trustmeimdonaldtrump...you think I was trying to hang out so fast cause you're so damn cool and that I was swooning over that embarrassing dick pic you sent me? Nah b. Slow your roll. My friend and I wanted a place to do coke and possibly fuck someone in the process. If we did it at our place we'd be kicked out of the program. No boys, no drugs, and no fun was allowed. 

We drive over to his place and find a parking spot. Little fuckboy trump comes out of his apartment to come meet my friend and I. who I 100% mentioned was coming due to safety reasons btw. Most girls I know do that in a college like setting so this dude was probably just salty I wouldn't come by myself. Anyways so this large fella comes out... we're sitting in our car wondering who this dude approaching our car waving his hand is. his ass was waddling in our general direction like some kind of penguin. 

(Have you ever seen that episode of Spongebob of the dude who reviews the krabby patty and lies about sponge forgetting the pickles? He looked exactly like that guy.)

We both looked at each other, realized what was happening and could not stop fucking laughing. It was embarrassing as shit. I had never been catfished before but this was definitely a first for me. The dude looked like a halloween costume.

We get out the car to greet him and I literally ask him...umm are you u/trustmeimdonaldtrump ?? You look nothing like your pics. He like grunted out a ""yeah"" with some heavy breathing. I couldn't tell if that was his actual voice or if he was pretending to make it deeper for us? It was so damn strained I couldn't figure it out. 

After he showed me the tinder messages on his iphone3gs he leads us back to his apartment. We probably would of made it there by the end of the night if he didn't have 3 flights of stairs. oof - I felt for the guy. Every time he took a step I swear he'd make this weird grunting sound like he was lifting weights at the gym or playing tennis. 

So after a few hours (i'm exaggerating) we finally get to his place. He had a roommate that seemed...perfectly normal? Not the worst looking dude in the world, seemed like a normal chap and was REALLY surprised to see us there. He was like uhh what's going on? As we walked in. Trump said ""THESE ARE MY FRIENDS"" and we walked into trump's room. We probably looked like fucking hookers because the whole thing was so strange and awkward. But the roommate really looked familiar! I couldn't quite put my finger on it just yet. 

We go into his room and see cheetos all over the ground. Uh c'mon dude you didn't even wanna pretend to clean up for us? What is this? They weren't even in the bag. It's like...are you so far gone at this point that you're just aiming for your mouth hole like it's a game of golf? When I buy a bag of cheetos, 99% of the cheetos are going into my body. The rest end up on my fingers like every other human being. 

My friend was more than uncomfortable to say the least and so was I. He did offer us some beer...fucking Natty Lite. I almost just took a water instead but fuck it, beer is beer I guess. To be honest the dude could of offered me Everclear and it wouldn't of made it any less weird.        

So he sits on his bed and you can tell that this dude spends quite of time here. He's exhausted from that walk up the stairs. Poor guy. He has some game called runescape open on his laptop playing it while we're just sitting there. I mean c'mon is this dude serious? He's not even talking to us.

A few minutes go by of just dead silence while he's sitting there on his laptop. My friend and I are sitting there looking at each other not really knowing what to do. All of a sudden he slams that shit shut and goes ""OKAY LADIES"" 

God what the fuck was about to happen to us?  
  
Basically in a very loud obnoxious tone he said that he wanted us to eat cheetos off his body and he'd pay us $500 each. 

Uh..fuck yeah? I mean this dude is disgusting but that really didn't sound like a bad deal. We could brush our teeth, take a shower and go home and buy so much coke with that money...

My friend was not having it. So she walked out of the room and went into the living room to go hang out with his roommate. I didn't wanna do it if it was just me, as much as I wanted the money I just couldn't do it. 

I walk out to the living room as well and see that my friend is clearly into his roommate. I realized now where I recognized him from. It was HIS pictures that trump was using on tinder. I pulled out my phone and started dying laughing and I showed it to my friend. She was screaming. He was like what...what's so funny? We show him the phone and he's like ""wait...wait...what the fuck?? I don't have a tinder account!"" 

Trumps door slams close at this point and we're fucking crying of laughter. 

Anyways so we're watching TV just shooting the shit and it turns out this guy is pretty chill and likes to do coke as well. We're doing lines having a good time and he then in a really smooth way asks us to go back to his room. My friend definitely wanted too cause I could tell by the way she was looking at me. Honestly I hadn't planned on it but I was so impressed by the way he asked that I was like fuck it...let's go. 

Now here's where this part of the story gets a little weird. What we did with his roommate is written in trump's story...we did coke off his dick and everything. So does that mean that they talked about it after we left? Man I don't even wanna know. Maybe he had a camera installed to live vicariously through his roommate or something.

So yeah his roommate walked us out to our car and we never saw him again. 

Also we aren't fat we're thicc but in the cool 2018 way.  "
86mjbc,17,2018-03-23,Online English teachers: is it possible to teach full-time in the EST timezone with a somewhat normal schedule? Or recommendations on how to supplement part-time teaching?,adventuressofnterest,WorkOnline,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/86mjbc/online_english_teachers_is_it_possible_to_teach/,"I've been looking into teaching online for some time now, but haven't taken the dive as I'm having trouble finding a company that seems like a good fit. I'm looking for a company that allows me to work full-time (or close to it,) and still have a somewhat normal life schedule around that.

Most the companies I'm finding pay pretty well, but there are only a few (very early) hours available to teach on weekdays, and overnight shifts on weekends (EST.) I wouldn't mind working early or late, but to do one then the other 7 days/week doesn't sound like something I'd be able to maintain for long. I'd be willing to accept a lower pay rate if the number (and quality) of working hours made it worth it. I would love a company that I can dedicate myself to full-time and long-term, I'm just not finding something that allows me to do so.
 
Here's a few quick stats to show what places I'd be qualified to work:
* BA in English w/focus on TESOL
* TESOL certificate from the university I graduated from
* 1 year teaching experience at an English academy in Korea (preschool-6th grade)
* ""standard"" midwest US accent (native speaker)
* I don't have a whole lot of experience teaching adults, but I did work with high school and college aged ESL students during my internship, and a for a few other classes while getting my degree.

I'd also be open to teaching just during those early hours and supplementing it with something else during the weekday afternoons, if anyone has suggestions for good ways to do that. I've looked on Upwork some, but I got a little intimidated having to apply to job after job and figuring out what to set my pay at. If you know of any good resources for how to go about getting started with something like that, I'm all ears!

Thanks in advance for any advice, I cannot tell you how much it's appreciated!"

86nh2i,0,2018-03-23,m4f couples and more,MrCoffeeNJ,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/86nh2i/m4f_couples_and_more/,"Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous college student. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. NOTE: all characters are over 18, and actual incest doesn't necessarily come into play. This is more about a married couple spicing things up. 

COUPLES' CABIN This is a fairly straightforward setup. Two couples (or more, if you prefer) spend the weekend at a cabin in the woods where the fireplace is warm, hot-tub steamy, and walls are thin. Over the course of the weekend, they all start to loosen-up and let go. This might include some voyeurism (listening/spying on the other couple); exhibitionism (showing off for the others); bi-play (girls and/or guys get friendly with one another); swaps; or group sex. I'd be ok with some jealousy, reluctance, or other drama if you want to spice things up too. THE 

NEIGHBORS' DAUGHTER A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could college or post-college in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature. 


ABUSES OF POWER A single mom desperately wants to get her daughter into the best high school in the community, but her grades just aren't good enough. She meets with the school's principal to discuss her options; he suggests there may a way he'd agree, involving a late night visit to her house. I'd also be up for anything involving a married couple spicing things up."

First japril has always been special because they were friends first.  They started together as interns at mercy west then were the “invaders”.

For jaggie, it’s revealed their paths might have crossed at Boston and they are oh so amazed by this. 

Japri, their bathroom hookup in season 8 was made sexy in part by them describing what they did the night before but really what they were about to do to each other.

Jaggies first kiss Jackson describes the date he wants to take Maggie on.

Jackson emphatically tells Catherine in season ten about April, “I love her, she’s the one”.

Then he tells Catherine about Maggie “I really like her”.

These are the ones most prominent and they differ slightly but it still just reminds me thst japril did it first and japril did those moments better (IMO).

Do others notice this? Why on earth are Krista and co doing this?

ETA: japril were caught by webber in the supply closet...jaggie wee caught by webber coming out of the supply closet...that might be stretching but dammit! Lol"
86pd52,1,2018-03-23,Surface Book 2 for work?,alpha2beta,Surface,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/86pd52/surface_book_2_for_work/,"So I'm looking for a new laptop to be used for work. I'm in marketing, and I focus on multimedia (video, graphic design, social media, etc.). I have already expressed interests to my managers on the Surface Book 2, but I was curious to see if I'd be making the right decision in choosing the SB2 for a dedicated work machine to be used day-to-day.


My video editing would be relatively light--I have a dedicated tower to power through heavier video and processing/exporting. But in the case that I'd be traveling or working from home/offsite, I'd like to be able to do some basic video editing (trimming clips, adding audio, logos, basic title slides, etc.). Also, I'm the dedicated livestream guy, so would the SB2 be able to handle Wirecast? I like the idea of being able to some light livestreaming (streaming to one source e.g. YouTube while traveling) without having to carry my (HUGE) dedicated tower around, but I'm curious to see if the SB2 is capable in any way.


I'd also be doing light graphic design work/photo editing in Illustrator and Lightroom. Again, it'd be relatively basic work since I'm more on the strategy side, but I'd like to see if this machine is capable in case I'd need to take over from our design team.


My only other work is really Powerpoint, Excel, and Word, and being able to multitask with many tabs in Chrome while not having the machine bog down at the end of the day.


I love the all-around capabilities of the SB2, and if it's capable machine, I'd love to move forward and get it. No other laptop really appeals to me, and I'd say the only one that is comparable is the Dell XPS 15. I currently use a Lenovo Thinkpad T430 with 12 GB RAM, Intel Core i5 with 500 GB storage. My current laptop actually is quite efficient for my needs, but I'm really trying to upgrade from my heavy, ugly, slowing intern laptop into something worthy for the next couple years.


The model I'm looking at is the 13.5 inch Intel Core i7, 8GB RAM, 256 GB. I'm looking at something between $1,500 and $2,000.


As much research as I'm done, I'd like to be confident in my decision since this would be a work machine and I work in a variety of media-rich tasks. All your guys' help is much, much  appreciated!"
86pt4n,8,2018-03-23,"I [23/f] was fired today by my boss [28/f] after only a week and a half, and I'm so confused.",Moria_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/86pt4n/i_23f_was_fired_today_by_my_boss_28f_after_only_a/,"So I was fired today after getting my first real job after college and I'm really confused, and absolutely devastated. I'm really looking for some kind of insight, or for someone to tell me I'm not a complete fuck up... you know... something like that.

So I graduated with a degree in biology and mathematics in the top ten percent of my class with multiple internships, international accolades and tons of research opportunities that translated into publications. I had a blast. I graduated in December and started applying to jobs.

So I reached out to this one company who was hiring EHR support analysts, which, given my technical hobbies, I wanted to try. I was pretty desperate to find something to do and I really wanted to have a job come spring. So I connect with them through a mutual contact at the college I graduated from, and I got a phone call.

I was pretty excited. So I do the phone interview, then another interview, and then they ask me to come in.

So I go to this small company, (less than 50 people) and have three interviews and I nailed them. I was honest, I got to talk about my experiences in dealing with people and teaching and support and tutoring and it went really well. Well this has all happened over the span of like 2 months, and I get an email the next day from the COO of the company asking if I will come in to interview for a different position.

They said they had a better opportunity for me, something that would fit me better, working in operations and lean thinking and automation with a title of Client success analyst. I thought it sounded amazing. There were training opportunities, educational opportunities, and the capacity to help solve problems so I said sure. Well I go in and I really felt like I nailed this interview as well.

Time goes by and I get a job offer of 52k a year, which I thought was pretty good, and I took the job, but they wanted me to start in a month. I was itching to get going, but I wanted the job and said sure.

Well.... I started last Wednesday, and I was kind of surprised. I was working in a small cubicle in a gray room and after everything I was told in the interview I started learning that the actual position was a bit different. They didn't tell me exactly what I was doing. They wanted me to learn salesforce, I had all this assigned reading (which was cool, I even did it on the weekend on my own time to get better with it) and they wanted me to learn the ins and outs of one of these processes that is done completely by hand, so that when we brought in a dev team we could automate the process. Well I said okay, but things got a little strange.

So it's an office culture, gossip and everything but I wasn't really interested, I just wanted to learn and help solve problems. So when my boss would bring me to meetings I would take notes and try to come up with free solutions or I just stayed silent. I'm the new kid, I don't expect to go in and revolutionize the wheel overnight, but if I'm supposed to be helping I try to take my notes so if they ask me I can contribute.

This wednesday was the end of my first week and I had my performance review. I'll be honest and say I honestly didn't have enough work during the day to keep me busy, so when I was done with everything and had done 3 hours of extra salesforce training I would play a game of 2048 to occupy my hands while my mind was on something else. But here's the thing. When I went to this performance review my boss said I was supposed to be more focused on just learning the process. I said that's fine and ask her to just clarify what she'd like me to be doing in the job or how she saw it going in the future and she said something that was totally different than the job description. I was going to be taking over the sales portion of the job for the forseeable future once I got it down, and then the smaller pieces were automation and operations. I asked if I could be involved in other projects like the job originally said because I found them very interesting and she assured me that I could, so I said I was okay with that.


There was a problem though, learning the process could only be done when I could lock down time with the other person on my team, and there weren't many tasks that she did in a day, so it took very little time. But I thanked her, accepted the feedback and stopped all the auxillery stuff I was doing adn just buckled down.

Well, on Thursday morning I notice my calendar has been changed, and our meetings at the end of the day have all been erased, and now there's just one meeting on friday to meet with her 1:1, but I didn't think much of it. So I go about my day, until I'm in another meeting with my boss. Everyone else leaves and she asks me to close the door. I oblige and she explains to me that she had to ask her manager because she wasn't sure what she could tell me yesterday but the woman I'm learning from is being phased out after I can automate the process. I feel horrible, but nod and say I understand. She then explains I'll be taking over sales when that happens which was never explained to me in the job description but I let it go and say thank you and leave. During this time I've completed several small projects that the company hadn't done in years. There was no standard email signature, so I just made a code for about 10 different ones and got her permission to run a meeting on it. I did a pretty good job in addition to some other things, but I guess I wasn't good enough.

 So on Friday Im friendly and as helpful as I can be, and I head to my bosses office, and the Hr rep walks in behind me.


My boss turns to me and says 'we're terminating your position effective immediately,"" and then looks down.

I'm stunned.

I ask if it's because I was hesitant about the sales portion of the job and say that I'm actually really enjoying it and the hr rep said the decisions already been made and can't be changed and she escorts me to my desk. I still can't believe it. I thought I was doing everything right. I was kind anc helpful and I did all my work and I don't understand. She just kept saying I wasn't a good fit... I know I'll never have a full answer, but I really am so fucking crushed.

TLDR: I don't know what I could have done to get fired, I know I'm a bit awkward, but I did my best and they just kept saying I wasn't a good fit, but I didn't receive any direction outside of 'learn this process' and that takes time and I was trying.

86q1d2,143,2018-03-23,How to stay sane and do well on wards [clinical],Crunchygranolabro,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/86q1d2/how_to_stay_sane_and_do_well_on_wards_clinical/,"M3 sucks, and the playing the subjective grading game has a steep learning curve. Here’s an aggregate of advice my pals and I wish we’d had two years ago. My school is relatively non-malignant so take it with a grain of salt. 

1. Look out for your own wellness. You learn better when you don’t feel like shit. At one point you WILL meet criteria for depression. Sleep can be hard to find, but really try to carve out time for sleep, relationships and exercise. Having my core group of friends and girlfriend saved me. This is also the time that good nutrition habits matter. Meal prep and slow cookers FTW. 

2. Time management. You want time to sleep? Learn to maximize your time at work. Efficient prerounding, rounding and charting will let you go early and sleep in. Got downtime? Do practice Qs or read. Up to date works well enough. Concise notes are better, if the plan isn’t changed copy paste is your friend. 
GO HOME when they offer. Don’t be that guy who stays or offers to come back after mandatory lecture. GO HOME. 

3. Make it educational. Read about your patients, interesting patients. Ask to follow the active ones. If your residents are chilling ask for help on NBME Qs you got wrong. The more you learn/study at work the less you do at home. 

4. Make things easier. Know your patients well enough that you can anticipate problems. Call the lab for labs, call social work, if your note can be used make it good. If you’ve been on wards since May and know the EMR better than the intern help them. If the other medical student needs a hand help them. Don’t worry about recognition. Give info to residents/interns as soon as you have it, may be pertinent or even life saving. 
Be GOOD rather than just seem good. 

5. Brevity is the soul of wit. Fast concise presentations are good. Short to the point notes. They make rounds suck less. Know your patient enough to add things on the fly. One attending timed the entire team saying “you have 60s to convince me your plan is what we should do.” I recorded a few of my presentations to see where I was wasting time. Residents appreciate fast rounds, and you’ll have more time to study or go home. 

7. Don’t step on toes. You know how much of an imposter you feel? The intern and the resident feel it even more. If you read on patients you aren’t following, ask respectfully if you can examine the patient. If you think a course of action is warranted run it past who ever is covering that patient. If they say no, and you still think it’s a good call, phrase your plan as a question. “I was reading on x and it seems like y is less sensitive/effective than Z? Never outright tell someone that they’re wrong. 

8. Make mistakes, lots of them, but learn from them. Don’t make the same mistake repeatedly. Make new ones. 

9. Stand down, lay low, have fun. A good medical student is seen rather than heard (especially on surgery). You’ll have to learn to hold your tongue,You’re caring for patients, finally. Enjoy it. A hard worker who keeps their heads down will be remembered favorably. Don’t lie, to anyone but especially yourself.  Not about patients, about specialty interests, about how you’re doing mentally, physically emotionally. 

10. Only two things can define you as a person: you, and the heart that you put into what you do. Try hard and be authentic. Bad evaluations, jaded residents, mean attendings, jerk patients and rough tests will come. These things do not define you. 

Credentials: Honors on all rotations, shelfs were honors or near, and I only had depression symptoms on my surgical months. Also matched to a specialty of choice at a place I really liked.

86qf0g,10,2018-03-23,[S14E16 Spoilers] April and getting help...,silkscarves,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/86qf0g/s14e16_spoilers_april_and_getting_help/,"So, this last episode was really, really sad. There were some genuinely funny moments actually scattered throughout, but overall it’s getting really hard to watch April struggle like this. 

Thoughts on the episode: 

- April probably needs some time in psych, if only for 48 hours. Even just some deep, deep sleep and the allowance of off-time would probably do wonders for her. I think Harriet should stay with Jackson for the time being. April’s condition is rapidly deteriorating- the Trauma cert scene was hard to sit through (amazing acting by SD- very raw)- I think this is a mental health problem at this point and she needs therapy and possibly medication. She’s bringing up all these old stories from the past and I just KNOW Samuel is going to be brought up eventually. 

- So sad that she couldn’t even allow herself to talk about her issues with Jackson, her former best friend, when he gave her the opportunity. It sucked to see her get rejected like that, but I respected Jackson for immediately sensing that April was not in her right mind and not letting her proceed. I think it really hurt him to see her like that. This is the empathetic and sensitive Jackson I have missed dearly. I think he can and will be the one to get her to seek professional help. 

- How long are they going to let April spiral?! I can’t take much more of this, it feels like I’m watching a friend self-destruct and it’s painful for me. The trauma cert was waaayyyy out there. She’s losing her sanity. 

- I’m actually enjoying the scenes with Owen and Amelia. This gives their relationship closure, since they basically didn’t talk at all last season. I know Teddy is coming back later in the season, so it’s implied he’s going to see her, but just IMAGINE if he was catching a plane to Switzerland 😭😭😭

- I like the Arizona and Sofia scenes- Arizona is a really good Mom, and it makes me feel better about her departure- the writers BETTER NOT HARM ARIZONA OR SOFIA IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM. 

- Poor interns!!! Glasses had a mini breakdown, that scene with Owen feeling awkward when comforting them from the wrath of Dr. Party was funny (but ugh the context with April 😭😭😭)  "
86qh30,2,2018-03-23,Safe-driving is the best driving.,Existing_Thing,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/86qh30/safedriving_is_the_best_driving/,"I used to intern for a crash reconstructionist. Basically we were the guys who investigated car accidents for insurance companies.

A few things I tell people after that job/rant:

Don’t lean your seat back when you’re the passenger. I know it’s tempting on those long road trips. I saw more than one partially decapitated person with their seat leaned back. Seat belt will slice through your neck. Your spine will (probably) stop it.

Wear your seatbelt and wear it properly! I saw so many people thrown hundreds of feet from their vehicle because they didn’t have a seatbelt on. You ain’t gonna look pretty after breaking the windshield with your face. I saw a case where a seatbelted sibling was killed when their unseatbelted sibling flew into them during a collision. Seatbelts are designed to work when used exactly as intended. So none of that half wearing it bullshit. You’re more likely to break bones and rupture your organs when you wear it incorrectly.

Get into a collision around 40 mph without a seatbelt on? Expect some very sore knees and some dents in your dash where your knees slammed into it.

Besides seatbelts, use your blinkers people. Saw too many cases where people died because they didn’t use blinkers! And yes, we most definitely can tell if you were using it or not!

And slow the fuck down y’all! Not too slow. But goddamn you don’t need to be doing 95 without a death wish. Do you know what a human pancake looks like, because I do and it’s not cute! Your car is not invincible. I’ve seen bodies so burnt that a skeleton was left and we had to use dental records to ID the bodies. I’ve seen people cut in half, I’ve seen limbs in ditches, I’ve seen a decapitated head in the bed of a truck.

People forget how dangerous driving can be and get too comfortable."
86qjtq,86,2018-03-23,"The Saga of AnimeAssassin: Small ways in which he snuffed out the light in me, and why I call him AnimeAssassin",CastielGalafran,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/86qjtq/the_saga_of_animeassassin_small_ways_in_which_he/,"AnimeAssassin had two great passions in life.

Anime.

And being an ""assassin"".

He considered himself God's gift to electrical engineering, although he was barely passing his core classes and had a job as a glorified air conditioner salesman. But he was a genius, an irrefutable genius, and the rest of the world paled in the light of his intellectual capacity. When he wasn't gracing humanity with shows of how high his IQ was (this took the form of endless facebook arguments with old folks or him belligerently insisting he was correct in discussions with people who knew more than him on a certain subject), he was absorbed in any and all anime involving assassins. 

He loved big titty anime girls, of course, and was always pressuring me to dress a bit more like them. But his true passion was in studying the way that Japanese cartoon characters would wield their completely unrealistic katanas. He insisted that he had studied enough anime that he could easily become an assassin if he wanted to. He liked to demonstrate his deadly talents by slowly twirling kitchen knives until he fumbled and dropped them, then blaming the knife for being poorly constructed. He often bragged about his own strength and agility, yet, as a tiny woman with a body weakened by an eating disorder, I had the ability to lift him off the floor and carry him around the house with ease. He did not work out, hadn't been engaged in any sort of physical activity since running cross country as a 13 year old, and couldn't run a mile. But, ever the endless source of self confidence, he talked about how he could beat anyone in a fight and, if a certain candidate he hated got elected president, he could easily get past the secret service and assassinate said person.

That's right.

AnimeAssassin would actively voice desires to assassinate major political figures and the president. 

So, my friends, that is why I've given him the name AnimeAssassin. But onto the real point of this post. This man was utterly convinced that he was a straight 10 in every single aspect. He viewed his interpersonal skills, athletic ability, intelligence, wisdom, and appearance as just about as perfect as they come. He'd use this to justify acting cruelly to other people, both to their face and behind their backs.  Yes, he did have talents, but he was nowhere near as gifted as he believed. His academic, social, and work performance at the time were below average at best and remain so to this day. And, the man had, to put it kindly, not won the genetic lottery. I'm not one to shame another person for their appearance, but AnimeAssassin was objectively unattractive. He looked exactly like his parents and every biological sibling of his, and his family's genetics, although strong, were not good. 

As I've mentioned in my other posts, when I met him I was a competitive ballroom dancer, my modeling career was going strong, I was the golden child of the physics department, and I was getting noticed by some important people in my field for my potential. I had helped invent a new cancer imaging device, the Department of Energy had published an interview of me, I helped discover a new type of astrophysical gamma ray source in our galaxy, my professor and I had just created the world's first working triplet polarimeter. I had successfully helped take the physics mentorship program I'd created national, having been given a $300,000 grant to start the program up at university's across the country. In short, for a Junior at a state university who had barely gotten good enough grades to graduate high school, I was doing pretty fucking well for myself. I don't consider myself highly intelligent. I'm just very creative, have very good people skills, and am determined. Those three traits were paying off big time. 

I didn't realize until recently how much AnimeAssassin hated me for my success. Little by little, bit by bit, he tore me down and snuffed out the light inside of me until by the end of our relationship my modeling career was over, I no longer did any research in physics, my GPA had dropped from near perfect to average (nothing wrong with an average GPA, but it was a significant drop for me which leaves me salty to this day), I had almost no friends, I wasn't doing any physical activity, I'd given up on writing, no longer read, and hadn't danced in a year. Rather than writing out the long version, I want to put in a list of things he did to tear me down. Maybe someone going through this will see their SO's actions in AnimeAssassin's and realize that this shit is not OK.

-He pushed and pushed for me to become just like the big titty anime girls he loved. I was struggling with anorexia to the point that my stomach would no longer properly digest food, my hair was falling out, and I couldn't stay awake for normal periods of time. Yet he'd constantly be measuring my boob size. He knew my boobs are one of my biggest insecurities. They're small. I'm super flat chested. That kind of happens when you're an anorexic girl who has played sports all her life. But he had this image of me with massive DDD tits and the constant measuring just tore down my self esteem even more. 

-Another way in which he pushed me to become like the anime girls was with my hair, which also happened to be another one of my biggest insecurities. I had only just come to love my hair when I met him. Growing up, kids would tease me ruthlessly for my hair. I'd come home crying almost every day, sobbing because I just wanted thin, pin straight hair like all the other girls. Due to my mixed race ancestry, my hair is incredibly thick, curly, coarse, and has been long for most of my life. It's also dark brown. At the time I'd been wanting to dye it blonde. He was supportive of that. I went in for my first appointment, and, of course, I left with yellowish-orange hair. That's what happens when you try to bleach dark brown, waist long, thick hair. You're not going to get it platinum blonde in one go. But the moment I stepped into the car after my first appointment, AnimeAssassin teased me for my hair the entire ride home until I was in tears. Then when we got to his place, he got his roommates to join in. He spent the next week telling me I needed to go back to get it dyed again asap, and convinced me to book another appointment a week after my first one. I didn't know any better and just wanted the teasing to end, so I let the stylist cover my already freshly bleached hair in more bleach. My hair burned off my head. It came out in chunks. I got on the plane the next day for a summer internship, and my hair was falling out for the entire 6 hour plane ride. I was heartbroken and my confidence was completely shattered.

-He nitpicked my dancing and would storm off if I made one mistake too many. He was my competition partner and constantly told me that we'd be winning gold if it weren't for how slow of a learner I am. He was always telling me that I was a slow learner. Always telling me that I just wasn't gifted physically. Always telling me how much better he'd place if he got a different partner and that maybe I just wasn't cut out for competition. I internalized this message and truly believed him, especially since I grew up being told I was stupid by teachers, peers, and even my parents. Even after we broke up I still believed I was just a horribly slow learner. It wasn't until a couple months ago I was practicing Muay Thai with my trainer. We were doing a move he'd recently shown me that's a challenging one to get right. At some point during that session he told me, ""You pick things up incredibly fast. Like, I just need to show you something once and you have it down. How do you do that?"". After practice, I got home and literally cried because I'd been so convinced I was utterly stupid and hopeless, but a gifted fighter was telling me I picked moves up quickly when I had literally no fighting experience previously. That remains one of the most meaningful things anyone's said to me.

-When we went social dancing, he'd storm out if I danced a little too close to other men. Eventually, he started glaring at any man who approached us to ask me to dance. Then he started telling me that no one would dance with me because I was frustrating to dance with due to my lack of coordination, timing, and talent. Eventually, we stopped going dancing. 

-I have acne prone skin. My senior year of high school, I got an acne infection so bad it hurt to move my mouth. I had deep, cystic acne covering near every inch of skin on my face. The infection flared up again at the beginning of my sophomore year of college, and after that I discovered that Proactive was the only thing that worked to keep my acne at bay. When I'm using the right regimen of Proactive, my skin is perfect aside from the scarring the infections left behind. AnimeAssassin, when we moved in together, forbade me from using Proactive. He said it was a waste of money and I was too vain. Almost immediately, my cheeks became covered in painful cystic acne. The infection lasted from April 2016 to October 2017. My scars are still fading. 

-I have always loved poetry and fiction with a passion. Whether it's writing or reading it, I eat that shit up. AnimeAssassin made fun of every book and poem I ever told him I liked. He told me I had poor taste and that the things I liked weren't ""smart"" enough for him. 

-When we were around other people in STEM, whether they were students, professors, or coworkers, I was pushed to the side and not allowed to speak a word. I didn't really realize until tonight (that realization is what prompted this post) that during every conversation with anyone in STEM, I would be standing a bit behind and to the side of AnimeAssassin, smiling timidly, and zoned out. I'd given up trying to talk about my own career because every time I did he'd jump on something I said, correct me, and make a joke of it. There was this one incident in the grocery store which still makes me angry. We were in the spice aisle and somehow struck up a conversation with this guy who was also an engineering student. The guy had originally spoken to me. I told him I was studying physics, he said that he was an engineering student working on a project involving a micro processing board, and that's as far as I got before AnimeAssassin decided to use this as a bragging opportunity. He spoke for twenty minutes about how good he was at programming micro processing boards. He and the guy carried on this great conversation while I was regulated to the sidelines. The thing is, every research project of mine has involved micro processing boards. Programming them is one of my greatest talents. Fuck, I programmed an FPGA module to act as a data processing system for the world's first wireless and handheld gamma camera, and I did that shit with *no help* from the real engineers/physicists on the project because they didn't know how to do that shit. Yet AnimeAssassin, who had only taken one class in programming micro processing boards and had literally never worked with them outside of the class, got to silence me and brag to a stranger about how amazing he was. The most impressive things he told the guy *was shit I taught him that he claimed he learned on his own*.

I know this post was long and didn't have all that much of a story to it. I just wanted to vent. But I also want to remind myself of how far I've come since then. I've taken up writing fiction again. I'm laying out plans for a new science fiction novel I've been wanting to work on. I read two books of poetry this week. My hair is growing healthier than it was before the bleach incident. My body is getting stronger than it ever was, and my Muay Thai trainer is seriously impressed with how far I've advanced. Even though AnimeAssassin might be a good enough assassin to beat secret service agents, I am confident I could easily kick his ass a few times over with minimal effort. Grad school is just a few months away. 

My anxiety has been really bad these past 24 hours and trauma thoughts keep popping up. So writing this out is a good reminder that shit's a lot different than it was a year ago and I don't need to be so afraid."
86qlfd,5,2018-03-23,Advice on career aspects.,Camestes,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/86qlfd/advice_on_career_aspects/,"Hey everyone,

I know this question isn't exactly mgtow related, but seeing as we are all in this boat called life together I figure why not ask. This may be kinda long but ill try to make a long story short.

 After highschool I was initially going to join the military so I had no plans to attend college. The military plan fell through so I attended college and got 2 associates in electronic and industrial engineering technology. During this time I was working part time in a warehouse then found an internship with the state working with radios and communications. 

After my two associates I made a snap decision to get my bachelors in engineering. I had not really researched as to what engineering I was attempting but figured I would just get the core stuff out of the way, this however led to uncertainty. I again interned with the state, only this time at the end of my internship I was told a position would be open very soon and basically was told that I would get the position. Wanting to get some really great experience and take a break from 4 straight years of school I decided not to re enroll and try to obtain this job. 

It has now been 4 months since the end of my internship and the job was just posted, I of course applied, however I am loosing patience and am wondering if this is even the right move for me. The job pays well and is very fun woth great experience but during this down time I have become very anxious and depressed due to lack of any progress.

 I am worrying constantly and all I want to do is move away and start over. I also worry that I am becoming to old to start anything even though I am barely 23! (In 3 days). The thing is I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I am an extremely driven and active individual with many hobbies but I get the feeling I will be settling for less with this job. I have so many options but feel stuck.

Anyways, would you think I would be settling for less if I took this job? Or should I try something new, whether its completing my degree or a change of scenery. Would this be wise?

Tl;Dr I am stuck in a rut. I feel as if I am missing out on life and I want to experience awesome times. But currently I just dont know where to turn as far as a career. 

Thanks for listening to me bitch guys. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

We always looked like a perfect family.

My husband is old money--we're practically the Kennedys of this town, and everyone knows it. We're always perfectly put together, right down to the last hair. My husband, Anthony, is the named partner at his law firm that was founded by his grandfather, and he's running for a senate seat this fall. I know he has affairs, it hurts me, but he always have, and I've learned to accept it. Our daughter, Allison, is fifteen years old and the perfect blonde beauty queen that I always hoped she would be. She's on the cheerleading team, she takes ballet, and she's an excellent student. I'm the perfect wife--I never have a hair out of place, I'm always running charities, hosting galas, attending fundraising events on my husband's arm. I'm the woman everyone looks to and wonders how I do it.

But I'm more proud of you than I am of anything else. You've always been my perfect, sweet boy. You're seventeen years old, the top of your class, and student body president. You're already so tall, I can't believe it! All of the girls adore you, all of the boys want to be you. You're the captain of your football team, you're dating the cheerleading squad captain, and you've been applying to ivy league colleges for next year. You have my dark hair and your father's blue eyes--and you look so much like him when he was your age. I couldn't adore you more!

Which is why all of this came as such a shock for me.

You had been moody lately, I knew that--your father was having another affair, but this time with an intern from his campaign, one only a year older than you were. I was so apologetic when you found out, but you were so angry, I thought it was best to let you work it out on your own.

Now I realize that was a mistake. A few weeks later, when my husband was out of town for a fundraising event, I woke up to the strangest feeling of someone pulling my panties down. Anthony must have been home early! I was so relieved that he had come home to me instead of his mistress that I didn't even complain as he pulled me up by the waist. I thought it was weird when he started licking my pussy, since he'd never liked going down on me before, but I was too busy groaning and squirming with pleasure to care.

And when he started fucking me, oh my god, it was so amazing! For some reason his cock felt so much BIGGER than usual, and--well, my husband had never been very good in bed before, but now I was whimpering and moaning with pleasure as he pounded my pussy into the mattress.

It wasn't until I came around your cock screaming for more that I realized that it was you, my son, how had just spurted his load into my pussy. I was humiliated and horrified--I couldn't understand why you would want to do this to our family, what what happen if anyone ever found out?

But now you won't stop. You think I deserve better than your father--you think I deserve you.

___


SO I want someone to play my son who starts an affair with me! The fun part is that we're so big in the community, and everyone looks up to us, they have no idea how corrupt we are on the inside.

I want you to be in love with me, but I also want you to be a rough dom. I love the idea of you eventually getting me pregnant, too!"
86r9qs,1,2018-03-24,"Boyfriend Has Doubts, and So Do I",throwaway20171114Wed,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/86r9qs/boyfriend_has_doubts_and_so_do_i/,"So I (F21) have been dating my boyfriend (M22) for 2 years now. Last semester, we moved in together and he was going to find a job here until I graduated. However, recently he decided to take an internship in another town, and he moved out. 

Lately he has been expressing doubts about my commitment to the relationship. He thinks that I am more motivated than him and will end up leaving him for someone better. I reassured him that I wouldn’t, but I’m starting to doubt our relationship as well. He doesn’t know what he wants to do in the future, but I have always known my goals and next steps. I love working, but he just wants to do the minimum to get by in life. An example of this is that he didn’t really devote much time to studying until I encouraged him to join me at the library every morning. In addition, now that he’s gone, I feel like I have a lot more interaction with friends and am getting more done school and work-wise. When he was here, I felt obligated to spend my time with him and isolated myself quite a bit. 

However, he also has his plus sides. He is a very kind person, and has been supportive of my dreams and forgiving of my faults since day one. My family loves him (although they question our compatibility as well), and he has put a lot of effort into our relationship (tries to keep my happy).

So my question is, should I take these doubts and my recent improvement in life as a sign that we should go our separate ways?  Or is it worth it to make some sacrifices to find someone who will treat you well?

TL;DR my boyfriend has doubts about our relationship, and now so do I. We have our differences, and I want to know if those are enough reason to consider breaking it off

Note: I do realize that the isolation is something I did to myself, but he doesn’t really mesh well with my friends, and his friends aren’t really the type of people I hang out with either. "
86rz8b,0,2018-03-24,Spoilers: the final act feels rushed and basically ruined the game for my friend and I.,TheRealWillFM,AWayOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/AWayOut/comments/86rz8b/spoilers_the_final_act_feels_rushed_and_basically/,"If you think in going to say not to buy it you're incorrect. The game is totally worth the price tag. It is fun. But hear me out.

I think the final act in Mexico was tagged on at the end and terribly rushed, and in pretty sure at some point ask intern ran in and said ""LETS MAKE VINCE A COP"" which they just went with. 

When you get to Mexico, they just start gunning down the ""cartel"" members without knowing anything about them. The game turns from epic story to piss poor 3rd person shooter. Put the entire Mexico chapter against anything else in the game and it just feels tacked on. Like an after thought. For example, the amazing hospital chase. It was so well plamned and executed. But this whole ending felt rushed. 

Then when you get back home, they try and throw you a curve ball with the Fed thing. Which feels forced. The whole game is so coop and you begin to like both characters so much, that I feel like they added the duel just to make people talk online. 

I was playing Vincent and as soon as he pulled the gun,  I lost interest. I basically stopped playing and did everything I could to let Leo go. Including letting him win the duel with 0 effort. I felt like I had no reason to fight. I lost all connection to the character. Hell, I even have a son that just turned 1 earlier this month, so I really connected on the baby ordeal. But I didn't care. I was upset that his daughter would grow up without a father but out wasn't even slightly enough to fight for him. I felt less surprised and more betrayed. 

Overall, game was amazing and worth the money but I'm willing to bet they wanted it to be about escaping prison and someone in EA said no and put their hand in the cookie jar, fucking up the whole batch. 

(I'm so disgruntled, it's 3am, my wife woke up from tending to our son and I got up just to tell her about the game and write this post. I feel dumb, but I really REALLY enjoyed there game up until the Mexico parts and beyond. I didn't even bitch about killing ray, such offers ZERO closure for either party.)

Edit: also, if anyone has any recommendations for story heavy coop games like this, I'd love to hear them. "

I obtained about 5,000 in need based grants, but this means I will have to take about 14,000 in some private/co-sign loan.


I've already talked to my parents about this and they want to put me college no matter what, it's an instate public college with a top engineering program in the united states, I would be attending for Computer Engineering/Software Engineering. So the return from those jobs could easily pay the 56,000 in loans over some time.


My family is consists of a single income parent of around 70-80,000 and I have two siblings who will need to be put through college in about two years as well.


I suppose my question is, what is the best way to go about these loans? I understand that I can go to community college and transfer but the transfer rate from the one community college available is abysmally low, and the program is hard enough to get into regularly. I am also aware of SMART and am considering it an option when I'm actually in college (as you can only apply when you're enrolled) but I also wanted to co-op and do internships to build a resume but this would prevent me from doing so as you have to be enrolled, then work for the government. Any and all scholarships are welcomed, I applied for at least 50-60 yet have gotten no returns/offers, I've maintained A Honor roll since sophmore year (lets not talk about freshman) so I think its more of a family income thing rather than qualifications.


I'll be checking throughout the day, as I have my car in the shop, and responding to anymore questions. Both me and my parents could really use the help!


**Edit:** I've had people ask me to post the college to determine whether or not it really is worth it. [Here](https://www.ncsu.edu/about/rankings/) is a link to their website with recorded rankings among U.S. colleges. **Note** they are ranked 24th overall for engineering, but I rank them a little higher due to their massive career fair and job retention."

This fall, I didn't apply to many schools, assuming that I'd easily get in to these ""middle tier"" UCs. I was wrong in the sense that it's incredibly hard to get into the CS major in general, and now I'm stuck between these options.

While most people I've read online say to pick the college guaranteed for CS, I find myself hesitant to pick UC Davis. I heard the school is great for veterinary and agricultural studies, yet mediocre in CS. I heard UCI and UCSB are much better for CS, but not guaranteed to get into for the major as someone undeclared. UCSB is my dream school and UCI is close to home so I can save money. Here are my main questions: Is it nearly impossible to switch to CS for UCI and UCSB and or should I just not bother? If so, does UC Davis offer a quality program for CS and will I  be able to land internships as a UC Davis CS student?

I'm aesexual. I'm comfortable with that part of myself. There's no trauma or reason that I am this way (except maybe hormones) but it doesn't trouble me most of the time. However I'm also, in generally, very unwilling to be vulnerable to people (or every myself 90% of the time)- I may talk to someone every day but without ever becoming their friend because I never open myself up to them to be rejected, be that emotionally or by asking them to hang out. To sum up how that's been- I made it through college without making a single friend, without having a single professor who I felt like I could ask to be a reference. And that's my own fault but I don't know how to change that about myself right now.

I'm also, I think, aromantic, and this is a part of myself that I'm just coming to terms with and that I really, really don't like. I thought for a long time that well, I can't connect with anyone physically but at least one day I might find someone to be with who can accept that and we'll still love each other. And I had that chance, I found a girl who was also ace and who liked me and we tried it and I never felt romantic towards her and we decided it was fair to end it, and decided to remain friends. And it's upsetting, but fair and its not what i'm upset about. She got a girlfriend right after and tried to hide it. The relationship is fine, its fair for her to pursue someone who can reciprocate, but it feels like my whole life has been filled with people who try and hide things from me. Even small shit like not getting told that someone had set up a doctors appointment for me until its about to happen. I don't feel in control if i dont have all the information.
And, you know, I have trouble making friends, made friends with someone who then sort of betrayed me in the way that she KNOWS hurts me worst by hiding something. I dont really have a support group to vent to because of my aforementioned issues making connections. I don't think I have an empathy problem, but there's some emotions that I guess other people have that I wont. I dont think I have the emotional vocabulary to understand what it means to love someone (not just romantically, it's not something I feel comfortable saying to my parents or siblings either).

On top of that... I graduated college last year. I got an internship at a zoo, which I thought is what I wanted to do with my life and it's really not. I'd like to do something creative, to make art, and I do in my spare time, but thanks to my degree I'm kind of left searching exclusively for jobs that disinterest me because I wasn't able to figure out what I wanted before I graduated. I don't know where my life is going, or what I'm going to do with it or what I even WANT to do with it anymore, because my ideal of being able to make stories and work for myself isn't something I can just jump into doing and survive off of, and in the meantime... my degree feels really useless because nothing it can get me sounds like something I care about. I'm moving back in with my parents next month and I feel less in control about my life and my own feelings than ever, and I know no one can solve that but me but I dont even really know where to begin with it."

We're very close, and even though I'm more extroverted, we spend plenty of time communicating with each other and talking to each other about everything, including disagreements. I just don't get along very well with her mother. I understand that is pretty normal, but I'm afraid we'll never have a great relationship until her mother trusts me.

My wife and I met in university in the U.S. and she was born in Columbia where she was also raised. When they were still married, I took an internship a state away, and her mother came to visit her during the summer in the meantime. I couldn't take days off, and because of that, I had to come visit her on the weekend after for my wife's birthday. Her mother told my wife that I obviously don't respect her since I didn't send flowers and a card before my visit. Meanwhile, it was just because I was poor and already had our whole weekend planned out. I tried to explain myself to her, but her English wasn't very good at the time and my wife (gf at the time) didn't want to translate an argument. It was a very small thing I understand now, but this set the tone for my relationship with my M-iL going forward.

Fast-forward a couple of years, and now my wife and I are considering marriage. Unfortunately, her parents divorced around the same time. Her mother then (like, a month later) comes to the U.S. with the sole purpose of finding a husband. I know this because my wife (still gf at the time) and I had to sit and eat lunch with one of the randos she met online. Apparently, her mom cut things off with him and was getting married to someone else in a couple of months, so in hindsight, that was a dangerous situation she put us in, and we weren't even married yet. What did both of the men have in common you ask? They were both within 50 miles of where we went to university. Just odd in my opinion, but I digress.

Now my wife and I are married, and things aren't any better between my M-iL and I. She's confronted me in tears multiple times asking me not to judge her for being who she is (I haven't to her directly, though I do talk to my wife about her). I see how she uses my wife when she needs money or anything else, and to make matters worse, she had a falling out with her own mother and they don't speak anymore. So my wife has to be the communicator between the two because ironically, my M-iL repeatedly asks my G-iL for money and help. Also ironically, her relationship with my S-iL's boyfriend is perfectly fine even though he cheated on her multiple times and is a semi-pathological liar. Maybe it's because he's about to inherit his stepfather's oil company in South America, but once again, I digress.

The sum of these things are putting a strain on my marriage because we are constantly being asked to selflessly help her mom with things when she would never reciprocate. My wife despises when I try to get involved too, so I felt stuck as long as we were close to her. Those arguments cause resentment from each other in other areas too. My wife talks about my parents as if they damaged me. Meanwhile, my parents have a very happy marriage, and all 5 of my siblings have college degrees, steady jobs and are married. There is really no comparison. We recently moved to the East Coast to take new jobs and get away from the situation, but I'm starting to question whether or not it was the right thing to do because it seems (at least in short term) that all this did was make her more needy of my wife. And once we start to have kids, I suspect it will only get worse.

What can I do to help my wife through this? Where is my place in their relationship? What can I do to strengthen the relationship between my M-iL and I? Where should I start? Anyone with troubled in-law experiences, but still a strong relationship with their spouse?

86uwoz,2,2018-03-24,Undiagnosed and going in for an assessment,marshforpres,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/86uwoz/undiagnosed_and_going_in_for_an_assessment/,"I finally called my primary doctor for an assessment. She's going to tell me what she suspects I may have a refer me to someone to do a specific evaluation. I have a few ideas of what I may have, which includes ADHD (my sibling has this), OCD (my other sibling has this), and potentially autism, or anything related (for a lack of a better word). 

I do have depression and I do have anxiety. I've also been through trauma, and currently live with a parent that I don't really get along with, so there are a lot of external influences on me that I feel like I can be mistaking for potentially having autism, OCD, ADHD, etc. However, I don't want to cross them out, and especially I don't want to eliminate the possibility that they could be induced or heighten by my environment and past.

Just recently this has begun to really bother me - I know there is a difference between my peers and I, and I can't tell if it's because I've had a ""late start"" to the world (as I was living in an abusive environment) and just simply am still learning how to be ""normal,"" or if it's because there is literally something within me that is different from others.

I recognize the abuse was wrong, and I try to be as empathetic as possible to people, so I don't think I am recovering from what I thought was ""normal,"" because I never, as a child, thought that the abuse was okay. 

So I started doing some research, and learned a lot about OCD, and I learned a lot about ADHD. This explains a lot of my private habits, but socially, the ADHD touches on it, but it doesn't explain a lot. Then I considered the possibility of having ASD, because I knew autism was a spectrum disorder and presented itself in many ways. I found that some people with autism have OCD, depression, and anxiety, and have attention problems, even if they don't have ADHD.

So, now that you know why I've kind of gotten to this hypothesis, these are some of the ""symptoms"" I experience, relating to autism and the other disabilities I've mentioned (I'll add examples too);

It's extremely hard for me to focus. However, when I find something I like, I do hyper focus. Often times though, I'll switch interests, but while I am interested in that particular thing, I'll learn everything about it, prioritize it, but even then, overtime, I'll still lose interest. High school; I was interested in my club, so I prioritized it over everything, over school, over my art, all I cared about was my club. Then, college, I was terrible and couldn't care less for government and then suddenly; was excelling in political science, and now comes my second semester, and, I feel like I don't care as much, and am interested in guitar.

Also, I'll bring these things up a lot in conversation, really going in depth. I have to remind myself to ask about how others are doing, their opinions, and to be tuned in when they are talking about their interests. I'm really empathetic, and I don't want to be inconsiderate of others, I just have to remind myself to just initiate that kind of engagement with others, and to not talk so much about myself, perhaps.

On the topic of focusing, but on a more physical scale; it takes the perfect environment for me to be focused. I get easily distracted; if I'm a bit hungry, if my clothes feel too tight, or if there is TV or someone talking, I just cant. I have trouble sitting still when I'm doing something that I don't care too much about, even if I know it's important. I have to get up, and sometimes I'll become so overwhelmed, I need to go somewhere private so I can just breathe and cry. On the note of clothes, as a kid, I never really wore clothes unless I went out. Even today, if there is a large bump where the seams meet under my armpits, I have to resist the urge to not stretch the sleeve, and I mean, I'll _really_ stretch it. 

I also have this internship, and I care a lot about it. I've always thought of myself as a ""visual learner,"" and at my internship, I make visuals. Sometime, though, I'll get stuck, just as something doesn't appear to be ""fitting,"" and I'll ask my boss. He'll explain it to me, and then I'll be completely surprised, realizing how simple it was, or how I could've solved it by comparing it to the other slides and whatnot. Additionally, if he is explaining to me something that is visual (although this happens with non-visual topics), I literally won't be able to keep up and I end up looking for keywords or key phrases - because of this I'll write everything he says down, look at it when I'm alone and then while I'm actually working through it I have that epiphany and suddenly everything he says makes perfect sense. He'll ask me if I understand because I don't say anything, and I just say ""I'm just digesting it, I'll understand it better when I get a chance to play around with it,"" and I starting to realize it's not just that I'm a visual learner, but maybe, it's that I learn differently altogether.

Just a few more brief examples;

Jokes often do go over my head. I am a rather literal person but I'm not completely oblivious to jokes and sarcasm. 

I do avoid social situations and get anxiety from doing things I typically do a lot, just because it involves social interaction. However, when the time comes I can cope pretty well, and sometimes the anxiety goes away completely. But I will ask others (not so much anymore) to do something for me (someone used ordering pizza as an example, which is accurate) and I do ""act"" a lot/observe how others react and apply that to whatever I'm in. Sometimes I still say and do the wrong things, though, and I won't realize it till it's already done.

These are just a few examples. I honestly would be writing an essay if I were to list them all. I would like to hear about your experiences - have you been diagnosed for something before autism or Aspergers? Also, what is your take on my experiences? I apologize if the above seems a bit like a ""rant,"" I'm just so tired of thinking about this all the time that I kind of just threw up my thoughts. Thanks for reading."
86v3u5,0,2018-03-24,I'm annoyed by older directors patronizing streaming and digital platforming.,IfYouHaveGhosts824,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/86v3u5/im_annoyed_by_older_directors_patronizing/,"Anonymous writer/director here. 

I completely respect how other directors do things, regardless of what kind of movies they make, whether they shoot on film or digital, how they distribute their movies, etc. 

Not to name names (*coughcoughSPIELBERGcoughcoughTARANTINOcoughcough*), but I’m honestly getting tired of the attitude among older directors that streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. have no credibility. There’s an unspoken mentality that the movies on them are somehow less superior than movies shown theatrically. (I know people are going to argue that a lot of bad movies get dumped on Netflix, which is true. But even worse movies get dumped in theaters.)

Movie theaters are changing. Gone are the days of seeing new and interesting movies from up-and-coming directors at your local movie theater. Soon, major studios will only use theaters to show big-budget blockbuster movies. It’s going to be more like a ride at Disneyland than an experience for discovering high-quality films. This is obvious. /r/movies has been talking about this for years. 

Nowadays, if you’re an indie director and you expect your movie to play in theaters and turn a profit – not only is that HIGHLY unlikely, but it’s just plain naïve. 

Meanwhile, the digital landscape has opened doors for creators that never would’ve been opened otherwise. This goes not just for Netflix and Amazon, but the whole internet landscape in general, including things like YouTube. 

Nowadays, anyone anywhere in the world can have their movie seen at the click of a mouse. You don’t have to sit around and hope and pray somebody’s cousin who’s an intern at Warner Brothers will read your script anymore. Smaller independent companies are now the majority, and will distribute new and interesting movies to anyone, anywhere in the world, so they can turn a profit. 

This is not something be looked down upon, but revered. This is not something to be shunned, but encouraged. 

Sure, there’s going to be a lot more competition on the internet – but that means only the strongest will survive. If this scares directors, that’s because it should. You can’t half-ass your movie or rely on Hollywood nepotism or partisanship to get you your next big movie deal anymore. Kids who pick up iPhones and DSLRs are going the be the next big award winners. And I think that’s beautiful. 

Like it or not, those who don’t adapt to digital distribution and platforming, at least to some degree, are going to be left in the dust. Just like musical artists who won’t use social media, MP3s, or music streaming to promote their music. 

Feel free to downvote me, argue with me, and disagree with me. I’m curious to hear other people’s opinions on this. "

Due to the institutional nature of our clientele and the fact that our business is new - building trust is going to be difficult and important. 

As I know we have a great product and team, I thought it would be really rewarding (both for the business, and our team) to document the story of our arrival in Austin, getting established in the community, dealing with our investors, going through the hiring process, etc. 

Ideally, it would be great to have someone with some video experience, but all of our founding team has video production experience, so its not a must. Commitment to the mission, resourcefulness, and aptitude are much more important than experience. 

This will be part-time, paid work (We can call it an internship if it is helpful). Starting date is May 1. Compensation will be negotiated based on the candidate. 

To apply or discuss, contact me via Reddit DM, or via my instagram (I shouldn't be hard to find) so I can see some of your content!

86von4,7,2018-03-24,I feel like I’m backing into a corner with no way out,RogerKappa,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/86von4/i_feel_like_im_backing_into_a_corner_with_no_way/,"So my life has been quite the rollercoaster over the past couple years and it seems like I have to keep living to high expectations that everyone saw in me before but I feel like I just don’t have it in me anymore. Even committing to my own goals seems to be a challenge and all I end up doing is feeling sorry for myself while I think of how in the past my life and mind was so calm and free and seeing how others are continuing to love their lives with most thing under control. It’s just feel like the act of staying afloat for me is a struggle while others are living life the way they see fit.

I had gotten into a really good university at 18, but everything about me seemed to have changed since then. Just before getting accepted my dad had passed away from Parkinson’s disease and that had left my family financially and emotionally vulnerable. I always saw myself as a strong person and went off to college across the nation knowing that if I were go to graduate and work hard I could live the life I wanted to and help out my family. 

The exact opposite happened. I struggled through the rigors of college and struggled making friends. I was usually a really outgoing person but anxiety and depression slowly sunk in as I witness my family struggle financially back home and I was helping in no way struggling with my academics.

Eventually after my third year I was dismissed from school and told to take a year off before I could reapply. This was a major blow to my family and me because my mom, who was just settling in to her new job and the professional landscape, was diagnosed with cancer and lost her job. This rocked me to my core and I couldn’t concentrate on anything my last semester of my third year and ended up failing all my classes. This wasn’t the only cause however, I was already suffering from depression at school through the reasons listed above and never had to guts to tell me mom over the phone whenever we talked. 

So now we are at the present where I ended  up getting a 4.0 at the school I transferred to next to my house and about to reapply to get back into my original university. I went to therapy as well which, I’m a sense, helped me get rid some anxiety I had but honestly was more of a place where I just ranted about how unfair my life was which didn’t really help with much of the depression, anxiety, and now laziness that has taken over me. I constantly just feel sorry for me and my family and don’t really know why I can do to change my mindset to just “get off my ass and succeed” since it’s not been deeply engrained in my system for a couple years now. 

It just seems like every hurdle I barely get over, a few taller ones just develop in front of me. I know people say there’s a light at the end of this dark tunnel and I’ll eventually get out of it but day by day I feel like I’m losing hope in that possibility and my mind is starting to accept the fact that I’m just a loser with honestly no way out. 

There are other obstacles like getting a internship or a full time job after graduation that I still worry about everyday but seem to worry about them and do nothing to help my case for some reason. I just get into this loop of feeling sorry for myself, telling myself that I need to snap out of it and work hard, end up doing nothing and then it loops again. 

The worst part is I feel like I get no help from my  family as they either think my bad habits are just self inflicted and constantly berate me with insults about how I’ve changed from a great motivated person to a lazy irresponsible slob. Now before anyone’s thinks that it’s my family’s fault I have to say they have been through a lot too and are pretty conservative in the fact that they don’t understand psychological trauma or pain and it’s seen as taboo to them. They also are really trapped by this idea that you have to hide these things and always show yourself in public as having your shit together so the community doesn’t judge us. I have been riddled with bad habits like sleeping in until noon and procrastinating on everything but instead of realizing I’ve still been going through depression   they just want to believe that I’m that lazy slob who needs to get his shit together eventually. 

Too long have I been caring for myself and my families problems so now that I can’t do either it almost feels like they are turning on me with cries of helping disguised as angry rants about my current state of living. 

So now I’ve come to a point where I have no self confidence in anything I do, and feel like there is no way out of this continuous loop. I get these rare feeling of euphoria and nostalgia of a person I used to be who had a happy free mind but now it seems to be stuck in the sticky trap of depression, laziness and hopelessness.

If you’ve read this far it really means a lot and if anyone’s has gone through similar situations and gotten out of it it would be a really big help to know what you did. Thanks guys. "
86vvne,9,2018-03-24,"Met and danced with a girl in a bar for the first time, was great, but didn't know what to say",DownloadPow,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/86vvne/met_and_danced_with_a_girl_in_a_bar_for_the_first/,"Hey !

First, I'm 20 and I met my 2 previous and only girlfriends on Tinder, and we never really dated, we just texted and got together when we met, that was 2 and a half years ago, I never went through that phase where you're flirting with a girl at a party, nor have I ever succeeded in dating girls

So two days ago I was with my uni class at a bar as a last party with them, since we're all going to be interns for 6 months and won't be seeing each other much. 

A girl from another uni came in, I didn't notice her at the time, I was dancing a bit, I was a bit tipsy, not drunk at all and I knew what I was doing, I was just wayyy more social than usually ( and I already socialize really well when sober ).

So anyway she comes on the dancefloor as I was dancing with a friend of mine, and joins us, talking and dancing, then walks away to her friend.

A few minutes later I went and talked with her, and sexual tension quickly appeared, and we flirted for a minute or two. I then got back to dancing with my friends.

After a few minutes she came back to the dancefloor and started to dance with me, we got closer and closer, that was the very first time that I danced with a girl in a really flirty way, it was really cool and I'm actually kind of proud of that lol

I pushed her against a wall ( or she pulled me on the wall, I honestly can't remember who initiated it, but our faces were literally an inch apart, so that's probably a move from both of us ), and we talk a little bit, flirted with each other, and that's where I didn't know at all what to say.

I knew she was from a uni where students are a bit weird and don't really work and only protest just to cancel classes ( I live in France, and yeah public universities are often closed because of protests.. ), so I teased her using this, and that's literally all I could say, that sucked and that was the least sexual thing I could say, and the only thought that crossed my mind. I remember she once said "" really, what you gonna do to me ? "" or something similar, and I teased her with that, wtf ? How is THAT supposed to help me get sexual with a girl ?

So anyway after a minute of being closer to a girl than I've been in more than two years, I tried to kiss her ( same, that was the VERY FIRST TIME that I initiated a first kiss ), and she gave me her cheek.. damn it.. But I didn't leave and said "" oops I'm sorry "", I was just like ""okay, whatever "" in my head ( which is a good behavior I guess ? ), 30 seconds later she walked away, and later I walked to her to get her number, she said "" hmm.. I don't know, maybe later "" as if it was a game, I said "" fine, see you "". 

At the end of party, as my class and I were walking away, going to another bar, I took a last shot at it, went to her and said :

- Okay give me your number now
- Are you sure ?
- Yep, c'mon
- Yeaaa I'm not really sure you want it ( or sth similar )
- Fine, look, I'm leaving in 5 secs, doesn't matter if I get it or not
- Sure ?
- 5..4..

And she gave it. We texted today, but the part that really bothers me was two days ago, I had no clue as to what to tell her, I said the dumbest thing ever.

I'm usually not bad at finding relevant things to say, and I wasn't anxious two days ago, how can I come up with better things to tell a girl when being flirty with her ?

TL;DR : flirted with a girl, I'm proud of a few things I did, but I said the least sexual things when flirting /dancing with her.

86wdab,1,2018-03-24,White and nerdy/blinded by science,jt1241,fanStands,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanStands/comments/86wdab/white_and_nerdyblinded_by_science/,"Stand name:blinded by science/white and nerdy

Namesake: she blinded me with science Thomas Dolby/ white and nerdy parody of riding dirty by Al Yankovic

User: Thomas halk an intern of the speedwagon foundation.

Namesake: Thomas after Thomas Dolby the singer of blinded by sciences and halk after the late and great scientist Steven halking.


Overview: blinded by science is a stand with multiple forms starting out as white and nerdy and later evolving into white and nerdy requiem or as its user calls it blinded by science.                    

Appearance: in both of its forms the stand takes on the appearance of a white liquid that seeps out of the users pores with white and nerdy surrounding the users hands giving them long tendril like fingers, and blinded by science separating from the user to form a more punch ghost like appearance with a bulbous large faceless head retaining the long tendril fingers. Other than that its appearance is very simple being completely featureless and white.

Personality: white and nerdy simply being a pair of hands doesn't exactly have much in the way of personality however blinded by science seems to display curiosity in just about everything, looking around and examining all the details of its surroundings.

Abilities: all of the stands abilities revolve around manipulating matter to create objects or reshape the environment to the users advantage With its only limitation being that it cannot manipulate organic matter ie humans plants esc.

Rapid construction and deconstruction is white nerdys primary ability, the user can take materials that they have around them and convert them down into liquid which can then be shaped into whatever the user wants, however they need all of the necessary materials at hand and on top of that the more complicated a construction is the longer it can take to construct. One way the user gets around this is by making firearms that are single use, simply put the weapons created only have one built and clip and are discarded or reused to create more, other uses for rapid construction include building walls, melting through shallow walls or sealing up wounds with whatever materials are at hand. Another import ability that user can do is separate matter from each other, ie if you mixed salt with water white and nerdy could be used to make the two separate again. White and nerdy for all its utilities however is particularly weak in physical combat leaving the user in a support role. However if the situation might arise were the user may need to get into conflict they have a few last tricks up their sleeve such as grabbing onto the enemy's face and separating moisture from their face (or worse if they could somehow reach into the enemy's mouth).

White and nerdy transforms into blinded by science after absorbing a stand arrow in the midst of a confrontation to grab it.

Still unarmed character: what is this! could this be white and nerdy requiem!?

Halk: no this is the new power of my stand! BLINDED BY SCIENCE!

    Matter storage and transportation is blinded by sciences main ability. Having taken on a more versatile form, blinded by science is a bit more capable in combat thanks to its new ability. The stand can now store and transport matter through its body with up to a maximum of 20 pounds capable of being stored inside of the stand as fluid that fills up in its large head or other parts of its body to add weight to its attacks. Thanks to its more versatile ability the stand now has much more combat potential. It can plug one arm into the ground and fire off a volley of concrete bullets from the other arm. Add matter to different parts of its body in order to increase the strength of its physical attacks. One of its most frightening attacks is that if it can penetrate your skin with one of its fingers it can sap the iron out of an enemy's bloodstream slowly weakening them or to an opposite degree transfer dangers materials into your bloodstream. Its rapid construction ability has also vastly improved as it now can build and deconstruct at much faster rate. This allows it to completely control the environment its in, making indore encounters especially deadly. It can raise and lower terrain as well as soften impacts by liquefying the ground bellow it. blinded by science also can perform the classic stand rush attack to pummel its opponents however whenever it does this it separates its 2 long arms into six separate arms increasing the speed of its attack!

Weakness: both forms of the stand have one simple weakness, the stand cannot manipulate any organic substance. Essentially people and all the way down to plants cannot be melted or stored making the user very weak in natural environments. This presents a problem early on with defending against enemy stand users as getting close isn't exactly an option and while separating moisture can slow down an opponent or disorient them it's not capable of killing people very easily. Therefore the user must support his allies until eventually standing up for himself and obtaining blinded by science

Plot: essentially the basic gist of the story behind this stand is that it belongs to thomas halk a young intern of the speedwagon foundation who accidentally pricks his finger on a stand arrow during an experiment. shortly after obtaining his stand, word spreads around the world about a mysterious island with a gigantic city on it suddenly appearing in the middle of the pacific ocean with multiple people heading to the island to discover what the deal is with it. the halk is sent in along with a team of other stand users to investigate the island, upon landing there they meet the islands “user” an eccentric millionaire who states the the entire island and city is his stand [city of angels] and he has manifested it out in the middle of the ocean in order to attract stand users from around the world to participate in a massive tournament to discover who is the most powerful stand user on earth. He has also managed to obtain three stand arrows and has hidden them around the city, to offer a possible advantage to those who can find them. People without stands or people who refuse to participate are swallowed by the city. with nothing else to do the Halk along with the other agents of the speedwagon foundation must fight there way through the tournament in order to escape the city of angels!

I have a summer internship at AIG in Atlanta. It's in CAS and specifically speaking, I'm going to be in pricing. I still don't have any concrete details on what exact kind of work I'm going to be doing, but the position lasts for 10 weeks. I'll be setting goals with my manager and those will be measured at the midpoint and at the end of the position. They've specifically said that high performing interns may receive full-time job offers, and I am gunning for this as hard as I can. 

I was wondering if anyone here could give advice on how I can best increase my chances of receiving a full-time offer? Essentially, what kinds of things would likely be impressive to my manager and to anyone else I may be working with? For example: I'm sitting for IFM in July not only to keep up my current exam momentum but also in the hope that it will make me look better as a candidate. I'm willing to put in whatever effort is necessary. 

Honestly, guys, any input is appreciated. You all have been so helpful to me in the past and I can't thank you enough."

Basically, I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, but I guess it's been more of a ""high-functioning"" type of depression where I channeled my efforts (probably a little too much) into my academics. But recently, with stressors especially family issues, internships, and lack of friends, I'm feeling overwhelmed and have gone from a 3.9 and never getting anything below an A- to all of the sudden failing 2 of my upper div CS classes this semester. It feels like my heart and mind are just nonstop racing and I just can't focus on anything anymore. It's also an issue that hasn't just been affecting my schoolwork, but relationship, social skills, and overall motivation. I could go more into this but I don't want to rant even more.

Anyway, I already applied for graduation in a year, and failing 2 classes would just create a lot of complications. I'm wondering if anyone here has had any similar experiences. I'm afraid to talk to my professors about this, as they might just see it as an excuse. I truly care about my academics and I know I can do better if I weren't feeling so shitty and if I could actually focus. I've been meaning to go to CAPS ever since last year, but I've always questioned whether they can really help, and frankly I've just been afraid. So I have 2 questions:

1. Has anyone gone to the psychiatric services here and can they diagnose you and prescribe you with medication? I know you have to get a referral from CAPS first. How does that work?
2. Is there any luck at all in going to my professors and explaining my situation? Has anyone done this before?

Thanks a lot for reading this. If anyone doesn't want to share this here, you can PM me.
Hope everyone's having a great spring break!"

Right now, it’s summer internship applications. It stresses me out so I avoid it. But when I start working on it again, I feel so guilty for setting back my progress. I see what others have done in the time I wasted and feel like an idiot.

I think I do this to keep my options open, so that I don’t have to commit to anything. 

This makes me feel crappy about myself and then I become self pitying and wallow. This accomplishes nothing but sometimes makes me forget about how I feel about myself.

New things scare me, but when I tackle them, I get such euphoria. Getting to that is hard though.

I want to eat better and have a stronger body. I want to work out. I want to have a relationship. But it is so hard to start those things. 

Does anyone have any advice or experience in dealing with stress and getting what you want out of life? I’m sick of being a backseat driver in my own life but am terrified. "

I had a couple of beaters in high school that my dad let me drive, but since I started college ~3 years ago I've been without a car. Now this summer I'll have an internship in a different city, and it's time to have a car again. 

I'm a very technical guy with a computer engineering background, so I'm great with buying tech but I'm clueless when it comes to cars. My biggest thing is that I want to get something as reliable as possible, and I car little about how the car looks or anything too special about it, as long as it's safe. My parents are going to help me with the payments for now, and are urging me to get something a bit newer, only saying that they want the payments to be around $100 / mo, which they say should be doable because they have great credit. 

Based on my research and from talking to those knowledgeable about cars, I'm going to want a Honda Civic, Accord or Toyota Corolla. I'm not entirely sure what year range I should be looking for, though. I plan on having this car for a while, and will be taking over payments with my internship and after graduation when I should have a good job, but I also do not want anything over the top expensive. I'm basically looking for a sweet spot of what I should be paying to get a reliable car I don't need to stress about, but not a *nice* car. I really would like it to be cheap to fix, in the event something does go wrong. 

The only really *extra* thing I care about besides reliability and fuel efficiency is that I'm a speaker guy, so I'd prefer it not to be a nightmare to add new speakers (subs, replacing door speakers if necessary).

Thanks for the help!"

So as you may(or may not) know, student devcon was today. I got back just a little while ago, and I'm a 2nd/3rd year student(changed majors). My main takeaway was that I was completely unqualified for EVERY position the startup companies were advertising. I spoke with almost every single one briefly, and found either a) I didnt know the requisite languages or b) I had nothing 'extra' to show for myself(ie side projects).

I thought that simply having a degree in CS, or a good GPA in the case of internships, would be enough to get an entry level position and from there I would specialize my skills, following the old adage that school doesn't teach you what you need to know for industry, only showing you are capable of learning. But it seems like the things I hear to get into the best of the best companies(Google etc) are now required just to get my foot in the door at a startup?

For reference I have the main 200 level CS courses complete(229,291,201,204) and I've finished 304 and my gpa has always been 3.5+. 

I just feel like I've given up my life for 3 years with nothing to show for it.

I have high hopes that 301 will teach me something good next fall, but we'll see i guess? Thanks for listening, any input is great!

I graduated in 2017 and have yet to land a job...I think a big obstacle for me is not being able to drive (I have vision issues and while most daily tasks are not a problem for me, I'm not comfortable driving).  At first I was mainly looking for hospital jobs since that's always been my area of interest, and although I've had several interviews I never ended up landing a job.  I've had two places interested in hiring me that I ended up having to decline after visiting the area and seeing how unrealistic it would be to live there with my situation, which was very discouraging.

I was hoping applying to retail would be easier, but so far it's been equally discouraging.  Most jobs expect me as a new grad to have a car and float, and most of the staff positions I've seen open are in more rural areas. Of course big cities with good public transit are super saturated.

I'll be the first to admit that the driving thing isn't my only issue, I didn't really work during school and wasn't so good at networking.  I have a big gap in my resume now since graduation which I really regret, I should have at least been working as an intern or volunteering during this time but I didn't expect finding a job to be quite this hard, too optimistic I guess. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could improve my situation?  I'm open to working in any pharmacy setting as long as i can realistically live in the area where I'm located.  Someone suggested I look into the Indian Health Service, as some of those areas having housing right next to the work site.  Would that be a viable option?  I've also been thinking an office-type long-term care job might be a good option, but know those usually want you to have experience.

Thanks for any advice you guys can provide."

**What's On Today**

**Today in Scottish History**

On this day in 1306, Robert the Bruce, Earl of Annandale, was crowned King of Scots at Scone.
Bruce was crowned in the presence of four bishops, five earls and the people of the land by the Countess of Buchan, performing the hereditary duties of her brother, the Earl of Fife, who was imprisoned at the time. Bruce was forced into hiding soon after his coronation, however, and the Countess of Buchan was imprisoned in a cage on the walls of Berwick castle.

March 25 was celebrated as the traditional date of the Scottish New Year until 1599. In that year, Scotland converted to the modern Gregorian Calendar. England did not adopt the new calendar until the Calendar Act of 1751 was passed, a full 152 years after Scotland.

Now this girl is smoking hot, slim with curves and a face to die for. I thought of getting her contact info, but she left before I could. Damn; I missed my chance. I was honestly ready to go running after her.

Then I cooled down and thought, what the fuck am I doing?

I already know there are fundamental differences between us that mean we would never work together. Even if I got her number or social media, she'd just be another 'friend' I don't really know. Yet I was still willing to waste my time and energy hunting her down. Because (1) she's hot, and (2) I didn't want to feel like I'd missed my shot.

I've done things like this in the past. 

One of my favorite writers, Mark Manson, talks about how a lot of guys seem to approach dating with a FOMO mindset. They chase girls purely for those reasons: they're attracted, and they don't want to feel like they've lost. They never stop to think about whether they actually want the girl they're chasing. 

I realize now that I have been one of these guys. Needy and attention-seeking, looking for external validation in women. Fuck that. It's time for an abundance mindset. 

NoFap isn't just about quitting PMO; it's about changing your attitude towards women. Learn from my example guys. Don't put girls on a pedestal. Be smart about who you're choosing.

86yv4v,3,2018-03-25,Considering moving to Minnesota...,Skorpius98,minnesota,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/86yv4v/considering_moving_to_minnesota/,"Hello all! I’m from the Chicagoland area and am currently attending college here. My internship is coming up and I’m really considering Minnesota as the place to do it and possibly stay there after I graduate (my internship is my last semester in school). I figured this would be a good place to ask my questions. I planned on doing my internship somewhere in the St.Paul - Minneapolis area due to the larger population. Im in school to become a firefighter and with over 97% of Minnesota being volunteer departments, I have to be in a place with a decent population. So here a few questions, anything helps!

Are the winters really that awful? Chicago gets down to -25 with the windchill on a pretty regular basis, and instead of snow we mostly just get ice storms, how does that compare to Minnesota? (Looking at averages can only tell me so much)

I’m single, and plan on staying that way while I’m still going to school in Illinois, does Minneapolis or St. Paul and the surrounding areas have any night life? If so, are there any other towns in Minnesota that are known for being pretty popular besides Duluth? (Was told it was mostly old married couples there).

A big reason I’m considering a move to Minnesota is because I find humidity and hot summers to be the absolute worst thing in the world. Illinois routinely gets to 75%-90%+ humidity on days averaging 85 degrees or more and it’s basically unbearable for me and takes the fun out of summer. Are the summers in Minnesota really that much different? 

I love fishing, hiking, backpacking and biking and saw that some of the wilderness in Minnesota is just downright amazing, are there areas of wilderness and lakes pretty much everywhere, or is that predominantly a Northern thing?

Last but not least, I’m already an EMT-B and looking to become a full time firefighter eventually as previously stated, so if anyone knows about the job prospects and relation to the cost of living, that would be great. (I know there is an MNJobs subreddit but I’m not seeking employment right now, just information regarding the potential for the future)

Any other information you think is important to know about living in Minnesota would also be great.

Thanks for everyone’s help in advance! Even answering one of these questions will definitely help me in my decision!

86z8a1,49,2018-03-25,having a rebellious phase after being a coddled and sheltered child all my life,almondryu,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/86z8a1/having_a_rebellious_phase_after_being_a_coddled/,"I'm a college student, and basically a typical sheltered and coddled child growing up, as a high schooler I was more akin to a 12 year old: I wasn't allowed to walk around the block, or come in the kitchen for fear I would be kidnapped or burn myself respectively. The first time I walked around by myself was at the ripe age of 17. I didn't know how to do anything (cook, public transport, laundry) until I came to college. 


So, the only thing I knew how to do was sit in front of the books and study. So I did this day in and day out, but then in my second year of college I had an ""epiphany"". I had moved out 1 year ago and I was hit by the fact that there was no one stopping me. So I went out and got various piercings in ""hidden"" locations if you get what I mean, started smoking... I then started posting nudes and various inappropriate images of myself on the web, without my face. I'm kind of horrified, at times, of what I'm doing....



I want to dye my hair and plan on getting a tattoo in a similar hidden location. But part of me realizes that I act like a young edgy 14-15 year old. I have no communication skills because I simply was never allowed to talk or go out with people. I get interviews and internships and I find myself sweating like a waterfall. I can't look people in the eyes and have conversations. I feel like the same 13 year old loner I was many years ago just with an appearance I like more. I can never talk with my parents about anything serious. All conversations go like this: ""have you studied for x midterm? applied for x job?"". And thats all. I cannot fathom telling my parents anything of substance: anxiety, the fact that I have no friends, my health...

I can't get any mental health from actual therapists because I am forced to be on my parents insurance. They do not believe in mental health and are violently against it. I am going to graduate school and I suspect that I will still be a ""dependent"" on them when it comes to insurance...(not sure about these kinds of things)


So, what do I do? I realize that I am left with no one to turn to, but the internet for help. I feel sad that I was raised this way, but you cant change the past and here I am. 


Any advice, however critical is greatly appreciated. I would like to become a better person. 

Thanks for reading.

86z9ul,6,2018-03-25,[F4M] Freeuse in the break room,miyunie,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/86z9ul/f4m_freeuse_in_the_break_room/,"You sigh and lean back in your chair. It was only 11:34am and you still had to stay for another 6 hours on a Friday. You peek over the wall of your cubicle as you see Dan and his cubicle-neighbor leave the break room, laughing and adjusting their belts. A wave of curiosity passes over you as you see your own cubicle-neighbor, Harvey, eagerly enter the break room after them with a large grin on his face. He shut the door behind him, leaving you wondering. Did someone bring donuts or cake or something? You pondered it briefly before deciding to finish up revising the draft your boss sent you earlier in the morning.


It was 12:01pm when you glanced up at the sound of a door opening. Harvey was leaving the break room looking complacent and satisfied, the zipper to his pants was completely down. Your curiosity was piqued now. You stood up and walked past him, motioning to his fly. He noticed your gesture and gave a hearty chuckle, zipping it up to its proper position once again. As he brushed past you, you smelt a weird musk in his wake. You stopped and turned to give an inquiring look at his retreating figure before putting a hand on the door to the break room. This was a really odd Friday.


As you opened the door to the break room, a deep, salty musk greeted you. Whatever donuts the intern brought went seriously bad. But to your surprise, what lay on the break room table was not donuts, but a girl. She was completely naked and was dripping in various white fluids. You stopped in place and immediately turned completely around and walked out the door.


“Uh what’s exactly going on in the break room?” you ask loudly to the office full of men. Some stopped their work and side conversation to look at you. No one spoke for a bit.


Dan looked up from his work, “The boss decided he’d treat us to something special since it’s Friday, I guess. You can use her how you like, is what he said.” Dan gave a shrug and went back to his desk work. The others also treated it casually and went back to their work. 



You were aghast. The boss hired some sexy fun time for his office? Seemed unlikely. 



You opened the door to the break room once more, stepping in. The girl was still laying on the table, looking quite exhausted. Her eyes weakly moved to you when you entered. You stopped in your tracks once again, eyeing her. Sure, she was cute. Really tiny and perky. But did the boss really hire someone for this sole purpose?



Something about her helpless nature caused the blood to rush to your nether regions and in no time flat, there was a tight bulge pressing on the fine material of your pants. It was begging to be released and sheathed inside that soft milky flesh. She warily eyes the growing tightness in your pants, already knowing what inevitably will happen. Your hands are already unbuckling your belt and pulling down your own zipper. Harvey’s indecency was starting to make a lot of sense to your lustful mind as your erect cock bounces free from its restraint.


You approach her, and she turns to lay on her back on the table, resigning herself to her own fate.

870erz,1,2018-03-25,A bit overwhelmed,Tacotobi4412,ENFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/870erz/a_bit_overwhelmed/,"So I've had a rough few weeks and I just need a place to find some encouragement. Recently my mom started having seizures (had 3 in one day) and we don't have the best communication skills with each other (I'm ""lost"" because I want to create anything and everything that interest me) so I'm having a hard time reaching out to express my care because I have this dream that my mom and my Grandma pass away and I'm just destroyed from it because they're my rock in my life especially my Grandma she's my best friend, and she's been really sick the last year after my grandfather passed it hit her hard and she's been mad depressed since then so I spend a lot of time with her but she won't go to the doctor she hates them and it's stressful and saddening to see her in this state especially when she'll say things like ""You're only hangout with me because I don't have much time left"" and that kills me so much because its the opposite she used to be happy and energetic now she's lethargic and bitter (if that's the word I'm looking for)   

I'm 19 and I have been making music for as long as I can remember it's my safe place, so I am working a project to release on Wednesday (my birthday) and my data became corrupt on Monday so I spent the next day or two trying to figure out if there was a way to get back 3 years of work and some of my favorite and personal songs so that just killed my mood and I try not to let it bring my mood down just that lately I feel as though I'm being left behind by others my age because I'm pursuing music while they're out at college or at an internship or military etc. whatever it is they seem like they're progressing further and faster than I. Which I don't mind for the most part because there's no real blueprint to do the things I want to create I am going to make the next Hollywood/La/NYC I'm a trailblazer but sometimes I feel like I've taken a wrong turn or I'm insane for actually having a crazy dream when most of my peers are going to school to be doctors or welders or mechanics but not me I want to build dynasty, the work I've put in the last few years had me so excited and then in a blink of an eye I messed it all up. I feel as though it could be a sign that it's not my calling as much as I'm passionate about it maybe I shouldn't scheme up concept for an album, I just don't know what else I would do besides music, maybe a teacher or start a nonprofit to help foster children or spread awareness and help adopt these children into loving supportive homes that give them the best opportunity to be successful in life.

So today I was mad bummed over the whole music data situation and family so I stayed in bed until 10am (which for me is late as fuck) until my best friend said he's going to cheer me up by taking me out. He knew how sad I've been and I struggle with depression but I've been doing well recently since the year started really been on a high note (or at least doing my best to persevere against the odds) got a job (start Friday!!) set a release date, started promo, had a few shows, pitched a few movie ideas, and I'm writing a book, but the biggest thing for me was my music but anyway we went out went to the park and then I broke my Iphone 7 again for the 2nd time in about 5 weeks, so I felt really stupid and worse and just wanted to go home and be by myself and mope. Then we went to grab a bite to eat at Panda so I order to go and as I getting back into the car I dropped my food. Then immediately I started to cry and my friend was like I'll go buy you food but it wasn't the food I mean it was the food but I just felt as if the scale of good vs bad karma was way off balance for me the last month or two and I was thinking as I was crying trying to stay positive but I kept thinking about my mom seizures and my grandma and how I want to do more but can't so I'm useless and I'm Klutz the Caveman  because I trip and break every form of technology in front of me like I'm allergic and then I started crying a lot more and I asked my friend to take me home and I've been listening to sad music and rolling blunts all day and night and I was getting really sadistic in my head and I just need some encouragement or advice,"

871k6r,309,2018-03-25,"Parents keep ""talking with"" me about future career plans but I don't think they understand me",TanLemur,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/871k6r/parents_keep_talking_with_me_about_future_career/,"I (20F) am a current college sophomore who is double majoring in Biology and Music. Music is just a side thing that I enjoy, but my major career path after college is still some biology-related occupation.

Now, all my family is Chinese. Parents both went to college in China and have everything developed there, while I am attending a quite prestigeous college which is known for its med school and business school. I have lived in the states for quite a while (~5 yrs) but to be frank, I think there is this cultural differences between me and my parents, like the way we think about life, goals and attitude towards self.

Anyway, being a sophomore who is constantly trying to figure out what she's doing with her life now and later, I get caught up in conversations with my parents a lot about future plans. It's almost all we ever talk about anymore. To give a little background of what's in my mind, I plan to work a little bit after graduating with bachelor's in bio-related fields, get my feet wet and see where that takes me. Because I like animals a lot, I think being an EMT, or work at a Vet clinic would be great for me to figure out if grad school, vet school or just keep on working would be the good choice for me. Ideally, I want to work with wildlife conservation, so a vet degree could really help, or I can just become a field technician or work at a zoo/museum of some sort.

You might ask why I don't consider med school - I am just not particularly interested in the time-commitment (both in school and work) and financial situation that comes along with the decision of going to med school. Plus, I don't know how I feel about being a doctor. Don't get me wrong, saving people's lives is an amazing thing to do as your job, but I don't like long shifts, difficult situations and sometimes having no choice in decisions regarding a patient's situation.

Before college, my parents (especially my mom) had always tried to push me to go to med school, because everything is just so perfect about becoming a doctor - you get good pay checks, you are well respected, etc. They finally subsided after I kept saying that might not be what I enjoy doing for the rest of my life. Things were good for a while, but now as their friends' kids are starting to have internships and their lives figured out (sort of), the career spiel has come up again.

Having an open mind, I told them I might consider going to PA school, vet school or grad school if that turns out to be what's best for me after working for a little bit. They then started telling me that being a PA doesn't really get as much respect as an MD, and also there isn't too much space for promotion. For example, a PA cannot be the chief of a department but only keep on being a PA. They told me that I am probably better off as a vet, because it's more ""respected, and there is space for developments in higher positions"".

I understand that all they are saying is probably true. There probably isn't too much space for higher positions for PA's. But I just don't agree with the whole ""respect"" thing. One doesn't do something that is well respected to be respected; one does something that he/she truly enjoys, becomes great in the field, and then gets respected for the expertise and passion. I just wanna help some lovely animals and conserve some endangered species. Becoming a vet isn't the only way out. I can do many things to achieve that. But it seems to me that all they think about are the pay checks I get, and how ""high up/respected"" the occupation is considered among society. They have only ever talked to me about these health professional occupations and neglected the other possibilities (research, conservationist, museum curator, blahblahblah).

This is so frustrating for me to deal with because I really want them to know what's going on in my mind, and I don't want this to be the only thing that we ever talk about. Also, I don't know how to tell/show them what is really going on in my mind - I have tried before by telling why I decided to work a little after graduation but it didn't seem to be very effective.

TL;DR: parents keep talking to me about being a health professional, it seems like they might have neglected some possibilities and my own thoughts, and that they are kinda blinded by the pros that come with becoming a health professional."

PC noob",SandwichBreath,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/871m0m/1000_budget_adobe_ready_build_france_pc_noob/,"&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* Mostly for video editing and motion design. So programs are Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, but also Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign. Otherwise media consumption, maybe a tiny bit of occasional gaming but nothing serious. 

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* Around 1000€ +-15% would be great. 

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* As soon as possible, I'm starting an internship mid-april and having the computer by then would be great. . 

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* Everything. I can spend a few extra buck for a good monitor. I don't really care about the mouse since I won't be gaming. 

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* France. I was thinking about buying the parts from Materiel.net or LDLC.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* Nothing!

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* I'm not really interested in overclocking. Eventually down the line.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* Video editing projects will require a lot of space. Apart from that, components that makes After Effects and Premiere rendering efficient, but I don't know anything about CPU/GPU. 

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* I don't care about the style, the less light it emits the better ! If I end up having to move the tower a lot, a medium size one would be great. 

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* Yes, Windows 10. If it makes the budget really tight, I heard there were cheaper official keys available on ebay so I might go with that. 

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**
*I'm a real computer noob, so I'm sorry for being so imprecise. Thanks for your time!*

Maybe a couple of old habits have resurfaced, but nothing to worry about. Do you have a problem? No, you can't. You aren't one of *those* guys. Keep it together. Only a few more weeks, and you'll be done. Just make sure you register for classes next semester. Oh you are still looking for an internship? I know a guy who might be able to help you out, one of my dad's friends works for a small marketing agency out of Durham. I'll send him an email for ya. Keep your head up. I know spring is here, but the cold mornings still linger. It takes a while to get out of bed, but maybe a nice omelette will help. Sure, the line is long, and everyone is just avoiding eye contact, but you are doing alright. Maybe your expectations were too high, but you don't want to settle for less. This is college, man. You take what you can get. But maybe you took a bite you couldn't swallow. You want cheese? Good call, and you tell the man at the omelette station to have a nice day, but you know he's tired too. Maybe you could start a conversation next time, brighten up the mood. But you probably won't, just gotta keep moving. There's a couple empty tables by the TVs, sweet. You can enjoy your omelette and the morning program in solitude. Hmm. The omelette taste a little bit funny, but hey now its the best you're gonna get. Count your blessings, some people cant even afford college. You finish up, and walk past the ice cream machine. You remember freshman year, and how good it would taste after a fun dinner with your friends. No ice cream today though. It just doesn't taste the same. You hope you'll find a job once you graduate. The loans are piling up. But you're alright. This is college, man. Lighten up. You heard someone was having a 21st tonight at VC. That might be fun, you haven't seen those friends in a while. You don't know why they don't hit you up anymore, but it was nice enough of them to send an invite. You're fine, they've just been busy. I'm sure you'll have a good time, just gotta get back out there. You've been hitting the gym, and you feel stronger, but you wish you had the confidence back. Tonight will be the night. No more excuses. Wait, the party started an hour ago? Why are you still here? You were waiting to see if anyone wanted to walk over with you, but no one responded. Maybe it'll be better to just stay in, that place reeks of weed anyways. Time for sleep, but maybe you'll just watch your friends snap stories of the party. Seems like fun. You wonder if they even notice that you aren't there. What happened man?"

First of all apologies if my english is not perfect.
So let's start, for the last few years I've been in college. I wasn't doing great (repeating 2 years). But this year is the final one and I finally found some great friends. 
As it's common here, in last year you must do a internship in a company. With my new friend we're all in the same company.

Among those friends, there is this one girl. At first, I wasn't paying lot of attention, she was just a friend, but since a few weeks, I just realized I wanted more with her. But I'm not sure she feels anything for me except friendship.
I need your help because I feel like we're closer. What do you think about those next points:

1) One day we had plan to go lunch together, not only me and her but with some friends too. I  was waiting with a friend and when another one arrived we just went to lunch, tottaly forgetting about her. She was pretty ma but just about them. 
There was a fe other times when my friends told me she's never mad at me whatever I do. I'm one of the few she apologies to, otherwise she's never sorry about anything.

2) We speak/message/snap everyday and she almost always uses smileys and avoid short answers.

3)I know she had a boy/sex friend a few weeks ago but she never wants to speak about him with me. She speaks about him with other people but whenever I'm here, she looks embarassed.

Right now I'm totally lost because I really love her but I wouldn't ruin the friendship we have.

2) Loitering times due to restaurants not anticipating/preparing order
3) No available parking in delivery locations etc. 
4) Customers behaving inappropriately.

**Background**
I have grown up with a family that has done their best to provide for me. By this I mean physical needs - clothes, books, and my accommodation at university. However, when it came to emotions or talking with me, it feels like they don't want to get to know me at all. This was the same growing up - whatever I was feeling, I ""wasn't normal"" for feeling it. 

I have done a bit of self-reflection and realise that I cannot change them. Having said that, where do I get love, support and validation (apart from your friends - because we're guys and none of my guy friends want to do that shit). 

**The situation I am in**

Presently, I am a 22-yr-old doing an internship at the UN with very confronting topics about genocide. I am overseas at the moment. I am finding it very difficult - I want to appear strong because they don't want to see me as weak.

If they ask me how I am, I say fine because it's a lot easier. If I tell them that I don't like the country I am in, they will tell me to 'cheer up' or 'get over it'. I am pained both ways: if I don't tell them then I suffer, and if I do tell them how I truly feel then I can tell they don't listen to me or are just very brashly dismissive.

I'm at a point in my life where I am very depressed because of the realisation that I need any type of love, and feel disgusted with myself for *needing* something. I do love myself, but sometimes I have episodes of self-hate and anxiety. I have been dealing with this, and some other difficult things for the past year, but I am running thin.

Please, RBN, I need resources to heal. I need to find out how to get the love that I never got. I feel very empty. Please."
873rps,8,2018-03-25,Any Physics students with opinions on taking a year off / gap year before undergrad?,wandering_____,PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/873rps/any_physics_students_with_opinions_on_taking_a/,"Hi, I'm a high school senior. I'm planning to major in Physics when I get to college. I've done a decent bit of research on the field. My current plan is to try to start getting in on undergrad research as soon as possible. If I enjoy it, I'll probably continue on to grad school; if not, I'll probably either try to get a job straight out of college, or get a masters in a different but tangentially related field.

However, I'm considering taking a year off. It'd be nice to live life outside of school for a time, especially considering that I've gone to school for 13-14 years, and if I do end up going for a physics undergrad and phd, I may end up be going to school for another 8-10 years (assuming 4 years undergrad and 4-6 years grad / phd). Assuming I manage to get a research position / internship every summer of undergrad (very possible that I won't be able to do this, but that's my goal), I don't see myself having the ability to take a year off, except for inbetween undergrad/grad school. (I could also just travel for 1 to 1.5 months during this summer break).

Plus, my habits that I have right now aren't the best. My sleep schedule is entirely messed up - it's very frequent that I sleep at 3AM one day, then at 8PM the next day, repeating. At school, I can usually stay focused and work, but at home, I struggle to motivate myself to do even an inch of work (I feel like leaving the house and studying at a library might help with this). If I were to take a year off, I would hope to spend time fixing my habits - I'd like to try to sleep on a regular schedule, eat and exercise, etc.

If I were to take the year off, I would want to spend the time traveling (either through a work-abroad program, volunteer program, or just working to save up money for cheap travel), reading, and learning useful skills (python, some manual skills). If there were a job that I could obtain that would be relevant to my intended physics major or would teach useful skills that I could take with a high school degree, I'd try to see about that as well.

I have no financial aid or scholarships, so I don't need to worry about losing them if I take a year off. I'm very lucky in that my parents will be funding my college tuition + living expenses, so I don't need to worry about debt. I'm currently doing well in my classes. In terms of APs, I'll have AP credit for Calc BC, AP Statistics, AP Physics Mechanics C, AP Environmental Science, and AP English Language and Composition, assuming that I pass my exams.

I have some concerns. My biggest worry is that, if I do decide to go to grad school for a phd, I'll be finishing school when I'm 26-28 years old, assuming I do everything in a timely manner. Taking a year off means that I'll be another year older when I finish - and, when I finish, there's a possibility I won't be in a position that pays a lot or has a lot of free time. My other worries is that I'll mess up and waste my year off, or that I'll lose my knowledge (math, etc) or work ethic (well, what little work ethic I have, anyway), and won't be able to do well in college.

I'm very eager to start a career in physics, and want to progress quickly, but at the same time, I want to spend a year traveling.

- Have of you taken, or not taken a gap year? Do you recommend doing it / wish you had?

- What did you/would you have done on the gap year?

- Has the gap year affected your academic ability (ex. forgetting important concepts)?

I have a paid internship that I currently work 6 hours a week (which will change to full time once the summer starts), along with the normal class load for any full-time student. I also currently have a great social life (I have more friends than I've ever had before, and I feel closer to all of them than I felt to almost any of my previous friends). I also get good grades, I have a 3.6 (out of 4) GPA. I also never cancel other plans to get high, and usually I only get high after I ask all my friends if they want to hang out and they're all busy (or after we're done hanging out).

I get high around 3-4 times a week. I usually get high on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night (not always Sunday), and then one more weekday after that. Never after 7pm on a school night (I go to bed at 11, so 4 hours is usually enough to come down and wake up feeling good). I also don't get high a week before I have an exam. 

Rationally, I feel like I've got it all under control - I get plenty of sleep, I get good grades, I have an internship, I have great friends, etc. I'm also able to control myself and just stop a week before I have an exam (about once a month). I also just finished a month long T-Break about 2 weeks ago (100% voluntary). But every time I get high I feel like I'm doing it too much - rationally, 3-4 times a week does sound like a lot. Am I overthinking this? 

I feel like I'm doing it a lot but keeping it under control (not letting it have an effect on the rest of my life), is this an unhealthy view?"

I was about 22 at the time and I was living in my fraternity's house off campus. At the time I was doing an internship in a nearby city and commuting back and forth.

Anyways towards the end of my junior year I became attracted to this freshman soon to be sophomore (who was 19 soon to be 20). So was half Arab/half Hispanic and had very much the Mia Khalifia look to her. Brown skin, brown eyes (she wore glasses), was fairly tall/curvy with nice tits and a decent ass. She had a very laid back somewhat nerdy personality as well.

I first noticed her when I was at my fraternity's formal a couple of months earlier. She was the date of another brother(however he is gay and a good friend of hers). I had a few brief-medium talks/interactions with others her there. From there I often saw her around campus here and there. I also got to see/talk to her whenever she hung out with my fraternity brother and his friends from the sorority. Eventually I gradually started to see her as a sexy woman. 

That summer I began my internship. One day I came home to find her there. My fraternity brother who was her friend (who is also quite spontaneous) said she'd be visiting from home for a couple of days and staying at the house. 

After this, my fraternity brother who could often be quite annoying and immature at times asks me to take her and him to the liquor store to get booze for them since they were underage. I begrudgingly and angrily comply with his request.

After we get back we had dinner which he cooked(though at this time I can't remember what it was). Then we started drinking, talking and hanging out.

All three of us eventually get into games like ""Truth or Dare"" and ""Never have I ever"" while taking shots. I was  hesitant because I had my internship the next day but was urged by my brother to participate anyways.

Around 11 or so,  I remember we started getting pretty drunk and as so the talk of the games became sexual. While we were playing Truth or Dare it somehow led to me whipping out my dick. It was then pretty hard and I then laid it on the table we were gathered around. She then braces back in her chair shocked and laughing while holding her hand over her face. My fraternity brother then did roughly the same.

Then I remember we took a break and they went outside to smoke cigarettes. I joined them and I started hitting on her. I move closer to her and kissed her she was then receptive, kissing back. When we moved inside this progressed to full on making out.

I then moved my hands down to hers hold one and moving another to my cock which was becoming gradually hard. She laughed almost embarrassed and moved in kissing me more. I asked her if she wanted to go upstairs to my room after a few minutes of this. Egged on by my gay fraternity brother, she agreed. I then led her upstairs to my bedroom.

I can't remember much but I remember laying on my bed and her aggressively pulling my shorts down. Shen then started to enthusiastically blow me while she gradually stripped all her clothes off. I remember my fraternity brother standing outside the door shortly after this laughing and finding it funny. I then shooed him away and turned off the lights which she asked me to do.

I went back the bed caressing her body while she sucked me off. I came at least twice, and she swallowed both times. It was some of the best head I've ever gotten.

Eventually Instead of getting head and wanted to go down on her. But for whatever reason she was insecure and wouldn't let me. So, I kissed and sucked her D cup sized tits while I got a condom out of my dresser. I then put it onto my fully erect 7-and-a-half-inch cock and letter her guide me into her pussy. We fucked at least 4 or 5 times that night before we both passed out around 2 or so.

Sometime in the middle of the night she woke up and went to my friend's room.

I woke up at my usual time the next morning to get ready for my internship and was out the door by 8. Spent the whole day at my internship and came home around 6:30/7.  My fraternity brother wanted me to stay up and drink with them, but I was dead tired. I was dead tired and opted to go to bed. Before I jotted off to the sack he told me to keep my door unlocked in an innuendo way. Finding it all funny.

Fast forward to around Midnight. I awoke to her coming into my room, climbing into my bed, pulling my boxers down, and putting my cock in her mouth. She was very aggressively telling me how much she wanted me while jacking/sucking me at the same time. I become rock hard immediately. I remember it was arguably the best blow job I've ever gotten. I came in her mouth fairly quickly which she swallowed.

She spent like the next 45 minutes to an hour sucking my dick. Just enjoying it, licking my shaft and balls and exploring my crotch.

Then I remember pulling her in an embrace with me on top. I then pulled down her bottom and panties while she removed her top. I remember asking her if I could caress her tits and she said ""of course you can honey"" however, she still wouldn't let me go down on her for some reason.

I was then still very hard and then I reached over to my night stand and got out a whole pack of condoms. I then put a condom on but had a hard time inter her. This went on for a few minutes until she directed me quite loudly to ""now really shove it in me!"" Which I did, and I was finally inside.

We fucked harder and more intensely then the night before. I found her pussy to be tighter than even the day before. I was moving between making out with her and sucking her tits at the same time. She was also scratching my back intensely which hurt at the same time. However, she was loudly moaning which was a massive plus for me. This went on all night. It was pure ecstasy.

At the end of the night I was pretty much out of the pack of condoms I had. I had counted at least 9 condoms that I had used that night. We had fucked until around 5:30 in the morning. She then fell asleep in my arms. 

The next morning when I first woke up she tried deep throating me but couldn't as it triggered her gag reflex.

After this we spent most of the morning hanging out and talking. I held her in my arms at one point. My friend then took her to the airport, so she could catch her afternoon flight back home.

Afterwards she apparently told all of her lady friends that she had a great time and that the sex was amazing. She also told my gay roommate that they needed to ""build a shrine to my cock"" lol. She later told me it was the best sex she had had up to that point.

For me this has gone down as one of the best hookups I've ever had

I've been unhappy with the job for months, but have been on the fence about looking at new opportunities because I genuinely like my boss and most of my coworkers. I would even consider us friends, and have had the same expressed to me.

A few weeks ago, I had to have a ""verbal warning"" because my show rates were low. Mind you, I work in the behavioral health field. I have zero control over whether or not my clients show and, given that therapy isn't exactly the funnest thing in the world, people are prone to missing appointments. 

So they talked about demoting me to a non-salaried position where I'd be expected to do the same tasks, and additional tasks, for less pay. Jury's still out on that one; we do the two week review this week. But after realizing my job (and my paycheck) was very much not secure, I panicked and started sending out my resume to anyone I thought would hire me. 

I interview this Friday somewhere an hour away from where I live, but with considerably higher pay and more consistency. At first I felt guilty, because I felt like it was a betrayal to my boss (who already has abandonment issues; turnover this year has been awful). But then I realized that, for the first time in months, I didn't wake up with a weight on my chest. 

So fingers crossed and wish me luck! There's a light at the end of this tunnel I've felt trapped in for ages, and while I dread the possibility of breaking the news to everyone, I also hope for it because it means I'm finally free."

I was working for this company and got promoted into a manager’s training program.

Panera has a deal on Tuesdays for their bagels. I think the Baker’s Dozen and two tubs of cream cheese comes out $1 or $2 less than the dozen bagels with cream cheese. Something to that extent.

I had gotten bagels and offered them to my boss and other managers since they were the ones training me. I put them in the break room for anyone else who would want one. One of the shift leads later asked who brought bagels, and I said that I did.

Her response: “oh, you should have gotten us soup and sandwiches instead.”k

I felt really offended with her comment. This was before when I wasn’t as outspoken, so I didn’t say anything.

But after that incident, I stopped getting bagels to share with people.

I didn’t have to get bagels for people at work. I just think Panera has a good deal on Tuesdays for all those bagels, so why not share them? It just meant I get a bagel for breakfast and another one for lunch.

There was also another incident while I was a management trainee and some of us were chipping in for pizza. The same shift lead made a comment about how I should just pay for the entire pizza since I made more than everyone else. Again, I didn’t make a comment.

But if you’ve made it this far in my post, and you’re wondering if I still get Panera bagels and bring them to work, yes. Panera is right off the interstate, so I sometimes swing by before I head to work. The company I worked for last year as an intern, I would get bagels for my team/department within IT maybe like once a month. No off-handed Choosy-Beggar comments. I work for a different company now. I haven’t brought in bagels, but I’ve brought in cupcakes because there’s a bakery near the office. No off-handed Choosy-Beggar comments either. Although I’ve gotten some “Ooh...you’re making me cheat on my diet” comments.

8760au,0,2018-03-25,Should I move to Bay Area?,siralexvip,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8760au/should_i_move_to_bay_area/,"Hi guys,
I am about to finish my degree in computer science from a decent state school in a low cost area and have 2 offers. One offer from my current company in which I have worked for almost 2 years after my internship. I am really happy with my job and the offer since I get good salary and work in an important team in the company. The other offer from a medium size company in Silicon Valley.  

My current company offer is 75k and Silicon valley company offer is 100k. I will live with my parents if I stay at the current company. I did all the calculations and will end up saving more if I stay. 

My family in San Jose told me to accept the offer in Silicon Valley since I will have a better career and told me that the offer from my company is not that good.
I am thinking about saving some money than move to Silicon Valley when I get more experience(may be in 2 years)

What should I do? Thanks. 
Edit: thanks for all your inputs. I dont have much debt. "
8767xe,8,2018-03-25,[Vent][Long] Quit my job today.,KennstDuCuntsDew,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/8767xe/ventlong_quit_my_job_today/,"I've been in this kitchen only a few months. I sort of stumbled into it- I was looking for FOH work, have experience in both, and this place hired me on the spot for the back when I wandered in to leave a resume. I figured I'd go with it and add a little more bulk to my resume. I ended up really liking working with the boss that hired me, and I feel like shit that I quit on him, but as for most of the rest, I feel so much better after just one day not having to see them anymore.

A lot of them hadn't had jobs before. Not just kitchen jobs- any jobs. These weren't culinary school interns or grads getting their feet wet. They were local kids who wanted enough of a paycheck to buy another video game. The majority of the conversations every shift were about their games. They would ignore and mishear line calls during rushes to chat about games, then get annoyed when they noticed something wasn't right with their orders because they never heard the call. They didn't even cover the basics, like saying they were behind someone while holding a knife, or carrying a pot of boiling water around a corner. Prep talked more than worked and would openly tell me to get someone else to do their job because they had no idea what half the stuff in the kitchen was and couldn't be arsed to learn their jobs. People would eat gross gooey shit over food that they were prepping, and come onto the line during service to make stuff for themselves without asking or even telling anyone. I had a guy last week boycott his own station because I told him he couldn't make fried chicken for himself at 6PM on a Friday while I had a queue for my fryers. There were no repercussions for him, while the float person and myself picked up his significant slack.

I ended up teaching other hires how to do things I hadn't been trained to do myself because they had been trained by the prep person who doesn't bother doing her own work. A guy told me he knew how to clean fryers but just in case I told him to turn them off first, and he ignored me. He lit them on fire and laughed while everyone scrambled to put it out. Called me a c*** when I told him after the fact that I told him in the first place to turn them off before draining. If I ever told him what to do for his work, he'd interrupt to tell me to cut the attitude. I would do some of the little cleaning tasks that were under his job and point them out to him so he would know for the future, and he flat out told me the other night that no one had ever told him about any of those jobs. *No.*

One boss would spend most of his shift hanging out in the window chatting with FOH and playing on his phone, then brag about how he was so awesome during rushes and was in his management position because of how much he cared and how hard he worked, and give workers shit for taking any breaks. Another one would micromanage my station whenever his bosses corrected him for anything. If they told him to check a temperature or correct an order, five minutes later he would be in my area picking two leaves off a dish I made and saying I over-portioned, or telling me to boil water for a recipe for nine minutes, not ten, before even putting the food in. Same guy also frequently told me to not bother prepping batches in advance because ""prep would do it."" Prep would leave hours early every day and would barely make enough to get through the shift they were working at the time, let alone the dinner rush, then spend the whole next morning whining that night prep (which was a shift only half the week) hadn't essentially done day's jobs for them.

No one used cleaning product properly. The fryers were separating despite being held together with metal plating because so much oil and residue had dripped into the split between them that the residue was forcing the machines apart. I detailed someone else's station one day when I had time and it was particularly grungy, and I found equipment caked with food debris on the portions facing the wall- months of being ignored and disgusting. Half the slicer has last year's onions on it. Frayed wires all over the place and not even electrical tape in the house. Equipment only got replaced piecemeal if and only if it had actually caught on fire. I know bits of plastic are ground into the food every day. The dishwashers frequently argued with me if I told them to scrub the residue off of the dishes instead of just running greasy, trash-speckled pots through the machine. It's nice that last week's plastic wrap is extra sanitary now, but it *shouldn't be there at all.* Use your head, then use your arms! And scrub! It's metal, it can handle you scraping a few mm. of melted plastic off the edges with steel wool- but apparently the dishwashers can't. One told me it wasn't even a possibility to get the debris off of the pans. A *dishwasher* told me it wasn't a possibility to *wash dishes*.

I've never seen a kitchen that closes so often within fifteen minutes of the restaurant closing. I've also never worked in a kitchen with so many hollow complaints about doing work, any amount of work. I've never worked in a kitchen that closes with so much soap spilled on the floor and so much oil and food residue on the coolers/boards/counters/lights/walls/equipment/ceilings. I've also never worked in a kitchen with so many white suburban teenagers comfortable with calling someone a n***** for ordering a dish the cooks didn't feel like making just then. I've never worked in a kitchen where half the team stands in the back out of sight of guests and vapes indoors during service while actively complaining about people who leave the line to smoke cigarettes.

Also: *pay me when you promise to give me a raise, you shits.* It's in the contract, and the handbook, and I know the guy who drops his half-eaten cheese-soaked potato chips into milkshakes gets paid more than I do, so pay your fucking employees a living wage and follow your own rules.

Not all of it was bad, and I tried to go in with a good attitude. I always knew it was temporary, but I never imagined it would be this temporary. I feel like shit for letting down the guy who hired me. He knew I was leaving soon, but quitting suddenly like I did was shitty and wrong to him. If someone less capable had been in his place, I would have walked out. Now that I am gone, I'll have time to actually take care of my life. I have to see a few more doctors and pack up my house to move. If this hadn't been a temporary job, this place would have eaten me alive and spat out a gross, listless mess of a person with even less to offer than I did when I fell into this place.

When I brought anything up to management, my concerns went nowhere. Nothing was fixed, and every time there was an issue the buck was passed to someone who happened to not be there at the moment. The place is only a few years old currently, so the building and the equipment are still decently new, but they go without proper maintenance. If they don't shape up, it'll be a rusted rats' nest by the end of their first decade. The profits on this place are largely due to the local community (which is a sleeper town with a few grocery stores and oversized housing developments) having more money than recreation outside of the local football team. They think their success is due to their quality rather than acknowledging that they opened in a place with nothing else to do and nowhere else to go, and as the town grows, their reputation won't hold up. I've wanted to leave every shift for a few weeks. I'm pissed at myself for not sticking it out like I should have, but I'm also mad that so many other people were comfortable with letting that place coast. This has been a bit of a novel. I'm angry, and I've been bottling it up because my complaints and suggestions went nowhere and I had no long-term investment in the place so it all felt like wasted effort. I just wanted to tell someone who knows what I'm talking about that this is not a way to operate well. Most people I know offline have no idea how a kitchen should run or are too stoned to care anymore, so talking about work is rather like screaming into the void. Thanks for giving me a place to vent about this stuff."
8768f3,1,2018-03-25,"I had a sad emotional breakdown, and I realized I was lying to myself about a lot of my problems",TrentGgrims,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8768f3/i_had_a_sad_emotional_breakdown_and_i_realized_i/,"For the last four years of my life, I have worked as a security guard, and last Friday, March 23^rd was my last day as one because I landed a new job for my main career field, which is to become an alcohol and drug counselor. As a security guard, I worked mainly in a warehouse, checking badges and people's bags and normal security stuff like that, but for the last two months, I switched location to a university because I had started an internship for my counseling career, which interfered with my schedule at the warehouse. I was sad because I had been there for over two and a half years and I had forged relationships with all the people there, but I still hang out with them and stay in contact, so it was easy to bear the move. 

Working at the university was vastly different than the warehouse, as there were many moving parts, and involved standing guard in front of the various buildings. The worst part was that it was mainly standing up for 9 hours a night with no siting down (until the main supervisor leaves, then we were given a lot of slack). One aspect I really liked about working at the university though was the camaraderie between the fellow guards. It felt more like a cohesive unit, unlike at the warehouse we never really dealt with each other, just the warehouse staff. At the university we would all hang out towards the end of our shifts and just clown around and talk and whatnot.

All of this is just background information for what I am writing this post about. Last Monday after my shift ended, I had a plan. There was a co-worker that I was gelling well with, and I was going to ask her out. I had a better chance the week before, but for whatever reason I did not, so I was going to ask her out the next night I would see her.

But I left without doing it, and I had an emotional breakdown on my way home that night.

I had made excuses for why I didn't do it, like her being tired and other people being inside the office, but that's not acceptable to me anymore. My breakdown consisted of thoughts ranging from me thinking that if I really wanted to do it, I would have, my anxiety problems and fears, to me feeling like I'm just not that exciting and like a blank slate with no emotion. I am almost always calm, and never really get heated or really emotional, and I sometimes feel like I am disconnected to other people because of it. I went to a birthday party with my friends from the warehouse a week before, and while it was a really good time and I had fun, I still felt like I wasn't as connected to them as I should be, and this all circles back to my blank slate feelings. These were feelings that have been hovering in the back of my head for a long time, but I had just shunned them away because I didn't like them, and I didn't ever face them until that Monday night.

As I said before, I am almost always calm, but it was always more from a lack of emotion. I liked that I was calm though, as it kept me as the rational one in the family and I never got angry or disappointed, but I also am not ""happy"" as well. That's not to say I'm sulking or sad all the time, but anytime I feel excitement and happiness, it goes away just as fast as it came and I'm back to having a flat affect. I can feel happiness, I'm always trying to help others and make them laugh, because that makes me happy, and I can get excited about movies, television, music and other things, but it doesn't last long. I just got a new job in my career and got approved for an apartment, yet I only felt 'okay' about it. I didn't get a flood of emotions, I just moved on. 

I know that looking back at events that happened in the past and wondering what we should have done in those situations is something everybody probably does and it's normal, but whenever I do so, I only feel a sense of anxiety and shame, and I can't get over those feelings. I can't help but fret about missed opportunities and it drives me crazy. My best friend told me that if I really wanted to ask my co-worker out I would have done it, and she was right, but I just couldn't understand why I hold myself back from doing it, because I did want to ask her out, yet I didn't. 

One aspect of treatment that counselors provide for recovering addicts are group meetings, where we get together and we have a certain topic to talk about for that day, and everyone gives their experiences about that topic and how they felt during their addiction. The group topic that we had that Monday morning was about trusting yourself and others, and also lying to others and yourself, and it sat in the back of my mind and didn't hit me until that night when I had the breakdown. I had realized that I had been lying to myself about my lack of emotions and that I didn't trust myself to do anything to make me feel happier. I realized that I suppress a lot of thoughts and emotions that make me feel bad, and I know that isn't healthy, but I had ways of dealing with them by acting like everything was a-ok, and singing and dancing and trying to look like I was happy all the time, but it wasn't helping like I thought it would. I liked to think that I was 'self-aware' of my own shortcomings and problems, but I had just been lying to myself.

It is interesting that you mention Bill Clinton here. Obviously, many people felt that cheating on your wife was grounds for impeachment, especially if it involved sexual relations with an impressionable, overweight, and consequently under-confident intern. Most of us see it as dangerously close to molestation when an older man with power and wealth uses an inexperienced woman in such a way.

As far as Trump goes, let us see if any of this is true yet. The media is about 0/29 on Trump scandals and manage to usually be looking in the wrong direction whenever he acts, so until demonstrated otherwise, this drama should go in the deflection/distraction pile.

**342,689** Shitty Tipsters giving life advice since **2012**

r/ShittyLifeProTips is a subreddit for the “best” tips out there. The community will brainstorm some of the shittiest ways to get something done and then tell you all about it. These include anything from [storing extra tennis balls in the container,](http://imgur.com/NAmozh5) [breathing underwater,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/comments/6alxzs/lpt_when_underwater_breath_with_a_third_of_your/) and one of the most iconic ones [finding a gas leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/comments/7h2nds/smell_gas_remember_to_us_this_top_tip_from_m/).

Even though this subreddit will never actually help anyone, it has grown into a large community with this being its 3rd feature! The subreddit has continued to grow since its creation in 2012 and has a great moderating team including some big names such as /u/Pravusmentis and /u/Kate_4_President. Both of these people plus 7 more all manage this subreddit and manage to keep the subreddit clean from rule breakers and spammers. 


Some of the other responses I got from Kate were:

&gt;1.With quality shitposts also comes bad ones, is it hard to deal with?

&gt;&gt;**Kate_4_President** We delete [the post] and tell user to heck off. The good thing that comes with moderating a shitty sub, is no one expect[s] anything of you.

&gt;2.What inspired this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Kate_4_President** LPT had become such an popular place to shitpost à la askredditt for people looking for easy reposts and karma, shittyLPT was bound to happen as a counter-jerk movement.

&gt;How has the subreddit changed since your last feature?

&gt;&gt;**Kate_4_President** We seem to have grown almost 10x bigger since the last feature! Hopefully we get at least one comment in our feature this time! Also it looks kinda good now, I think. Someone please pat me on the back.

Overall this subreddit has a great community and will give laughs to many people as the subreddit continues to grow even further. I highly recommend subbing to the subreddit and watching it become a subreddit that will eventually reach r/all frequently!

&amp;nbsp;    
1  
Klopt het dat Octrooicentrum Nederland sinds 2016 niet meer regulier oriënterende octrooiliteratuuronderzoeken voor de Nederlandse universiteiten en hogescholen uitvoert? Waarom is besloten tot stopzetting van deze service?  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
Klopt het dat als gevolg van deze stopzetting de universiteiten en hogescholen geen beroep meer kunnen doen op deze service, maar hiervoor een octrooibureau een opdracht moeten laten uitvoeren met de daarbij behorende kosten van zo’n onderzoek?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. In het kader van bezuinigingen die in vorige kabinetsperioden zijn doorgevoerd, heeft inderdaad een versobering van het dienstenpakket van OCNL plaatsgevonden. Als gevolg daarvan kunnen universiteiten en hogescholen geen oriënterende onderzoeken bij OCNL meer aanvragen. Dat betekent niet dat daarvoor per definitie een extern bureau moet worden ingeschakeld. Universiteiten en hogescholen kunnen er ook voor kiezen om deze activiteiten intern uit te voeren, bijvoorbeeld bij hun Technology Transfer Offices &amp;#40;TTO’s&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
Bent u ervan op de hoogte dat, om via octrooidatabases naar octrooidocumentatie te zoeken, de onderzoeker vertrouwd dient te zijn met het zoeken door middel van octrooiklassen? Is deze kennis wel voldoende aanwezig bij universiteiten en hogescholen, bijvoorbeeld bij hun Technology Transfer Offices &amp;#40;TTO’s&amp;#41;, om de service van Octrooicentrum Nederland op dit moment te kunnen schrappen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Het zoeken naar  octrooidocumentatie in octrooidatabases vereist bijzondere expertise, competenties en ruime praktijkervaring, die niet zonder meer in voldoende mate aanwezig zijn bij universiteiten.   
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
Deelt u de mening dat, gelet op de taak van het WO en HBO om maatschappelijk relevant onderzoek te financieren en toepassing na te streven, de aanvraag van een octrooi relevant kan zijn om dit doel te bereiken? Deelt u de mening dat een objectieve overweging of een octrooiaanvrage mogelijk en zinvol is gebaat is bij een onafhankelijk oriënterend onderzoek?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik deel de mening dat het verkrijgen van octrooibescherming een belangrijke bijdrage kan leveren aan het bereiken van valorisatiedoelstellingen van universiteiten en hogescholen. Of in een concreet geval een octrooi moet worden aangevraagd, om daadwerkelijk te komen tot kennisvalorisatie, is een verantwoordelijkheid van de desbetreffende instelling zelf, op basis van eigen analyse en afwegingen, al dan niet mede ingegeven door inschakeling van externe expertise.    
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Deelt u de mening dat de genoemde service van Octrooicentrum Nederland beschikbaar moet blijven voor universiteiten en hogescholen? Welke actie gaat u nemen naar aanleiding van deze vragen?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee. In het kader van de verdere professionalisering van TTO’s van universiteiten en hogescholen vind ik het belangrijk dat de voor het uitvoeren van oriënterende onderzoeken vereiste expertise binnen de TTO’s zelf beschikbaar is, zodat universiteiten en hogescholen zelf verantwoorde keuzes kunnen maken. Wel ben ik bereid om te bezien of OCNL de instellingen daarbij behulpzaam kan zijn. Ik zal dat doen in het licht van de Beleidsvaluatie Intellectueel Eigendomsbeleid, die binnenkort aan de Tweede Kamer zal worden toegezonden.

However, I have tried and find it extremely difficult for a couple reasons.
 One, I am a server and a full time student and my income is the least steady thing ever. For a while I was doing pretty well and **making almost $500 a week**, but march madness started and it's spring break and I had a couple shitty nights so I got down to like **$250 a week** for two weeks before taking a week off on an already scheduled and paid for trip. 

Secondly, I don't have very many monthly expenses BUT I have a lot of large things I need to save up for in the future.
**$6,000** I need to save up for for room/board alone next year (scholarships require me to live on campus and have a meal plan). 
**$800** for housing this summer.


**$1700 saved** because I just bought a $3500 car (hopefully I can sell my old one for $1000). 

Additionally, **I'm going to be working less next fall** because I need to get an internship in order to graduate next May, I'm going to get one this summer to just beef up my resume but I would have to pay an additional $1500 for it to count as credit. 

I graduate in May 2019, so I need some money set aside to move out on my own/possibly go to grad school.

My current method is just to spend as little as possible, but being 21 and coming back from living in a country with a small variety of food makes me want to go out and eat, plus I have a mentality sometimes that I'm working so hard in college...what am I doing that for if I can't have any fun?
Any advice would be great, thank you.

I'm 22, a junior in University, double-major and a double-minor who is planning on going to law school. The last six years of my life I have let my depression take me up and down and much further away from my goals. Honestly, I am tired of letting it rule my life while giving into it as often as I have. I have only created problems for myself that end up compounding and really fucking with my life and plans. So today I decide to change that. 

My end goal revolves around become academically and professionally successful and an overall healthier person

**Short term goals:**

-  Start following a morning routine and wakeup earlier
     - Run, breakfast, skincare routine
- Go to class every day, makeup readings/work from missing classes (I've been so bad with going to classes this semester)
     - I have a GPA just below 3.9 right now
- Start following a Keto diet, drink over 8 glasses of water everyday
- Apply to summer internships
     - Somewhere in the field of law or human rights preferably, though I might have to go for a corporate one because I desperately need to earn money
- Find fall internship and research opportunities
- Study for LSAT everyday per schedule
- Get into a study abroad program for next semester
- Apply for honors thesis for my senior year for my majors
- Get financials in order
- Visit doctor
- (Maybe) Apply to jobs. I don’t want to overwork myself as I usually do by taking on too much, but I hate not having money for food or for going out
     - Maybe some tutoring jobs?

**Long term goals:**

- Lose 100lbs and live a healthier lifestyle
- Clear up skin problems by following a skincare routine
- Get only A’s in my classes and finish undergrad with a GPA over 3.95
- Get a 175+ on my LSAT
- Get into t14 law schools (Harvard is my #1 choice!)
- Travel extensively and apply to prestigious scholarships
- Have $10,000 in savings
- Build a wardrobe that doesn’t revolve around sweats
- Finish a 5k

If anyone has any advice, that would be wonderful!"

So dumb young me signed up for a credit card when I was in college about 2 years ago. After graduation I took a minimum wage part time job and an unpaid internship. Trying to balance life for the first time I wasn’t able to make my minimum payments making my cc debt go into collections. I owe them about 1750 dollars 

It’s been on collections for about 6 months now I believe as I been trying to stall it while I get another higher paying job so I can start making payments towards it and towards my student loans.

Yesterday on the mail I got a letter from Stone Law Group saying that the cc company had filed a lawsuit against me and how they could help me in court or with a free consultation.

Now I haven’t heard anything from the actual cc company or have been served any papers for a court hearing or anything. 

Im not sure what steps to take now to avoid having to go to court and how to start fixing my mistakes, im completely lost. I’m making minimum wage and feel like I’m drowning in debt with my student loans and cc debt.

87ax7e,63,2018-03-26,Cambridge Analytica Primer,Puffin_Fitness,RussiaLago,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaLago/comments/87ax7e/cambridge_analytica_primer/,"**Before Cambridge Analytica**

Prior to the formation of Cambridge Analytica, CA’s parent company, SCL, was owned by billionaire Robert Mercer (1) and Vincent Tchenguiz (2). 

Tchenguiz, a major Tory donor, was arrested in 2008 in connection with the collapse of Icelandic bank, Kaupthing, that lent 40% of it’s capital to Tchenguiz and his brother. Tchenguiz is linked both to Russia’s Alfa-Bank and the Ukrainian oligarch, Dmytro Firtash (2).

Prior to becoming Cambridge Analytica, SCL subsidiary SCL elections had been involved in voter suppression in Nigeria (3). 

**Birth of Cambridge Analytica**

In 2013, Cambridge Analytica was born as the brain-child of Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon (4). At the time Steve Bannon was executive chair of Breitbart News that was largely financed by the Mercer family (5).

Steve Bannon met with SCL elections at Cambridge University, prompting him to name the outfit Cambridge Analytica (6 @2:30). 

**Michael Flynn joins Cambridge Analytica**

In 2013, the same year Bannon formed Cambridge Analytica and Trump was hanging out with the Agalarovs in Vegas and later Moscow, Michael Flynn would be the first US officer to be allowed inside the GRU, where he briefed their entire staff and gave them leadership OPD (7).

It has recently been revealed that Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to have hacked the DNC and Podesta and handed the files to Wikileaks, is a GRU officer (22).

Then, interestingly enough, in February 2014, Flynn met with a former employee of Sberbank (8) and a graduate student at Cambridge University, Svetlana Lokhova, whom had trusted access to Russian spy agency records and was writing a book about GRU spies. After the meeting, the two continued to communicate through email. Flynn would sign his emails as General Misha. Flynn did not disclose this meeting to US authorities and it’s believed the incident is linked to his dismissal from the Obama administration for insubordination (9).

To put this meeting between Flynn and ex-Sberbank employee Lokhova into context of the Trump-Russia scandal, just four months prior during the Miss Universe Mosocow 2013 contest, Herman Greff of Sberbank and Donald Trump signed a letter of intent for a Trump Tower Moscow to be financed by Sberbank for $1.6 billion through Crocus Group owned by Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov (21).

In January 2014, just a month before Flynn first met Lokhova, Yulya Alferova, who hung out with Trump during Miss Universe Moscow 2013, tweeted her support for Trump’s presidential run well before Trump ever announced (23). 

Flynn would eventually become an advisor for Cambridge Analytica (10). 

**Some background on Flynn**

&gt; Flynn ran intelligence for the U.S.-led international coalition in Kabul and was pushing for more creative approaches to targeting Taliban networks, including use of **data mining and social network analysis**, according to McCulloh. (emphasis mine)  (11)

That runs parallel to what Cambridge Analytica does. 

After being fired, Flynn entered into consulting, founding Flynn Intelligence Group. FIG “began assembling a crew of former armed forces veterans with expertise in cyber, logistics and surveillance, and sought out ties with lesser-known figures and companies trying to expand their profiles as contractors in the military and intelligence spheres” (11).

**George Papadopolous' ties**

On Papadopolous’ Linkedin, Papadopoulos said he wrote papers for Cambridge University, tying him into the rest of Cambridge University spies (154).

Papadopolous had direct emails from both Flynn and Bannon encouraging and supporting his role in the campaign, including his contacts with Russia (155).

**Michael Flynn would become Jared Kushner’s right-hand man**

Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were instrumental in pushing Chris Christi off Trump’s transition team and implanting Flynn (115)(116). They would later push to make Flynn Trump’s National Security Advisor (117) and then push to have Comey fired when it was discovered Comey was investigating Flynn for lying to the FBI (118).

Flynn was involved in many of the scandalous meetings Kushner held including with the prince of Abu Dhabi Zayed (119), Chinese ambassador Cui Tankai (120), and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak (121) (122). Jared Kushner would ultimately order Flynn to negotiate sanctions with Kislyak during Trumps transition in violation of the Logan Act (123). 

Jared Kushner, along Brad Parscale, worked closely with Cambridge Analytica on Trump’s digital operation (124). Jared Kushner invited campaign embeds from Facebook, Youtube, and Google to work with his Cambridge Analytica team (125 @2:37).

**Facebook, embedded in Cambridge Analytica, is embedded by Russia**

Theresa Hong from the Trump campaign says that people from Facebook, Google, and Youtube ""...were helping us... They were basically our hands-on partners...""

In the video above (125 @4:21), Theresa Hong from the Trump campaign says, ""Without Facebook, we wouldn't have won.

Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has long been close with Russia. Back in 2009, Russian social-media mogul Yuri Milner invested $200 million into Facebook at a valuation of $10 billion dollars without voting rights or a seat on the board. To understand this investment, at the time the world was going through a global recession and Facebook's general valuation had dropped from the $15 billion from the year prior to $4-$6 billion in 2009 (126).  

One company did offer a valuation of $8 billion, but with a seat on the board, which Zuckerberg was strongly against. In other words, Yuri Milner invested in Facebook when they were strapped for cash and at an inflated price without voting rights or a seat on the board. That's an amazing deal for Zuckerberg. The Paradise Papers would later reveal Milner acquired the financing through Gazprom (129).

The deal was coordinated by Alisher B. Usmanov, a close friend of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich (128). A Russian oligarch himself, Usmanov earned his fortune managing steel mill subsidiaries for Gazprom. Usmanov spent six years in prison for fraud and embezzlement in the 80's. In 2008, Usmanov fired a publisher and editor at one of Russia's most respected news paper after it published detailed accounts of Russian election fraud (127).

It was said, ""His ties to the Kremlin and Facebook have stirred concerns that he might influence the company’s policies in subtle ways to appease governments in markets where Facebook is also an important tool of political dissent, such as Russia."" This was in 2009 (127).

Soon after, Zuckerberg and Milner became friends, meeting monthly (130) and Milner even attended Zuckerberg’s wedding (131). And guess what?

Since Trump’s presidential win, Facebook has been instrumental in bringing to the USA a former Russian Troll of the IRA, Agatha Burdonova, and her husband Dmitry Fyodorov (133)(134), and has even hired Joseph Chancellor from Global Science Research, the company the breached Facebook users’ private data (135). 

**Controversial researcher Alexander Kogan partners with Cambridge Analytica**

&gt; In a 2012 study, Kosinski and two colleagues at Cambridge University were able to predict any person’s race, political affiliations and sexual orientation by analyzing someone’s social media activity.

&gt; While at Cambridge, Kosinski met fellow researcher Aleksandr Kogan. Russian-born Kogan asked about using Kosinski’s method for election manipulation. “The whole thing began to stink,” Kosinski told German Das Magazine (12).

Interestingly enough, November 2012 was when Kremlin propagandist Konstantin Rykov claims he began helping Trump’s presidential campaign. In his confession posted onto Facebook shortly after Trump’s win, Rykov claims he utilized Cambridge Analytica, a pair of hacker groups (presumably Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear), civil journalists at Wikileaks, political strategist Mikhail Kovalev, and **“the special scientific department of the ‘Cambridge University.’”** (13)

November 2012 was also when Trump registered “Make America Great Again” (14).

In 2014 Cambridge University researchers Joseph Chancellor and Alexander Kogan took the research of Cambridge University psychologist Michal Kosinki and founded Global Science Research (12), the company that breached Facebook user’s private information and sold it to Cambridge Analytica (15). 2014 was a busy year at Cambridge University.

It turns out the idea to scrape Facebook data through an app, however, came from, Alfredas Chmieliauskas, an employee of Facebook board memeber Peter Thiel’s Palantir (172). An intern at Cambridge Analytica and daughter of Google’s Eric Schmidt, Sophie, initially pushed CA toward Palantir (171).

Alexander Kogan would again use his Facebook data-scraping technique in 2015 on behalf of St Petersburg State University (16)

Kogan’s lecturer page at Cambridge University has since been taken down after the CA controvery erupted (17). Joseph Chancellor currently works as a researcher at Facebook (18).

**Ron Lauder, Trump's original Russia connection**

In November 2014, the same year Kogan founded Global Science Research and Flynn founded Flynn Intelligence Group,Trump’s childhood friend, Ron Lauder, met with Mikhail Fridman and German Khan, both of Alfa-Bank, in London (68). Two years later in April 2016 Ron Lauder would meet with Valdimir Putin (99).

Alfa-Bank servers would later directly ping servers from the Trump Organization and Betsy Devos’ Spectrum Health. Betsy Devos’ brother, Erik Prince, has a business associate, Ko Chun Shun, on the board of Cambridge Analytica (70). 

Ron Lauder has a long history of connections with Russia. As a matter of fact, Trump’s first known introduction to a Russian government official was to Russian Ambassador Yuri Dubinin   at a luncheon hosted by Ron’s brother, Leonard Louder, in 1986 (19).

Ron Lauder is close to Alfa-Bank’s Pyotr Aven. They both sit on the Board of Patrons together (112), host art galleries together (113), and Ron Lauder’s Lauder Institute joined Alfa-Bank in awarding foreign firms that conduct successful business in Russia. Who so happened to be on the Jury for that award? Trump advisor and Alfa-Bank chair Richard Burt (114).

Ron Lauder has done business with Russian oligarchs Lev Leviev (103) and Oleg Deripaska’s business partner Roman Abramovich (104). The same Lev Leviev whom Jared Kushner did business with (105) and who’s luncheon he met Ivanka Trump (106); And the same Roman Abramovich who’s ex-wife, Dahsa Zhukova, is good friends with Ivanka Trump and suspected Chinese agent and Putin love interest Wendi Deng (107).

In 1998, Lauder joined George Nader and Benjamin Netanyahu in secret Israel-Syria negotiations that ultimately failed (108). George Nader is close to UAE crown prince Zayed and was instrumental in arranging a meeting between Erik Prince and head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev (109).

Even today, Lauder sits on a board with Yuri Milner, the Russian oligarch behind DST’s investment into Facebook (132).

Ron Lauder, with the help of Trump Organization employee Arthur Finkelstein, ran for NYC mayor in 1989, though he failed to gain the nomination (100). Lauder would later recommend Finkelstein to Benjamin Netanyahu (101). Since 2003 Finkelstein partnered with George Birnbaum (100) who would become enmeshed in the campaigns of pro-Russia Netanyahu and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (102), eventually joining Ben Carson’s campaign where George Papadopolous got his first campaign experience (110), and then, after Carson’s campaign collapse, Birnbaum moved on to join Ben Carson’s ex-campaign manager Barry Bennett and Trump’s ex-campaign manager Corey Lewankdowski to form Avenue Strategies (111). 

**Nigel Farage back-channel between Julian Assange and Cambridge Analytica**

Nigel Farage and Steve Bannon are good friends. Nigel Farage once gifted Bannon a portrait of Bannon dresses as Napoleon (73). 

In 2014, Bannon brought Breitbart to London to support Nigel Farage (72), even sending Breitbart London’s managing editor, Raheem Kassam, to join UKIP as senior advisor to Farage (74).

Cambridge Analytica has a history of using hacked emails in their campaigns. Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, met with Israeli hackers at his office in London and used the hacked materials they provided in his campaign against Buhari in Nigeria (76). 

Nigel Farage had been a frequent guest of Julian Assange and suspected of having delivered a thumb drive (75). 

**Cambridge Analytica may have ordered the hack into the DNC and Podesta and later delivered the hacked files to Julian Assange for dissemination.**

Quick Timeline of Cambridge Analytica and hacked DNC emails:

* Summer 2015 Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s future campaign manager, is in talks with Cambridge Analytica (77).

* Summer 2015 Michael Flynn, an advisor of Cambridge Analytica (78), meets Donald Trump (79).

* **July 2015 DNC is hacked** (80).

* **August 8, 2015, Trump fires Roger Stone from Trump’s campaign. Sam Nunberg claimed Mueller was asking if Stone’s firing “was some grand plot by Roger and [Nunberg] to get fired and then ...we would collude with the Russians...” (167 @20:00)

* December 2015 Michael Flynn sits with Putin at an RT Gala in Moscow (81).

* At some point Peter Smith, in coordination with Michael Flynn, contacted various hacker groups, including at least two connected to the Russians, in hopes of finding Hillary Clinton’s 30,000 deleted emails (82) (Note: this would require a third hack separate from the DNC and Podesta hacks).

* April 29, 2016 Professor Mifsud tells George Papadopoulos Russians had dirt on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.

* Aug 14, Trump adviser Roger Stone direct messages Russian intelligence agent Guccifer 2.0 (83)(84). Roger Stone admits being in contact with Guccifer (85).

* Guccifer 2.0 leaks DNC hacked memo directly to Kushner-owned Observer (86)

**Carter Page and Vin Weber back-channels for Paul Manafort**

From 2000-2004 Carter Page worked at Merrill Lynch, London, where he impressed a colleague when he mentioned his work for Victor Pinchuk (91), a Ukrainian oligarch that donate $150,000 to Trump’s Trump Foundation (92). They sent him to Moscow to open a Merrill Lynch office where he worked until 2007 (90). 

Shortly after returning to New York, Carter Page founded Global Energy Capital with James Richard and a former mid-level Gazprom executive, Sergei Yatsenko, that invested in Gazprom (89). He opened his office in a building directly connected to Trump Tower where Trump and Paul Manafort resided.

In 2013, Carter Page got caught up in a busted spy ring (95). Despite that, on Aug 25, 2013, Carter Page bragged about his work as advisor to the Kremlin (88).

On March 21st, 2016 Page was named to Trump’s NatSec team along with George Papadopoulos (87). That’s four days after Trump asked Manafort to run his campaign (36).

On July 7, 2016, Carter Page gave a speech at the New Economic School in Moscow, who’s main benefactor is Pyotr Aven of Alfa-Bank. While there he discussed with Igor Sechin a deal of the brokerage fee of .5% of the 19% sale of Rosneft (93).

On July 11, 2016, Carter Page visited Vin Weber, a Paul Manafort associate, at Cambridge University (94).

Vin Weber is currently under investigation by Robert Mueller(97) and at the center of the meeting Rick Gates lied about in his plea deal with Mueller. The meeting included Rick Gates, Vin Weber, Paul Manafort, and Dana Rohrabacher where they discussed Ukraine (98).

Paul Manafort recruited Vin Weber in 2012  to be a lobbyist on behalf of the European Center for Modern Ukraine, a firm funded by the Ukrainian Party of Regions that also financed Manafort’s work there. Vin Weber also lobbied on behalf of Gazprom, and a Turkish company chaired by Ekim Alptekin who also hired Flynn (96).

**Giuliani, Trump’s original back-channel to Russia**

Trump and Giuliani have been good friends for years. In 2000, while Giuliani was Mayor of New York, Giuliani and Trump appeared in a low-budget comedy video together (37) and in 2001 Giuliani borrowed Trump’s plane for a trip to Israel (38).

Immediately after leaving office, Giuliani founded consulting firm Giuliani Partners that’s been shrouded in secrecy and became a named partner at oil and gas law firm Bracewell and Giuliani in Texas (39). 

In 2004, while partnered at Bracewell and Giuliani, Giuliani met with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov (40). Since then, Guiliani picked up big clients that have been major players in the Trump-Russia scandal including Emirates of Qatar and Russian state-run Rosneft, both appearing in Steele Dossier. Alfa-Bank, that also appeared in the Steele Dossier and is connected to SCL through Vincent Tchenguiz, hired Giuliani as a paid speaker. Giuliani represented Eni, the Italian energy company that bought Yukos assets only to turn around and give them to Gazprom (40) (55). Mercer-backed Keep the Promise 1/Make America Number 1 payed Bracewell and Giuliani and later his firm Greenberg and Traurig even while the Mercers were backing Ted Cruz publicly (41). The Mercers, of course, financed Cambridge Analytica. Bracewell and Giuliani also did legal work for Cambridge Analytica directly (42). 

On February 1st, 2013, Giuliani met with Emin Agalarov (48). 

**Russia and Trump share lawyers**

Guiliani is not the only lawyer connected to Trump and Russia. 

* Trump’s lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, also represents Sberbank (43).

* Trump’s lawyer, Don McGahn, worked for Patton Boggs that represented Gazprom (44).

* Richard Burt, on the board of Alfa-Bank, lobbied on behalf of Alfa-Bank to Jeff Sessions during Trump’s campaign, and helped write Trump’s first speech on foreign affairs (71). 

* Morgan Lewis, a firm that represented Trump and dealt with his conflicts of interest issues as president by having lawyer Sheri Dillon stand before a stack of blank folders, won 2016 Russia Law Firm of the Year (47) (46). Dillon also claimed Trump’s tax returns “do not reflect” ties to Russian “with a few exceptions” (45).

**Morgan Lewis, the center of the web: Trump, Russia, Giuliani, Ted Cruz, Cambridge Analytica, Mercers, Gazprom, Rosneft, Eni, Carter Page**

Ted Cruz, who was backed by the Mercer’s before backing Trump, also hired Cambridge Analytica and also happened to work for Morgan Lewis (50).

Morgan Lewis’s Moscow page boasts of being “particularly adept at advising [their] clients about compliance and sanction matters"" (51). 

Morgan Lewis partner Jonathan Hines has been stationed in Moscow for 18 years and has represented Gazprom through every major development including Sakhalin II, a project Carter Page also worked on while at Merrill Lynch in London (67). Hines also represented the same Eni  Giuliani represented that bought Yukos assets only to turn around and hand them to Gazprom (55); Statoil’s venture with Giuliani’s client, Rosneft; Exxon-mobil’s deal with Rosneft in Sakhalin that Tillerson signed with Igor Sechin, earning Tillerson both an Order of Friendship from Putin and a $2 million fine for violating US sanctions against Sechin (54); and Lukoil, whom Cambridge Analytica did a presentation for (53), amongst others (52).

Kirstin Gibbs has worked for both Bracewell and Giuliani as well as Morgan Lewis (56) (57). She also happened to have worked with Statoil.

In May 2011, she worked for Bracewell and Giuliani (57). In October 9th, 2013 she spoke at Bracewell &amp; Giuliani’s 2013 Oil &amp; Gas Regulatory Symposium as a representative of Morgan Lewis (58). By February 20, 2014, she was introduced as a representative of Bracewell and Giuliani at the 13th Annual Liquefied Natural Gas in Houston, Texas where she spoke alongside Mikahail Anotonov, CEO of Gazprom Marketing and Trading (59). She spoke along side Anotonov again in February 2015 (60).

**Trump adviser-backers hold a meeting**

In January, 2013, just days before Giuliani meets with Emin Agalarov, Victor Pinchuk hosts his annual Ukrainian Lunch at Davos (164)(165).

For context, Paul Manafort attended Pinchuk’s Ukrainian Lunch in 2007 and in 2006, Paul Manafort’s business associate in Ukrain, Rick Davis of Davis and Manafort, introduces Senator John McCain to Oleg Deripaska (27).

The guests of Pinchuk’s 2013 Ukrainian Lunch included (156):

* **Victor Pinchuk**, Ukrainian oligarch that donated $150,000 to **Donald Trump's** Trump Foundation (157) was also the name **Carter Page** dropped that impressed his colleagues enough that they had Carter Page open a Merrill Lynch in Moscow where Page claims to have been involved in deals with Gazprom (91).

* **Vitali Klitschko**, mayor of Kiev and client of **Rudy Giuliani**  (166). 

* **Eugene Kaspersky**, who’s Kaspersky labs anti-viral software has been banned by the US government over hacking fears (158). Kaspersky labs also paid **Flynn** a speaking fee (159).

* **Alexander Lukanov**, CEO of Alfa-Bank Ukraine. While **Wilbur Ross** was vice-chair, Cyprus Bank extended by four years a loan made to Alfa-Bank to buy its Ukrainian assets (160); Alfa-Bank paid **Rudy Giuliani** a speaking fee (40); Chairman of Alfa-Bank and Trump advisor **Richard Burton** sits on a jury for an award handed out in partnership with Alfa-Bank and Donald Trump’s childhood friend Ron Lauder’s Lauder Institute (114); Alfa-Bank’s German Khan’s son-in-law Alex van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to Mueller for lying about his contacts with **Paul Manafort and Rick Gates**, whom had worked with him on a false Ukrainian report (161).

* **Herman Gref** of Sberbank that signed a deal for **Trump** Tower Moscow at the Miss Universe contest 2013 just a few months after this photo was taken (21). While **Wilbur Ross** was vice-chair, the Bank of Cyprus, adivsed by Deutsche Bank London, sold off its Russian based businesses to Artem Avetisyan, who has ties to US-Sanctioned Sberbank through his business partner Oleg Greff, son of Herman Gref. The businesses, bought by Cyprus in 2008 for $450 million sold it to Avetisyan for less than one-sixtieth that price (160).

* **Alexey Pertin**, CEO of Smart Holding. Smart Holding, in tandem with Alisher Usmanov’s Metalloinvest, failed to acquire KGOKOR due to Timoshenko’s plans to private the asset (168). Yanukovych later jailed Timoshenko after his ascent to power with the help of Paul Manafort. General director of Gazprom Investment Holding Alisher Usmanov also arranged Yuri Milner’s 2009 investment deal with **Facebook**, financed through Gazprom (169).

* **Vadym Novynskyi**, Ukrainian oligarch who is currently under investigation for helping **Viktor Yanukoych** take over the Ukrainian Orthodox Church just months after this photo was taken (162).

* **Aleksandr Yaroslavsky**, in tandem with **Paul-Manafort-employer** in Ukraine Rinat Akhmetov, bought several of Roman Abramovich’s Ukrainian businesses in 2016. In 2015 he also purchased a controlling stake in a company from an Oleg Deripaska associate. Deripaska and Abramovich are close assoaciates (170).

* **Günther Oettinger**, a German politician that had negotiated with **Gazprom** and lobbied for both the Nabucco and Trans Adriatic pipelines that would bypass Ukraine. He also was involved in the EU mediation that had Gazprom turn gas back on in Ukraine after Russia and Ukraine had  pricing conflicts. **Carter Page** teamed up with a Gazprom exec at his company Global Energy Capital (163). 

It’s almost as if each attendant hand-selected their own agents to support their interests while infiltrating Trump’s campaign.

**Giuliani brings along Emin Agalarov**

On May 29, 2013, four months after Giuliani met with Emin Agalarov, Emin posted a music video starring himself and Miss Universe 2012 Olivia Culpo (49).

Two weeks later, on June 15th, 2013, Rob Goldstone, Emin’s publicist, hangs out with Trump (61) the night Trump is alleged to have visited a Vegas night club known for an act of simulated urination (62). The next day during the Miss America 2013 contest, Trump announces Miss Universe 2013 will be held in Moscow (63). Trump, Emin, Goldstone, Yulya Alferova, Artem Klyushin, and Michael Cohen all hang out for dinner later that evening (64). 

The whole crew hung out again during the Miss Universe Moscow 2013 (66)  . 

Three years later Emin and Goldstone would attend the infamous meeting at Trump Tower with Paul Manafort, Don Jr., Jared Kushner, Natalia Veselnitskaya, Ike Kaveladze, and suspected hacker Rinat Akhmetshin where Emin and Goldstone promised Don Jr. documents that would incriminate Hillary Clinton (65). 

**Trump uses Miss Universe competition to garner favor**

Trump signing the Trump Tower Moscow deal at Miss Universe Moscow 2013 isn’t the first time Trump used his Miss Universe contest to garner favor.

In 2002, Oxana Federova, who had no busy winning, acquired the crown for Miss Universe. Four months later she became to first Miss Universe to be dethroned (138). Turns out Federova was Putin’s girlfriend (139) and who was kept under watchful eye by Russian tycoon Vladimir Golubov (140). There are claims Trump rigged the competition in Putin’s favor (148). 

**Felix Sater joins Team Trump**

In 2003, just months after Trump allegedly rigged the Miss Universe 2002 competion, Bayrock Group moves into Trump Tower and hired the son of Russian mob “boss of bosses"" Semyon Mogilevich’s underboss, Felix Sater (141)(142), who would go on to manage the scandal-ridden Trump Tower SoHo (143) (144) (145). Felix, with his own colorful past - assault and penny stock fraud (146)- is currently cooperating with the Mueller investigation (147). The owner of Bayrock, Tevfik Arif, was also caught in shady behavior, being caught on a yacht with underage prostitutes (149). 

In 2006, during Ivanka and Don Jr. trip to Moscow, Felix Sater arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putin’s chair at the Kremlin (150).

Sater would later email Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, that “Our boy [Trump] cam become president of the USA and we can egineer it.” He later states, “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected” (151).

This strongly echoes KT McFarland’s email to a friend in December 2016 stating it was Russia “which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him [Trump]” (152)

Sater eventually got caught up passing a secret Ukrainian peace plan from Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii V. Artemenko to Michael Cohen that eventually landed on Flynn’s desk, though he was fired before he could receive it (153). 

**Roger Stone joins Team Trump**

Roger Stone was introduced to Donald Trump through Trump’s lawyer in the 80‘s, Roy Cohn (32). 

As early as 1989, Stone was trying to persuade Trump to run for president (33).

After being Trump’s presidential campaign manager in 2000 (31), Stone again joined Trump’s presidential ambition in 2011 (34 @0.03), around the time Steve Bannon and David Bossie were talking to Trump about a potential run for the presidency (35). Stone and his sidekick, Sam Nunberg, would be fired from Trump’s campaign in 2015, though Stone stayed an active advisor.

Stone would directly message GRU agent Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks’ Julian Assange (136), even meeting him in London (137). Stone new of the Podesta hack and tweeted “it will soon be Podesta’s time in the barrel,” before knowledge of Podesta’s email hack was made public (136). 

**Paul Manafort joins Team Trump**

In 2004, Paul Manafort starting working alongside Dmytro Firtash and the Party of Regions in support of Russia-friendly Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine.

In 2006 Manafort’s business partner in Ukraine, Rick Davis of Davis and Manafort, managed to arrange a meeting between John McCain and Russian Oligarch Oleg Deripaska in Davos . Soon after, John McCain would start preaching a stance n Montenegro favored by the Russians and later that same year on a yacht off the coast of Montenegro, Oleg Deripaska would host McCain’s 70‘th birthday bash. In 2008, Davis became McCain’s campaign manager during his run for the presidency while Manafort attempted to join the campaign as well, though was forced out by others working in the campaign (27).

That same year, in 2006, Manafort purchased an apartment at Trump Tower (24). Paul Manafort is currently indicted by Mueller for money laundering (25) and Trump properties are known to be money laundromats (26). 

Soon enough, the two begin plotting away (36).

87c0mt,1,2018-03-26,Feeling forced to make a decision about my career... don't know how to proceed :(,tatoomonkee64,u_tatoomonkee64,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tatoomonkee64/comments/87c0mt/feeling_forced_to_make_a_decision_about_my_career/,"Recently, I got an internship at this great company, and I definitely know it'll be a great way to really get into my dream field. The hours are crazy, though, so, apart from classes since I'm in college, I really have to build my schedule around it. It's quite a lot of getting hands on.

I also never expected to get it, so I kept my part time job as a tutor. I don't get paid a whole lot ($30-40 for two weeks is the usual, sometimes, if my tutees really need help, they see me more and I can make about $80-100 for two weeks' time), but it feels nice to help other students out. I'm also one of the only tutors available for really difficult subjects like Philosophy, so the few people I get really rely ony me. The students are athletes, so I also have to build my schedule around their games and practices.

The schedules have clashed intensely, and I've worked really hard to resolve them, but it's a lot of pressure on me, and I feel bad constantly having to ask of both sides like this, especially with the tutoring job which I know will be more lenient than my internship. I also recently got accepted to this awesome advertising mentoring program, and since it's an 8 week program, I know it's going to clash me to death.

I know I need to go to that class and do my internship. I'm graduating soon and need to get myself ready for the real world and my dream career goals.

But I also feel bad dropping my tutoring job, being I'm a ""rare subject"" tutor, that I feel bad ""abandoning"" the center and the athletes, and the fact I've grown to have a personal connection with some of them.

Then again, they might not care as much as I do. But it still bites at me inside.

I'm still in college, so it's probably not the biggest heart wrencher in the world, but I feel wedged between a rock and a hard place.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
87cfrp,76,2018-03-26,The penguin chronicles part one: Mr. Horse and his weird way of flirting,Antisocial_Element,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/87cfrp/the_penguin_chronicles_part_one_mr_horse_and_his/,"So.... hello there. I didn't originally plan to post this story, since the guy didn't seem THAT beardy to me, but here it is anyway. Since this story ""started"" a while ago and is still going on to this day, I'll split it up into more than one part and update it as soon as something interesting happens.

So, I (let's call myself penguin in this story, since they are my favourite animals) met this guy (let's call him Mr. Horse) during an internship at a company selling horse gear over a year ago. The store was located in a different town that the one I live in, so I stayed at a relatives house near the shop during that time.
 Mr. horse was the son of the shops owner and used to hang out in the shop after school. He was two years younger than me, making him 15 at the time, quite tall, blonde, and the living cliche of a european fuckboy, wearing an oversized shirt, red adidas shoes and a snapback to small for his head all the time. His hygiene was also quite decent. He didn't look like a neckbeard at all...

...Because of boredom, I started talking to him. He seemed actually quite nice. He took me on a tour through the city one day and invited me over to his place afterwards. I declined his offer, since I had a boyfriend and didn't really want to visit any other guys, but he didnt give up and tried to get me to come to his place almost every day from now on. 
On the last day of my internship, he asked for my phone number. Since I had nothing to fear, I gave it to him. I was kinda expecting him to spam me with texts every day, but I never heard anything from him for months and kinda forgot about him.

on the 12th of january 2018 he texted me. 
It took me a minute to remember who he was since he only wrote ""hey"". Well, he contacted me again because he developed a sudden interest in art and for some reason remembered that i was into art as well, so he asked me if I wanted to join a group chat he made. The idea of the group chat was for artists to share their work with other artists and getting constructive criticism.
Sounded like fun to me, so I said yes. The people in the group where mostly beginners. I dont want brag about it, but i and this one girl (let's call her eagle since she mostly draws predatory birds. She'll play a bigger part later on.) where the artists with the highest skill level in the group. We where also the only ones giving proper criticism, but most other people couldn't really handle the fact that their art wasn't really good and either ignored our criticism or insulted us, so we left the group.
Since then, Mr. Horse started sending me his - not that good - art privately. He also ignored criticism or used stuff like ""It's just my style"" as an excuse for poor anatomy. (I still haven't given up and criticise every piece he sends me since I am lowkey trolling him at this point. He still hasnt improved though.)

Shit got creepy after a week or so. He simply texted me ""I like you"". I was confused and simply replied with ""Okay"". Since then, he always texted me whenever I changed my profile pic on any social media or posted something he didn't like. For real tho, he texted me to ""better take this photo down, since it might attract weirdos"" because i posted a photo of me and my boyfriend (let's call him shark, because of his strong resemblence with a goblin shark) on holiday. 

Whenever I wouldn't reply to his messages immediately after he sent them to me or refused to answer his really private questions (e.g. what are you wearing today?), he called me a ""naughty girl"" or ""bad penguin"". Tbh, I thought that his behaviour was hilarious so I didn't block him.
I told shark about the situation and also texted eagle about it and they found it to be as funny as i did.

I never sent mr. Horse any photos of me, but he sends me selfies of him almost every day, complaining to me about how ugly he is and that no girl liked him. He asked me for my honest opinion on his appearance, so I gave him my honest opinion.

I thought that he was ugly.

I also told him that other girls definitly wont think so, since... let's say, a lot german girls seem to be really into his style of clothing and his more ""child-like"" appaerence. I'm just not into guys like him, I prefer more masculine men. 
He didn't respond to my text for a while, but a few days later he suddenly asked me if me and shark where still together. 

Yes, we were. This didn't stop him from getting really creepy tho. 

He started giving me compliments out of nowhere, for my looks, my drawing skills, man he even compliments my style of texting. He  constantly tried to give me nick names like ""Baby"", ""Sweetheart"" or even ""Fluffy"". One day, he asked me if I could twerk for him. 
Shark and I where literally laughing out loud whenever he texted me, the whole situation was just laughable...

Whenever I responded to him, i always used very short answers, like a straight ""Yes"" or ""no"". Sometimes i also said ""okay then"" or told him to stop whatever he was doing.

About a week ago he randomly told me about his fetishes. apparently, he is into girls farting into his face and girls wearing those weird rubber horse masks during sex and asked me to send him a fucking sex tape or ""more photos of me in my horse mask"".

Yup, I own a horse mask. And he openly admitted that he fapped to a fucking photo of me wearing it on halloween that I had posted on facebook.

This is what made me block him on every social media account, but oh boy i wouldn't be the last time that I had to deal with him..."

Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid."

I work harder than anyone knows, I do so well in university too. Not once has anyone acknowledged that, asked about it, or even cared about it. Infact my parents treat me like I have all the time in the world. No mom, It ISN'T easy studying to be an electrical engineer, I'm NOT ""just sitting around on my laptop"" I'm WORKING. I never needed anyone to acknowledge it, because I always knew I was doing it for myself, which I am. But what happens when I can't prove that to anyone including myself at any point? I work this hard, but what do I have to show for it? I have been applying for internships since October. October. And got a whopping total of 0 interviews. I feel so worthless. I don't even have anyone to tell about it. And it just makes me worse at everything. Makes me want to quit everything. I don't like to cry and complain but I felt like I deserved it. On top of that I have nobody. My ""friends"" don't wanna hear it, my parents I would never even consider talking to, and my girlfriend just makes it a chore to talk to her about any single problem. I don't think I wanted that much this year. Now I have to spend four months of my life waking up every day feeling like I'm not accomplishing anything, while everyone around me is. I deserved something. I can't keep feeling I'll get some sort of retribution or reward for everything I do, for everything I've put up with. That's all I had, thinking I'll get something for it. But I haven't, and I give up."

I also have an internship coming up this summer (2018) at LinkedIn in the bay area in a machine learning team. It's likely that I can get a return offer from LinkedIn (and that's my original plan before I got the offer from Amazon). I'm graduating in summer 2019. Should I accept this Amazon offer now? Some pros and cons I can think of now:

pros: 
1. Alexa machine learning seems interesting
2. I don't have to interview anymore for full time positions this fall (2018)

cons:
1. not sure if I want to relocate to Boston/Cambridge
2. This is the only offer now and I don't have any leverage to negotiate the compensations for this offer
3. there are some negative views on the work culture of Amazon out there
4. the compensation is not super impressive for a me and I see that LinkedIn has pretty much the same base salary as Amazon and LinkedIn has free food and a better culture (maybe?)

Any suggestions or comments? 

Also, is it possible to be considered for another team in the same org (Alexa) in the Seattle office? How to do that? I think they are hiring by team for the position I'm applying.

Thanks!"

87elu9,1,2018-03-26,The Importance of Immigration Lawyers: On a quest to enact change,imlaw07,immigrationlaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigrationlaw/comments/87elu9/the_importance_of_immigration_lawyers_on_a_quest/,"This post was a response to a prompt from the Immigration Law Office of Ronen Kurzfeld. To find more about the work immigration lawyers do, find out here: http://www.immigrationway.com

A few years ago, I was paid one of the best compliments I’ve ever received. A friend of mine told me “Wow you’d be a great immigration lawyer – you’d fight tooth and nail to stop someone from being deported!” His comment was partially tongue and cheek, since it was intended to be a jab at my argumentative and stubborn nature. Nonetheless, I took the compliment to heart. Indeed, that comment has been hanging over my head ever since I became interested in law.

But as an indecisive, self-consumed second year-undergrad (as undergrads are prone to be), I came to an impasse. A mid-undergraduate crisis, if you will. As much as I wanted to pursue law school, I also wanted to pursue medical school. And graduate school. And possibly every other interesting career with which I had crossed paths in the past two years. So, to quell feelings of anxiety and frustration, I made myself a promise. I would pursue whatever career afforded me the opportunity to enact the greatest change. And thus, I embarked on my quest to find the career which would help me make the biggest impact on people’s lives. Unsurprisingly, my first stop was immigration law.

I was fortunate to be accepted as an intern at a local immigration and refugee law firm. On my first day, I had the privilege to sit in on a client meeting with a young couple and their three-year old daughter, *Amira. It was clear Amira was feisty and mature beyond her years, but luckily, she was distracted by the TV show on her laptop. Otherwise, she might not have had the patience for the ensuing two-hour meeting. The lawyer I was working with, *Sarah, and the young couple, began discussing the nuances of the legal process for an immigration claim. Admittedly, some of the legal jargon went over my head. But, I was able to discern some salient information. Firstly, Sarah took painstaking efforts to listen to the young couple’s story; all of her questions were thoughtful and considerate. Through this questioning, Sarah teased out the important details of the couple’s story. It was clear she had done this before. Later, Sarah told me that she was responsible for synthesizing this information to craft a coherent narrative for the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB). The latter was known for its demanding and impatient “members of schedule” (individuals who adjudicate immigration claims): they only wanted to hear relevant details, anything else was summarily dismissed. Without an immigration lawyer, it would be impossible to discern the fickle nature of the IRB, thus drastically decreasing the changes of a successful claim. Aside from the more substantive benefits of having an immigration lawyer, I quickly realized there were key emotional benefits as well. Throughout the meeting, I observed a transformation of sorts. Certainty and confidence began to dawn on the young couple’s faces; soon, all signs of confusion and anxiety were wiped away. These feelings were evidenced by the wife’s comment to her husband in response to being told that if one partner wanted to hide something from the other partner, they would both be legally forced to find new lawyers; “well if there’s anything you’re hiding from me, you better tell me now – I like Sarah too much!” Everyone erupted in laughter, but it was clear that her comment was genuine.

Later that day, I was given the option to go down to the IRB to reschedule a hearing on behalf of one of the other lawyers who was sick. I jumped at the opportunity. The hearing was quite quick; I acted as a liaison between the client, his interpreter, and the member of schedule to reschedule the hearing. However, even though I played a small role, the client showed similar feelings of gratitude. Although he did not speak a word of English, he came up to me afterwards with a smile that reached from ear to ear and bowed in thanks. Later, I was informed by his lawyer that the client and the member of schedule already knew the hearing was to be rescheduled, but clients always appreciate if someone, even a measly undergraduate intern, would be there to help them through the process.

In the weeks since this happened, I’ve learned a few other valuable lessons. Firstly, the IRB is administratively overburdened; the extent of which is frankly, quite scary. This condition often results in an inconsistent treatment of immigration claims. Additionally, the claim’s success can be contingent on the member of schedule: some may be accommodating and lenient, while others can be stringent and inconsiderate. Thus, claims may be dismissed on an arbitrary basis. I was incredibly surprised to learn of the political complexities of the IRB; without a lawyer who knows the politics of this process, it is hard to achieve a successful claim. Moreover, members of schedule may have very specific questions; an inconsistency or inability to answer these questions may result in dismissal. But with a lawyer by the client’s side, these misunderstandings can be resolved: lawyers act as skillful liaisons between the IRB and clients. Lastly, immigration lawyers act as advocates and emotional support systems: it’s difficult to chart the waters of the immigration process; it may be an enormous relief to rely on an authority figure who is there to defend you.

I am more than excited to continue working in immigration and refugee law: it is a perfect blend of challenging and rewarding. But perhaps more saliently, I believe I have found a field in which I can enact change. Now, I see immigration lawyers as captains on a ship: they can help you navigate choppy waters because they know the best path to take which avoids all rocks and rapids. The importance of having immigration lawyers may not be discernable to the unobservant eye, but I promise you, immigration lawyers are the bastions of justice, the beacons of hope in an increasingly hostile political climate.

Despite all of this, my self-esteem and self-confidence remains low. Why? Because of how they treated me (and sometimes still do) growing up.

I told him its because I do not have much time on my hands like I did in college, and also because of his criticisms about me (about my weight mostly). Granted, yes I've made some immature decisions in my life. Although, not anything dangerous or illegal. For example, during my sophomore year in college right after finals, I rode my bike to a nearby river and actually went into the river because of how bad things were. My mom found me the next day with soaking wet clothes. The only reason she found me is because she saw a note on my dorm room door, which I wrote. Had a cold chest, but not enough to be hospitalized. I was deeply depressed because of how bad my grades were at the time. Granted, I could have handled this more maturely. My parents furiously confronted me about my ""stunt"". Another time was when I bought unprescribed pills (as in not approved by the FDA) in an attempt to increase my processing power and therefore boost my academic performance. It worked wonders and my GPA went from 2.7 after 3 semesters to nearly 3.5/3.6 at graduation. Understandibly, they were concerned about my safety and health. However, the reason why I don't really contact my parents is because I don't really feel comfortable around them. Like sometimes, my dad would be in a bad mood and take his stress out on me, and would be patronizing at times, especially as I was close to leaving the nest. My relationship with my parents deteriorated severely despite doing well in school, and earning and completing internships. I mean seriously?! For what?! My parents made me come with them on a family trip, which I absolutely hated because my dad spent the whole trip criticizing my brothers and I and lecturing us about the importance of school, and how grateful we should be (at almost 23 years old mind you with good grades and internships lined up and one completed). After I got hired for one of my internships, my dad groaned about the fact that I would not be able to go on the trip instead of congratulating me like any father would. I literally avoided spending time with him or contacting him after that. Its pretty depressing for a 23 year old to feel like they're walking on eggshells around their father. There are more incidents, but for this post I'll keep it short. When I was a teenager, my dad would sometimes yell at us, but he stopped as I got to around 16. When I was 12, he yelled at me for being lazy. Though, I am actually quite grateful for that one. A few months later he made me sleep in the garage for the night after I mouthed off to my mother in an argument. In fairness, I've had many good times with my father. We both share alot of good memories and joke with each other ever so often. However, I've also had memories whereby I've felt patronized, criticized, and walked on eggshells around him. Even when I left home, became a professional, and started a career, their attitude continued. Always criticizing me, correcting me, questioning me telling me what I did or said was wrong. I just want my parents to be proud of me, or at least see me as an adult and take me more seriously. I mean they do, but not at the level that I would want. I mean I have no criminal record, except for a single speeding ticket, and a professional license (CPA if anyone is interested). I understand how hard my fathers childhood was and that he went to bed hungry every night and that his father would sometimes abuse him, his siblings, and mother (my grandma) but it at times seemed as though he would take out his frustrations out on me.I am depressed about it to the point that I sometimes self medicate with food.

I guess I'll repost this story till I get some answers. Basically if I talk to someone I begin to pick up their Vibes over the phone. This intern begins to manifest in strange occurrences around me.

Let's say you have good energy, and we have a conversation. I will begin to feel a warm and positivity around me and positive things happen.

I have a close friend of mine who is on medication and suffers from a mental disorder. It's very hard to talk to this person because as soon as we begin talking on the phone I begin to pick up their vibes. This translates into a bunch of strange things happening around me, people becoming irritable, rude, and hostile

On one hand I have a heart to help this person and give them Council and try to help them with their life on the other hand it's very difficult to absorb their energy through the phone. I have some real life stories but I'm not even going to go there right now.

I don't know what to do at this point my only other answer is just to not contact this person anymore. But my only answer for them as they have to raise up their own spiritual awareness and level. It really does take a toll on me. Who would have thought that a simple phone conversation can take such a huge toll on someone.

Mark my words, psychoactive medication covers up major symptoms, I'm talking crazy symptoms that the person on the medication doesn't even feel. Their spirit can be crying "" death to all"" and they wouldn't even flinch. That's the kind of craziness I have to deal with .

Its tough."

Heya! I have had a rather kinky idea that I've wanted to play out for a while. I was hoping you would play someone with a huge cock and you would evetually have all of the girls at Rooster Teeth as your pets! 

This could start out a few ways. You could be one of their cousins/nephews, you could be a new intern, you could be someone who's parent might invest a lot of money into RT, or you could come up with a new idea!

If you don't recognize the name Rooster Teeth, you may recognize some of the names of the girls: Barbara Dunkleman, Ashley Jenkins, Meg Turney, Mica Burton, Mariel Salcedo, Ellie Main, and more names that I don't feel like listing! We can start with just about anyone, depending on the scene. 

In case you couldn't tell, I am very submissive! My only real limits are toilet play, blood, and too much pain. But I have a ton of kinks! Rough sex, public teasing, clothed sex, discreet sex, impregnation, huge cocks, perverts, groping, and cheating are my main ones, but I am definitely open to more! And, of course, we don't have to do these kinks. 

I think that's all I actually have to say, so please make your title stand out so I can tell it apart? Add a color to it please. I can't wait to hear from all of you!"

I was offered a 5-month internship with ING Bank this morning! My problem right now is finding a place from April 30 to September 30. I've recently become acutely aware of the housing situation, and I'm looking for anywhere to stay (within reasonable prices). 

About me: MBA student from Toronto.

I've noticed a few websites like DUWO. I've also seen how much the student hotel is asking for and it's ridiculous. Is it possible to find students subletting their places out during the summer? Does anyone know of a good place? 

I would greatly appreciate your help, I can thank you with maple syrup and buying you a beer when I arrive.

Thank you,

87fmu5,1,2018-03-27,Salary for Engineer,TruShanez,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/87fmu5/salary_for_engineer/,"So I currently am an Mechanical Engineer working in Orange County California and I feel like I am severely getting shafted by my employer. I currently have 3 years of experience with a degree and about another 3.5 years of internship experience which was very hands on doing calculations, design and build in a small specialty renewable energy company. I am currently doing new product development/R&amp;D in a manufacturing company. We recently got raises at our company by it was a measly 1%, barely bumping me up to $69k. The small percentage of raise was based on our sales team not meeting the desired target amount for the year. I talked to my boss about this and told him I don't feel that it is right that the raise is so small due to the fact that my performance(according to him) has been excellent and my job does not impact sales. I told my boss also that I feel I am underpaid per industry standard, but he said there was nothing he can do. This situation has been really frustrating to me as I know engineers at my company with less experience are making more than myself.

Am I right to feel this way?  I feel like with  my experience, I should be making about 10-15% more. I am guessing it should be time to start looking for another place of employment."

I wanted a degree that would give me a lot of job options because I wanted to live in different parts of the country. I figured a BS in computer science and an internship would be enough to get that.

But 3 months after graduation with 2 interviews and no job offers made me realize that I was an idiot. I was told the job market for STEM majors and computer science majors would be a lot better. But at this point, things have gotten to the point where, professionally, I would have been a lot better off just not going to college at all. Would have saved me a lot of time and money for similar job prospects. I'm pretty close to giving up, and I know people have been on the job search for much longer than 3 months, but it's very clear that I have no place in the computing industry. 

I have no clue what I'm supposed to be doing. Instead of applying for software engineering jobs I think I'll just look for bartending jobs instead. What does the world want from me?"

87g9b2,1,2018-03-27,I don't know what to make of this.,Mimsayy,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/87g9b2/i_dont_know_what_to_make_of_this/,"For years, I've dealt with abuse with my father (mental, emotional, and physical). My mother was the only parent who I felt loved me and was the one I always ran to. I even considered my mother to be my best friend - hell, we planned to get matching tattoos. It wasn't until recently that my mother started acting very hostile towards me. She started saying that I was a lousy, good-for-nothing daughter, and that she was way too embarrassed to talk about me with her coworkers because of the accomplishments I never made and continues to compared me her coworkers children.
I was completely blind sided by her behavior because she always told me she loved me. Now she tells me how I was a mistake and that she wishes that she got an abortion (I already knew I was an unplanned child but she never threw it in my face the way she did).
I'm supposed to be moving in a couple of months to finish school and this would be the second time living out of home but for more than one semester (I lived out of state for 5 months for an internship). I feel like she could be acting out on feelings of resentment because I chose now to live out on my own before my brother (27, graduated, works in dentistry, whereas I am 23 and still in school for nursing).
I was also always compared to my brother constantly because he was the ""golden child."" Always listened to my parents, never had a job while he was in school, never had a relationship until after he graduated college, and never tried leaving home. I was the complete opposite. But then again, I feel like when you feel like you're being given the crappy end of the stick in terms of how your family treats you, you'd do anything to get out. I also wanted to be independent because I hated the idea of having to ask my parents for money if I wanted to spend it on myself or if they were to buy me something, they would be able to hold it over my head.
At this point, I don't know what to do. I didn't think my mother would also hop on the ""let's treat Mimsayy like crap for no reason"" train. I love my parents despite everything. A lot of my friends and my boyfriend think that I need to drop them, don't wait till my lease for my apartment comes, and leave. It's easier said than done. In my mind, they're still my family. But home doesn't feel like home anymore. It hasn't for a long time. "

I know math is important for both CS and Geo, you can't escape it. At 23, I'm steadily working towards transferring from a community college to a Cal State in CS (and minor in geology). I live with my parents due to sky high housing, despite my $14/hr internship (classes mean I work 10/hrs a week average), and they are growing impatient/anxious/whatever (I've been in comm college 4.5 years due to math, but am very close to done due to studying right). They want me to switch to something like business (boring...also a pun) or comp info systems (a transfer my college and the target Cal State are without, it sits firmly under BUSINESS ADMIN). I've heard/read bad things about business degrees, but then again my knowledge of business is retail and how Hollywood paints it (sad, dull, full of idiots and people and 24/7 ass kissing, no creativity, etc).

I've had a love of science, mostly geology, from a young age. I've done enough research to not be convinced of the job stability of a geology BS alone. The professors and their classes at my college have strengthened my interest, but I'm not sure I can be a researcher and/or teacher. I'm set on minoring in geology/ESC Sci and majoring in Comp Sci. 

With the power of computer sci, how possible is it to study or work in geology or related fields? I'd prefer to study Earthquakes (because they terrify and wow me as a native Californian), but I'm bad at picking favorites in geology. I guess the dreaded business COULD work with geology, but my guess is ""haha no"".  "

I’m 22 years old, female, 176cm tall (5’9”), 106 kg (234 lbs , 16.7 stones) 
I had hairline fractures on both my ankles and had a cast 3 times on different feet over the course of the last 5 years. The last one was pretty bad and it’s been one and a half years from the injury and I’ve regained mobility and started walking normally again. But any stretches to my muscles beyond walking range is quite painful.( like standing on toes, tried pilates but getting my legs to a 90 degree angle for example hurts my hamstrings and my muscles around my ankle and I actually get numbness to my little toes..) I tried running but since I’m so heavy the impact my foot makes with the ground hurts my ankle so I can’t sustain it for long.
I can walk about 10 mile range before it properly starts o hurt for me to stop. Usually don’t have the time to walk that much so this only happens on a free Saturday. Daily, I walk for 40 minutes to get to work(internship) and 40 minutes to get back. I also live on the 5th floor and take the stairs. But it’s not enough...
I have high cholesterol and cardio feels like I’m gonna die and I start wheezing and coughing and have trouble breathing. 
I had binge eating and it’s mostly under control but sometimes I relapse. But now I’ve started on Keto. I’m pretty much in control of what I’m eating and am doing quite well. I’ve lost 15 pounds in two months on Keto alone with no exercise whatsoever. 
And I’m a senior so close to getting their BA diploma, but with all the internships and thesis stuff I’m pretty busy and don’t get to sleep often. I feel so tired throughout the day that exercising feels like such a hassle.
I used to play volleyball for like 8 years and even though I have so much fat over it, I still have a good muscle definition underneath. 
I really wanna dedicate an hour everyday to exercising but don’t know which ones I should start with. (I really hate the gym though)
I’m graduating in like 3 months and would like to start a new chapter of my life better than who I am now. And I really want to have a routine in my life and be happy when I exercise, I’m looking forward to the ‘refreshed’ feeling fit people always talk about, the feeling that I vaguely remember during those years of double training for three hours every day of the week. 
Any suggestions would be helpful.

Italy Elections: Populism and Right-Wing Reaction

Down With the European Union!

MILANO—The results of the Italian elections on March 4 introduced a new riddle for the Italian bourgeoisie and the Euro-imperialists. The result was a hung parliament dominated by forces that are not part of the mainstream bourgeois establishment and that have at times opposed the European Union (EU), although in their bid for government they made it quite clear that they are willing to support the EU.

Disgruntled over a decade of immiseration and austerity, working-class and petty-bourgeois voters ditched the main bourgeois parties—the Partito democratico (PD) and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia—to massively support bourgeois-populist formations posing as defenders of the “little man”: the far-right, racist Lega (formerly Lega Nord—Northern League) and the nationalist Five Star Movement (M5S). Both of the latter two parties advanced a chauvinist agenda of “Italians first.”

While the PD promised to continue austerity policies, the Lega trumpeted demands for a 15 percent “flat tax” benefiting entrepreneurs in the North and a lowering of the retirement age. The M5S got support based on its tirades against corruption and its proposal for a minimum monthly income, which would require recipients to accept jobs proposed by the state and would exclude anyone who is not an Italian or EU citizen. The minimum income scheme was particularly popular in the impoverished South. The M5S emerged as the leading party in parliament, gathering almost 36 percent of the seats and sweeping Southern regions with 40 to 60 percent of the vote. The Lega, which dropped its historic “Northern” label to appeal to right-wing voters throughout Italy, got 19 percent, scoring over 30 percent of the vote in the Venezia region and in the hinterland of Milano.

The success of the Lega and M5S is a sinister development for the working class, as both parties promote anti-immigrant racism, anti-unionism and chauvinism. But class-conscious workers must shed no tears over the collapse of the PD, which got less than 19 percent of the vote. The PD, which had been at the core of ruling coalitions since 2011, was formed in 2007 through the fusion of social-democratic remnants of the old Communist Party with elements from the Christian Democracy and other bourgeois politicians. Since its inception, it has been capitalist in its social composition and program.

No coalition got a decisive majority, and at the moment it is unclear what will emerge from the parliamentary cattle market. The only certain thing is that whatever government is formed will benefit the capitalist class, the enemy of the workers and all the oppressed. The Lega trotskista d’Italia (Ltd’I) issued a leaflet opposing a vote for any of the parties standing for election, including those left slates running against the PD, Lega and M5S, none of which represented even a deformed expression of working-class independence.

There is a burning need for a revolutionary party to lead the working masses in repelling capitalist attacks and opening the road to a socialist future. The Ltd’I fights to build a revolutionary party of the multiethnic proletariat—a section of a reforged Fourth International—on a program for workers power in Italy and internationally.

Right-Wing Populist Backlash Against Austerity

The Lega and M5S fomented anti-immigrant racism in order to channel discontent over poverty and unemployment into hatred directed against the most vulnerable section of the population and away from the capitalists and their government. The Lega called for “defense of the white race” and for a “halt” to the alleged “invasion” of refugees. (Berlusconi promised to deport 600,000 “clandestines” accused of making a living off crime.) The M5S is also racist, nationalist and anti-working-class. Just like Lega chief Matteo Salvini, M5S guru Beppe Grillo rants about “closing Roma [Gypsy] camps” and “repatriating all irregular immigrants immediately.”

In Italy as in other European countries, the rise of the right is the product of the “left-wing” reformist and liberal governments that have administered the EU’s murderous austerity. While the PD claims to have created a million jobs, these were overwhelmingly part-time and other forms of precarious employment. PD governments presided over the devastation of the country’s industrial output, which in 2015 was 31 percent below the level right before the 2008 economic crisis. Bankrupt banks, dismantled airlines, jobs in industry wiped out: this is the political legacy of the PD. The PD dealt a blow to previous conquests of the workers movement, symbolized by Labor Law Article 18, which protected workers in larger companies from individual firings. Destroying these protections, in 2014-15 the “Jobs Act” introduced conditions of unbridled exploitation. This was extended to students who are now forced to work as unpaid interns. PD-led governments pushed the retirement age to almost 70, so that many workers die before they retire or shortly thereafter.

It was the acquiescence of the trade-union bureaucrats that let these governments continue their anti-worker austerity policy: all the attacks were allowed to go ahead without even the usual symbolic strikes. For the unions to be revived, we need hard class struggle based on the understanding that the interests of the workers are counterposed to those of their bosses. We need a new leadership of the trade unions, built in the course of the struggle for a multiethnic revolutionary workers party.

Full Citizenship Rights for All Immigrants!

PD-led governments have been responsible for the deaths of thousands of immigrants with their policy of repatriation at sea, detention camps and military missions in Libya and Niger. All these actions are aimed at blocking desperate people from fleeing imperialist devastation. The PD has maintained the Bossi-Fini law, which binds residency visas to employment contracts, and racist laws based on the “ius sanguinis,” which deny citizenship to the 800,000 young people born in Italy to parents who are not citizens.

The bosses use racism against immigrants to divide and rule their wage slaves. But immigrants are not only victims. They are a vital part of the Italian working class and its unions, often bringing with them a clearer understanding of imperialist looting in the neocolonial world. Indeed, the few union victories over the last ten years have almost all been won by immigrant workers, especially in the logistics sector, through hard struggle against the bosses, the police and even the trade-union bureaucracies that sabotaged those efforts.

Anyone who arrives in this country should have full citizenship rights! The trade unions must oppose deportations and racist segregation of refugees in detention centers, where they are treated like animals. The labor movement must organize large-scale unionization of all unorganized workers, from the cooperatives in the North to tomato fields in the South! Italian troops out of Libya and Niger!

Encouraged by the growth of the main right-wing parties, fascist organizations such as CasaPound and Forza Nuova have carried out numerous beatings and provocations against immigrants and left-wing militants. These culminated in a terrorist attack in the city of Macerata, where eight people were injured by a former Lega candidate who drove around shooting at black people on sight, giving a fascist salute and waving the national flag when he was caught.

The fascists’ ultimate objective is the destruction of the organizations of the workers movement—from the trade unions to the left—and racial genocide. In many towns, anti-fascist youth have tried to stop Forza Nuova and CasaPound, clashing with a sea of cops deployed by the PD government. The anti-fascists have been denounced by the bourgeois press, arrested and indicted. We defend them against state repression and demand their immediate release. But the task at hand is the mobilization of the working class, which has the social power to stop the fascists based on its numbers and collective organization.

The reformist left preaches confidence in the police and the judges to dissolve fascist organizations. The truth is that the police and the fascists work for the same masters—the ruling capitalist class. We are against any measure reinforcing the powers of the state: even laws allegedly against fascists have been and will ultimately be used against the workers and the oppressed.

Bourgeois Populism vs. Proletarian Internationalism

Throughout Europe, the ravages of the economic crisis and EU diktats have led to appeals to “the people” to rally around the interests of the nation, that is, those of the capitalist ruling class. Bourgeois populism is not inherently leftist: appeals to “the people” are characteristic of reactionaries, from Donald Trump in the U.S. and the Lega in Italy to outright fascists. In an attempt to compete with right-wing populists, there has been a proliferation of “left-wing” populism, including Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain and Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise. These are all bourgeois organizations, having no organic link to the working class and wedded to imperialist institutions like the EU.

The new Italian attempt at left-wing bourgeois populism is “Potere al Popolo” (PaP—Power to the People), a conglomerate of reformist groups and bourgeois politicians centered around Rifondazione comunista and the “Je so Pazzo” social center in Naples. PaP was set up in explicit opposition to a proletarian class perspective. As its spokesperson Viola Carofalo explained: “The word ‘people’ evokes the less well-to-do classes, people who are not normally considered in decisions about their lives. And when somebody comes here, he does not feel repelled by the word ‘people,’ which is instead what would happen if we used the word ‘proletariat’” (Internazionale, 18 January).

Reformist groups that in the past identified themselves (hypocritically) with communism, like Rifondazione comunista, the Stalinist Rete dei comunisti and others, have thrown away the red flag to jump on PaP’s bandwagon. Contrary to the myth that social change will be carried out by “the people,” Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote in the Communist Manifesto (1848):

“Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class.... The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance they are revolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat...they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.”

The battle to overthrow capitalism is a battle not between the “people” and the “elite” but between the two fundamental, antagonistic classes under capitalism: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The proletariat must seek to win oppressed layers of the petty bourgeoisie to its side. But it can do so only by fighting for a revolutionary solution to capitalist crisis, by showing that only with the working class in power and the expropriation of the bourgeoisie can the oppression of the masses end.

Many ostensible Trotskyists have tailed bourgeois populism during and after the elections. The Italian affiliate of the “United Secretariat of the Fourth International” gave their full support to PaP. Other groups, like the Italian section of the International Marxist Tendency (IMT) and the Partito comunista dei lavoratori, presented their own reformist slate, “Revolutionary Left,” which got less than 0.1 percent of the vote. Having tailed the M5S movement, the IMT proclaimed after the elections that the formation of an M5S government was now “an unavoidable passage” for the people to “test and unmask the cross-class equivocation of the M5S.”

European Union: Imperialist Consortium

International finance and imperialist governments fear that the Italian elections could destabilize the EU, a reactionary bloc designed to increase the European imperialists’ competitiveness against their U.S. and Japanese rivals. The International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) has always opposed the EU and its euro currency, a financial instrument used by German imperialism and, in smaller proportion, the imperialists of Italy and France to plunder and subjugate the economically weaker countries. As the Ltd’I wrote last year in a leaflet distributed at protests against the 60th anniversary of the EU’s predecessor, the European Economic Community:

“The working class must fight for Italy out of the EU and the euro. An Italian exit could precipitate the collapse of the EU. This would be in the interest of all workers and the oppressed and strike a hard blow against the bosses. The end of the EU would not mean the end of international capitalism, or of the exploitation and racism that are intrinsic to this system of production, but it would facilitate workers struggles across Europe and more sharply expose that the main enemy to combat is one’s ‘own’ national exploiter.”

—“Italian Trotskyists Say: Italy Out of the European Union!” (WV No. 1118, 22 September 2017)

Potere al Popolo openly supports the EU. The groups promoting the “Revolutionary Left” also proved their support to the EU in practice by opposing Brexit. So, too, did the U.S.-based Internationalist Group. More recently, its Italian supporters published an eight-page supplement on the elections in which they were not able to even once utter the words “European Union”!

For more than a century, Marxists have explained that the unification of Europe under capitalism is destined either to remain a utopia or to take the form of a reactionary reality. As V.I. Lenin wrote in August 1915:

“Of course, temporary agreements are possible between capitalists and between states. In this sense a United States of Europe is possible as an agreement between the European capitalists…but to what end? Only for the purpose of jointly suppressing socialism in Europe, of jointly protecting colonial booty against Japan and America.”

—V.I. Lenin, “On the Slogan for a United States of Europe”

Only proletarian revolution, with the expropriation of the capitalist ruling classes of the whole continent, can constitute the basis for a true, voluntary Socialist United States of Europe. This is the perspective that the Ltd’I and ICL fight for.

I am 23 years old, going to law college and doing internship.

Let’s get to the situation. I met a girl in late december and since then we talked everyday, almost all day long for over 3 months (not a long time but I’ve never managed to mantain a relationship with someone for more than 2 months). Since the beggining we would meet every single weekend, hang out and make out as any normal couple would do, but we agreed that we weren’t going to have a serious relationship, which may confuse some people.

She was in an abusive relationship before and that was the problem for her getting serious with me, and she isn’t actually over it. I must say that we never had any serious fight or anything, so it was a pretty nice run, I have to admit.
Even though we agreed on not having a serious relationship, the only thing we didn’t actually have was the lable. Everything else was just like any other relationship, I supose.

So let’s get to the actual advice I’m looking for.

Last friday I’ve decided to end the relationship since she wasn’t ready for anything serious and we were already having something she wasn’t ready for. We talked and she agreed on it. I said I’d block her from social media since it makes endings a bit harder, she wasn’t very happy about it but agreed on it.

Yesterday she freaked out because I was sad about the situation and she felt guilty for everything, I went to her place and we ended up sleeping together, I know, big mistake.

The thing is I don’t really want to delete her from my life. I don’t have any resentment over her and we even talked about trying again when she’s ready, but we know we can’t keep seeing each other since it will definitely end up with us continuing doing the same things we’ve been doing.

My question is: how should I deal with this? We still talk daily, play some games together and interact in social media, but I’m afraid this can end up bad for at least one of us.

Obs.: sorry for any mistaked I’ve made, english is not my first language and I’m at class at the moment.

**tl;dr Been together for 3 months, ended up because of different interests but we are still in touch, what should I do?**"

However, the film that got him his long-awaited Oscar, did not have the smoothest of journey to its eventual critical acclaim. Call Me by Your Name, which tells the story of the intense romance between 17 year old Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and his father’s 24 year old research intern, Oliver (Armie Hammer) over the course of a languid Italian summer, took almost a decade to come to fruition. In this decade, Luca Guadagnino, who started out as a location consultant, rose up in ranks to become a co-director (with Ivory) and then, eventually, the director of the film (Erbland, indiewire.com). It can be argued that, even while Ivory is credited as the sole writer, it is the auteuristic vision of Guadagnino that defines the final on-screen version of Call Me by Your Name. In fact, Guadagnino was credited as a co-writer until Ivory took him to arbitration by the Writers Guild of America, who ruled in favour of crediting Ivory as the sole screenwriter of the film (Johnson, pagesix.com). While the conflict seems to have been amicably resolved, with Guadagnino calling the process, ‘customary’, it is interesting to study the changes the influence of both these strong personalities had on the final project (qtd. In Johnson).
Through its ten year journey, the film saw various iterations of its screenplay being made. There are two versions that are widely available on the internet currently- one is the 95-page scrip submitted by James Ivory for shooting, and the other is the 82-page version released by Sony (scriptslug.com; sonyclassics.com). Analysing these two scripts gives us an idea of the changes in the vision of the film that had taken place. According to Ivory, he had submitted the screenplay by 2015 and eventually sold the rights of screenplay to the producers (qted.in Roxborough, hollywoodreporter.com). However, further changes had to be made to create the film within the available budget (Roxborough). It can be assumed that it was at this point that Luca Guadagnino’s vision comes to fore for the film. The significant changes that were made to the initial screenplay can be traced back to the advice that Guadagnino received from the famed filmmaker, Bernardo Bertolucci, telling him to keep the ‘essence’ of the script rather than transfer the script as it is on-screen (‘Call Me by Your Name Guardian TIFF Talks’ 00.47.23-00.47.56).

If you don't recognize the name Rooster Teeth, you may recognize some of the names of the girls: Barbara Dunkleman, Ashley Jenkins, Meg Turney, Mica Burton, Mariel Salcedo, Ellie Main, and more names that I don't feel like listing! We can start with just about anyone, depending on the scene. 

In case you couldn't tell, I am very submissive! My only real limits are toilet play, blood, and too much pain. But I have a ton of kinks! Rough sex, public teasing, clothed sex, discreet sex, impregnation, huge cocks, perverts, groping, and cheating are my main ones, but I am definitely open to more! And, of course, we don't have to do these kinks. 

I think that's all I actually have to say, so please make your title stand out so I can tell it apart? Add a color to it please. I can't wait to hear from all of you!"

I didn't start breaking out until I was half-way through 24. Now at 25 My forehead and temples are covered in bumps, blackheads and lots lots of dark spots. Also my shoulders and chest also get an amount of breakouts I never experienced in my younger years. Oh and the corners of my mouth have these eternal bumps that although unnoticeable, are always packed with gnarliness and make me feel dirty. 

I've tried everything. Washing my face twice per day with neutrogena orange soap; washing my face more than twice per day with neutrogena orang soap; using the dark angels scrub from lush; using a brush to wash my face; using cold water to wash my face; derma roller; face specific moisturizer; hyaluronic acid serum; clearasil spot treatment; clearasil pore unclogging charcoal wash; using oil absorbing sheets throughout the day, and now I'm using witch hazel and trying out the whole aztec mud mask thing. 

I was my pillow cases and rest of my bedding once per week and change towels every 2 days or so. 

I also started washing all my hats once per week and avoid sweating when wearing them. 

I'm desperate and my self-esteem is on the ground. Not to mention the bumps can be super painful and seem to always come back in the same spot like some eternal punishment. 

I'm a dude with little facial hair and don't shave with a razor because it also makes me break out so I just use clippers. I spend most day indoors because I'm in law school. I try my best to drink water and carry a Nalgene with me. I consume very little dairy and maintain a normal diet - not crazy healthy, but also not fast food - very bland stuff (white rice, eggs, broccoli, roasted chicken, tortillas). 

Any clue on what else is there for me try? I'm running out of ideas, frustrated and my face looks like a red/brown hell. It makes me feel so unprofessional to have breakouts as an adult male and intern in a law firm... 
To make matters worse my hair is also thinning. WTF.

87jesd,15,2018-03-27,Husband needs to get his promotion...now,FiendishCurry,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/87jesd/husband_needs_to_get_his_promotionnow/,"It turns out I am in a dead end job. I didn't think I was. Publishing is a very mentor heavy environment, so I thought my boss (P) and boss' boss (N) were grooming me to eventually move up. When P left last August, I thought I would surely get promoted. I told N I was interested in applying. To my dismay, I was told that ""you aren't ready yet"" and then all of my little mistakes (because I am human and humans make mistakes) were thrown back on me. I was shocked and dismayed. Folks, I have 8 years of managerial experience in books, a degree in Publishing, a Master's degree in writing, an internship with a well-known publisher, and over 4 1/2 years of experience working at my current publisher. Not to mention all my other odds and ends jobs that gave me a very well-rounded resume. I am angry about the fact that I wasn't even considered and am confident that had I applied from outside the company, I would have at least gotten an interview. Instead, I was completely disregarded.

It is now March and I am particularly pissed because I have literally been doing P's job since she left in August, with no raise or bonus mind you. I've been doing two people's jobs for months now. The new manager starts in two weeks. And the only help I have gotten in all this time is from an intern in another department. My checklist is endless. And every time I make the slightest mistake now, N uses it as an opportunity to ""gently"" remind me that this is why she didn't promote me. It's so bad that my co-workers have come to offer their condolences on me not getting the job and are legit mystified as to why I wouldn't be considered. 

So husband and I made a plan for me to quit and work full-time as a writer doing some freelance on the side as soon as he gets his upcoming promotion. The problem is that the wheels of industry move slowly and that promotion could happen anywhere between tomorrow and September. It's coming, he's been assured, but everything needs to be approved. 

I need it now. My kid is tracked out for another two weeks. He can't be left home alone because despite being 18, he functions more like a young child. He also has a lot of anxiety so leaving him home alone upsets him. Work-from-husband is at training all next week. I'm trying to convince my boss to let me work from home for half days and then bring him with me to work. But it's only going to get crazier. In May my husband is traveling for work for 2 weeks. Out of the country. (I'm a bit jealous) I HAVE to work from home in the mornings otherwise the kid won't get up and go to school. He'll just sleep through it. And he hates school, so he's not going to get up on his own. My boss reluctantly agrees to me working from home in the AM, but you can tell she strongly disapproves. Even though 90% of my job could be done from home. 

We knew this kid had issues, but when we decided to adopt him, we didn't realize how delayed he actually was. I don't mind dealing with the behavioral challenges associated with the delay, but the fact that he can't be left alone and is scared to go places is a real problem for two working parents. He just can't leave my husband alone during the day either. DH even bought a sign for his door so the kid knows when he can't be disturbed. Not that it does any good. DH counted one day and the kid disturbed him 64 times in a 3 hour period. Kind of hard to manage an entire department when your kid won't leave you alone. So we have to do something else. I don't mind working super hard throughout the year and taking breaks when my kid is out of school. I can do that. But something has got to change. I'm excited about the prospect of writing full-time. I've done it before and I know how productive I can be. But it feels like none of this happening fast enough and my stress levels are through the roof. "

87jzq0,14,2018-03-27,University Tutor and Student team up to damage my professional career with false allegations. Everything is documented. What are my options?,ohnoathrowawayagain,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/87jzq0/university_tutor_and_student_team_up_to_damage_my/,"Hello good people! Throwaway for reason that will be clear in a minute.

I’ll try to be as concise as I can, but first

TL;DR:

during 1st year of Uni, I comment on a fellow student’s academic blog, saying feminism is not the solution to the all the world’s problems. In the next years, there are no interactions of any sort between me and this student.

During the Uni work placement year (3rd year), I land a 6 months internship at a prestigious company, advertised to all students by our Course Coordinator. The manager tells me I will get the 6 months contract within the week so I can start preparing the relocation.

After two months of radio silence, I am given a 3 months probation contract. I find out the student was working there, went straight to HR when found out I was joining the company, and my tutor sided with her despite all evidence to effectively demote my job offer, while I was completely unaware of everything.

A formal complaint has been presented to various related offices within the Uni, and they are all pretending I do not exist.

—

The full story.

I am a European student attending a London University. The first year of the course started in October of 2014. We were told to fire up a wordpress blog, post whatever was relevant to the course, and interact with each other.

A student published a post ranting about the infamous Boko Haram kidnappings of 2014, blaming that event (amongst others) on misogyny, and proposing Feminism as the solution. I argue in the comments that when you consider the thousands of males slaughtered by BH that very year, it is unlikely that they are motivated by misogyny.

The tutor tells me the next week that the student in question complained for my “sexism”. Since the whole interaction was written and public, and no formal complaint had been filed, I apologise and move on with my life. That student and I never interacted again in the following years (we are part of a rather large course).

The 3rd year of the course is a work placement program. The course coordinator will interact constantly during the year with the students, advertising jobs that are proposed to us through the tutor, before being publicly advertised, and assisting students in the hiring process in case they apply for jobs independently.

I was looking for long term paid internships for financial reasons, and because many students prefer short but fancy internships, so competition is generally lower. In the middle of the year, I was working abroad, but already looking for the next internship when that one would expire. A perfect 6 months paid internship is available back in London, at a prestigious company.

I apply to their managers, with the tutor always CCd in the emails. I get the job offer, but I make clear I will accept if I can sign the contract shortly, and if it is long term - so that I can start arranging for accommodation, moving, and all that. They say no problem, you’ll get the contract next week.

I did not get the contract next week. After 3 weeks, I ask both management and the tutor if something’s wrong. I get a lot of “I’ll check and get back to you asap”, or “I’ll pass you to HR”, or whatever. In the meanwhile I had stopped looking for a job, believing their word.

After two months of this circus, I found out from the course coordinator that the student in question had heard I was being hired there, and went straight to HR with a formal complaint for sexism (which is possibly a world record, considering the circumstances) and, assisted by the course coordinator, had escalated the entire thing to upper management. The catch: she never mentioned that the interaction happened online, so she did not present the one existing evidence of the event, which - if anything - proves her to be kinda sexist.

So, after two months of being completely abandoned by the tutor whose only job was to assist me, I am there with a 3 months probationary contract - from a 6 months employment contract - at a company where I’ve never met anybody, but where everybody - at least in management - knows me to be a sort of sexist boogeyman, already having undergone an HR investigation for an online comment I had made 3 years earlier, and where the only guy presenting any evidence - me - was contacted only after everything had been said and done. My work experience in what started as my dream job - for field, place, pay... - became a sad and stressful drag thanks to this.

I presented a formal complaint for the behaviour of the student and the tutor in June of 2017 (end of the 3rd year of the course) to all the possible offices of the Uni supposed to deal with this. I have never received a reply. I have gone personally to the head of the college and left a printed formal complaint on their desk - this was a month ago. Still nothing. I am sending countless emails, but every University employees only answers to the lines not touching this subject, or just never replies.

I am now about to finish my 4th and final year of the course. What are my options, legally? Do I have a case, anywhere (unprofessional HR process, false accusation by the student/colleague, collusion of my tutor, wilful ignorance of the governing bodies of my Uni regarding the internal investigation for the case)? Consider that every single step of interaction of everything I’ve described here is documented and only happened in written form, so everything I am saying is irrefutable.

Thank you in advance for any advice, and thanks for reading all of this."
87jzve,17,2018-03-27,Anyone else figure that there are now too many compsci students?,NervousSell,uAlberta,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/87jzve/anyone_else_figure_that_there_are_now_too_many/,"I see so many posts on this subreddit about compsci and see how many people are in the courses now that I am convinced that compsci is going to see a job market crash soon. I'm already seeing people have a brutally difficult time getting jobs compared to even 2-3 years ago. It's absolutely crazy.

I'm also hearing that many people aren't getting any sort of internship offers at all. Like none at all, not hearing back from anyone. It's a bit crazy and a bit sad actually now I think of it. People heard that this was a really great career to get into with ""many"" jobs and that all of those jobs were essentially sucked up leaving none for the people now in the degree.

I don't think anyone graduating this year with less than 1 year of internship stands a chance in the job market here.

Just my personal thoughts on what I am seeing now."
87k4xr,2,2018-03-27,Looking for someone to stay with in Ireland this summer,JackiWilson,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/87k4xr/looking_for_someone_to_stay_with_in_ireland_this/,"I'm not quite sure if this is the right place to post this. I'm not looking for a specific city or even a region of Ireland I want to stay so I figured this would be the most general. 

I made a workaway account a few weeks ago but not having much luck and would really want to secure my summer plans rather than something a week in advance. 

So, hello! I'm a university student from Texas likely not getting a summer internship this summer in Texas because I'm not experienced enough in my field. I want to spend at least half my summer in Ireland instead. I plan to move there (or the UK if jobs look better) after I graduate in a few years and I want to have spent more time there than 10 days. 

What I'm really hoping to find is someone to live with. Any gender, any age. Someone who wouldn't be burdened accomdating me, meaning I could offer a skill in return. 

* I work in IT part time and I'm pretty experienced in setting up/ troubleshooting with computers so if you need help. 

* I have done art many years and could work on a wall mural or even repainting your house. 

* I can teach you how to use different mediums (acrylic, color pencil, water color, oil or chalk pastel) 

* I was a lifeguard/ swim instructor, I could teach you how to swim or some first aid skills. 

* I know a small bit of Spanish and could help teach you basics or conversate. 

* I worked in customer service for a while so I could help you as a ""volunteer"" at your business. 

* I have interest in UX/UI and could help you improve your website. I know some java and can teach you the basics of the object-oriented programming language but nothing really advanced as I'm a beginner. 

Hostels can be cheap at 30ish a night but if I'm there a minimum of a month and a half, it becomes far out of my budget and I want to make this happen. I'm okay with rural areas though I have preference for a city. I'm okay with smokers , pets, no internet, and manual labor too. 

I love your country and want a bit longer of a trial before I commit.

87kgwu,5,2018-03-27,"It’s just all such a terrible mess. I feel like a horrible person and I don’t know what to do with myself. On the outside, I’m cold and moving forward. On the inside I oscillate between panicked, rage filled, betrayed, guilty, desperate, numb. We broke up, I don’t want him back...I’m very confused.",Goingpostal09,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/87kgwu/its_just_all_such_a_terrible_mess_i_feel_like_a/,"I don’t even know who to talk to about this, which is why I’m talking to you guys, I guess.

Background: I came out of a very abusive relationship a few years ago. He cheated on me with transsexual prostitutes, choked me nearly to death several times, raped me. Real bad shit. 

I come back to my family town from Australia where I moved. I met my ex, he’s 33, I’m 21. He’s very persistent in wooing me despite my protests. I had mental health issues from the trauma and that made me difficult to deal with and not very interested in a relationship. He supported me nonetheless and I grew to really care about him and became close, like best friends. We trusted each other with everything. I realise I really needed a best friend and someone to treat me right which he did. He is a good man, there’s no getting around it.

However there were worrying undercurrents. He was unemployed, lived with his parents and over the course of the next six months, he was extremely intense with me. He demanded commitment and a serious direction to our relationship, involved me heavily in his financial and work troubles, and became very smothering when I tried to go to university. I was very unwell whilst there, and he supported me when I had to defer for a year.

My mum says he liked me best when I was completely dependent on him, and maybe that’s true but it wasn’t real life. When real life got in the way we fell apart.

I love him but I was very conflicted about our future. He lied to me all the time about getting a job or a potential career. He had a long term girlfriend who left him for what I suspect were similar reasons. Like a dick, I rang up several colleges he’d told me he was attending to help him arrange something (He was very edgy about me doing this) and discovered he’d never even contacted them. I don’t care what his job was as long as he could support himself. Meanwhile his family were unpleasant to me, and I believe this was because they resented him for living at home and bringing me back there. I felt isolated because he was demanding commitment (to move in with me when I returned to university), which I was happy to give, but I had a huge feeling that it would be a bad idea because of his work ethic and I didn’t want to jeopardise university, something I’d wanted for a very long time and my abusive ex refused to let me have. 

I am not proud of myself. I’ve been in therapy a lot...the abusive relationship started it but the therapist also said I am a love addict. This made me very upset but I believe it to be true because I struggle with being on my own. Whilst at university, I cheated on my ex. The relationship had reached crisis level tension and I took the coward’s way out. We broke up, of course. But he took me back and I felt like I could finally breathe again. I got on medication, got therapy, promised to work on myself which I did. He promised to get a job, one that wasn’t his father throwing him odd labouring gigs now and again. I regretted hurting him and we both agreed to move on, which was amazing of him because I don’t think I could’ve in his position.

He didn’t end up getting a job but I rationalised that I would either have to put up with it or shut up. We shared a really beautiful year, and I didn’t look at anyone else. The problems started again when I went back to university. He promised and promised to get a career and didn’t, and we stopped having fun. He was suspicious of me being away and cheating which I understood, and I addressed by calling him all the time and being completely transparent (access to my phone etc). He wanted more contact but I said I couldn’t keep coming home every weekend. He’d promise to pay for my ticket but never did, so I ended up spending a lot of money on train fare. He talked constantly about finding a stable job but never did anything to actually get one, relying on his father for infrequent work and breaking his promise again and again.

But the other straw that broke the camel’s back was me getting an internship to China for three weeks in the summer. He went mad at me, saying he’d never see me, etc...I felt shit because I felt like I was holding up my end of the bargain and he wasn’t. 

I stressed the importance of personal independence in terms of a job, finances but any time I moved towards it or against his wishes, he would freak out and it would be an explosive war zone. We stopped having sex. Still, we were best friends.

I cheated again. I’m a complete dick, I know. I immediately tried to break up with my ex, but didn’t tell him about the cheating. He begged for a break which I accepted, also like a dick. He hacked my social media remotely and found out that way. He called me to shout at me, fair enough, and I said I wanted to break up properly this time.

I feel bad for what I did. I did hurt someone unnecessarily who I loved. I lost my best friend. I don’t want to be this bad person any more.

He really was my best friend. I want to know why I do this rather than just break up when I know it’s going wrong. I want to know how to stop being such a scumbag. But I don’t want him back. I don’t want anyone; I just don’t know how to cope with this aching loneliness or how to cope with life full stop. Being with him made the weird stuff in my head easier, but made actual life so difficult. Once a cheater, always a cheater. But I don’t want to be. 

I just needed to tell someone. I know what I am. I am awfully confused about everything right now."
87kibs,4,2018-03-27,Four year user. Need help stopping for work.,coral-reefer00,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/87kibs/four_year_user_need_help_stopping_for_work/,"I am gracing r/leaves with my first Reddit post ever. My boyfriend posted here for me, but the mods asked that I make an account and post myself so here I am

I've been using weed heavily for four years. My average night is getting home from work, immediately vaping, then vaping slowly but consistently throughout the night until I'm ready to go to sleep.

I'm involved in an internship and have decided that it's time to move forward and apply to jobs in my field. The more jobs I apply to the more jobs I realize require drug testing. If I keep using weed I'm damaging myself professionally. It's limiting my job options and holding me back from the positions I truly want.

My problem is that weed helps my work output. Without it I can't bring myself to push that extra bit. The anxiety, mounting stress, and competition is too much for me. Weed gives me something to look forward to at the end of the day. When I work from home I vape all day. When I do that I can focus, remain relaxed, but still work all day happily and put out my best work. Without it I just can't stand the extra work. It wears me down. I can't shake the thoughts that I'm not doing enough and the guilt that comes with that. I can put those thoughts aside and feel satisfied with my work output when I'm high.

Weed is my release. Without it I can't work nearly as well. Without it my hobbies don't interest me nearly as much. I feel like I need it to enhance things and quiet my intrusive thoughts that take away from every situation. I've dealt with binge eating before and fell back into that habit last time I quit. I've dealt with body image issues most of my life and the extra weight really caused a lot of shame. I don't want to experience that again. I feel like weed is healthier and that it helps me.

If I don't quit I'll be hurting myself professionally. All of my hard work won't be worth much if it keeps me from advancing my career. I don't want to quit, but I have to quit. I know that an addict can't change until they truly want to change. I don't know if I'm ready to change, but I have to and I don't know how to deal with it. What if the quality of my work diminishes without weed?

I need some kind of vice. I need some way to turn it all off. I need some kind of outlet and I don't know where I can find it. I hate exercising. I don't want to fall back into binge eating. My hobbies don't give me the relief I'm looking for. How do I cope with this?

I'm perscribed .5mg Klonopin for an anxiety disorder.  My idea is to take one .5mg Klonopin at 9pm nightly. A whole 1mg in the event of a panic attack. It's not recreational; I just want to use it to take the edge off and get me through. I know there's a huge potential for benzo abuse, but I feel like I can control myself. I know I have some addict tendencies with weed, but I'm confident that I'll know where to draw the line with benzos.

I don't know how to do this. I don't want to do this, but I know I have to. I understand that's not exactly a common motive here, but there's gotta be people in my situation. How do I deal with this? What if I'm not ready for this? I honestly don't know how I would handle things without weed.

Any advice would be appreciated."
87ks76,27,2018-03-27,Co-Worker [26 F] has been extremely rude to me [22 M] after working on a project and seems to be sabotaging our new one.,NewDetail,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/87ks76/coworker_26_f_has_been_extremely_rude_to_me_22_m/,"Hey all. ""Claire"" is a Co-worker of mine. She came over at the start of the new year.  I intern as my ""Capstone"" (Last ""class"" you take at my school. It can be an internship, so I'm pretty much full time) at a consulting firm. We deal heavily in analytics and helping companies improve their metrics. I've been here since before my Capstone and have already received and accepted a full time offer. It's safe to say I know our systems, clients, etc. very well.

Claire was named project lead on this massive data project. A company we worked with dropped the ball and as a result we had to manually enter metrics for each ""packet"". It's easy. It's incredibly mundane and tedious however. We were expected to do 1400 a day. 

Claire, established the slowest way possible to do these. It involved three extra unnecessary checks before entry. I told her privately (because I have been here longer and know the system) that we didn't need the extra checks because our system would spit back out wrong ones. She said I should know my place as an intern and this is how she was running her project.

I said ok and completely ignored all of her instructions. I knew it was inefficient and would lead to more errors. Midway through the project my average number of packets per day were around 2100. Compared to the rest of the groups which was 1290 or something like that. I also had a higher accuracy rate than anyone on our team. Claire asked me to switch to her method after seeing the results, and I said no. I asked why we didn't have team switch to my method so we could meet the deadline and she shrugged me off and called me ""Insubordinate""

We miss the deadline and the team has to have a meeting with the manager and an executive as a result because it ended up costing the company. Claire tried to blame my ""insubordination"" and in a haste, I told my manager and my executive that I informed Claire that we wouldn't meet the deadline due to her slow method. 

I also pulled up my averages and rates compared to the group in the middle of the meeting. Our manager did the math: We would've made beat the deadline by three days had we all done it my way.  I was responsible for more than half of all the completed packets. Furthermore, it was found out Claire lied, and was telling our manager we were *way* further ahead than we actually were to save face.

Claire got screamed at. This damn near cost us a client. We heard it from our desks. I feel bad, however, this wasn't on me whatsoever, and management has let me know by the compliments/attention I've received from executives/managers and increased responsibility as Assistant Project Lead on a new assignment. 

Claire has been a complete bitch to me since then. It's been blatant.   She's on this new project with me and has done absolutely nothing. She's passive aggressive and seems uninterested. She makes comments about her ""Track getting altered"" because of me under her breath.

Like chill, lady. You were the one that decided to add extra unnecessary steps and miss a deadline. I wasn't getting ripped a new asshole or taking one for the team when I outperformed everyone and gave you the proverbial answer key which you ignored.

It's getting bad and Claire seems to be actively campaigning against any idea I have in our project. I'm trying to keep decorum, but it's absurd. She's getting outvoted, ousted, and at times told she's downright wrong but keeps fighting. She's gone as far as to ""bump"" into me and spill hot coffee on my suit.

Any solutions without going to management? I'm not that guy. I don't like involving others to resolve my problems, but at some point this needs to stop. I've tried talking to her and she blows me off. 

TL;DR

Project lead had an inefficient way to complete a project. I told her. She ignored me. I did my part of the project my way and over-performed while she caused the team to miss a deadline with her slow method. She got ripped a new one by management because I called her out for it during a meeting. She's now been incredibly rude and seems to be sabotaging a new project. She continually ignores my attempts to talk to her even if it's strictly work related"

Taylor Swift's 'Delicate' stays at the top of the chart this week on its 19th week chart run. Charlie Puth's collaboration with Kehlani 'Done For Me' debuts at #2, making it this week's highest debut. Janelle Monae's 'Make Me Feel' remains strong as the song charts at #3. The EDM collab of Zedd, Maren Morris and Grey 'The Middle' increases two more spots to #4. Will the song continue to rise and reach a new peak at #1?

Camila Cabello's 'Never Be The Same' continues to chart in the top ten at #5 on its 15th week chart run. Another Chainsmokers song 'Everybody Hates Me' debuts at #6.

With the release of the highly-anticipated gay teen romantic film *Love, Simon*, two of the songs from the movie's soundtracks charted in the top ten, with Troye Sivan's 'Strawberries and Cigarettes' and Khalid and Normani's 'Love Lies' charting at #7 and #10 respectively.

Kim Petras' 'Heart to Break' returns to the top ten at #8. Charli XCX's collab with Carly Rae Jepsen 'Backseat' makes a huge jump of 41 spots back to the top ten at #9, making it the biggest gain of the week.

'I Got It', which features Brooke Candy, CupcakKe and Pabllo Vittar is this week's highest re-entry at #30. Unfortunately for Abel and Kendrick, 'Pray For Me' is this week's biggest decline.

* **Highest Debut:** #2. Charlie Puth - Done For Me (feat. Kehlani)
* **Highest Re-Entry:** #30. Charli XCX - I Got It (feat. Brooke Candy, CupcakKe &amp; Pabllo Vittar)

##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs

Two more songs from the soundtrack of *Love, Simon* charts at the Hot 50, with 'Never Fall in Love' by Jack Antonoff and MØ and 'Alfie's Song (Not So Typical Love Song)' by Bleachers at #12 and #27respectively.

One of Bleachers' older songs 'Rollercoaster' makes its debut at #33.

'SAD!', a song from well-known problematic rapper and singer 'XXXTentacion' charts at #13 on its second week. (**Author's Note**: I don't want to be biased but can we please stop streaming him? Seriously, he just sucker punched a woman recently and that's tame compared to the other things he did. We are not going to exclude one artist we don't like from the chart since the Hot 50 is supposed to represent what the community listens each week but jeez, please stop supporting problematic artists like XXXTentacion.)

Dua Lipa's 'IDGAF' might see its return to the top ten soon as it charts at #15.

With the recent conclusion of the third season of *RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars*, 'Kitty Girl' by RuPaul and the cast of the season debuts at 16.

Instead of the remix of Halsey's latest single, the original version of 'Alone' debuts at #19.

Two new songs from Panic! at the Disco 'Say Amen (Saturday Night)' and '(Fuck A) Sliver Lining' debuts at #24 and #28 respectively. 

Lastly, Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Cut to the Feeling' re-enters the Hot 50 at #49. You guys can't get enough of Carly!

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

87lct4,0,2018-03-27,Why should I do my internship in your country ?,Treycos,AskEurope,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEurope/comments/87lct4/why_should_i_do_my_internship_in_your_country/,"Hi everyone  
I've been studying in an IT school for nearly 4 years  
For our next intership, wich will begin in september, we'll have to go abroad on our own for a few months  
I'm currently looking for the country that will suit me the best  
A perfect fit would be a country where : 

* most people speak english
* there's a high demand in the IT field
* the cost of living wouldn't be too high
* there are beautfiul places to visit  

So far, Ireland has been the country my friends recommended me the most (english speaking, high IT demand, great landscapes ... and beers)  
But I'm still looking for what other countries have to offer   

So tell me, why should I do my internship in your country ?"
87lqd4,2,2018-03-27,Hate when I'm talked over and people hijack a conversation,meatpuppeting,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/87lqd4/hate_when_im_talked_over_and_people_hijack_a/,"So a conversation you know, should be a back and forth. I'm a pretty good listener I like to think, I'm pretty quiet and listen more than talk. When I do talk though, it annoys me when some people just interrupt me in the middle of me saying something. 

It happens often with work and jobs. To the point where at my internship last summer, I would end the day just writing a small email to my main manager I reported to everyday like what I did what happened etc....so at the next stand-up of the week or when he drops by my desk it wouldn't be me just starting to say something, and he hijacks the conversation. He'll at least hear or has the option to hear what I want to say.

Just ahhh let me finish before I'm interrupted two sentences in.

87mgjn,3,2018-03-27,Long awaited first steps toward FREEDOM,RuffledPlume,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/87mgjn/long_awaited_first_steps_toward_freedom/,"It's been quite a while since my last post so, bear with me as I try to give a summary of the last few months of my life although it probably won't be as organized as I would like. Might even be ranty at times. I've been wanting to share updates with you guys for a while now but just haven't felt up to doing it until now. So, last time I posted I think I had been working part-time and interning on a film production. Since then, my internship has ended (the film has been produced and is now in post-production) and that part-time job has become a full-time job AND I've been promoted to a department lead and I'm a few baby steps closer to being financially stable enough move out of my NM's house. 

That's some of the good. Now, here's the bad, frustrating and downright stressful stuff. I just got home after going out with a friend for a few hours without getting ""permission"" for the first time in my life. I'm 23 years old and I've never done this before because I've always been afraid I'd be met at the door with who knows what kind of attack but I stuffed that fear down today and went out. 

I'm in my room right now semi-trembling because the second I got back and went upstairs I heard NM scream that I'm back. Not saying hello to me or anything just announcing to everyone else in the house that I'm back. When I tell you the *tone* in her voice was like nothing I EVER want to hear again....... My brother came up a few moments after and filled me in on how she's been acting since she got home knowing I wasn't there. 

Thing is, she wouldn't have even known about it if it were not for the fact that her son, who is damn near 40 years old (golden child / flying monkey) called her and TOLD her the second I left that I was going somewhere. Of course, he told her I left and didn't tell him where I was going which is a lie because I DID. 

Anyway, I'm now in this odd state of sort of feeling proud for finally doing something for myself and feeling like the world might end soon. I've spent the majority of my life distancing myself from friends and people I should be connecting with all because my cultish family is determined to maintain control over every minuscule detail of my life that going out with a friend who has offered to help me makes me feel like I've committed treason. I am simultaneously sure that I've done nothing wrong and also guilty. 

My NM is the most toxic, manipulative person I've ever known and although I feel like I've come a long way in dealing with her brand of crazy, I still have these moments where I feel like, what if she's right about me? What if I'm the evil one? What if I am everything she so desperately wants everyone she knows to believe that I am? I mean, all I truly want is the freedom to know I can walk outside of my own house or talk to a friend on the phone or go out with friends and not be treated like I've just murdered someone. I want to be able to live each day on my own terms without wondering; can I do this or should I not because NM might not want me to? If I want to go get ice cream to go to a movie, I want to grab my wallet, keys and leave my house to do so without feeling guilty. Is that too much to ask?

Why would you, a self-proclaimed Christian be trying so hard to make every member of our family believe your ridiculous claims about your own, albeit ""adopted"" child. I don't understand it. A friend offered to take me to fill out a job application because he knows I need to be making a living wage so I can move out on my own. I accepted that offer. He even bought me lunch after seeing how much happier I was to be spending some free time away from home and work. He doesn't know that I don't eat my NM's cooking because I'm afraid I'll get sick from it. He just knew I was hungry cause he heard my stomach and wanted me to be happy. That was so amazing of a gesture and I'm too socially and emotionally stunted to express my gratitude to him the way I wanted to because the whole time I'm out, I'm thinking - I should really go back now before I get in TROUBLE FOR BEING A HUMAN BEING WITH ACTUAL BASIC NEEDS AND FEELINGS....... 

Ok, sorry for the random caps. It's just so infuriating. I can't be happy for being depressed. Can't be angry for being ashamed. Can't be proud of my own little personal accomplishments for being guilty. I just can't seem to win."

87n0fr,1,2018-03-27,How Can I [19M] Move On But Be Her [18F] Best Friend?,KiwiWithAHat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/87n0fr/how_can_i_19m_move_on_but_be_her_18f_best_friend/,"I had one of the first ""amazing, deeprooted"" relationships of my life with my best friend who was genuinely good to me. We were best friends for months before dating, and at the time we thought that we would NEVER date. Unfortunately she had some baggage from her recent relationship of 3 years, and really felt like she needed to be alone and take care of herself, and as a result sometimes we didn't have the happiest relationship but she really tried.

We decided to mutually split, but it's hard for both of us. We want to be eachothers' best friends and truthfully still have feelings for eachother. We've started seeing eachother SIGNIFICANTLY less (from 5 or 6 times a week to maybe only one or two, if even) and barely contact eachother. We already had misunderstandings with boundaries and hurt feelings/anger of mine, but she understood the ways in which she hurt me and we've made up with all that.

I still want her in my life and I want to be her best friend, and the possibility of us dating in the future (I mean 8 months to years later) is one we both seem to be keeping open. I saw her today and I can tell she wanted to hold my hand instinctively as I did her. It's hard because I need to take time for myself as does she, but I still want to be there for her and be best friends like we were before we dated.

How can I do this? I might spend a month or two abroad in an internship so I know that will help, but unfortunately that is in over 2.5 months from now.

tldr: Relationship with former best friend sadly ended on mutualish terms. We see eachother a lot less often and talk little, but we both want to be best friends and have eachother in our lives. The possibility for a relationship in the distant future seems open, but I musn't count on this in the slightest. How can I move on but stay close? I miss my best friend."

Every female as far as i know has a their kids father be a broke mf a bum dude that does not help. now on the Males side.. im not sure how this works yet but my uncle died over a decade ago and how he died was in an accident with alcohol in his system. a couple of years ago my cousin died from an accident with alcohol in his system 2 days ago i lost 2 cousins due to an accident with alcohol in their system. everything is just super strange but i cant find any other explanation for this coincidence? my uncle rose to power in where he was about to pass high society and died driving drunk on his boat at night at a high speed, doctors say he died instantly but his whole insides were liquified. my cousin was drunk driving at a high speed after starting an Internship he had just got. he died instantly and so his body liquified instantly. my cousin just turned 22 and just graduated about to start his new job as an engineer. he died instantly and his insides liquified. All of the females are some strong mf and i honestly dont know how to dig further. ive asked an uncle i get along with and told me that my great grandpa and his grandpa were brothers and as far as he knows ran away from where they were originally from. but nobody in our family whats to talk about the brothers. what i heard from my uncle was that my great grandpa killed his grandpa and thats why our family is so broken up because everyone blames each other side to side and everyday our family just grows farther and farther. so i really want to understand more and what to learn more and if your willing to help me please please help me "

I'm a freshman at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science interested in working an internship in the fast paced environment of a startup this summer. I love solving intellectually stimulating problems, am open minded, and can learn very quickly on the fly. My basic qualifications include coding (c++, JavaScript, Java, Python), fabrication, CAD, etc. I'm happy to send you a full resume. I'm a believer in learning from experience, so I'm looking to spend some time solving the interesting problems faced by startups, as I think it is much more valuable than what can be learned in a classroom. I'm pretty anxious to get into this kind of fast paced environment, so I'm willing to work on the cheap.
Let me know if you have anything. I'm happy to send you a full resume with references and can interview over Skype. FWIW my hobbies include cycling (mountain and road), cars, hiking, and music.

All my professors keep saying that the most important thing to have before you graduate is internship and experience. Well, I’ve been actively looking since my freshman year and still no luck. At first I figured nobody wants to hire a freshman because they don’t know anything yet, but I’m about to finish my third year and I’ve only gotten a few offers that I had to turn down because of some reason or another.

I also know that having connections is very important, but even with relations to an engineering manager in this one company, I still can’t get a position. 

My GPA isn’t too bad (3.4 overall, 3.5 major specific) and I’m a part of a few clubs on campus. But I can’t figure out why it’s so hard for me to find something.

Perhaps it’s because I’m an Asian male in engineering (there’s a million of us) and they want a diverse workplace? What do you guys think?

Starting to feel really discouraged having to come home all the time and constantly tell my parents that I haven’t found anything yet. I’m the first in my family to go to college, but I can’t help but feel like a disappointment. Sometimes I wish I had continued my schooling to become a paramedic or firefighter (I did this for a bit before deciding to go to a university)

Please tell me I’m not the only one struggling :( anyway thanks for reading about my woes"

Please help!,cravingfornachos,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/87oo5x/fresh_grad_life_is_challenging_as_hell_please_help/,"Hey all my fellow PFs! I’m a long time lurker who purposely make an account to ask for help. Please be brutally honest I need all the help out there!

Background: I got my BS in mechanical engineering last December and started working 2 weeks ago since Jan-Mar was my last chance to go back to my home country (international student problem amirite) before work starts (no loan thanks mom and dad ❤️). My salary is 40k (this is after negotiating from 36k. Before yelling at me that it’s too low I was offered 3 other jobs that offers 55k or more but this requires me to relocate but I can’t. Will explain later). My fiancé got his AS in Engineering last December as well and owe 16K (he was there for three years because his first year was in other major) he started working right away and his salary right now is 52K. Our weekly income is 

530 (mine) + 740 (his) = 1270. 

We each contribute 6% 50% match to 401 (k). 

Problem: I bought a car last summer 2017 toyota corrolla that I bought for my then internship. Forgot the initial price but I have 10k left that ends up costing 228/month (5years). Car insurance is crazy high at 400/month. His rest of car debt is 6000 which cost him 130/month for 3 more years. His car insurance is crazy expensive too at 220/month. 

Question: 

1) Before I started working we live okay with his paycheck. Everything is covered although we couldn’t really save. Now that I’m starting to work, we’re not too sure where to put my weekly paycheck towards. I was thinking to put all my paycheck towards both of our cars (to lower the crazy insurance) which means both car will be paid of by November. and then after that starts paying for his old loan. Do you think this is a good idea?

2) he’s planning to go back to school to finish his bachelor in mechanical engineering as well (another 2 years). Knowing how heavy the work load is, I suggested him to just focus on school for those 2 years period. What are you guys suggestions for this? 

Thank you for reading all these words I know it’s a lot. Any suggestions are welcomed &lt;3"
87otka,3,2018-03-27,Advice on which type of exercise would be best for me?,duchessofcarrots,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/87otka/advice_on_which_type_of_exercise_would_be_best/,"Hello.
I’m 22 years old, female, 176cm tall (5’9”), 106 kg (234 lbs , 16.7 stones) 
I had hairline fractures on both my ankles and had a cast 3 times on different feet over the course of the last 5 years. The last one was pretty bad and it’s been one and a half years from the injury and I’ve regained mobility and started walking normally again. But any stretches to my muscles beyond walking range is quite painful.( like standing on toes, tried pilates but getting my legs to a 90 degree angle for example hurts my hamstrings and my muscles around my ankle and I actually get numbness to my little toes..) I tried running but since I’m so heavy the impact my foot makes with the ground hurts my ankle so I can’t sustain it for long.
I can walk about 10 mile range before it properly starts o hurt for me to stop. Usually don’t have the time to walk that much so this only happens on a free Saturday. Daily, I walk for 40 minutes to get to work(internship) and 40 minutes to get back. I also live on the 5th floor and take the stairs. But it’s not enough...
I have high cholesterol and cardio feels like I’m gonna die and I start wheezing and coughing and have trouble breathing. 
I had binge eating and it’s mostly under control but sometimes I relapse. But now I’ve started on Keto. I’m pretty much in control of what I’m eating and am doing quite well. I’ve lost 15 pounds in two months on Keto alone with no exercise whatsoever. 
And I’m a senior so close to getting their BA diploma, but with all the internships and thesis stuff I’m pretty busy and don’t get to sleep often. I feel so tired throughout the day that exercising feels like such a hassle.
I used to play volleyball for like 8 years and even though I have so much fat over it, I still have a good muscle definition underneath. 
I really wanna dedicate an hour everyday to exercising but don’t know which ones I should start with. (I really hate the gym though)
I’m graduating in like 3 months and would like to start a new chapter of my life better than who I am now. And I really want to have a routine in my life and be happy when I exercise, I’m looking forward to the ‘refreshed’ feeling fit people always talk about, the feeling that I vaguely remember during those years of double training for three hours every day of the week. 
Any suggestions would be helpful.

87ozgx,934,2018-03-28,How I got from welfare to upper middle class,Lars2893,povertyfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/87ozgx/how_i_got_from_welfare_to_upper_middle_class/,"Hey all, I'm not sure how helpful this anecdotal story will be, but I'm really excited about this community and wanted to contribute what I could.  I grew up with a lot of 'checkboxes'--welfare, single parent household, drug abusive mom, and many more.  I was a poor student, surrounded by poor influences and no one--including myself--had a lot of expectations.  I remember my mom teaching me how to steal gloves from the Salvation Army.  I remember digging through couch cushions for McDonald's money.  I remember the elation of 'renters rebates' so I could get school clothes.  I remember being poor.  I started working at 15 and landed a job at the local movie theatre making $5.15 an hour.  I was emancipated at 17 and basically couch surfed through high school.  I stayed dedicated to my job at the theatre throughout and by the time I graduated high school I was an assistant manager and had no plans for college.  One day the manager drove in with his brand new Dodge Stratus and I found out a theatre manager's salary was around 35k and that seemed more than adequate, so that became my plan.  

I eventually was dragged by my old social workers (now ""adopted grandmas"") to at least attempt to go to college.  My grades were terrible so not only were there no scholarships available, but I was rejected by every university in my city.  I eventually saved enough to afford a single algebra class at the local community college.  I worked hard and got an A.  I used that to prove to the universities that I was trying to turn over a new leaf.  Once accepted I had to start the arduous process of paying for college. It took a ton of research and back and forth (I did not have anyone to go to with experience on this topic).  Thankfully Pell grants and subsidized student loans were enough to cover everything but books.  I took out a little extra in student loans when needed to pay rent and keep my head above water.  After a year and a half at the local state university campus I applied to go to the ""Main U"" in the state capital (my first time outside my hometown).  I was Pre-Law at first but switched to Computer Science about a year in when I heard about salary and job prospects.  At this point I was prideful and felt I had enough experience in CS to justify an internship.  I applied a lot and got rejected a lot.  After living off my girlfriends server wages for a few months I sucked it up realizing I was not ready and got another job at the theatre.  I spent a lot of time at this point learning about my field, reading books, doing side projects, whatever could make me seem more appealing.

I finally got a break in my Junior year of college and got a job at a student consulting firm doing odd projects for Thomson Reuters. I worked 20 hours a week, made $13.50 an hour and was getting direct experience in my field.  I interviewed a lot before and had a lot of rejections.  I remember I was sweaty-palmed and walked around the block a few times before my interview and when I got the job I bought my girlfriend (now wife) a stupidly expensive (relatively) purse with my first check.  From here, I had my break. I worked there through college, interned directly with Thomson Reuters and was much better poised for interviews as I approached graduation.  I got lucky and landed my first job at Microsoft making 81k a year.  It was a mind-boggling amount of money.  I ate peanut butter sandwiches for lunch every day until my first check came in.  

Since then I've worked miscellaneous places in tech and have increase my salary significantly.  I thrive at work and I attribute a lot of that to the fact that I had to learn to problem solve and not succumb to fear early on.  Some middle aged guy shouting at me about a deadline doesn't bother me, but for some 'silver spoons' who haven't faced real conflict before it absolutely ravages them and they shut down.  People who grew up poor often have a lot of perspective and skills that are valuable to major companies. I'm 29 right now and  I just bought my first house, have a solid retirement plan and am able to buy things, travel and help others without worrying about next month.  It's still so surreal.

Like I said, this is just a big anecdotal story.  I am well-spoken and white (which I acknowledge has given me privileges despite my upbringing).  I chose a career (intentionally) that has a surplus of jobs and high salaries and thankfully had a natural aptitude for it.  I had support from social structures.  And I probably got lucky saying the right thing to the right interviewer a time or two...I don't know if I would have landed the jobs I did if I applied again.  The main goal of this story is just to share a path of how I made it from A to B.  Anyone else here, I wish you the absolute best in doing the same!

Editing to share a link to a very valuable resource I wish I'd have known about:  You can dial 211 or visit 211.org to be linked to local resources in your area that can help with necessities like food, shelter, medical or simply starting your path toward higher education or the workforce.  A lot of folks on here have expressed a sense of ""Where do you begin?"" and hopefully for some this link will help!"

87p5da,3,2018-03-28,How should I [22/f] approach my boyfriend [23/m] about some of his concerning social media use?,rheumatisticwerewolf,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/87p5da/how_should_i_22f_approach_my_boyfriend_23m_about/,"We've been dating for almost 6 months and have already said ""I love you"" to each other, I'm his first girlfriend in almost 4 years and he has given me absolutely no reason not to trust him. However...my last boyfriend cheated on me with one of his female friends and this has had a great impact on my perception. I am aware that a lot of my feelings may come from an unfair place of insecurity, jealousy, irrationality, or discomfort and I am very mindful and combative of these feelings (by recognizing and working them out in private) as I understand he is a different (and better) man.

This is where you come in however, as his social media use has become an issue for me and I need feedback. But, please be gentle as I'm truly coming from a good place where I want to learn how to handle my relationship in the most appropriate and healthy way possible. Okay here goes the scenario:

The only social media my boyfriend uses is Facebook and Snapchat. On Facebook he will randomly add very beautiful women he doesn't know in real life (he actually added me before we met) and his feed is full of very provocative pictures of these attractive girls (such as them in bikinis, stylish/trendy/sexy outfits, revealing work out gear, etc.). I didn't really think too much of this until I was trying to find his friend's girlfriend's Facebook through his friend's list to add her/tag her in a picture and was shocked at how many ""Bridgets"" he was friends with (20+ and many of them fitting into the random, provocatively dressed beautiful woman category). I'm not even sure what to do or say in this situation as it feels like he uses Facebook more like most people use Instagram and he doesn't seem to have any interactions with them beyond liking their pics. I have never and will never go through his phone as I feel that would be a huge invasion of privacy/trust but he will usually be on his phone in front of me/showing me things and ""liking"" seems to be the only interaction he does.

Now on Snapchat, things get way more dicey and this is where my biggest issue lies. He acts way more secretive with his snapchat. He'll call me over and show me snaps from groupchats with his guy friends and purposefully not click on 5+ unopened snaps from girls. I one time gently prompted while he was showing me snaps, ""Oh look you have more unopened snaps."" (making an observation to gauge his reaction) and he hesitantly open them. The content of the snaps from those girls ranged from something funny to very posed, filtered selfies/videos that came off a little flirty to food they're cooking to them partying to pictures of their feet/legs. He has streaks with many of these girls and religiously keeps them going with some of the streaks being over 2 months long. He often posts me on his story/has sent these girls snaps of me so I know he isn't hiding me from these girls but, my discomfort still persists. On this app, I noticed he will also accept every friend request from girls and ignore ones from guys. One of his snap friends is a girl he's known since freshmen year of college and this is the one person he CONSTANTLY stays in communication with via snaps and messages on the app. I would say he communicates with her more on snapchat than he does with me. She had moved out of state for grad school and flew in on Friday for her spring break. Guess who was the one person who picked her up from the airport at 8:30 am...ding ding ding, my boyfriend. While here, she begged him to go out to the bars with her and all her friends (he didn't because he didn't have the money) but she went out to lunch with him and his roommate who is also friends with her. One day I had asked him about his snapchat friends; he was quick to tell me about the two groupchats he's in with his guy friends but had to be pried a little about his other friends. He told me the girls were all acquaintances he'd met through school, internships, and work. He views all of these girl’s stories as well. In the past, he told me about this girl he talked to who, ""was the worst person I've ever been around in my life"" yet he watches her story and even showed me her story (she is absolutely breath-taking, seriously she had one of the most beautiful faces and best bodies I have ever seen in my life as well as a very sexy tattoo going up the side of her thigh to her lower abdomen which you could see very well in the picture).  When trying to show me a snap memory, he scrolled through his saved memories and it was absolutely littered with selfies of girls and him and pictures of girls that I felt he was talking to at the time (as the same girl would be in these memories for segments of the screen and then would never be seen again).

Sorry for the length but I wanted to accurately go through everything that has made me uncomfortable to properly showcase the situation and my feelings. I do not want to be controlling, insecure, jealous, or crazy and I realize some of my feelings could be reflective of my last relationship/my own personal issues. I also understand that this is something that has continuously bothered me and I want to approach the situation from the most rational, productive, and healthiest way possible. Is his behavior completely normal and nothing for me to worry about? Would it be a good idea to sit down and have a conversation with him about how I'm feeling or rather, should I continue to work through my feelings in private? Is it reasonable to ask him to adjust his behavior on social media in any capacity and if so, in what ways?

tl;dr My boyfriend has been a little shady on social media and has done some things that concern me. Is it unreasonable to ask him to modify his behavior and if so, in what ways?"

She’s about to graduate (yay!) in a few long weeks, and she couldn't be more ecstatic about that. I don't know why she got it in her head that she would just be able to apply to the one place she wanted to and get hired on, but let's just say that she did. 

To clarify, there's one particularly outstanding hospital in my area that she wanted to work at out of the gate because of how amazing everyone here has told us their new nurse training is, 6 months with a preceptor. She whole-heartedly wants to be the best that she can be, work in the hardest areas, and have the most knowledge that she can attain, so this was obviously the place for her. She worked hard through nursing school, has a 3.95 GPA, did an internship last summer all while working 2 jobs. She was crushed when she didn't even secure an interview.

It's becoming taxing going to class now listening as people are shouting from the tops of their lungs how they got a job at the hospital that she wants to be at. She’s not ready to give up, but she is learning the reality of the world and looking for encouragement and positivity.

TL;DR: Didn't get an interview at the only place she ever considered working, and now she is wondering...

What positive stories do you have about the beginning of your nursing career?"

I am a fresh graduate with a Communication degree with a lot of Psychology emphasis. I settled on Communication after attending a passionate lecture from a professor who worked in HR for decades. However, after taking many classes, I realized that I enjoyed Psychology far more than the corporate world. Thus, I have taken many Psychology courses, but didn’t quite finish double majoring in Psychology (wanted to get out of school asap to avoid more tuition.)

My plan, during the last year of my schooling, was to pursue a MSW after getting some work experience to improve my chances of getting into graduate school. Every internship or job I looked at required me to be currently enrolled in a Masters program, so I’m currently working as an entry level behavioral therapist for children with autism (ABA) I dislike it. A LOT. ABA and MSW are not the same field but it’s incredibly draining at this job. (Kudos to anyone doing RBT, BCBA, BCABA…I thought I had a plethora of patience, but I was wrong.) The longer I am working with my clients, the less resolve I have for pursing MSW. I’ve received many indirect and direct injuries while working as a BT that my parents don’t even want me pursing a mental health career anymore, they want me to apply for HR positions because I have a degree in Communication. 

I don’t want to break any of the subreddit rules, so instead of asking you if this is the right path for me, I’ll ask all the MSW/LCSW a few questions instead. 

1. Has there ever been a time where you were working a case and you wanted to throw in the towel and give up? What happened? How did you change your mind (if you stayed)?
2. What happened that made you feel like you made an impact in a client’s life?
3. If you were given an opportunity to start your life over, would you still choose to be a social worker?
4. What is your ""self-care"" routine?

If anyone wants to privately message me to give me any advice in this field, PLEASE DO. I am completely lost on what to do. 

Thank you everyone, for your time. :)

87rt78,1,2018-03-28,A College Degree Isn’t Complete Without Real World B2B Work Experience,mlondon_tnp,collegejobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegejobs/comments/87rt78/a_college_degree_isnt_complete_without_real_world/,"Academics, social life, sleep — pick two. Call it the impossible trinity, the unattainable trifecta or the Bermuda Triangle of college, but practically every student knows it all too well. You can go to that party and then pull an all-nighter to finish a paper you have due, become a social recluse who has a 4.0 GPA and gets 8.0 hours of sleep every night or risk flunking out (but in a more fun and less sleep-deprived way). 

While every campus has students that fall under each of these categories, neither option is an optimal way to go through college. Truth is, you can balance your studies and fun, while still getting enough rest with the help of proper time-management. But this is a discussion for another article. 

Today, we want to talk about the time when you study less, party more and have multiple opportunities to catch up on sleep — your summer break. It’s not only a perfect opportunity to do all three of the above mentioned things but also a time to invest in something that can kick-start your career in a not too distant real world. Yes, we are talking about an internship. Here are some of the reasons why you should consider applying for one (or several).

Work Experience 

There are two types of work experience an internship provides — the tangible accomplishments you can put on your resume and the intangible lessons you learn based on the work process itself. Let us explain.

Every company where you apply for a job will want to see your resume. You want to make sure you don’t just have enough experience to fill up a page, but also be able to select those roles that are most relevant to the position you are applying for. Also, most employers want to see what you have accomplished, not simply what you have done.
 
For example, the [Marketing Specialist Internship](http://byob123.com/marketing-internship/) from [Be Your Own Boss](http://byob123.com/), a new college initiative recently launched by [TransNational Payments](https://gotnpayments.com/), comes with an opportunity to build, submit and execute your own marketing plan, which is a huge professional milestone you can be proud to show off. The best part of this specific internship is that it has the potential to turn into a full-time opportunity. Even better, you don’t have to wait until the summer to apply — go ahead and check it out today!

Now, what do we mean by intangible lessons? We are referring to all the things you learn along the way that aren’t necessarily tied to particular projects. Following a regular work schedule, knowing how to collaborate with people from other generations and backgrounds, understanding office etiquette and employee policies — all of these play a big role in preparing you for a professional career. 

Career Prospects 

What do you want to be when you grow up? Some people still can’t answer this question even after they have grown up. Internships, however, are designed for this exact reason. This type of short-term employment is a great way to get a sneak peak into a particular role or industry to see if that might just be something you wouldn’t mind investing 40 hours a week in. 

Unlike having multiple full-time jobs over a short period of time, having multiple internships on your resume is seen as a positive. It means you’ve done your research. Internships are also a great opportunity to get your foot in the door at a particular company, and at the same time, for that company to see if you might make a good candidate for a full-time role. Remember that they are prospecting you just as much as you are prospecting them, so always strive to do your best.

Professional Connections

It’s easy to simply hang out with your fellow interns during each lunch break, forgetting that there other people working at the company too. While your manager might introduce you to some of them at the start of your internship, it’s in your best interest to reach out to them personally (beyond a simple LinkedIn request). Invite them to grab a coffee or a casual lunch and use this opportunity to learn more about their role and the organization in general. Ask questions and listen. Speaking with current employees is often the best way to get a feel for the company culture and to see if you would be a good fit.

Clearly, internships come with multiple benefits that go well beyond simply making some extra cash (although that’s important as well). Keep them in mind as you seek the right opportunity to enhance your college experience.

My internship starts at 8:30am. It takes 45 minutes to get there.

I missed the whole of last week; sick/depressive episode.

Went in Monday and Tuesday. Had a talk with her.

She was supportive af.

Now I feel like I've fucking failed her.

5 minutes late turned into 20, turned into 1 hours, then 2. Fuck.

I'm a pathetic piece of shit, and just wished she'd give up on me, and ask me to the fuck put of her life. I hope I fucking die.

I'm so fucking embarrassed and disappear in myself. I hate me.

I just want a restart button. And I want them to forgive me for being fucked up. I want them to not judge. I wish I didn't want to die an disappear.

I'm too scared to fucking leave my apartment, because wtf, I'm so so late. Fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me. I fucking hate myself. I fucking fucking hate myself. I fucking hate myself. I fucking hate myself."

I did internship in CI framework for three more months. During those period I learnt CRUD operation, REST API service, searching and gmap integration. 

After a month I started working in a web development company. They have developed their own CMS in core PHP. I am given the task of integrating new templates with the existing CMS. It's been 11 days and I feel so tensed. The file structure and the modules are quite difficult. Its taking lot of time for me to understand the system.

I'm thinking like programming is not for me. 
Did you guys struggle during the first month of your job? How did you overcome these situations? This month is a probation period for me. Need some suggestions from people who went through these situation."

87tdv7,2,2018-03-28,Questions for probation officers from a prospective probation officer,RevolutionaryDaikon,probation,https://www.reddit.com/r/probation/comments/87tdv7/questions_for_probation_officers_from_a/,"Hey POs. I'm in Indiana for reference.

I'm currently in college to finish my degree. I would like to work as a probation officer out of college, so I had a few questions that I was hoping any of you could help with (preferably those in Indiana, but any insight from other POs is helpful). 

1: Is this truly a ""40 hour a week"" job? How often is OT?

2: How bad is the paperwork? I don't mind writing at all, I can even find it fun at times, but I've heard time and time again about how god awful the paperwork can be, and I'm getting a bit dissuaded. 

3: I'm particularly looking to go into juvenile probation; what should I look out for/be expecting going into juvenile probation over adult probation? Does anyone think that juvenile is harder than adult or adult is harder than juvenile, etc., and why?

I've always considered getting an MSW and going into therapy, but between the poor pay and the graduate school debt, I just wouldn't feel comfortable. I've also always considered going into law enforcement. With my specific personality traits and interests, I really find the field of probation, and especially juvenile probation, to be a good fit. With all that said, does anyone have any piece of advice for how you should know this field is a good match for you? Like, ""you need to have a heart"" or etc.? I'm going to be doing an internship with at-risk youth sometime soon, so I hope that will provide a lot more insight and give me a better idea as to whether or not juvenile is the way to go. 

Any advice or answers is greatly appreciated! Please feel free to add anything that you think is important."
87texd,1,2018-03-28,Unsure of whether to reconnect with my Dad.,LonelyHarvardBoy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/87texd/unsure_of_whether_to_reconnect_with_my_dad/,"My Dad is a former multi-millionaire. At his peak, he owned 3 Mercedes (They were birthday gifts to my older brother and I when we were 3 and 5 respectively), a BMW, a Range Rover and this one old car which he kept in our garage symbolically since it was first car a bit over 30 years ago at this point. It was a beaten up car that was costing him more on maintenance then the gas for it.


My Dad married my mom after two previous divorces and they had my older brother after a year of marriage. My Dad cheated on my mom virtually every other day (unbeknownst to her at the time ofc) and would make it a personal goal to sleep with 5-10 high end escorts on business trips.


Very long story short, my mom was informed about this from my Dad's very close friend (like childhood friends). A lot of shit went down. My mom told him just to divorce her and there'd be no qualms, just to ensure that we (the kids) weren't affected. We all went to an extremely expensive private school. She said that she wouldn't ask for personal allowances or anything, just for him to pay the tuition and she'd support us for everything else (she didn't even have a job at this point.).


My Dad, outright refused, and instead said that he'd be withdrawing us from the school immediately and will not be paying child support (the whole half your shit and child support payments aren't a thing here.) He did so. Mom intervened in the school, and told that she'd continue paying our tuition fees to the school. We had like a year fees outstanding by my Dad (who although could've paid it, was quite disinterested).


The school understood the situation, and essentially discarded those outstanding fees. My Dad is a bit of a well-known guy in my country and is not largely seen as a good person. She got caught up with the wrong guy.


Dad left, took every single car except for the old one which wasn't running. Mom told him to at least have the courtesy to take the shit one. He said he didn't have to take any of ""her"" shits (obviously implied we were shitters too lol, pretty witty tbh).


A LOT has happened since there. Mom got a job (networked extremely well with a LOT of influential people) and was able to overcome some INCREDIBLE hardship to raise us. She had to borrow a car from her friend to drive us around. It was a manual car so it kept stalling around and I remember memories of her crying on the steering wheel with me in the backseat being unaware of what's going on, pretending to sleep.


Growing up, I'd always wonder why we were able to afford such a good school but not have the same vacations to europe that my friends had etc. As an 18 year old looking back, I can see that she spent EVERY SINGLE FREE CENT she had on our education. 


For a backdrop, our country has free education and health care, so its not as though she had to. As a single mother, noone could blame her for pulling us out and trying to live a more tolerable life or even moving out of this country altogether to go back home and raise us closer to her family.


Ofc, there are so many more examples of the adversity she overcame, but that's not what this is about. My mom would always be consistently informed about news with my Dad (which was scarce since he toggled between living here and elsewhere) through his close friends who were on her side. I don't think It'd be a stretch to say that there wasn't a single person on his side of my family who wasn't in complete support of my mom. I remember my Grandma threatening to disown him if he did not pay our tuition fees, but he just left to a different country for a couple of years in between visits.


Over the period of my life, he lost millions. Sometimes in a single day. His best friend visited us and told us how an asset management company told him to invest in the yen, and in doing so, he lost 5 million US dollars overnight. He wasn't financially literate in investing, but he was a HELL of a business man (Got tons of examples but it'd make this a bit less succinct). 


By the time I was in the process of applying to universities, he had lost his entire fortune. He now owns a smaller house than we do, with the family he laid down with.


My older brother got accepted to a very good university (easily world class but not a Super Ivy league or Stanford etc). He applied for our government's loan but required a guarantor who was a citizen. My mom had to get contact with a relative to convince my Dad to meet my older brother. They did. They did NOT get along well. My dad only agreed if my mom signed a contract saying that if he couldn't pay it back, my mom would bear the debt. My brother left immediately. My aunt upon hearing a rumour, called us up immediately and said she'd sign it.


I got accepted into a Super Ivy League, but received a full scholarship for it. (My mom sent a picture of the acceptance letter of the uni and the scholarship acceptance to him with flipping him off xD). Luckily, i was able to avoid the ""you're gonna have to talk to your father"" thing. 


My Dad received my number from my aunt who messaged me saying that he'd sign the guarantor thing (there isn't one, and he knows that. He isn't stupid). Although I don't despise him or anything, I don't really think about him as a father. He started messaging me more and more after hearing his friends go on about how I've done Investment Banking internships at their firms etc.


When you contact your son after 15 years, only after knowing that he is likely to make a success of himself, you know they aren't interested in you, but the money. He didn't contact us after my mom BEGGED him to get into contact with us (she had a very big cancer scare, but luckily a surgery put it straight) as she might not be there to do so.


I have like 5-6 unread messages and I'm torn between replying politely (That i do not feel comfortable messaging you) or giving him the cold shoulder altogether.


What do you think? I feel like he shouldn't be entitled to my time since I clearly wasn't entitled to his. I do not have any resentment and am trying to phrase my thinking logically. Years of therapy has made me so calm to this type of thing where I can safely say I'll be okay not knowing him. My Dad's friend was a therapist and offered to give me free therapy sessions since supposedly I was really close to him. I don't know though, I don't remember any interaction. My mom was more than enough for me growing up, and I don't want to fall into the cliche of having a relationship with an estranged parent for the sake of it. "

87uq87,1,2018-03-28,I [28M] think my sister [25F] is in a bad relationship. How to talk to her about it?,thelifehypnotic,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/87uq87/i_28m_think_my_sister_25f_is_in_a_bad/,"(Probably Way Too Much) Background Info:
My sister has always been introverted, shy, and hasn’t had many friends or significant others. She had a few friends in High school, almost no friends In college and came home a lot on weekends (only a few hours away from our parents). My parents have always worried about her in a “failure to launch” sort of way. 

I have always been supportive of my sister, though I do sometimes worry that she’s not just introverted, but also has social anxiety and somewhat lonely and is unwilling to talk about her feelings. Her life post-college has really strengthened those worries for me.

Example: she had never had a boyfriend until college. I met her first instantly thought he was a tool. They went out for a year and, unbeknownst to me or anyone else, he was really controlling in their relationship. She lost a lot of confidence in herself. I’m worried that she doesn’t have a lot of experience in relationships and that the few she’s been in have not been fulfilling and have hurt her self-esteem.

Flash forward a few years:
She’s graduated from college - almost two years out now, hasn’t had a steady job really. She’s been dating her current BF (25) since her senior year of college. He is unmotivated and seems immature for his age. He skipped around several majors before dropping out of college. He now goes to a trade school learning IT maintenance. He has an internship with a decent company but if hasn’t turned into a full-time job or anything. 

At first, I thought maybe this relationship might be okay. He seems nice and a little introverted like her. But time has shown that he’s very lackadaisical, makes carless decisions, and focuses a lot on gaming/DND/smoking pot. *Full disclaimer, I have no problem with any of those things in moderation. I do have a problem with how he spends money and leaves the house very dirty despite being home frequently. 

I worry that he’s extremely complacent and not interested in growing as a person. Also worried my sister is going to stagnate and fail to really become an adult. 

What Brought This All to A Head:
My dad is very old-school. Not abusive or anything, but pretty traditional and expects his kids to be productive members of society. My sis being unemployed for almost two months now and plus living with this guy he highly disapproves of has made him super angry with her.

He recently visited her to pick up something from her. He came in to her house, which is crappy crappy, dirty and cluttered. He asked her bf why he was sitting around and not cleaning up (he comes every day at lunch to play Fortnite, btw). The BF’s response was basically “It’s no big deal”, which made my dad livid. He said goodbye and left pretty quickly.

He emailed my sister a letter the next day to say that he thinks her BF is a loser, that he thinks she is wasting her potential, and that she needs to breaks up with him and rethink “where her life is going”. 

Thinking this Through Now:
I admit, that wasn’t the way for my dad to go about it. But, tbh, it’s how I feel too. I’m worried that my sister is depressed, not pushing herself, and becoming complacent because this relationship is low-effort but ultimately not fulfilling or contributing to her well-being or growth. 

My sister is very active, is into working out, likes nature, and doesn’t like to play video games – I honestly don’t even know how much they have in common or what else holding the relationship together other than that they are both fine with this. My sister says she loves him though. She once described him to my mom as “the highschool BF she never had”. 

I’ve privately said that I think her BF is immature, and she agrees with me on that somewhat. She knows he needs to grow up, but I feel like she doesn’t seem interested in pushing him or herself.

I think she needs to break up with him, find a career (or at least a steady job), and find some kind of community/friends, go to therapy and learn to love herself more, and hopefully meet someone that is deserving of her love. 

I’m worried though that pressing that all on her is the wrong move — that she’d only feel judged and withdraw into this bad relationship more. The cat’s out of the bad though, so I need to talk to her about it.

Do I need to say, “Dad is an asshole about it, but I agree with him that this relationship is bad for you” ?

Any advice on if I’m seeing this the wrong way, if I need to consider something I may have missed, or similar experience/solutions that other people have – all are greatly appreciated.  

Thanks in advance, sorry for the length.

TL;DR
My (m/28) younger sister (25) is currently unemployed and living with her BF(25) of 3 years. He is very immature and my family (including me) disapprove of her being with him. My dad recently got into an argument with her about how she needs to break up with him and rethink “what she’s doing with her life” – my dad’s words, not mine. I feel caught in the middle of this and am unsure of how to talk to my sister."
87us7s,4,2018-03-28,My (f/17) bf (m/19) wants me to be into furries and rp but I don't want to and he says he can't live without it,Prooooooops,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/87us7s/my_f17_bf_m19_wants_me_to_be_into_furries_and_rp/,"Prepare for a long one:
(btw I put this here and not on r/teenrelationships because I trun 18 a in a couple months and my bf is 19. If this is the wrong place I apologize.) 

I would ask my parents or friends about this but I don't want to have them judge my partner for what I'm going to say. My bf and I will have been dating for 4 months on the 5th of April. I'm thinking about breaking up with my bf, for many reasons at this point, we have a big fight at least once a month and have disagreements about a lot of stuff but we usually solve it and move forward but I don't know if I want to. I've never really cared for high school relationships in that I know most of them don't last long so whenever I get into one I always go in with the mindset do just enjoying the companionship and the experience while it lasts and never putting to much weight on it, I don't like to think about major things like what if we go married, moved in together, anything like that. 

Around last year my already small group of friends (around 5 real people) all started dating people, going on vacations, getting jobs, internships all that stuff. This meant less time for me to hang out with them and I'm terrible at making friends so I got lonely but decided to act on it by going on Reddit and trying to make friends here. I thought that online friends would be better than embarrassing myself in real life, but online just led to a lot of people asking for my picture only to ghost me, people looking for nudes, or really strange people at times. I very briefly met and dated a guy online which also went terribly. Through all of that I found 3 guys I really talked to and became friends with. 1 of them got feelings for me and tried to trap me with guilt so I cut him off, another guy was cool at first but ended up having a lot of personal issues that stopped us from talking as much. 

The last one ended up being my now bf, he also has depression and I've helped him through it and in turn he helped me through my break up and not 2 weeks after asked me out. I was scared about doing it because it would be another long distance relationship (8 hours away instead of another country away with my ex) and he was into some stuff I wasn't, didn't like a lot of the stuff that I liked, was really emotional and sensitive at times, kinda needy, and most importantly and why our relationship doesn't look to be working right now: he's a fur and likes to rp. I've never been into anything related to furries and role-playing, I find it out of my comfort zone and don t find it fun or entertaining personally but I was willing to be with him if he didn't talk about it too much or try to get me into it. That plan kinda worked for a while but he would randomly say something that was in reference to furries or role play while we were texting and I never liked it and about a month ago I confronted him about it. He apologized and said that he wouldn't do it anymore, I tried to make it very clear that I don't have anything against the activities or him, I just don't enjoy them personally. 

Whenever I would say that response to any of his activities that he tried to get me into he always said that I hated it when I don't feel that way at all. It really hurt him that I wasn't into role playing and furries. In fact last weekend I gave a long improvised speech on how I don't like those things, have no interest in them, and don't want to be involved because he started talking about our future and how he would start putting on pieces of outfits and would try to get me into it. After that conversation he didn't talk to me for the rest of the day or the day after that, since then all the times we've actually talked have been spotty and short. He found some other furries he likes to talk to and I've been trying to hang out irl with my friends more as well. Even with that he told me that me not being a furry really bothered him because he wanted to share that part of him with someone he cared about, I broke and told him if it meant that much to him that I would try it.

 For an hour he explained to me a bunch of furry stuff and showed me drawings and all that stuff. Then yesterday we're talking and he says he doubts it but a part of him thinks that he can change me because of ""evidence"". This ""evidence"" is my infatuation with this fictional action book that has some characters in it that turn into human animal hybrids, I don't even know if I would like it if I tried it out now, it's just a remnant of stuff I used to read in middle school and I have good memories of reading it. He thinks because I liked the book that j must have the potential to be a furry. After I explain that I'm trying this for him so that we can close this chapter in our relationship he says ""Let me put this as bluntly as I can.  I will either live depressed, suppressed even though I have you. Or it will slowly destroy our relationship."" I was surprised and a little hurt but not that much, I had been thinking of the possibility of this whole thing being the end for us, so I told him I agreed but like before I don't think it will ""destroy"" our relationship. 

I still want to be friends and feel like we can learn from our time together, and in total I think we should be happy with the experience that we've had together. So he says that he does think it will destroy it because he can't live without the furry part of a relationship. He constantly acknowledges how stupid it is how important being a fur is in his life and how selfish he feels but I told him that I don't care that he's a fur and that he shouldn't feel bad for it, it's his hobby, it makes him happy, and doesn't hurt anybody so it's fine. I got have a problem with him and his hobbies, I just don't want to participate in it and for all the stuff that I like that he refuses to try at all I feel like it's fair. I also said "" I don't know, this is all a lot easier for me to contemplate and deal with emotionally cause I've thought it all out, and kind of try to be optimistic and have a whatever happens happens sort of view. If I do all my best then I have nothing to worry about cause I did nothing wrong and did everything I could to have everything go well, if it doesn't then that's the way the world made it to be. 

So I'm gonna do my best for myself and you, can you promise that you'll do the same?"" He said he's trying and has changed a lot for the better since we met but he doesn't want us to end so I again repeated that I don't want us to end but but if it's better for the both of us to not date because we wouldn't be able to express and enjoy ourselves then we have to do what's best. But then he said that he would cut off that hobby and in turn part of who he is to keep me but I don't want him to in any way sacrifice happiness for me so he says ""wouldn't you cut off an arm to save your life?"" And I get sort of angry because this is something I've worried about since we became friends, him becoming dependent and thinking that he couldn't live without me, then he said we'll see and that's where all that drama stopped.

 After that I'm left at a crossroads, do I attempt to get into fur and role play even if I don't want to for the sake of our relationship and his happiness or do I end it all for both of our sakes. This is where I need help because if I end it I want to know that I wasn't being selfish in not wanting to get into his kinks. If anyone has any idea about how I should go about this to get the most peaceful and mutual agreement possible, If should stay with him and work it out or not I would greatly appreciate it, the faster the better because the longer this sits with both of us the worse I think it'll be. If you have any questions I'm glad to clarify or go into more detail. After this I'm just gonna try to be more in the real world rather than isolating myself to the internet and looking for foolish teen love."

Although Waterloo is known for its reputation and I am likely to get better co-ops if I do go there, I don't really want another 5 years of misery in school with the work load they give you there.

The only issue I have with Guelph is that I've heard the co-ops aren't as great, so what experiences have those of you in Computer Science or Software Engineering had with co-op, and what are the positions offered that you would say stand out the most?

By the way (since this obviously affects the co-ops you get), I do have a lot of coding experience and would consider myself at the ""Waterloo level"" of coding skills. I also plan on doing an internship outside of school over the course of my first year if it helps."

87vp45,8,2018-03-28,Thinking about starting a small cut-flower operation out of college. Advice?,LeftArmGoose,gardening,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/87vp45/thinking_about_starting_a_small_cutflower/,"I'm 21 and readying to graduate from college with a B.A. in sustainable food systems in early May. I'm actively applying to jobs, but my job market is needs-based and obviously a little niche (love it, as frustrating as it is). I'm torn between getting away from the east coast to take a job... or going home to start a farm. 

My experience: 
I knew early on that I had green thumb and a passion for farming/gardening, so from 7th grade until graduation, I kept a pretty intensive vegetable operation on maybe an 1/8th acre. We've kept chickens since I can remember, dabbled in horses, cows, etc. I was a farm intern all summer last year in my college town. I liked parts of it, but was often very frustrated with the lack of control I had in the operation, the rigidity of rules (operating under the university's strict eye), and my boss aggressively micro-managing every little thing we did. By the end of the summer, I was ready to throw in the towel, but cherish the important know-how I gained. I've attended several conferences and workshops on small, organic farming, done a fair amount of reading and even some university  grant-funded research, and have plenty of close contacts in the industry at home. 

My resources:
I realized that my idea of starting a small farm was a reality when it occurred to me that there would be very little financial stakes involved- I already have the farmland (My parent’s 168 acres, way more than I need), I wouldn't be paying for rent, I would have access to a functional tractor, rototiller, barns, plenty of miscellaneous things like scrap wood and wire, a farm truck. We're close (about 75 min) to the D.C. area, so I'd be able to potentially tap into that market. I also have a connection to a woman in the next town over who runs her own excellent cut-flower operation. We even have a mountain of gorgeous topsoil laying around. My parents aren't farmers, but they were thrilled when I suggested coming home to farm for a period of time. They very generously offered to loan me some money to make it happen. I'd also be starting this all with my partner, so extra hands and a bit necessary moral support. I'd still need a greenhouse of some sort, to set up irrigation and drip lines, to buy seeds, row cover, fencing, etc. 

My Plan: My initial plan is to head home in May and begin to put together a small (half-acre to 1 acre) cut-flower and herb operation, get my hands on about 50 laying hens, and potentially a sheep or two for wool. Ultimately, the goal is to head west in about 2 or 3 years. If our operation at home is successful, then we can justify purchasing farmland in the future in our desired location. 

My concerns are that... getting into farming is scary. I'm not expecting to sunbathe in my ranunculus bed all morning, I know that farming is often less about harmony with nature and more like beating nature into submission- but I'm still scared I have no idea what I'm in for. I have about $60k in student loans, but honestly being able to forego rent and probably a decent amount of food costs really helps to justify the inevitable pay cut I'd take in opening a farm versus getting a job. The operation would be temporary, so forging lasting market relationships would not be realistic. I'd be scrambling to start in mid-May in order to scrape some sort of profit by mid-to-late summer. Also, though it truly pains me to admit this, I sometimes struggle to schedule myself and am easily distracted.

I'm seeking advice... is this a terrible idea? What are the odds that I am able to turn a livable profit, based on my situation? And is there any advice you might have for me? 

EDIT: clarity.

Who is Dr. Jackson?

[ AJC](https://www.ajc.com/news/who-white-house-physician-ronny-jackson/Tx4DB5hFaynF2rJslyduZK/) reports:

U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson became physician to the president in 2013, when he was appointed by President Barack Obama. It’s a position that has been around since George Washington became president, but it did not become official until Congress created the title in 1928. […]

The 50-year-old was born and raised in Levelland, Texas, located in the western part of the state near the New Mexico border. He graduated from Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston in 1991 with a bachelor of science degree in marine biology, according to his [biography](http://disasterfellowship.org/personnel/core-faculty/ronny-l-jackson/). He attended medical school at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, where he graduated in 1995 with a Doctor of Medicine degree.

Jackson then completed his internship at the Portsmouth Naval Medical Center in Virginia and began active duty naval service in 1995. He returned to Portsmouth in 2001 to begin his residency in emergency medicine. He completed his residency in 2004, finishing at the top of his class.

In 2005 he joined the 2nd Marines, Combat Logistics Regiment 25 at Camp LeJeune, North Carolina. He was then deployed to Iraq, where he served during Operation Iraqi Freedom as an emergency medicine physician based out of Taqaddum, Iraq.

While still serving in Iraq, Jackson was appointed a White House physician, serving on the staff of Air Force Brig. Gen. Richard Tubb. He was named the physician to the president in July 2013 and was retained when Donald Trump was elected president.

According to Fox News reporter Chad Pergram, House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Phil Roe (R-TN) is pleased with Trump’s pick.

“Hse Vets Affairs Cmte Chair Roe on Shulkin: I think he’s done a fantastic job &amp; I hate to see him go. That said, I respect President Trump’s decision, support the president’s agenda and remain willing to work with anyone committed to doing the right thing on behalf of..veterans,” Pergram tweeted.

On March 14, CBS News [reported](https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/979112394852110336) that Shulkin’s job was “in jeopardy due to continued fallout from travel expenses and the IG report about misinformation tied to that travel situation.”

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

I’ve been sort of lurking around this sub for a little while, and I was hoping to get some advice/encouragement?

I’m a senior in CS at a good public uni, and next semester is my last one. However, over the last four years I’ve noticed that my feelings of being an imposter have grown steadily worse, and it may have affected my grades. I have a terrible GPA (~2.5), and I have to get at least a C++ average in the rest of my major classes in order to graduate. In other words, I am the living embodiment of “ C’s get degrees”.  I’ve done an internship at a fairly well known company, and I work part time on campus doing web development, but I haven’t really done any side projects. Whenever I come close to doing non-class coding I get this overwhelming fear that my code is/is going to be terrible and not optimized well enough and just *mediocre*. That I am mediocre, and that I won’t be able to get a job. Then that just starts me down a dark hole of self-pity and worry about being able to pay off my student loans, and so on and so forth.  The only classes that I consistently get A’s and B’s in are my classes for my English minor, so I’m worried that I wasted money and time pursuing a CS degree despite my love of coding and problem solving. 

At work I feel completely incompetent the majority of the time. Despite being the senior employee, my boss gives all of the ‘interesting’ or ‘challenging’ projects to my male coworker, and the few times that I was able to take the more difficult assignments, they were all cancelled or used to goad another department into doing their jobs and then cancelled. Over the course of three or so years there I’ve essentially only done bug fixes and refactoring that was almost immediately refactored by my male coworker again. It just feels like nothing that I do is good enough, nor appreciated, and that just further fuels my certainty that I am incompetent and that my code is terrible.  To make matters worse, I feel like whenever I walk into work I become noticeably dumber or something. At the moment it seems like my biggest completed project will be establishing and writing all of the documentation for a web app that has been in active deployment/development for more than 6 years.

Has anyone else had this experience? Any advice for how to deal with these problems and what to look for in post-grad positions?"

I would appreciate any advice you guys might have in helping me decide on where to start my career.

One offer that I received for full time is for a smaller group in a national accounting firm doing bankruptcy/restructuring work. The environment is very positive and I felt very welcome - the only issue is that I wasn't challenged and I don't know if I will be building the skills I want to build. I've been working here as an intern (doing full time work) for the past 8 months. They are coming in at pretty strong (roughly $65k, with a bonus as % of income)

The other offer I received was to join a global restructuring/bankruptcy industry leader in their training program that results in a consultant position. The training program is roughly 2 years long and starts out mostly doing back office work. This is my dream company and where I hoped to end up in 5-10 years post-undergrad. The only downside is that I would have to move to Dallas for this opportunity and stay there for the 2-year training program. Another good thing is that I have a mentor who has been incredibly helpful and he would be able to guide me - I don't think not taking this opp would sour the relationship entirely but it would probably not be as positive.

I am stuck between choosing both offers. In NYC I have my friends, family, girlfriend, and network. I would save on costs of living because I would live with my parents. In Dallas, I would have to start from scratch and the networking opportunities seem slim if things don't pan out as I hope. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Edit: the real question I should be asking is, how do I prevent seeing their faces every day from sending my heart and my mind into a dumpster? It's like Groundhog Day, the lesbian edition. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


Last year, at the beginning of my 4th year clinical rotations, I fell in love with a new intern. Immediately. I have always struggled with my sexuality—although I’ve consistently identified as bisexual since 14, every now and then I would sink into a deep turmoil about whether or not I was actually more interested in women. Before this, I had only ever been in relationships with men (which also made me feel guilty/phony), and had only slept with one woman. The moment I shook my now ex’s hand, that all changed and I was lit on fire.

I embraced a red flag (which actually turned out to be a red herring, and now the source of much of my current agony)--she was adamant about being “broken beyond repair” and that she had reached a place in her life where she could be content basically dying alone. Still I persisted, brazenly, and we finally became an item a couple months later. From the beginning I was completely on board with us keeping it quiet, but I know that for her it wasn’t so much about being professional as it was about a fear of what people would think if they knew she was dating *ME*. She developed friendships with my classmates who would rotate through her service—I am not close with them because I took a year off—namely with this one girl, we’ll call her Melody.
Anyway, we moved fast. We never spent a night apart, so we just ended up u-hauling it. I fell so madly in love with her. My ex would hang out with Melody regularly, and quickly they became best friends. Needless to say, I was fraught with worry. I didn’t know Melody at all. My ex insisted that she absolutely does not find Melody attractive, and that their relationship was strictly platonic. She even told me she asked about Melody’s sexuality, and Melody affirmed that she was straight. Late last year, we decided to tell Melody about our relationship, because my ex felt overwhelmed with guilt about hiding her (and I personally just wanted SOMEONE to know about our relationship).

On Christmas, my ex told me she loved me for the first time. Can I tell you how touching that moment was, how momentous it was? The vulnerability was palpable. I told her that I loved her for the first time over 4 months earlier, and never expected her to be able to say it back. She said that she truly believed that I had taught her how to trust again. A few weeks later, when I was on a required rotation 2 hours away, she surprised me by driving up to meet for dinner. This was the night before she was set to drive 8+ hours for a residency interview. My last picture of her is of her holding a glass of wine at the table, which I had captioned with “I’m so lucky.”

A month later, Melody and my ex went out to celebrate another classmate’s birthday. At the bar, they each texted me, begging me to come. This was not the norm, and it made me exceedingly uncomfortable (both the thought of going, as well as wondering why the fuck all of a sudden it was so important that I come on this occasion, when every other time I've done my own thing and it wasn't a big deal) .I was perfectly fine not hanging out with their group; not only did I not know any of Melody’s friends before I started dating my ex, I also felt that I wouldn’t be able to be genuine/it would seem fishy if I was just pretending to be a new friend of theirs.

I refused, but they continued texting me (Melody was repeatedly offering to buy me drinks and be my ""buddy""; my ex kept saying please until it got to the point where she sulkingly said, “fine.”). Being the guilt tripee that I am, I saw ""fine"" and had to make it out to her by putting down my book and glass of wine, suiting up and meeting them at the bar. I remember thinking on my way past the bouncer, ""what am I doing here?"". My natural response to feeling this level of discomfort and awkwardness was to drink until I got sick. Aaaand my ex took that in the worst way possible. The fallout lasted 4 days; she basically spent the rest of the weekend with Melody. When she returned she matter of factly said that she did not want me to come with her wherever she got a residency (I had been looking for jobs at the various places where she had applied). I was floored, because that put an expiration date on our relationship. When I confronted her about that, she said she didn’t want me to move out and that she still wanted me to be her girlfriend. Nevertheless, I was inconsolable. The next few days were a blur, but basically her thoughts only went downhill from there, until she finally came home one day and said she didn’t want to be with me anymore.

I spent the following week in a daze, sleeping on couches. I knew my ex was stressed about the fast approaching “match day” for her prospective residency, so I reached out to Melody and said that I couldn’t offer support to my ex, but I knew she needed it. Melody simply said that she didn’t want to get involved in “your guys’ relationship”. When I pointed out that I wasn’t talking about that, she brushed me off.

I went through a few surges of impulse-texting my ex out of unbridled emotion. I wanted closure. I saw my opportunity the weekend after she had broken up with me—she let me know that she wasn’t home that weekend and that I could pick up my stuff from our old apartment. Her computer was in plain sight. Before I knew it, I was scrolling through endless texts between her and Melody. There was baby talk, celebration of their cuddling/kissing, and gossip about me that extended back to at least the night I got drunk. I couldn't (and for the love of god shouldn't) have gone through them all. My ex fucking cheated on me. Not just by kissing and messing around with Melody, but by having an emotional affair with her that she swore was just a platonic friendship.

That night, I totaled my car while I was trying to make it through the winding coastal highway to my cousin’s home. I shouldn’t have driven while I was in such hysterics, but I haven't found much relief since. The cycle of rage, self pity, confusion, bitterness, sense of betrayal, grief... It never ends. It took a week to sensor my urges to text her, which vacillated from venomous jabs directed towards both her and Melody, to petty rationalizing. My behavior was overall pretty immature. I finally made NC for 2 weeks but then broke it when I saw them driving around town together. I was so fed up with it a month later that I changed my rotation schedule so that I could get some credit off campus/out of town, and then return when Melody was supposed to be out of town (my ex mentioned multiple times, both haphazardly in January as well as when I moved out, that Melody would be in California working at clinics). Well, on Monday morning when I got back to campus, I was greeted by Melody’s smug little face in the hallways. She had changed her schedule to be with her. I know this, because Melody lives a few blocks away from my new apartment, and I see their cars there at night.

Melody and my ex have always hung out at school. But now, they are hanging out more than ever (it almost seems like Melody never actually does anything at school except wander the halls, and loiter around my ex's side of the hospital). I wouldn’t be surprised if they disclosed their relationship to Melody’s friend group. Even if they haven’t, I can’t imagine that it’s hard to figure out with all that wandering and hanging out. Anyone with half a brain knows that there are literally no fucks to be given about what those people think or know, yet I still hang my head in shame. 
...I’m ashamed that she made me look like a fool and left me for someone who she’s under the illusion of thinking is “better” than I am. She’s only shared “good days” with Mariah. Theirs was a lighthearted, gossip-ridden, friendship based on perceived similarities in personality. My ex loved that they see themselves as similar people, and I don’t think my ex liked that she and I had reasonable differences. They never had to hide their relationship, stress over bills, you know—the usual unpleasant stuff that couples sometimes get testy about. Melody looks appealing in that way. Melody never professed a perhaps off-puttingly intense sense of commitment in the way that I did—I have a pretty good feeling that when I was actively looking for jobs where she might get a residency was too real, too fast. 

Then again, isn’t dumping your girlfriend and jumping right into a new relationship 4 months before you’re both supposed to move a little real, and a little fast?
 
I’ve spent the last 3 days harnessing every ounce of energy I have to keep myself from falling apart. I only have to see my ex randomly every now and then, because she is permanently located on one side of the hospital. Melody is in my area. It seems like every time I turn a corner, there she is. Today, I was rounding with my rotation in the main atrium, and Melody and my ex stroll by the windows directly in front of us and sit down to lunch together.

A big component of my struggle is comprehending the betrayal. That red flag that was actually the red herring: In the beginning, I understood when my ex said that she was so broken from having her trust violated in past relationships, so unprepared and caught off guard when I pursued her. Admittedly, in an alternate universe where the reasons she left was because of an inability to love or trust, I still would be devastated. But the fact is that she dumped my ass for someone else. I still can’t seem to process this. Nor do I know how to handle having to be reminded of all of this every single day when I see their faces. My ex doesn’t seem phased one bit, as if she’s forgotten me altogether.

I’ve actually truly disliked school, and have known for a long time that if given a second chance, I would never have gone. As I mentioned, I took a year off. This was in the middle of my third year, so all my close friends have graduated and moved away. I joined my current class last year. My point being that I can’t find much comfort in my work right now. 

I love her with all my heart. She is a hell of a woman. She has a drive like none other; I was so excited at the prospect of harmonizing my future with that unstoppable force. I didn't care where we ended up, as long as I could do my work where she was. Now I just don't care at all. 
In the last text I sent her, I said that she was no better than [her ex who ""broke"" her beyond repair] and that now I understand what it's like to believe you won't ever be able to trust again.

87xgsk,3,2018-03-28,How to Handle My Student Loans (and Emergency Fund?),CapnDanger,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/87xgsk/how_to_handle_my_student_loans_and_emergency_fund/,"I'm currently on the REPAYE plan, but my last job was minimum wage so I was blessed with a monthly payment plan of $0. I don't have to re-certify until May to begin payments in July, so I'm holding off on that as long as I can so I can save some money. My big question is, should I drag these loans off as long as I can by making just the minimum payment, and use my money elsewhere (savings, investment, travel/experiences, etc.)?

Little bit about me:

* 23 y/o, graduated from college in Dec. 2016
* Current income $50,000, but I started this job end of Feb. so I'll get closer to $40,000 in 2018.
* Currently owe about $2,000 in credit card debt accrued during my minimum wage internship last year, but I've doubled my payment to this to ~$110 a month. My goal is to pay this off by December 2019. 
* My credit is good, but not great - I've never missed a payment, even if I only paid the minimum, and my only negative factors against me are that high amount of credit card debt, and the fact that all my accounts are pretty young - I've had the credit card open about a year and a half, and the student loans are all 5 years old or younger. 
* My employer offers 50% match on 401(k) up to 6%. I am currently maxxing this out by investing 6% into the 401(k), and I chose the Roth contribution option. 

Loan situation:

* $3,368 in a Perkins loan at 5% APR, minimum payment of $40 that I have paid every month since December.
* $2,254 in a subsidized Stafford loan at 3.86% APR
* $5,500 in a subsidized Stafford loan at 4.29% APR
* $5,500 in a subsidized Stafford loan at 4.66% APR

So my two big questions are as follows:

* As stated before, should I be in any rush to pay these student loans off? Is it more worthwhile now to just pay the minimum payments and invest/save the rest of that money (or put it to credit card debt or travel/experiences/life)? 
* If I should be dragging these on, I believe that due to my income change, my REPAYE monthly payment will jump to around $220 a month, which is higher than the standard repayment plan. Is it worth it (or even legal) to change to a normal repayment plan, and pay a minimum of around $140 a month instead of that $220?

Thanks in advance!"

I currently have a 3.23, and am very hopeful that it will improve after this semester. Also, I have passed FM and am sitting for P and MFE this summer, so hopefully next fall I will have 2 or 3 exams on my resume. HOWEVER, because my school's risk/act sci department is so large (our GIS chapter is the largest in the country) all on campus recruiting is extremely competitive. For the most part, every other junior will also have 2 or 3 exams on their resume. Is there anything I can do this summer to make me a more ideal internship candidate? I have a couple interviews with some internships that are completely non insurance related, however I doubt I will receive offers since I can't commit to a 10 week program this summer. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!"
87xqvq,1,2018-03-28,How quickly should I build my emergency fund?,CapnDanger,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/87xqvq/how_quickly_should_i_build_my_emergency_fund/,"Sorry for multiple posts in a short time-span, but the short story is I just started a new job about a month ago and am now in a position where I can start saving (my last job was a minimum wage internship). Currently I'm saving $200 a month towards my emergency fund, but I'm wondering if that's enough. My goal is to have $2,000, which is about 1 month of expenses, by the end of this year.

87yby7,10,2018-03-29,Eye for an eye.,Irwin_126,DDLC,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/87yby7/eye_for_an_eye/,"""The time is now."" I say under my breath, try to mask it behind the noise going on right now. Perfect time for the band to go ape outside. Everyone is busy around me. Yuri's reading, Natsuki's watching the chaos unfold outside. (Here's a hint, our school band is not very good.) And Monika is arguing with Sayori about the meaning of life. I'm shocked either of them are having the conversation in the first place. But it'll do, If I don't do this today I'll never get another chance. I promised to dump it last week but I forgot. And last time I checked Yuri doesn't forget.

I bring out the book, With it's eye seemingly glowing amidst the room. It's only ever done this in the classroom, at home it's as dead as... Well.... A Book. But something isn't right about it. It's as if I have a connection to it, despite only ever skimming it. It only seems to glow whenever I'm around it, Yet as I ask anyone about it I get the same old answers. Not that I don't like listening to them, I just heard all of it already. Honestly I'm shocked Player even managed to add in a band club mod, despite everyone in the club being both here and out there. It's almost like they can't think of any other people to add into it, Heck the edit's they did aren't even as good as I hoped. I can still see the outlines!

Crap! Only got 5 more minutes until Monika's speech. Time to strike! 

With one swift motion I pull out Yuri's knife I stole from her. Because Player is an idiot and can't think of a better place to write where to put Yuri's knife other than In the casing. They also can't seem to forget we got a whole story still running in the background here that they forgot to close. There's no use trying to hide the knife, It made a very distinct and loud noise as soon as I pulled it out, Draging attention to me as if I was going to use it on them.

I'm not that stupid, Not yet anyways.

I pull back and stab right in the center of the eye on the cover, Anywhere else and it would do no affect. I'd assume.

...
""Hey, MC to world here! Wake up!""
I'm awoken by an annoying girl with a loud speaker in my ear. I always was a heavy sleeper.
""Ugh, do you always have to do that? Your going to scare someone!"" I said, still trying to fall back asleep.
""Look, either you work or I drag your ass to Leader and we let them decide your fate."" 
""Yeah yeah, Fine. I'll go check on em'. Just don't try and wake me up after, I need to sleep sometime in this hell hole."" 
I clean the dust between by eyes and put on a ""fresh"" coat. Last time I checked we don't clean these, got sick because of one of em' having a puke stain in the dead center of it. Despite having full power we can't clean shit.
""Please state your name and occupation"" The guard says as dead as our guests. I'm guessing he gave up trying to act tough.
""MC, Head of affairs, I need to pass through to get to work.""
The guard sighs, with annoyance in his voice, he says
""Not your nickname, your real name.""
""That **Is** my real name."" 
""Not on your record. You don't pass until you say it.""
""Ugh, do I have to? I work here for god's sake!""
""Do you want to join the test subjects or test them? Say your damn name.""
With a heavy sigh, and trying to mask it from my fellow co-workers. I utter
""Mike Clair""   
God that's embarrassing. Why did they have to finish my documents *before* I was born.
""Pass through, Next!""
...
That's the last time I use the checkpoints, I don't care if it's the safest choice. I don't want to be publicly embarrassed each time I walk into work. Besides it's not like it's a good job where you are able to block out the people around you and understand what you need to do. Noooo. I have to remember every one I see unless I want to be washed and removed. And last I checked they aren't as friendly as you'd think.
""Hey MC! Over here!""
Before I can head to my office, I'm greeted with an intern, who proceeds to fill my hands with paperwork reaching the roof. 
""We need all these done by next week, We keep getting run-in's going in and out of top floor. Personally I think we should-""
I block out the rest of her rant while I skim over the paperwork, Surprisingly It's more entertaining than hearing an unpaid freak talk about hidden doors and attempts to bury us all underground to avoid assholes walking in on our property. Or worse of telling others about it.
""Anyways, Best of Luck!"" She runs off, And I attempt to open my door with my foot. Surprisingly it worked. While I try and sort things out, I'd figure I'd get some sleep. I got till next week to finish these, and in the comfort of my own office,  Who's going to stop me?

Besides, the last few dreams I've been having have been interesting. Though I doubt it's going to end well. "
87ydyk,0,2018-03-29,"My girlfriend [22F] of 3 years is going to grad school this coming Fall, I am having difficulty with the idea of following her, now we are having serious discussions about if we should stay together",CosmoticWayfarer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/87ydyk/my_girlfriend_22f_of_3_years_is_going_to_grad/,"My girlfriend and I started dating our junior year of college, we went to the same school and had been friends, at a certain point we started being romantically interested in each other. We continued to date the rest of undergrad, and after graduation she moved back home to Florida and I took a job in Maryland almost right after school. We have been doing long-distance since, and for the most part our relationship has been wonderful.

While she was working at home, I knew she had plans to go to graduate school, and initially planned to do so after a year. She decided to delay it a year further, and is now intending to go this coming Fall. About a year ago, I could sense some sort of tension rising in our relationship. I couldn't tell if it was due to how long we had been long distance, or if the looming thought of her graduate school plans coming into sight. Either way, once she began her application process, the tension/stress ramped up. She was stressed over deciding where to go/apply, and ended up applying and auditioning (she is pursuing music performance) to 5 schools. In the past few month, she heard back final decisions regarding schools, and only got into 1 of her schools, albeit it was one of her top choices.

Meanwhile, my job in Maryland has taken a winding path. I initially started as an intern, and was offered a permanent job after my internship ended. I initially declined, as I felt the position wasn't necessarily the best fit for me at the time, and I began to look at other job opportunities (including applying and interviewing for a job in my girlfriend's hometown). However, the CEO of my company (small company) asked me to stay because he respected my decision and everyone liked me and my work. I agreed, and I entered a different position at the beginning of the new year. I was in that position for 6-9 months, and things moved along fine. I didn't love the job at times, but it wasn't unbearable, and the company treated/treats me extremely well in all aspects. Over the course of last year, I began to have more responsibilities added to my plate. In January, I was promoted, given a 10% raise, and told I would be given even more responsibilities in the coming year. I had begun to be excited about my prospects and role, and how I could continue to grow where I was.

One of the schools my girlfriend applied to was at University of Maryland, and I would have been able to keep my current job. However, the school she got into is in Boston, which, while though not terribly far away, is far enough that I would have to find a new job. During her application and audition process, I began to feel very stressed about the prospect of moving to a new place and finding a new job, given my success at my current job and how well I was treated. I felt/feel that I likely would not be able to find another job that treated me as well, was as secure financially, and offered me the same prospects and benefits. Furthermore, although she intends to take out loans, I would want to be able to support her and us as much as possible, and I feel this pressure to find a job that pays as much as possible to make our life together comfortable, especially given that we would be living in a high COL area (Boston).

I am an very logical and analytical person, and it has taken me a lot to begin to warm up to the idea of moving to Boston. However,  I have thought about it a lot, and I think given my age and that Boston would have decent job prospects, it wouldn't be the biggest risk in the world, and if I truly care about this person (which I do) I could make that move for her. I haven't been the most supportive or positive partner during this process, and I have repeatedly apologized to her for that. I visited Boston with her for her audition, and tried to be as open and excited as possible, and I did enjoy it.

Tonight, she called me to talk. I wasn't expecting it, but she sprung on me that she has been having serious thoughts about our relationship and each of our own goals and priorities. She feels that maybe we may not be the best fit for each other, and that it shouldn't be this hard and stressful for us if we both truly want to be together.

I feel extremely conflicted. Over the past year and a half, my job has gotten much better, I am doing well financially, I like where I live, and things are going well. However, I don't want to become obsessed with the idea of making the most money I can, or being as comfortable as I can be. I want to support my girlfriend, who I love, with this huge step in her career. I have had worries thinking about, if the roles were switched, would she do the same for me. She is a singer, a very demanding and uncertain career, while my career prospects are much more suited toward being in the same place for longer periods of time. But, I think a move to Boston could work for me, and maybe I am just being to unreasonable or scared, and I am letting that get to my head, and hers, too much.

/r/relationships: Am I being a bad partner or acting selfish or too cautious? I know relationships are about compromise (if you truly want to be with the other person) but is compromise the best for both of us now? Are her feelings right, and maybe we're not fit for each other. What worries me most, is the thought that I am prioritizing financial stability, job security, and being ""comfortable"" over what I think truly matters in the end: the people we surround ourselves with. 

Any advice would be much appreciate for those that have read through all of this. Feeling somewhat lost.


tl;dr: Girlfriend going to grad school, would need to leave good job to follow, unsure if right decision for both of us, am I being a selfish and material prick?"

One of the sets of Allegations against her (the new Mindboss CEO)

https://imgur.com/a/fC868

&gt; Throughout the weekend, we were flirty-- They are legitimately charismatic, and we had a connection going on that I really appreciated during a chaotic time. However, during the last night where I experienced come-ons where I rejected them, and slept by myself on a couch.

&gt; I received DMs the next day that were belligerent, to say the least, asking why I did not sleep with them that night. When I said I wasn't in the mood, they became even more angry, and ended up cutting contact completely with me, saying that we should not talk anymore.

&gt; My experience is not the only one in this nature-- Other people, who are in the furry fandom, have reported issues with her aggressively pursuing sex when told no. One person, who is in a closed relationship, reported that her response to refusing her advances was--

&gt; -- being locked out of their hotel room for hours while she slept with another person. Another was accused of transphobia when refusing her advances, attempting to manipulate them (a non-binary individual) into sex.

&gt; ANOTHER said that their first interactions with her was her imitating another artist in the furry fandom.

&gt; This is all hearsay, of course, having deleted the logs after the incident out of stress from the incident. But because of but having heard enough voices of people close to me who have experienced this, people who have much more to lose than I do, I need to speak out.

&gt; People who are scared of the repercussions of speaking out about it, or dredging up these incidents publicly. I am going to use my voice and my experiences.

So yeh accusing people of Transphobia for turning her down...........

Ex employee of Feminist Frequency has written about the Mindboss allegations on Gamasutra

http://archive.fo/VozPy

Some choice quotes

&gt; One, Tyler Gausvik, took to Twitter to confirm the substance of the allegations, saying there was “a lot of sexual harassment/misbehavior, emotional manipulation, and other really toxic behavior. I was threatened with litigation when I spoke out.” 

&gt; I’ve been a guest of honor at GaymerX in both the US and Australia (though the latter was run by an entirely different set of people). I’ve met wonderful people at GX, making lifelong friends there and even meeting a few romantic partners. To say my personal experience was positive was an understatement. My role as a guest involved comped badges and sometimes comped hotel rooms, a precious commodity at any convention. I was briefly supported on Patreon by MidBoss (to the tune of four dollars total) before I requested that they cease doing so because it created the appearance of a conflict of interest.

&gt; Longtime staffer, Toni Rocca, would lead the company and oversee reforms--such as developing an HR department--according to the statement. She tweeted that she would be “working on MidBoss moving forward,” though she’s now confronting serious allegations of her own--including inappropriate sexual behavior and racism.

&gt; She has issued a strenuous denial of one specific allegation that she’d told an employee of color to keep other non-white MidBoss employees happy purely to give the company a cosmetic appearance of diversity, rather than because of their inherent value.

&gt;But the sexual harassment allegations are even more severe. One man came forward late last night to offer his own story on Twitter, alleging that Conn brought him on board for a GX internship and then immediately began looking through his phone messages, encouraging him to break up with his boyfriend. “He made constant comments about my appearance, telling me I COULD be handsome if I changed my beard, or hairstyle, etc. He used phrases similar to 'Well, I like my guys to look like that, so you should do it.' He became annoyed when I said I liked the way I looked.” In addition:

**I've never felt I've deserved anything.** Guilt and shame is just so innate. And I'm sorry to myself.

I blame a lot of things and people for a lot things that are hurting so, so much in me... but that's okay.

It's fucking hard.

I cannot separate things, but you've maybe made me realise that... they *are* two separate things: my internship and... my schoolwork.

I've never never never, *ever*, thought that I fucking deserved anything. Fucking never. Never. Fucking never.

I am too hard on myself. I feel that is so because of my parents. Because I've fucking internalised their *fucking* ""life is hard"", fucking ""suck it up"", ""that's your problem"" kind of fucking mentally.

**I fucking expressed myself and now I feel fucking guilty. Fuckkkkkkkkk**

Fuck.

I blame my mother, mostly. I'm sorry. I'm so so fucking sorry **but I don't know what the fuck to do**. *I fucking don't.* I **fucking** *don't*. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. I fucking just fucking hate thing. I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry. Fuck. I'm sorry. Fuckkkkkkkkk. Someone please fucking help me. Please. Fuckkkkkkkkk. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Fuck. Ahh.

That's how I fucking feel.

It's late. Will try to be honest, further, tomorrow. Fuck."

87z0ys,7,2018-03-29,Any international software eng/CS students? How are your experiences with internships and where do you plan to head after graduation?,1100H19,CalPoly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/87z0ys/any_international_software_engcs_students_how_are/,"I am a Canadian student debating on whether or not I should come to Cal Poly to study software engineering. Cal Poly is a great school but will be ~80k CAD more expensive than if I go to a top Canadian school (Waterloo, though I did not get into co-op). On the other hand, California is where I want to end up because my family is moving to Danville (small town in NorCal). Our green card is processing, but it is very possible that I turn 21 before it's complete. Anyway, the benefit of going to a US school, especially a great school like Cal Poly, is the F1 Visa which might allow for better internship opportunities. At the same time, I'm not certain if I will be able to immigrate to the US. I would love to hear about any international students who can comment on finding internships (I heard there is discrimination against F1) and plans after graduation."
87z56k,2,2018-03-29,Late night thoughts on another sleepless night,wrappedinquilts,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/87z56k/late_night_thoughts_on_another_sleepless_night/,"I’m so tired. It’s been three days without adequate sleep. Maybe two hours a day? If I’m in class, I don’t put any effort in my work. If I’m skipping class, I’m spending all day on my couch to just move to bed when I feel like it’s bedtime. I just sit there looking at the walls and just cry. Why can’t I sleep? I just want a night’s rest.

I feel worthless. When I spend my days on the couch, I just shit on myself for not doing anything. I graduate this semester after six years of hell and you would think I would be excited to graduate, but I’m not. I’m scared shitless. I’ve applied for so many ljobs, but I’ve heard nothing. They say my internships are great, but they would like me to have my master’s. I’d love to get my masters, but I need a break from school. I don’t want to start my master’s program while feeling this way. I know how that story ends. There is so much unknown in my life, it makes me uneasy and just shut down and hide. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about the time I had the gun in my hand. Contemplating the pro’s and con’s to my quality of life. I wanted to do it so bad. I remember the tears running down my face because I had come to the realization that this is what I wanted. But, my parents, boyfriend, and friends, what would they think? Would they think it’s their fault? Would they have regret for not always being there? I didn’t want that for them. They didn’t deserve that pain. I sold the gun the next day. That was in July and I never told anyone that. I guess I didn’t want to be told I had a problem or I just think I can handle everything on my own.

But I can’t. I can’t handle it on my own and I’m realizing that. I am scared I’ll get back to that low point of analyzing my quality of life.  I don’t want that. I really don’t. I know I have something to offer, whether I feel it now, I know it’s there. But I just have so much hate for myself and I don’t know where it comes from. I try to make sure those around me are cared for, but why can’t I do the same for myself? 

Where’s the fast track course on how to love yourself the way you love others? 

I want help. I want to be better. I want to look and feel better. But as much as I want it, I can’t do it. There’s too much fear in this unknown path of self care that eats me alive. Will I become aware of demons I’ve shut away? Will I learn that I’m not that great of a person? What if this process of self care ends up on me figuring out everything I hate about myself is true? What do I do then? "
87z6br,4,2018-03-29,Weirdo Raptor Script,TheScumAlsoRises,JurassicPark,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/87z6br/weirdo_raptor_script/,"Bored in a waiting room, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/87x4gw/rip_daniel/dwglsua/?context=3) the following weird, stupid script after seeing a [raptor-related front page post](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/87x4gw/rip_daniel/) on /r/funny. It's stupid and weird and getting downvoted there for some reason. It's embarrassingly weird. But here goes:

Free idea for a sitcom: ""RaptorBoss"" or maybe ""Vel-Office Raptor."" I can't believe I wasted time writing this goddamn thing:

*FADE IN:*


*[RaptorBoss is conducting a job interview with a promising new candidate, TriceraTom. The interview takes place in an open area positioned between poorly-managed, dying office fern bushes and a strange collection of copiers and coffee machines]*



**RAPTORBOSS:**

Impressive resume, TriceraTom, but we want more than experience. We want smarts. 


*[Points at co-workers: two women and an obese man]* 


Take a look at those losers. They used to be intelligent, even problem-solving intelligent. Especially the big one.


I’ve managed most things you can manage, but the way those things procrastinate…


*[The printer, copier and coffee machine all malfunction simultaneously]*


**STEGASUSAN:**

They should all be destroyed!



**RAPTORBOSS:**

Dammit, Danonychus! You really did it this time! What did I tell you about buying those cheap off-brand copiers? You spared a shit-ton of expense with those goddamn things!


**DANONYCHUS:**

Remind me again who wanted to straddle the hell out of the copy machine to discover what photocopies of a six-inch retractable appendage looked like in Xerox form?

You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could – and whether or not the new crop of interns would dig it – that you never stopped to think if you should.


**TRICERATOM:**

Why would you need to straddle the copier to make copies of your toe claw?



**RAPTORBOSS:**

Who said I was Xeroxing my toe claw?

Besides, it’s worked on interns before. I was systematically testing them for weaknesses, scientifically. 


*[Raptorboss awkwardly attempts shooting a seductive glance at one of the interns]*


I know exactly what you’re thinking about these new pants: “Wow – what does he have in there, King Kong?”


*[Looks again at the interns, focusing on one in particular]*

I'm going to call you Amber. Because you're about to be full of Dino DNA.


**STEGASUSAN:**

Jesus Christ. Yeah, the lawyers are still interviewing witnesses from the last crop of interns. 


They remember…Because they have to. They’re under oath.


 **DANONYCHUS:** 

I’m actually surprised to see you being interviewed, TriceraTom. RaptorBoss said he was only hiring female employees from now on – even though it makes no sense. Most of us can’t tell who is male and female anyway.


**TRICERATOM:**


*[Smiling uncomfortably and attempting to lighten the mood with humor]* 

So how do you know they’re female? Does someone walk around and look under everyone’s skirts? [Laughs] 



 **RAPTORBOSS:**

*[Raptorboss greets the joke with a stony silence and a blank, serious expression]*


…How did you know? Were you watching us? I’ve only been checking skirts the past two weeks…I bet you think you have me right where you want me. I bet you think you think you’re a real clever girl… 



**TRICERATOM:**

I’m not a girl...


*[TriceraTom notices a rustling in his periphery. He turns to see the office fern bush part, revealing a grinning – and clearly aroused – Danonoychus inches away from his face]* 



**DANONYCHUS:** 

You may not be a girl. But I am…



**TRICERATOM:**

Clever g…

880gpn,5,2018-03-29,My thoughts on grown ish season 1.,Kissyu,Blackish,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackish/comments/880gpn/my_thoughts_on_grown_ish_season_1/,"So grown ish wrapped up last night with what to me was on of the funniest episodes. 

As a while grown ish started poorly with the show focusing on her love life mostly. The second half of the show was much better with episodes focusing on social issues, and while the execution wasn't the greatest, the spirit was there. 

One of the themes of the series was Zoeys adderal abuse. However that story line abruptly ended with no real consequences to Zoey. In a way I was expecting that the finale to address it. 

When Zoey had to choose between 3 guys, I was expecting that post adderal Zoey finds out her grades were slipping and after the hickup in her internship she hit rock bottom without realizing it, because she couldn't manage her social and school life without the drug. After that she would realizes she needs to stop chasing boys and focus on herself, thus choosing no one.

But alas that didn't happen and she choose Luca. To be fair I think he was the best of the bunch, but I still think the season didn't address one of its biggest themes. Hopefully the next season is better written and thought out, because I did love their characters a lot. "

I am trying to get into any IT/software/engineering related entry (gs5 or gs7) position. I am wondering how likely it is given my experiences:

 1. I graduated from an accredited university on May 2017, with a computer engineering degree. 

 2. I have 1 technical internship experience, and a 6 month working experience as a full time software developer.
 
 3. I am not a vetern.

I am currently using the recent grad filter on USAJOBS, and apply to every position possible. Is there any of you with similar experiences as me who got hired through the recent grad program? Any insight is appreciated. Thank you!"

Audrey was released from the hospital the next day. Honestly, I think they only kept her as long as they did due to her mental state, which was, understandably, not good. None of ours was.

“Addi’s parents asked me to pick out clothes for..for..her..” She told us at my door, unable to bring herself to say ‘funeral’. “I can’t. I can’t go back there.”

Sarah nearly scooped her up, as she ushered her inside, but was careful of her arm in the sling. Audrey was referring to the studio apartment she had shared with Addison, a couple blocks from the spot where Addison died.

“I can’t go back there, alone.” She finished, choking back tears.

“You don’t have to—“ Sarah began.

“We’re coming with you.” Claire finished.

Audrey weighed maybe a hundred pounds after gorging on beer and pizza. I had never seen her look so thin, as she did that day. Before I realized what I was doing I’d gathered her up in my arms, and just held her, if only to remind myself that she was still there. I felt hands on my back, and arms wrapping around me, Claire’s, Sarah’s, Audrey’s. It took me a minute to realize that some of the tears flowing were mine.

***

When we got to Audrey and Addison’s apartment, I collapsed on the couch, opting to let them go through Addison’s things. Instead, I got lost. That’s easy to do when your memory is like mine. This place, less than a year past. Claire and I had been dating for about three months. We all went to Auds' and Addi’s place to play some silly card game.

“I shit you not,” Addison said, laughing, “My mom tried to convince me I wasn’t gay.” She picked up her drink and took a healthy swallow. “She actually tried to tell me that I wasn’t gay, I just needed to find an effeminate boy with a small penis.”

“No.” Claire said in disbelief.

“Oh, this is true.” Audrey added.

“You’re fucking with me, right?” I replied, conscious of the fact that I was the new person in this circle.

“Nope.” Addison grinned. “They came around eventually, but I was fourteen! I’d never even kissed a girl, or a boy for that matter, and my save-yourself-for-marriage mother is trying to convince me to just fuck a guy with a little dick and see how I like it!”

“That’s horrible.” I said, trying not to laugh.

“Mortifying.” Addison corrected, “But Mom and Dad had my back, once they came to terms.” She explained, cracking open a fresh beer. “Dad went to the pastor at our old church. He gave him all sorts of literature on those ‘conversion therapy camps’—“

“That’s barbaric.“ Sarah said, without thinking.

“Exactly.” Addison continued. “Dad said the same thing. When Mom and Dad told the pastor they wouldn’t send me to one of those places, he told us not to come back.” She sipped at her beer. “Truthfully, that hurt the worst. I loved going to that church, I loved singing every Sunday, it was fun, really. And all my old friends acting like I had the goddamned plague or something. I was like, ‘look you stupid bitches, you can’t catch the gay.’” She chuckled. “If that were the case I would given it to Sally Weiss.” 

Audrey’s eyes went wide, Addison grinned at her, “Fourteen, baby.”
Audrey cocked her head and grinned back at her. Then, almost in unison, they blew kisses at each other.

This was the one time I wished I could share the clarity of my memory with someone. I would’ve given every conversation with Addison to Audrey, without hesitation. Because, I’d never forget her. For Audrey, the memories would slowly fade. Somehow, that seems almost worse.

***

Claire, Sarah, and Audrey had come up with an outfit for Addison: A violet turtleneck sweater dress, black leggings, comfortable shoes.

Then Audrey came out of the bedroom with a thick, fuzzy, woolen pair of socks. “She always gets cold.” She said, her breath coming in short, hitching gasps. “I don’t want her to be cold.”

Sarah caught her around the waist, before she collapsed completely, and I caught them both before they fell together.

 Whatever Audrey tried to say next dissolved into a sharp, keening cry. That time, it didn’t take me very long that some of the tears were mine.

Sometime later, we handed off the clothes to Addison’s parents. Audrey fell asleep, weeping in their bed that night, clutching Addison’s pillow. Claire curled up beside her and cried with her. Sarah and I stayed with them, until sleep threatened.

I slipped out because I knew better than to fall asleep in the apartment Audrey and Addison had shared for the past two years. Sarah slipped out because she had been sad for long enough and needed to get angry, or drunk, or both.

I walked out on the balcony, didn’t bother to find a chair, and just slid down the wall, until I was sitting on the deck. Sarah sat down beside me.

“She was the first one, you know.” *Please, Sarah, don’t tell me this.* “Addi was the first one to place her seal of approval on you.”
 Sarah said, as she reached into her purse and came out with a pint of Shit-Whiskey. She twisted the cap off and took a healthy swig. Then she offered it to me, I thought about waving her off, but took it anyway.

“Claire had a habit of dating douchenozzles.” She explained when I offered it back to her. “I, honestly, thought you were another one. Addi knew better. Don’t you fucking forget it.” She wiped her eyes, took another drink and handed me the bottle.

I put my arm around her and pulled her in close, kissed the top of her head, and said, “You’re one of the best friends I’ve ever had, Sarah.”

By this time, she had handfuls of my shirt and was crying, a mixture of rage and sorrow into my shoulder. “Take care of her.” She managed, after she caught her breath.

“I will.”

“You fucking better.” She was quiet for a moment, “David, I was so scared. I thought I was going to die.”

“So was I.” I told her. “I’ve never been more afraid of anything in my life.” I was telling her the truth. The thought of losing Claire, it breaks a piece of me every time it comes to mind. “And that’s saying something, because I’m afraid of everything.”

Sarah gave me a look that said *You?*

“I’m afraid of road trips. Flying, boats, water. Falling asleep. Hell, my own reflection scares me sometimes. People have been trying to hurt me for my entire life.” I explained her, truthfully as I could.

“David.” I hadn’t noticed Claire had come out to the balcony. Her face had gone pale, concern etched on her face. “I-“

“The thought off losing you, I—Well, I’d rather die.”

She came to me in two quick steps and threw her arms around. “Baby. Don’t even think it. I’m not going anywhere. And I’d rather you didn’t.”

Addison would have rather died than lose Audrey. My choice forced her hand. For what had to be, the hundredth time, I wished I’d just taken the bullet.

“It isn’t safe here.” I told them both, then I had to start lying again, “If he wants to find us, he’s just got to turn on the TV.” I motioned to the News Vans that were already assembling at the end of the block. “There is a place, my dad used take me when I was a kid. Its secluded, off the grid, and we own the whole damned mountain. Claire and I are going after the funeral.” I looked at Sarah, “You, and Audrey are welcome to join us.”

Sarah grinned, “The thought of being locked in a bunker with you two makes me want to take my chances with the psychopath.”

“It’s not a bunker.” Well, there was a bunker, but it was hidden. 
“It’s a cabin on a hot spring, miles away from anything.”

“So miles away from help?” Sarah said, skeptical.

“If he manages to find us, and come after us there, Sarah, he’s the one that will need help.”

***

Sarah opted to stay with Audrey that night. I made sure that they had security posted outside. As Claire and I rode in the back of an armored SUV back to my place, I called my Dad.

“Hey David, shouldn’t you be sleeping?” He answered, “It’s a long drive tomorrow.”

Addison was from a smallish town about 4 hours away. We would all be making the trip in the morning for the visitation and service. “Yeah, Claire and I are on our way home.” I answered, “I need you to get the Lake Cabin prepped. We’re going there after.”

“Good Plan.”

“Yeah, one more thing.” I continued, “Can you get the Beast down there for me?”

Claire gave me a look, I waved her off and mouthed “In a minute.” To her.

I heard Dad chuckle on the line. “I feel extremely sorry for that bastard.”

“Thanks, Dad.” I said as he hung up.

“Beast?” Claire queried.

“My old truck.” I explained. “I don’t think my Honda could handle the roads out there.”

Claire nodded.

As Sarah had pointed out, I do have a gift for understatement.

***

The same armored SUV met us the next morning outside my residence hall. I had my suit, naturally, and Claire was a knee length black dress, with a sweater and an overcoat. The sky was overcast with low hanging clouds the color and texture of old asphalt, that were spitting an icy drizzle at us. I took off my jacket and hung it inside, after I let Claire in. Sarah and Audrey opted to ride down with Addison’s family.

Dad handed me a small black case as I got in the SUV, then went back to his own car. Inside was a Smith and Wesson 1066. The Semi-auto pistol was chambered in ten millimeter, and had three fully loaded magazines with it. I had chosen the pistol and rounds because it was a fast, relatively flat-shooting round. Plus, it had been known to defeat body armor. I’m not really a gun guy, but if you’re like me, it’s helpful to know how to use one. Besides, if it came down to it, a rusty spoon was better than nothing.

“David, what the hell?” Claire spoke up, shocked, as I took it, loaded it, and tucked it, in its holster, into my pants at the small of my back.

“It’s just a precaution, Claire.” I told her, “and one hundred percent legal.”

“Why do you need a gun? You’ve got a team of armed security shadowing our every move?”

“Odds are it will be an uncomfortable hunk of metal hanging on my belt all day, Baby.”

“I don’t like it.” Claire said, worry in her eyes. “I don’t like what this is doing to you. I mean, last week you wouldn’t even kill a spider, now you’re carrying a gun?”

“That spider,” She was talking about the one I caught in her shower and relocated outside, “Never pointed a gun at you.” I could tell she wasn’t happy with my answer, so I leaned over and kissed her, lightly, on the lips. “Once he’s caught, it will go back in the case, and stay there. I promise.”

She lifted her cat’s eye frames and dabbed at her eyes, then she crossed her arms across her chest and said, “I feel like I’m losing you.” As she stared out the window.

“No,” I took off my seat belt and slid across the seat to be closer to her, “Baby, No. This is really hard, on all of us. Losing Addi, worrying over Audrey, I know I haven’t been there for you like I should have. I’m sorry.”

“I miss her so much.” Claire took off her glasses and let the tears come, as she leaned back into me. “The distance is partially my fault. I guess I feel guilty for still having you. I didn’t, I don’t want to make Audrey feel worse.”

“I don’t think that’s possible right now.” I told her, being able, for once, to be completely honest with her. “There is no easy way through this, for any of us.”

“One foot in front of the other, keep moving forward.” She said with a wistful smile. “That’s what my Grandpa used to say.”

“I think I would’ve liked him.”

“He would’ve liked you too.” She turned her head to face me, and touched my cheek, letting her hand linger. “I will be with you, every step of the way.” She sat back up, “But I wish you’d stop beating yourself up. There were five of us. Four of us are still here because of you. We all know it, and Addison knows it. You didn’t kill her. He did.” Her light, shining, ferocious, in her eyes. “You are so gentle. Kind to a fault.” She smiled at me, “The fact that you actually feel guilty over this just confirms what I’ve always thought; I’m lucky to have you.”

“No,” I told her, as I kissed her neck, just below her ear. “I’m the lucky one.”

She put her arms around and held me tight. “When you jumped in front of me, and the gun went off. I was scared to death, not for me. For you. I thought I’d lost you. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”

I knew exactly what I’d do if I lost her. I’d find myself on my very next slip, and put an end to it, in the hopes that it would be far enough back to insure she never even met me.

***

Of course, The news crews were trying to cover the funeral, too. I’ve never understood the fascination with money. Yeah, several of you are probably scowling at your screens right now. But, It’s alien to me. True, I’ve never wanted for much. But the things I do want can’t be bought. Since Addison’s death was national news, and she was a gay woman, of course a lonely little group of those idiots from Kansas showed up. But [redacted] University’s Concert Choir had also come. Bolstered by the choirs of several local Churches, they had surrounded those pig-eyed zealots, four deep, in their little cordoned off pen, and were currently drowning out their weapons-grade stupid with a selection of hymnals.

I made eye contact with an elderly black woman in a purple choir robe who was in that ring of song, as I held the door for Claire and mouthed “Thank You.”

She smiled back at me and waved.

The local police were doing their best, but simply did not have the manpower to keep all the press at bay. Camera flashes and spotlights trailed us as we made our way from that armored SUV to the front entrance of the funeral home. I had Claire by the arm, trying to lead her through the forest of microphones, when suddenly a woman appeared in front of us.

I recognized her, you probably would too, as she was on TV nearly every night. “Claire, who are you wearing?”

Claire stopped, utterly shocked, and completely aghast, then demanded, “What the fuck is wrong with you?” Her reply momentarily silenced the din of shouted questions. “We’re about to bury a friend. Someone is burying their daughter, their sister today. And you’re most pressing question is ‘Who am I wearing?’” She screwed up her face in anger, “What the FUCK is wrong with you?” She shouted.

“There’s your sound-bite.” I snarled, as I took Claire by the arm again, and pushed past the woman, who had gone pale, realizing just how colossally she’d screwed up. Part of me hoped it was a live feed.

“Alright!” A man in what looked to be his mid-sixties, in the uniform of the local police department, shouted over the freshly renewed clamor, “You got what you came for, let these people mourn in peace!” Then he gave the order to his officers to evict the press from the premises.

Sarah was waiting for us when we got inside.

“Did you see that?” Claire growled, ‘Can you believe that?”

“Same bitch offered me ten grand and an internship if I wore a hidden camera in here.” Sarah grumbled. “If that is what being a professional journalist is about, I’m changing majors.”

“Seems like the field could use an injection of integrity to me.” Pete said as he came into the lobby to meet us. “David, Claire, it’s good to see you again.” He looked like he had aged ten years since I met him five days ago. “David, Mary and I wanted to thank you, The Funeral Director told us what you did, and I meant to ask you earlier, but things have been so hectic. We’re short a pallbearer, and Addison spoke highly of you.”

“Of course, Pete, of course.” I told him, I didn’t answer the slightly confused looks from Claire and Sarah. I had, tried to, at least, quietly take care of Addison’s final expenses. I guess I should have directly told the Funeral Director to call me an anonymous donor, rather than imply it, with a heavy hand. “It would be an honor.” One that I didn’t deserve, if I’m being completely honest. It was my fault she was gone.

The Public visitation had ended nearly an hour before we arrived, and for this last hour before the service was closed to all but friends and family.

A group of whom I can only assume to be aunts, uncles and cousins were clustered around a photo display in the back of the room, quietly sharing pleasant memories. Mary stood off to one side, staring at her daughter’s body, in the casket, as if trying to memorize every detail of her baby girl’s face, and occasionally wiping away tears. Audrey, along with Addison’s brothers sat in the front row of the chairs set up before the casket. She looked like she had her head bowed in prayer, and Addison’s two oldest brothers were trying to comfort her. Claire and Sarah were talking with Pete. I touched Claire’s arm and motioned to Mary, she nodded at me. I left the three of them to mouth the empty platitudes people mouth at funerals, went to Mary’s side.

Then I saw, that Audrey’s head wasn’t bowed in prayer. She was staring at a small box in her hand, covered in black velvet. Inside, nestled in white silk, was a gleaming silver ring.

*An Engagement Ring.*

Mary slid under my arm as my knees nearly buckled. “She was going to ask her at the end of term.” She never looked away from the casket. “She came to us when they were visiting over Christmas.” Mary’s voice hitched, as she took a breath. “I was going to have another daughter.” Mary said.

I heard Addison’s brother encouraging Audrey to give her the ring. ‘You’re our sister now.” He said. “She would have loved it.”

Audrey looked up at them, smiling through her tears. Together, they rose, and walked unsteadily, leaning on each other, to Addison’s casket. Audrey took the ring from the box, and carefully slid it on to Addison’s finger, with her brother’s now fully supporting her. She was weeping like a widow, because that’s what she was, when she kissed her fingers and pressed them to Addison’s lips.

“I’ll never forget you.” She whispered, “I love you, Addi.”

Claire was at my side, guiding me back to a chair, as the enormity of what my choice had done to Audrey crashed down on me.
It could have been five minutes, or five hours, But the preacher came in, administered the last rites, and funeral service. Just before the funeral home staff closed the casket, Mary stood, withdrew a roughly used, and obviously well-loved stuffed tiger from her purse, and tucked it under Addison’s arm.

Shortly thereafter, it was time to carry her out to the hearse. Addison Wright was barely five feet tall, and probably never weighed more than ninety-eight pounds in her all too short life. 
There were six of us.

She was the heaviest weight I’ve ever lifted.

***

After the graveside service, we went to the local Elk’s Lodge, for a proper wake. A few hours into it, Pete, Mary, and their sons decided to call it a night. Audrey thanked me for the offer to come with us to the Lake Cabin, but said the Wrights had asked her to stay with them for a while, and she couldn’t, didn’t want to refuse. Claire and I told her we understood, asked her to call when she got settled.

One of Addison’s uncles was flirting with Claire in that harmless way old men flirt with young women. It didn’t bother me. It never does. I would never fault a guy, or a girl, for that matter, for trying to make a little time with a woman like Claire. After all, I was hers, and she was mine.

I kissed her and told her, “I’m going outside for a little air.”

“Okay, baby.”

“Jeez, Dave, give an old geezer the illusion of hope, at least.” I didn’t mind when he called me Dave.

“Chuck, you’re a dirty old man, you know that?”

“You’re damn right.” He grinned at Claire, then winked at me.

I laughed as I walked toward the back door. I’ve done this enough to know, that there is more laughter at funerals and wakes, than one would expect. Remembering the good times is one of the few ways a human psyche can weather such a profound loss.

When I hit that back door I saw Sarah, leaning against the wall, smoking a cigarette.

“Since when do you smoke?” I demanded, a little more than half drunk.

“Please don’t tell Claire.” She pleaded, “I really can’t deal with her going all mother hen on me, tonight.”

“Okay, on one condition; Got one for me?”

She handed me one, and her lighter. “Since when do you smoke?”

“I don’t.” I said, coughing out the first lung full. “Just felt the need to—“

“Do something a little self-destructive?” She completed my thought.

“Yeah.”

“Me too. It was either this,” She held up the cigarette, “Or fuck the bartender cross-eyed, and he’s not really my type.”

“You have a type?”

Sarah scowled at me, “Well, if I do, it is definitely not fifteen years older than me with greasy hair and bad teeth.” She stubbed out her cigarette on the wall, took a bottle of perfume from her purse, and sprayed it in the air before her, then walked through the mist. “I’m going to protect your girlfriend from seduction at the hands of Uncle Chuck.”

I snorted a laugh at her and started pacing. I took another drag off the cigarette, coughed some more, decided it tasted like shit, and threw the thing away.

That’s when the hair stood up on the back of my neck.

I spun around. I had the pistol out of the holster, safety off, and leveled on the bridge of his nose before I even realized what I was doing.

“Damn, you’re fast.” The Man with Ice Blue Eyes said. His hands were raised, palms facing me, about shoulder level.

“You got something to say, you better say it quick.” My finger tightened on the trigger.

“I’m just here to talk, David. I am unarmed.” He said, almost serenely. “And I don’t think you’re capable of killing me in cold blood, yet.”

“Talk.” I ordered.

“I decided to give you today.” He explained. “I could have killed you both a dozen times since you got out of that truck this morning. But I really don’t want that.”

*Just pull the trigger*

“There doesn’t need to be any more bloodshed.” He continued, “I came here to talk, like reasonable people.”

“You didn’t think to do that, before you murdered my friend?” *Just do it. Kill him where he stands.*

“I am sorry for that.” He sounded sincere, “It was never my intention to hurt Addison. And after our last meeting, I realized I don’t even have to hurt you, or Claire, in order to get what I want.”

“And that is?” I demanded.

“That red-haired harpy to never exist.” He said, finally. “Just leave her. Leave Claire, and I will never come near you or her again. Yes, you’ll be hurt, and so will she, but you’ll both get over it. She’s young, intelligent and extremely beautiful. She will find another man that will make her happy. You, well, you’re young, and extremely wealthy. Shouldn’t be too hard to find a girl willing to do the things she does for you.”

“You should stop talking now.” I was a wrong word from blowing his face out the back of his head.

“Believe it or not, David, I do respect you.” He said, his face placid, “and like you, I really don’t want to hurt anyone.”

“There you’re wrong.”

“So you’re going to do what? Shoot me? How will you explain firing a gun, drunk, in an empty parking lot, after I vanish?”

“You’re right.” I said, as I dropped the magazine, and set about breaking his goddamned skull with the pistol.

Three minutes, and thirty-eight seconds later, he flickered, appeared to expand slightly, then vanished. His blood, staining my shirt and hands went with him. “I hope you feel that for hours, you son of a bitch.” I said to the empty night air.

881egl,4,2018-03-29,I need impressions,Feli--,INTP,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/881egl/i_need_impressions/,"I've always been the silent reader, I never share my own thoughts, I try instead to find answers in understanding the world and the human kind in history, psychology, philosophy, reddit, etc.

When I look at my family, I see a sad scheme where my father doesn't speak the same language as us, and had 0 social connections, he had 'no choice' than being at home, watch TV all the time, cook and drive the car. My parents didn't divorce for the only sake of practicality, even if they never loved each other (didn't sleep together nor share affection) and fought most of the time. So I've been raised by a 'stranger', very old school, with a very bad temper, not understanding the culture nor the epoch where we live in, I never had a normal conversation with him, he's the most stubborn person you'll ever meet. My mother didn't realize that this would have an impact on my mental health. It's like they had children only to not die alone (they are 70 and 81 years old).

I'm going to be 25 in a month. I'm still in 3rd year of undergraduate after trying 4 different paths, but I know I'm in the wrong one again.
My cursus has been 
- highest mention in scientific baccalaureat
- medicine (6 months)
- history and geography (licence obtained)
- gender studies (6 months)
- architecture (3 years)
I'd like to study in the trend of smart cities, but I don't know what role I could have in it (all my life has been around this problem), I have skills in every field as an INTP. I'm thinking of making internships this year. 

Since I know MBTI theory I wonder if all these traits (depression, anxiety, poor social skills...) are only attribuable to INTP or from my weird life, where many things are not in the right place. Perhaps being INTP made me think too much about it but it didn't really help to understand a fucked up situation where you actually live in. This brought me down most of my childhood because I knew I'll never meet someone who could relate to my story. I never told my friends because they couldn't understand it.

Sorry if this doesn't really make sense, the problem is broad and I can't specify it as 'I am depressed' or 'I am bored'. Actually I'd just like exterior impressions on my story, the most tiring is being alone in your own problems because subjectivity can't give you the big picture.

So I've come to the point where I now need to purchase a car specifically for a internship where I am required to provide my own transportation. I have already asked my parents about borrowing one of their cars for the summer (they said no), and also have looked into renting (too expensive). So I am now tasked with deciding how to go about purchasing a car.

Originally, I planned to buy a cheap $2-3k car (around 2003-2005 with &gt;100,000 miles) that would at least last me the summer, since I don't have a ton of money at my disposal as a college student. However, I now have another $6k to work with, so I am trying to decide whether it is worth it to invest in a car that might last longer and be more reliable long term. After this summer, I will be commuting to and from school every day (about 20 miles) and then graduating in the Spring (hopefully with a secured job). Given that a car would be helpful for transport to and from school (and later, work), would it make sense to spend more money to get a car that is newer and with fewer miles that will last longer, or wait until I have better financial ability to purchase a better car? What kind of purchase makes sense at this point in my life, and for either case, what kinds of cars are recommended? 

Thanks everyone!"

8825o0,1,2018-03-29,USA - Canada Tax Treaty Help/Questions,funkadelic06,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8825o0/usa_canada_tax_treaty_helpquestions/,"First I apologize for the length, I just want to make sure I have all the relevant information that will make it easier for any of you to help/provide input. **For simplicity I have bolded and numbers direct questions.**

**Summary:**

I'm a Canadian working in the USA and I'm doing my taxes in the USA for the first time, but I'm unsure if I qualify for any article in the tax treaty. I'm hoping one of you fine folks can help me clear some things up or point me in the right direction.

**Background Info:**

* Worked from sept-Dec 2017 as an Intern (total of 107 days)
* Was done school prior to the internship (June 2017)
* Gross income of $11,192 USD
* Was working under a J1 visa (Trainee/Intern)
* Working for an American company in California

**What I know (I think...):**

I know that I have to fill out the 1040NR-EZ for federal taxes, form 540NR for state taxes (CA), and I believe I can fill out form 8843 to get my Medicare and Social Security back because I was working under a J1 visa (**1) Is that correct about medicare and social security?**). The part that I'm struggling with is determine which, if any article in the USA-Canada tax treaty that applies to me.

I tried to use Sprintax to complete my taxes as it allows for the form 1040NR, however it said I did not qualify for any articles in the tax treaty. It did however indicate that I do indeed get Medicare and Social Security back.

**Tax Treaty Inquiry:**

There are only three articles that I think that may apply to me:

* XV - Dependent Personal Services
* XX - Students
* XXIV - Elimination of Double Taxation

**Tax Treaty Inquiry - XV**

I think that **XV** applies to me because while I made over $10,000, I was not in the USA for more than 183 days (including the years prior when doing the presence calculation). The only thing that has stopped me from moving forward is the specific sentence 

*""and the remuneration is not borne by an
employer who is a resident of that other State or by a permanent establishment or a fixed base
which the employer has in that other State.""* 

**2) Does that mean that because I was being paid by an american company I do not qualify?**

**Tax Treaty Inquiry - XX**

I don't think that **XX** applies to me because of this sentence *""shall not be taxed in that State provided that such payments are made to him from
outside that State.""* 

Which from my understanding means to qualify I would have to be paid be a company in Canada. **3) Is that correct?**

**Tax Treaty Inquiry - XXIV**

For **XXIV** I'm not sure, I can't make sense of the lawyer talk here. I think that I qualify because I'm being taxed in Canada for my USA income. **4) Care to shed some light on this**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;“Nobody talks about entrepreneurship as survival, but that’s exactly what it is and what nurtures creative thinking.”  (Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop)  

&amp;nbsp;

I’ll walk you through the major business lessons that I think every entrepreneur needs to know to reach success. Ask me any questions along the way and I’ll do my best to answer them as honestly and insightfully as possible. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Before getting started, I’ll tell you a little bit about myself. Traveling has been a major part of my life for the past fifteen years. I have traveled to more than sixty countries and have lived in four, including the United States, Germany, Switzerland and South Korea. Over the past three years, I’ve traveled seven times around the world. To put in perspective, the past three years have brought me more than three quarters of the way from the Earth to the Moon!

&amp;nbsp;

My journey in the U.S. started nine years ago. I came from Germany as a medical intern to train in cardiology at Johns Hopkins, and eventually decided to stay and build my professional career here. Fast forward three years, I realized that clinical medicine was not my passion and it was time to branch out. The only thing I knew was that I wanted to change something, make people’s lives better, and have a larger impact than I could as a doctor seeing one patient at a time. Even though it took another few years to figure out how I would achieve this goal, I eventually came across entrepreneurship as the solution. Starting in 2012, I developed my ideas at the [Harvard Innovation Lab](https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/), bootstrapped until I was ready to join full-time, left my six-figure job as a consultant, and threw myself into the most insane life experience ever. 

&amp;nbsp;

Below you’ll find my progress as an entrepreneur over the past five years. I detail what each step looked like and, in addition, the pressing challenges that I needed to overcome at each stage. In speaking with hundreds of other entrepreneurs over the years, I found that these challenges are very common. I wrote them down because I believe they are key to consider when you develop your own startup.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Part 3 - Launching my first investment fund**


_______________________

**Part 1 - Building a global digital health company**

&amp;nbsp;

For the past 5+ years, my team and I built the first-of-its-kind global [digital concierge service](https://doctorinyourpocket.info/en/shopping/) called Doctor In Your Pocket. In short, it helps international travelers connect with a qualified and vetted medical doctor or dentist wherever they are on the globe, and at any time of the day. We have since launched our service in 180+ cities around the world. Below you’ll find some of the major business challenges and lessons that I’ve learned along the way. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Scale
Truth be told, and I’m sure most of you can relate or imagine this, I had no clue what I was doing when I started out with this company in late 2012. Although I had two “silent” co-founders, I ended up having to make all major decisions by myself. To start, I recognized the reality of scale: to assist American outbound travelers with trusted medical care around the globe, we needed a physical presence in (at minimum) the major tourist and business traveler destinations globally.

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you scale from 1 city to 180+ cities without draining your financial resources or having to rely on venture capital?
* How do you assure consistent quality of medical care as well as patient experience?
* How do you do all this in the fastest possible time?

&amp;nbsp;

#Sales 
One thing that medical school definitely never taught me was how to be an effective and convincing salesperson. As a result, I had to learn these skills the hard way. Back in 2013, I traveled to [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore), [Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur), [Dubai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai) and [Abu Dhabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi), where I approached medical doctors in private practice, clinics, and hospitals to sign them up and onboard them to our service. Let me tell you, that it was the most humbling experience in my entire life. Despite my academic background, I wrestled daily with serious doubts concerning my ability to sell our product.  

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you get to overcome a series of NO’s? 
* How do you increase your conversion rate by selecting your leads?
* How do you cope with the emotional ups and downs of your daily sales efforts?

&amp;nbsp;

#Recruitment 
The success of your company, in terms of raising money, building a compelling product or service, and being competitive, is a direct result of finding the right founders and employees. I’ve had to learn a lot about the different strategies of interviewing people successfully. 

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you find the best talent for your company? 
* How do you convince the best talent to join your company when you can’t pay competitive salaries? 
* How do you overcome your own bias and objectivity in trusting likable people [(Halo effect)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect)? 

&amp;nbsp;

#Business Development 
In order for us to really scale the business from a revenue point of view, we had to build partnerships with global travel companies. Over time we successfully launched business partnerships with the likes of [HomeAway](https://www.homeaway.com/), [Hostelling International](https://www.hihostels.com/), and many more. 

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you identify the right person to speak with at large corporations? 
* How do you negotiate a contract that has meaningful key performance indicators to quickly grow your trial partnership? 
* How do you overcome the long sales cycles for corporate partnerships financially?

&amp;nbsp;

#Technology - (Web Development)
I’m a non-technical founder, making the early stages of the startup journey brutally difficult, especially since our core product is a technology-enabled service. As a result, it took many iterations and a lot of money to eventually build a sustainable team.

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you find a technical co-founder?
* How do you convince an A-player to join your company?
* How do you compensate for a lack of deep technical expertise as a non-technical co-founder?

&amp;nbsp;

#Fundraising 
Even though we never raised venture capital, there was still a need for angel and seed capital. This was especially important in the early stages before we generated revenue. As you can imagine, never having raised money before came with its own set of challenges. 

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you identify serious investors? [(See blog post here)](https://medium.com/swlh/the-perfect-networking-equation-how-to-get-noticed-get-involved-and-get-your-foot-in-the-door-a1175120c59f)
* How do you communicate with investors after you’ve raised an investment?
* How do you distinguish between smart and dumb money? [(See blog post here)](https://medium.com/swlh/the-perfect-networking-equation-how-to-get-noticed-get-involved-and-get-your-foot-in-the-door-a1175120c59f)

&amp;nbsp;

I believe that the success of any company depends on the type of people, advisors, investors, and team members you meet along the way. I am very privileged to have met so many outstanding people throughout my still young entrepreneurial journey. Hence, I decided to give back to the global entrepreneurial community through my [Entrepreneurship Unplugged World Tour 2018](https://medium.com/swlh/world-tour-2018-ever-wondered-how-startups-differ-around-the-world-aca79c90a8d3) by visiting major startup hubs globally and offering workshops. See some of the most common questions that entrepreneurs come to me with below.

##*Challenges [(Read more here)](https://medium.com/@marcel.muenster/entrepreneurship-unplugged-7-things-to-master-in-order-to-kill-it-as-a-successful-startup-ee97f7852cac)*
* How do I pitch or tell the story for a company that has a vision but no product?
* How do I raise my first investment?
* How do I validate my product?

**Part 3 - Launching my first investment fund**

&amp;nbsp;

As part of my [Entrepreneurship Unplugged World Tour](https://medium.com/swlh/world-tour-2018-ever-wondered-how-startups-differ-around-the-world-aca79c90a8d3), I traveled to Dubai in early 2018 and mentored 34 companies in seven days. Every founder (and even the existing investment community) complained about the same obstacle: lack of early-stage funding. On my fourteen hour flight back to Boston, I couldn’t stop thinking about this problem. I know how critical and also how difficult the first funding can be in the life cycle of a promising company. As a result, I decided to take action and combat this problem head-on. I’m excited to announce that I have started working on a fund that will invest between **$10k to $50k** in **early-stage companies across multiple industries**. We’ll invest in companies in the Middle East as well as globally so long as they intend to do business in the region. 

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do we find the best companies to invest in?
* How do we increase the chances of success of our funded companies?
* How do we convince our fund investors that we have the right recipe for an early stage fund? 

&amp;nbsp;

**PS:** Even though we haven’t launched the fund quite yet, please take this first public announcement as an invite to send me your deck or pitch your idea! Contact details are below. 

&amp;nbsp;

**PPS:** The fund is supposed to launch within the next three months (by June 2018).

882cqa,2,2018-03-29,What do law schools look for from engineering students?,ConflictedJew,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/882cqa/what_do_law_schools_look_for_from_engineering/,"Hello,

I am an upper sophomore studying Electrical Engineering and am considering going into Patent Law. Until now, I have developed my resume/career under the assumption I'd go into engineering after graduating. 

How will law schools look at internships in ""prestigious"" engineering companies? Rather, how does a competitive engineering applicant translate to a competitive law school applicant?

My resume now consists of

* Cybersecurity research (coding)
* Robotics research (different place)
* Industry internship at a fortune 100 company
* Engineering lead for a student club.

Assuming I graduate with a ~3.8-3.9 and score well on the LSAT, will I be a competitive applicant for the T14s? Will I need to intern at a law firm or at somewhere similar? 

Thank you!

I have one relative left in New York that I talk to and I asked them if I could stay, they said yes but then once I booked my flight and I told them they asked ""How many days are you staying?"" and I took it as them not wanting me to stay longer than a couple days.

I have nowhere else to go and I don't want to spend so much money to only stay a week. I even said I already made a car reservation and that I'll even Uber from the airport to their place.

I feel shit cause it feels really unfair that I'm being treated this way because of gossip created by my own family. I'm losing such a good opportunity.

So as the title states I was wondering how difficult it was to obtain a full-time career in Digital/Social Media Marketing without the degree in marketing.

I made the mistake of going into psychology and being set on a particular path, but I found a much bigger passion doing content creation and managing social media platforms. I discovered this about two years ago when I first transferred into my 4 year institution. I am on my last quarter at University of California Irvine, so its too late to turn back having gone this far in.

I currently have three digital/social media marketing internships under my belt, with experience in managing multiple social media accounts for brands, as well as experience in the Adobe Suites (particularly lightroom and photoshop, currently learning illustrator as well). My next goal is to learn more about SEO and understanding more about google analytics (was taught a bit in my last internship) but I'm afraid that the ""B.S in Psychology"" portion of my resume will have my resume turned down. 

The main questions I have are:

What would be a good way to market myself as a psychology major within this field?

What else should I do that will better qualify me against those with a degree (i.e., are there any certificates I can get, etc.)

Any advice would be great! "
883vvt,56,2018-03-29,The Saga of AnimeAssassin: In which I receive thoughtful and loving gifts for my birthday that in no way were actually awful,CastielGalafran,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/883vvt/the_saga_of_animeassassin_in_which_i_receive/,"TW: eating disorders, rape, emotional/verbal abuse, suicide

My birthday is in a few weeks. I'm filled with a mix of anxiety and excitement over it this year because memories of my last two have been popping up aggressively lately. I've been in a mental funk all week that just seems to be getting worse, so maybe typing this out will help. 

I was with AnimeAssassin for my last two birthdays. And for each birthday he listened to my needs, showed me nothing but respect and admiration, and was as supportive as any boyfriend could be. This post is going to be filled with only wonderful memories!

Hahahahahahahahaha

No.

I'm just going to dive right in here and spill some tea. 

By the time my birthday came around during our first year dating, I was no longer homeless and was living in a tiny loft with my cousin S. S was mainly absent, as she had just gotten engaged to a guy she'd only known for a month and was spending most of her time with him. I was concerned but had nowhere near enough mental energy to devote to that whole barrel of monkeys. Honestly, I was just grateful to have a roof over my head. AnimeAssassin lived a five minute walk away with his frat buddies and was almost constantly at my place.  

Shit with my family had just kept getting worse by this time. I was fielding daily, sometimes multiple times a day, phone calls from my parents. Sometimes they were crying and begging for me to come home, sometimes they were screaming about how horrible of a daughter I was, sometimes they were threatening to track down and hurt AnimeAssassin. My grades were slipping, my finances were plummeting, I was doing an awful job at work, and the stress of all of that had made my eating disorder worse than it ever was. 

I was eating one pack of 50 cent ramen a day. My body was so malnourished that my female best friend could fit her entire hand around the largest part of my arm (she has small hands). My hair was falling out. If I tried to eat any more than half a bowl of plain ramen, my stomach would explode in shooting pain. I could barely stay awake during normal hours, usually literally passing out by 7:30 pm because my body just had no fuel. I was obsessively counting calories and staring in the mirror for at least 30 minutes at a time, despairing over how large I thought I'd gotten. I literally believed that my stomach and thighs were getting huge. I would cry every day over how large I believed I was getting. In reality, my hipbones were jutting out like a starving dog and clothes were falling off of me (for reference, I'm 5' 8"" and at my most muscular and healthy right now I still wear between sizes 2-4. So back then I was too small for even a size 2).

I had just started seeing a therapist for the first time, and one of the rules she gave me was to stop looking at numbers. So no counting calories and no weighing myself. No counting my steps. No measuring my waist. Absolutely no numbers that had anything to do with my body. I was scared enough about what was happening to my body at this point that I fully committed to everything she told me, so I told AnimeAssassin and all my closest friends that I needed help avoiding numbers. I told them the exact rules she gave me and explained all the reasons why I couldn't do numbers. 

So my birthday comes around and AnimeAssassin had been talking all week about how amazing of a gift he had gotten for me. I was excited. Maybe he had gotten me some painting supplies, or a book, or flowers. My imagination went wild as he kept asking me to guess what he got me. 

On the morning of my birthday, I woke up next to him and he announced that he could finally reveal my gift. He produced a box from his backpack and, with as much pomp and circumstance as a naked skinny white boy with a soul patch was capable of, gave me the much anticipated birthday gift. I opened it, and the moment I laid eyes on what lay within the box my heart sank.

It was a fitbit. 

Not only was a fitbit, it was *his* fitbit. The fitbit he'd gotten for free from a work event two years ago, that was missing most of its accessories, and that he had said months ago that he no longer wanted.

My boyfriend gave my anorexic ass a used calorie counting machine.

He expected me to constantly wear the fitbit. I did, for a while, until my therapist told me I had to stop doing that. So I started sneaking the fitbit off during the day when AnimeAssassin wasn't around. Which didn't work very well because he would check the app on my phone to see how many calories I'd consumed and how many steps I'd taken. He claimed this was to make sure I ate enough calories, and that my therapist, a trained mental health professional who was the most experienced at the facility I went to, didn't know what she was talking about. 

I wore the fitbit until I returned from my summer internship and proceeded to ""lose"" it in early August of that year. What I never told AnimeAssassin was that one evening when we went to the movies together, he was groping and fingering me in the very back row of the theatre as usual (I hated that but had given up saying no). Realizing he was distracted, I wrapped my arms around him and then slipped the fitbit off my wrist and let it fall between the seats, never to be seen again.

So that was his gift to me for my first birthday. That gift was like a fucking diamond necklace compared to what he got me for my birthday last year. Buckle up, folks, because this one's going to be a wild ride.

A year ago our sex life had nosedived. Me being suicidal and raped constantly sort of killed my libido. AnimeAssassin would keep a tally of how many times I had sex with him between my periods, and if he could tally it on one hand would blow up at me. Everything became about sex. It eventually began eating up all my therapy sessions, since I was trying desperately to fix myself so I could make him happy. I felt so damn broken and useless for not putting out enough. 

Just like the year prior, AnimeAssassin was making big talk about what he got me for my birthday. Again, he was having me guess the gift. And, again, I let myself get excited. 

A week before my birthday, on a Saturday night, he randomly announced that it was time for me to receive my gift. We loaded into his car and he began driving around town. The entire drive, he kept having me guess the gift. 

Flowers?

A book?

Art supplies?

Jewelry?

Clothes?

Horseback riding lessons?

No, no, no, and no. I racked my brain trying to figure out what he could possibly have gotten me. Every time I guessed wrong, he became filled with even more glee. AnimeAssassin was practically jumping out of his skin with giddiness while I grew more and more baffled. Finally, he had me close my eyes. I sat there in darkness until I felt the car park. Then he told me to take a look. My eyes snapped open, a big smile plastered on my face, my heart racing in anticipation. 

And then my brain registered where we were. 

A grimy sex shop.

I started laughing uncontrollably. I was in complete denial. This had to be a joke. There was no way that he could have seriously taken me here. I just kept repeating, ""Are you serious?"" and he just stared at me with a dead expression. The joy in his eyes was gone, replaced by grim darkness. The longer he stared the more strained my laughter became until ""Are you serious"" was said between sobs. Finally, I couldn't speak anymore and just sat there in the front seat crying.

AnimeAssassin sighed and said, ""I thought you'd be fucking grateful.""

He started telling me how hurt he was that I was such an ungrateful gift receiver. How he put so much effort into this and I couldn't even pretend I was happy. How I was just like his mother. 

I felt so shitty that I forced myself to stop crying. I apologized and agreed to go inside. AnimeAssassin flipped a switch and the joy returned to his eyes. He ran inside, practically skipping, and refused to let me leave until I had picked out a dildo, lube, this weird flavored stuff that you rub on someone's dick to make oral taste better. I was mortified, begging him to just let me order this stuff online. He kept repeating I needed to loosen up my boundaries. And then he asked me to pay for half of it. 

I'll never forget the pity in the eyes of the women behind the register. 

Those were the things he used to rape me with until the end of our relationship. He didn't like using the lube so he threw it away. I told him it hurt without that. And it really fucking did. He liked to just jam the dildo into me as hard as he could with no foreplay and jackhammer it for what felt like at least 30 minutes at a time. I got really good at pretending to cum, since he refused to stop until I did. Sometimes if I was unlucky, he would keep going until I pretended to do it a second time. It really made him feel like a man for me to cum twice. 

I wish that was the end of it. I could have handled that. But what he did a week later broke me down so much I tried to order barbiturates to kill myself with.

The following Friday he announced he had a surprise for me. We blindfolded me and drove me in circles, led me out of my car, and walked me to a door. He took the blindfold off and I was greeted by my two best friends, my friend L, and Doge. It was a surprise party! An oddly small and slapped together surprise party, but it was a party! I was so goddam happy. We ate cake, played games, and hung out until AnimeAssassin said it was time to go home. Months later, my best friends would later reveal to me that AnimeAssassin had texted them two hours before hand asking if they could plan and host my surprise party. He then claimed credit for planning all of it, saying that he had been working on it for weeks. In reality, all he did was shoot a last minute text to my best friends and drive me.

The next morning, I went to lunch with L, Doge, and my DnD group. I'd been planning this birthday lunch for weeks. We met up at our local outdoor mall and had burgers. AnimeAssassin had been bitching and moaning about the lunch all morning, but dragged himself there under the condition that we only stay for 30 minutes. 

I mentioned this to L and she was having none of that. She told AnimeAssassin, ""This is Castiel's birthday and she can stay as long as she likes. If you want to go, then go."" and proceeded to take my hand and refuse to let me go. I was so grateful to her, and I was stuck to her side the entire lunch. When we were finished eating, L and I walked hand in hand to every store I wanted to go to. I hadn't spent a single cent on myself (well, with the exception of the sex toys that were supposed to have been something resembling a gift) in months. But when we walked into H&amp;M, I saw a $4 little pink purse that I loved. L convinced me to buy it for myself. 

I was so proud of my purchase. Up until then, the only purse I had was a dirty old bag with holes in it I got from Goodwill. I proudly showed it to AnimeAssassin when we left the store, and he only grumbled. I could tell he was fuming and that we'd been out for an hour at this point, so I told him I was ready to go. He said nothing until we got in the car.

Then he exploded. 

He screamed at me. He called me a ""fucking liar"". He called me stupid, said I was cheating on him, saying he can't trust me anymore. He said I was just like his mother. I asked him why he was yelling at me and he said, ""Because you fucking lied. You said we only were going to stay 30 minutes and you fucking lied. What makes you think you could buy that purse? Do you think we're rich? You are so fucking irresponsible. We have bills, Castiel!"" 

I shrinked my body as small as I could into the passenger seat and muttered, ""I'm sorry. I just wanted to do something for my birthday.""

""We already did your birthday last night! You are so fucking selfish! You got your birthday last night. It's over. Ok? It's over!"" 

I apologized again and he kept cursing and shouting. 

We met up with the DnD group a bit later to play. The entire time I sat there in silence holding back tears. The DM asked me what was wrong and before I could speak, AnimeAssassin, without looking up from his computer, said, ""She's just throwing a tantrum because I scolded her."" 

I started crying and my friend E took me outside. He asked what had happened. I just sat in the grass and kept repeating, ""I'm so stupid. I'm so selfish. AnimeAssassin deserves better. I'll never be good enough for him.""

E hugged me and tried his best to comfort me. 

When we went back inside I got on my phone and started looking up barbiturates. I figured out where to get them from, how much I needed to take, how long it would take to kill me, and when they'd arrive at my house. I made my plan. I was about to order the sleeping pills when I realized that I couldn't afford them.

I could have afforded them if I hadn't bought the purse. 

So I decided to order them when my next paycheck arrived. A few hours later, AnimeAssassin and I went home. He started crying hysterically, telling me that I look at him like he's a monster. He flopped face down into the bed and refused to even look at me. He said that he only ever does things for me, he's sacrificed so much for me, and all I ever do is make him look like a monster in front of our friends. 

I begged for his forgiveness and apologized. I held him as he cried.

I never did order the sleeping pills. I told my therapist about my suicide plans the following week and she helped me out. I would end up having a close call again shortly afterward, but I never ordered the pills. And AnimeAssassin will never know the only reason he didn't walk in on my corpse in our bed was because I was stupid enough to buy myself a $4 purse.

This year, in celebration of my freedom, I'll be buying another purse. Only this time, it will be a hell of a lot more expensive than 4$. I'm thinking Coach."

Although it is rare to be offered a job afterwards I am doing it for the experience and in hopes on one day finding a related job even if it’s at another location. I was wondering if anyone had any advice or words of wisdom regarding taking time off to get experience and find full time work before jumping right into graduate school. Obviously I would eventually love to get a masters degree but right now I just feel like it won’t fit my schedule or financial situation right now. From my experience it seems like people in the science field jump right from their bachelors into their masters program so it just often makes me feel like I’m getting left behind. Basically, does experience compete with education so that it is okay for me to wait to get my Masters for a year or two? "

I'm so like bleh everyday and I keep thinking about the fact that this is just an internship and if I feel this way working in an office for only 2 months, then how will it be when I get a real job? Just thinking of it makes me wanna throw up.

In fact, Ive had a lot of suicidal thoughts and thinking what if I do it, what if I actually just die, cause I don't wanna live my life working that way with people I don't like, doing something insignificant, and waiting for the weekends, waiting for vacations, 70% of my life will be work where i'm miserable. I'm so unhappy in so many ways. Even if i'm grateful about a lot of things, I try to remember that I have a lot of things that some people in other parts of the world don't have but it still doesn't make me happy.

I'm very alone and I feel like I lost a big part of myself. The 16 year old me, or I don't know, 18 year old who used to be hopeful about the future, always thinking about adventure and doing things, meeting people, always making jokes, finding the bright side of life, I feel like she's gone and I don't know if it's because of OCD, and maybe losing a lot of friends in the process, I don't know I feel like it changed me. Where I'm just a big black cloud now, and I try to find my old spark, love for life that I just don't have anymore...

And i'm crying while writing this but it feels good... 

I feel trapped in my own life but I know that I can't sit and cry or die, I have to try, scared that I won't find my happiness ever

I'm have got an admit for MS from CMU ECE for Spring 2019.
Since this term is unconventional, I wanted to reach out to people who have experienced this. 
(Just FYI I am inclined towards embedded systems/software currently, and am not interested in research as such.) 

Could you shed some light on:

The actual disadvantages of Spring admission, or any difficulty you have faced due to this.

Will it impact internship/job opportunities in the future?

Is it easy to get the courses you want? (ECE department, as well as other departments)

What do people do in the summer, if they do not intern?

(Some more FYI, I also have an offer from Georgia Tech ECE for Fall 2018. Any thoughts on which is a better pick?) 

Any information about any of these topics is welcome and highly appreciated.
Thank you very much!"

I switched my major and am graduating at 20 with my bachelors, so the switch made graduating come a lot sooner - I was prepared and happy for it but it’s like wow this is really happening this soon! I switched to Computer Science which I’m still extremely new at. But I went to an interview yesterday morning, and they gave me an intern position on the spot! It’s a good paying internship that can last around 6 months, and they like to hire interns after if there’s an opening. I’m planning on doing the best I can so I can get a permanent position there. If not, the internship opens doors for other jobs since it shows I have experience. Plus my boyfriend and I are planning on getting engaged soon, and married in a few years or so. It’s so crazy how things are happening just how i wanted them too, and I’m just super excited about it."

Stable job, hard but decent work, nice but older crowd.

It turns out the guy who hired me has a crush on a former station employee who left to work on the Jenny Jones show, then returned to us after that show got cancelled. He asks me to take her on as an intern, knowing full well that made no sense as she had logged more time in her past at the station than I had accrued myself.  Sure enough, a few weeks later I'm out the door, she's got my job, and they're dating.

As a promotions director I was responsible for all of the stations contests, and the stations' adherence to FCC rules on radio contests, which are strict af - google prize chance consideration and radio.  

Around the time of my firing, our station and everyone else was sucked in by the Trading Spaces tv show craze, so the station decided to bring in a bunch of local businesses and try to pull it off offering free renovations to a pair of listeners.  Except doing that by the rules would be a major pain in the ass, especially if the winners we actually selected by random - they could have major remediation work necessary prior to these fantasy renovations, insurance/liability issues due to unpermitted structures already on their property, etc.  SO the geniuses decided to cherry-pick a pair of winners that would be easiest to give renovations to.

Bad idea.  I advised them of this, as was my job, and was shitcanned the same week.

My first move was to send a cute little email to the station fan database, which I still had access to, letting them know about the scam contest they were all hoping to win in a yet to be held drawing.  I then received a call from the station manager telling me my severance offer was being rescinded, or about $600.

As I mentioned earlier, I didn't just work for one station, there were two: a 70's, 80s, 90s adult contemporary station, and a news station that the company was in the process of selling.  So I fired up a web browser to FCC.gov and blew the big ol' whistle on their scam contest practices.

BOOM.  FCC investigation commences, the sale is put on hold, and they have to reduce the asking price by a full 1 million dollars before the sale goes through.

Kiss my ass, Beasley Broadcasting and Gary the Bagel Guy.

884zpc,1,2018-03-29,Why Recovery of an MMO Junkie Starts a Positive Discussion | NEET in Anime,InAsianSpaces,u_InAsianSpaces,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_InAsianSpaces/comments/884zpc/why_recovery_of_an_mmo_junkie_starts_a_positive/,"Recovery of an MMO Junkie [ ネト充のススメ], or Netojuu no Susume is an anime I’d heard whispers of back when I was actively not watching anime. For reference, I was working almost every day surrounded by Japanese culture, Japanese people and Japanese food – I felt like I was in an actual anime. I was living my best life, as a shoujo maiden running for the train with toast in my mouth each morning. Okay, the toast thing is an exaggeration but the shoujo maiden thing is totally legit. 

I love the ‘video game within an anime’ or virtual reality genre. It started with the first season of Sword Art Online, transcended with Accel World, fell off a bit with No Game no Life and still rests somewhere between hoping for a season 3 of Log Horizon and occasional rewatches of Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash. Maybe it’s because I actually love real life virtual reality; maybe it’s because I desperately wish to play an MMO with friends on Discord. Either way, I was really surprised at how fast I got invested in this show.
Have I also mentioned that I enjoy NEET characters? For those of you who might not know, NEET stands for Not into Education, Employment, or Training. It’s usually people in their late teens to even later twenties in anime, but statistics from the Japanese government suggest that those in their forties could even be qualified as NEETs. However, these individuals are usually not included in surveys – causing the overall number to be lower when it really may be much higher. These people tend to live with parents or alone in their own apartments, being supported by said parents or relatives. Some are self-sufficient, but this is not always the case. NEETs and Hikikomori share the traits of not liking to leave the house, as it gives them anxiety. They would rather order things online and have them dropped off in front of their doorstep, and do not socialize much. Many indulge in their hobbies, but some not even that. I have a demur enjoyment of learning about all aspects of Japanese culture, even the taboo bits that are usually hidden away.

We’re still getting to know one another with this new blog, but I’m really into this type of stuff. The subject of hikikomori in Japan interests me. It’s more of an interest in those people’s lives and how society perceives them, which although different from NEETs, episode two seems to focus on this subject based on the teaser preview. Our main character Morioka is a self-stylized “chosen NEET” who has retired from office work and honestly, I cannot blame her. The rat race is exhausting. I went from high school to college to internships all the while holding jobs without a break; until now that is, and let me tell you – I’ve been overwhelmed by having so much free time for the first time in literally eight years. Time to watch Netflix, time to watch my backlog list of films, anime, read manga, read books, finish reading the ASOIAF series. I think what really resonated with me in the first few minutes of watching this show is that Morioka jumps up hearing her alarm in a panic before realizing that she doesn’t work anymore. I still get anxiety anytime I hear my alarm go off…those are real feelings in our society today that I’m sure anyone reading this can relate to – whether it be an alarm for school, college or a job you’re not too fond of.

Morioka – which I am using her last name because it’s simply how I’ve grown accustomed to referring to anime characters and real-life Japanese people – reinvents herself as a turquoise haired male named ‘Hayashi’ in an MMO called Fruits de Mer. She is a newbie to the game and is kinda trash until she finds help from an angel in pink named Lily. Lily is actually an office worker, or 会社員 named Sakurai Yuuta. The two quickly hit it off, and through a somewhat nonchalant passage of time it’s almost Christmas and the Guild Master (Morioka joins a guild at some point, again super nonchalant passage of time) tells Hayashi that there is no romance allowed in the guild. Hayashi acts kind of dense and the episode ends with Hayashi and Lily exchanging gifts in a tree watching the stars at night. Romantic, but it was even more romantic that earlier in the episode the two (unbeknownst to them) met in their real-world avatars. 

Maybe the camera panned in a confusing manner intentionally, but it seemed like when Morioka and Sakurai were in a discount Lawson’s together, the Fruits de Mer points card she was buying caught his attention. (Lawson’s is a popular convenience store chain in Japan, known for delicious chicken.) 

The pair tries to purchase the same piece of konbini chicken, which happens to be the last. Sakurai recedes his offer, and Morioka leaves embarrassed. Again the passage of time is vague, but it seemed like she hadn’t left the house for at least a few weeks. Morioka upgraded her PC setup, but as I mentioned earlier she could have simply ordered it online. Her fridge was completely empty, but we have no determinate of how much she eats daily to calculate the exact amount of time she’s been NEET.

I enjoyed the first episode much more than I expected to, and I hope Morioka – rather Hayashi- has a supportive group of friends in regards to her new lifestyle choices. I will keep watching, but I wanted to make a first impressions post as I will most likely write more about this show.  It’s only ten episodes and seems to have an unaired eleventh episode special according to my anime list. I’ve had a habit since before film school of binge watching shows, even staying up all night to finish a season (here’s looking at you, Riverdale) but I am going to try my best to pace myself. I’ll share more thoughts on this show after I finish the series, but for now I’ll leave our conversation of NEETs here.

Have you seen Recovery of an MMO Junkie? If you could play any game for an extended period of time, or enter any video game – what world would you choose? Leave your thoughts in a comment below, I’d love to hear from you! Be sure to follow us for more episode reviews (also analysis of NEET and hikikomori in anime) in the future! 

(I will let you know which game I’d like to live in when I make my after-show post) ^^

8854xl,0,2018-03-29,[M(as A)4F(as A)] A compendium of prompts to entertain your free time,freddiemercurious,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8854xl/mas_a4fas_a_a_compendium_of_prompts_to_entertain/,"Hello there! I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!
———————————————————
Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Preaching every week kills me. I spend my sermons struggling to keep my eyes off of all of the beautiful young woman in my congregation. Our youth group is especially tempting....

I want to roleplay or chat with a younger girl. Bonus points if you are innocent or a virgin, but everyone is welcome. You could be my church intern, a young married woman, part of the youth group, etc.

======================================

Troy and Derrick were still in love after five years, and tomorrow was the big day. Troy felt like the luckiest Little Boy in the world. The prominent gay couple had two weddings planned. One was a kind of obligatory, modest celebration. Troy grew up “Jewish-lite” and did not believe in God or organized religion, and Derrick was a lapsed, agnostic “Cultural Catholic” who hadn’t stepped foot in a church since his Confirmation. They were married by a judge at City Hall in their hometown of Philadelphia, in the presence of Troy’s parents, Derrick’s brothers, and their friends and neighbors, Cherry and Lorraine, who were due to be married by the same judge, right after the boys.
As the two newlywed couples drove to the site of their “vanilla” reception in Derrick’s beat-up old Mercedes Benz 190E, strings of cans rattling on the pavement, Troy felt funny riding in the front seat and pretending to be a grown up. He looked forward to being, alone, with Derrick, where the pressure would be off, and he could luxuriate in his Daddy’s attention. They had, of course, removed his adult-sized car seat from the Benz for today. It would need to be re-installed, of course, for the more authentic ceremony they had scheduled tomorrow.

Their second wedding ceremony was an invitation-only affair, and the invitees were restricted to other members of the CG/L Community. Only Caregivers and their Littles, of all genders and orientations, were invited. The location was a renovated warehouse somewhere close to but outside the city, in nearby Delaware County, that served as a type of CG/L-oriented “adult daycare.” Daddy Derrick and his Little Boy Toy Troy, and their lesbian friends, Mommy Lorraine and Little Cherry, had booked the space months ago, as both their Littles were intimately familiar with the site’s preschool-like environment. “School” was not in session, so Derrick and Lorraine were free, according to their agreement with their friends who owned and ran the site, to emphasize the more sexual elements of Troy’s and Cherry’s diapered submission. Normally, sexual displays and behaviors were not permitted, when “school” was in session, as not all Littles were sexualized, but Troy-Boy and Cherry-Berry were, and although of their Little friends who attended as guests did not engage in sexual behaviors were their caregivers, they all knew what to expect, and most of them anticipated seeing it on display just as much as their caregivers did. They knew they would benefit from watching other Littles being reminded of their place and having their status formalized.
The Littles in attendance were all “adults” but they no longer saw themselves as “grownups,” though they sometimes had to pretend. Half of them wore diapers, about a quarter were in training pants of some sort, either disposable pull-ups or cloth trainers with plastic pants, and the rest wore cartoonish undies or dainty little girl panties under their clothes. They were dressed up in adult-size versions of children’s clothing, but none of what they wore necessarily corresponded to their play age. Troy and Cherry both varied tremendously what play age they identified with from moment to moment, going from precocious toddler to sullen tween at a moment’s notice. Daddy Derrick and Mommy Lorraine enjoyed this aspect of their relationships; keeping up with their Littles was like an ongoing adventure game. However, both caregivers kept their little devils in thick, disposable diapers, unless they were having fun with trying to potty-train them and allowed them the use of pull ups and training pants. These potty-training scenarios always ended in humiliation for the diaper-dependent little, and a return to taped-on, plastic-backed disposables, complete with a loving change before being cuddled and reminded of why they wore diapers in the first place. The Littles enjoyed this roller-coaster ride of emotions, and although they loved their diapers, they looked forward to their potty-training attempts despite knowing they would end in failure and humiliation. Troy-Boy and Cherry-Berry were almost the same age in real life, and their caregivers treated them like brother and sister. Daddy Derrick and Mommy Lorraine weren’t a romantic couple- they were both gay- but they did things together much like any family, up to and including their wedding and “adoption ritual plans.”
The Ritual was like a fun CG/L-style parody of a wedding. The “Rugrats” theme song played while Ms. Samantha, Troy and Cherry’s “daycare” teacher, led the adult “kids” down the aisle using appropriately sized-up toddler reins attached to their harnesses. Both wore extremely cute costumes; Cherry’s was a pink and white dress made to resemble a flowergirl, and Troy’s outfit was his fanciest schoolboy uniform. The couples had already exchanged rings, but Troy’s role in this ceremony involved carrying a box, which Ms. Samantha opened as she took her place in the center, between the two couples. The box contained two studded leather locking collars, one pink and the other a soft baby-blue. The collars had rings for attaching kiddie leashes and nearly-identical heart-shaped metal tags that said “Property of Mommy and Daddy; if found, please return to owner.” Troy-Boy’s heart jumped at the sight of his collar in Ms. Samantha’s hands. His teacher noted his eager eyes and smiled.
“Almost time, kiddos!” She sang out in her sweet, warm voice. Troy-Boy and Cherry-Berry both grinned at each other in anticipation. Their little minds struggled to focus on what was in front of them; both of them were high on their own hormones. Troy could feel his pee-pee bulging in the silicon chastity cage he wore under his thick disposable diaper. He knew from watching Cherry get her diaper changed that she wore a female version of a chastity belt too. These and their diapers were their constant status reminders, hugging and reassuring them both as they toiled about their days, even when they pretended, for the sake of work, family and aspects of their social lives, to be dreary adults.
Troy-Boy and Cherry-Berry listened as best as they could, each holding hands with their Big, while Ms. Samantha gave a kind of invocation.
“I am proud to be here today with this amazing community,” she said. “And I am especially proud of the four people here today. It’s been a long journey. I want to congratulate Troy-Boy and Cherry-Berry on all their hard work in graduate school and in their extracurricular studies at this fine institution of learning.”
The grownups and a few of the older littles and middles chuckled. For three years, while they both worked full-time jobs while managing internships and classwork in their Masters of Social Work program, the little boy and girl had spent every spare hour that they weren’t with Mommy and Daddy here at the daycare where their homework and playtime was supervised and Ms. Samantha’s staff provided diaper changes and a rotating schedule to keep their minds fresh and their hearts pure. Mommy Lorraine was an ambulance driver for the district and Daddy Derrick was a nurse at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. They both often worked past their shifts and dealt with uncertain hours, although they were decently compensated by their employers. Troy and Cherry both worked at an agency that provided mental health services for low-income families. Troy was a case manager and Cherry was a Family Based Services  clinician, but with their internship in the counseling department completed, they were planning on sitting for their LSW exam and applying for higher paying positions at their agency. Troy’s hours were relatively steady, but Cherry’s hours as an FBS clinician were more variable, and they both had to adhere to a strict schedule to get all their hours in at their day jobs and their internships. All that was over now, and next week the two of them would sit for their exam. Having a license would open up doors full of opportunities for both of them. With their mommy and daddy’s support, they were both almost at the finish line they had started out for as part-time students three years ago. They looked forward to making a little more money. As social workers in public service, neither expected to become rich, nor wanted that for themselves. The pay off would instead be less stress about money and more time to spend with Mommy and Daddy! More time spent playing and learning together with their friends at daycare, more time as Littles without having to pretend and act like the grownups they both knew they really weren’t.
“We call today upon the forces of eternal youth to seal these loving bonds between caregivers and littles in matrimony, cooperation and mutual respect. Two couples stand before us today as one family. We are here to formalize the adoptions of Little Troy-Boy by Daddy Derrick, and of Little Cherry-Berry by Mommy Lorraine. We will begin with the grownups. Lorraine, do you take Cherry as your lover and dependent, to have and to hold, to love, honor, supervise, discipline, and care for?”
Cherry looked up at the mature woman who held her hand. 36 years to Cherry’s 32, Mommy Lorraine looked quite statuesque in her tuxedo. There was no mistaking who was in charge between the two of them. Lorraine had short blond hair and emerald and crimson tattoos in a twisting Celtic pattern behind her left ear, which also sported several small thin silver earrings. She smiled down at her little charge. Her petite, diapered girlfriend looked even tinier all dolled up like a little flowergirl. The little girl eagerly sucked on the pink pacifier that was clipped to the collar of her dress.
“I do,” said Mommy Lorraine. She squeezed Cherry’s hand even tighter and Cherry smiled as she barely registered a trickle of pee-pee flow out of her. Her diaper absorbed the pee-pee and Cherry was barely aware she was even wet.
Ms. Samantha turned toward the little girl and smiled sweetly. She reached forward and gently removed the girl’s pacifier, then asked her, “And do you, Cherry, accept Lorraine as your Mommy, your lover and caregiver, to love, honor, respect and obey? Do you accept your Mommy’s discipline and authority?”
“Yes, Miss Samantha!” the girl answered with glee as another spurt of pee-pee entered the absorbent material of her disposable. The two “children” had been encouraged to drink lots in preparation for the part of the ceremony that would come next, after Derrick and Troy exchanged their vows. Cherry locked eyes with Troy and noticed that under his smart-looking schoolboy slacks, his diaper appeared to be expanding too. Ms. Samantha let the girl’s lips take hold once again of her paci. She sucked contentedly.
Satisfied, Ms. Samantha continued on to the man and the boy. “Derrick, do you take Troy as your lover and dependent, to have and to hold, to love, honor, supervise, discipline, and care for?”
Derrick, looking quite well-dressed and powerful in his broad-shouldered tuxedo suit, squeezed Troy’s slim, pink hand with his own, much larger, darker hand. The little boy fidgeted slightly, still getting used to the new chastity device. He looked up at his Daddy with big, puppy dog-brown eyes, eyes almost as dark as Daddy’s beautiful skin. The much bigger, square-jawed, broad-shouldered man hugged his little boy close and said “I do” before removing the boy’s blue pacifier from his lips and letting it dangle on its clip.
“And Troy, do you accept Derrick as your Daddy, your lover and caregiver, to love, honor, respect and obey? Do you accept your Daddy’s discipline and authority?” asked Ms. Samantha.
“I do, Miss Samantha,” said Troy, with a big smile. His daddy let the boy’s slim hand go and he patted his little tyke possessively on his diapered rear. Even through the schoolboy uniform slacks, Troy’s very wet diaper made a slight crinkling sound.
“Very well,” said Ms. Samantha. She stuffed Troy’s blue pacifier back in his waiting lips. She then locked the blue collar and pink collar around Troy’s and Cherry’s necks and presented the collars’ keys to each respective caregiver. “I now pronounce you parents of these formally adopted, adorable littles. Caregivers, you may change their diapers.”
45-year old Alexis and 28-year old Trevor, two smartly-dressed Middles in school uniforms whose play ages varied more narrowly between 12 and 16, assisted with wheeling two adult-sized changing tables to line up neatly with the stage on which Ms. Samantha’s podium rested. The Middles were frequent “volunteers” at the daycare site and also offered babysitting services for younger littles and their caregivers. Taking hold of their littles’ leashes, Mommy and Daddy led Troy and Cherry to the tables, and helped them up using the childish stepping stools that concealed the movable tables’ pull-out plastic training potties. Ms. Samantha handed them each a small container of baby wipes, powder and lotion. Mommy and Daddy began the diaper change by ripping open the tapes and lifting their butts in the air to slide the sodden diapers out from underneath. The wet diapers went in a diaper genie. The caregivers then produced the keys for their littles’ chastity devices and unlocked these, allowing the little ones’ genitals to air out after going over their entire diaper areas with the wipes. After applying lotion, they reattached the kids’ chastity devices and proceeded to powder their diaper areas, rubbing the power into their skin, careful not to tease the chaste little ones too much, but just enough to make them squirm slightly. The kids cooed and moaned pleasurably behind their pacifiers. Troy kept pinching himself, sure that this was a dream, and he would surely wake up somewhere, cold, alone, desperate, and horny with no relief, but his worst fears failed to materialize. As Derrick lifted him off the changing table, Troy felt his entire body relax. If he hadn’t just been changed, he surely would have wet his diaper again. He batted his long, beautiful boy-eyelashes at the adoring crowd of other littles, middles and their caregivers, and basked in the radiant warmth of their cheers and applause. He smiled cutely and kept sucking on his pacifier. 
His dream, five years in the making, had finally come true. He was his Daddy’s property, a happy diapered little prince, pure and simple. For now on, every night, he would come home to Daddy. He would give up the pretense of being an adult when he crossed the threshold of Daddy’s home. They had their rules, their formal contract, and so did Cherry and her mommy. The rules gave them consistency and structure. They set limits and guidelines. They weren’t always easy to follow, but trying to follow them, and submitting to the appropriate punishment when he failed to obey, made his Daddy happy. It made their life together stable. But living under Daddy’s rules was no dictatorship; Troy absolutely had a voice. He had a safeword he could use if things got too intense for him, though he had never used it, his trust in Daddy was such that it had never been necessary. Part of their rules contract allowed for negotiation. And Derrick loved all of Troy, not just Troy-Boy. He loved the streetwise, aspiring social worker who blasted Trap music from his Honda and sent fiery op-eds to local papers and blogs, as much as he loved the diapered little tyke who was content to snuggle all day with his Daddy if he had no pressing business, and who could entertain himself for hours on his solar system playmat with a myriad of action figures on opposite sides of intergalactic conquest.
Dreaming of adventures amidst distant stars, the boy slept contentedly in his Daddy’s arms. When he awoke, his reality confirmed itself: he was diapered, in his daddy’s arms. His diaper was wet and Daddy moaned in his sleep and cupped his hand against the wet mound of diaper covering his crotch. The boy felt his pee-pee stir in his cage, but muscle memory kicked in and it only twitched. The feeling of total emasculation was more liberating every day he lived this secret life. He did enjoy his big boy freedoms.  He and Daddy had negotiated a lot about that. But for the most part, behind closed doors, he lived the life of a child no less than 4 but generally no older than 14. Of course, he loved his job, and his vanilla and platonic friendships, and neither Troy nor Troy-Boy nor Derrick nor Daddy thought it necessary that he should be deprived of a normal life with friends, meaningful work, art, music, and everything sci-fi/horror/fantasy. He was generally allowed to watch adult movies and TV and read whatever he wanted, though he enjoyed children’s media as well as more mature content, but if he misbehaved he risked temporarily losing these sorts of privileges. He was also allowed to listen to the rap music that his Daddy hated, but when he teased Daddy about this, he wound up being mouthsoaped after a warning, and Daddy reminded him politely that, even if “cussing” was a no-no in Daddy’s presence, being married to a black man still did not confer N-word privileges. Daddy really didn’t like that music anyway. His biological son from his first marriage when he was in the closet had been killed at 22nd and Berks during an infamous rap battle. Police had shut that corner down for a while and the boy’s body was left in the street. So Daddy asked that Troy use headphones in the apartment and the car when they were together to enjoy his music. He understood that Troy related to the music because his job took him to neighborhoods like that, where he spent a good deal of time forming relationships with the family members of the kids he was assigned to help. They were families who were struggling with their child’s disabilities, but because the clinic where he worked was Medicaid-funded and this was Philadelphia, the majority of his clients were lower-income and mostly minority families. A large number were African American and Troy had spent so much of his career in African American and minority-dominated cultural spaces- workplaces, kitchens, living rooms, schools- that he was often more comfortable in those spaces than with his own family. That wasn’t why he and Derrick were together though; they had met online, each looking for another with their mutual interest in DD/LB who was local. Daddy’s last boyfriend, with whom he was still on good terms, was Jonah, and he was also Jewish.
There were some things that simply transcended the difference between his real age and whatever his play age was at the moment. They both loved that their play was never just play, and thrilled in finding ways to extend the special aspects of their relationship into their everyday life. For example, Troy wasn’t required by the rules to wear diapers outside the home unless he was with Derrick. He could wear pull ups, or even underwear- including “big boy” underwear, not just cartoonish kiddie briefs in adult sizes, although he enjoyed those too. Troy often chose, however, to wear diapers instead, masking them with his long undershirts, boxer-briefs and well-worn, well-fitting jeans or slacks for work. In the winter he would cover them up additionally with a pair of thermal long underwear. It worked well, and he had never been caught. He joked that the underwear he used to quite the crinkling and rustling of his plastic-backed disposables was his diaper’s “cloaking device.” He and Daddy both loved science fiction and they giggled together at jokes like this.
Troy also wore his chastity device quite frequently, though usually not in Daddy’s company; Daddy had left it on last night after using it for additional humiliation during both wedding ceremonies. The device was silicon and Daddy used the plastic numbered locks because Troy’s job and internship often required him to go through metal detectors at schools and courtrooms. He was a tireless advocate for children and families outside their home. But inside their West Philly apartment, he was happy to wake up in Daddy’s arms, wearing a wet diaper and chastity belt, his pacifier dangling from the collar of his fleece rocketship pajamas, feeling both very small and very elated, like he was the luckiest boy the in the world. He hugged Daddy tight, and the bigger, slightly older man’s eyes fluttered open. He smiled at his captive, willing, eager diaperboy, who to the whole world appeared in his black leather jacket like a strident, sharp-tongued rogue, who stormed into interagency meetings armed with data and strategic alliances, who tirelessly fought for justice and decency in a broken system. He loved his husband and he loved his little boy, and he didn’t give a damn which was which, he hugged them both back. They both silently resolved that today would be the first day of the best of their lives; yesterday was the real wedding. At least, as far as the totality of their relationship was concerned.
They basked in each other’s warmth under the covers. Spring came late to Philadelphia. It was mid-May, and just warming up above a mid-day average of 60. Troy warmed up his diaper with a little spurt of pee-pee left over from his bladder emptying while he slept and yawned. Sure, he'd need a change soon, but his thick, thirsty diaper could handle some more, and it was way more fun to let Daddy take the lead.

885qpj,1,2018-03-29,should i consider leaving my job?,flagrntvagrant,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/885qpj/should_i_consider_leaving_my_job/,"I need some advice. 
I started working at a lab in october of last year. I was so excited because I had been out of the science world for about two years (not by choice; I had worked for a pharmaceutical company that went under and I had to take the first job I could get, which was in tax management. ) After I accepted the position, my manager (the lab director) told me: ""If you get to a point where you are going to walk out, please do me a favor and just talk to me before you do so."" Of course, I knew this was odd but I didn't want to let it get to me. 

I had gotten a position in the mass spec department. The first week of the job ended up being pretty brutal. I was working with a coworker who had his Ph.d. He gave me a difficult time over everything that I did. Some examples: he told me I wasn't allowed to sit in the 'good chair.' When I was weighing acid on the scale, I was doing it too slow. He criticized me for taking notes and told me I was not to write anything down when he spoke. He also told me it was clear that I had absolutely no experience working in the medical field. This was completely untrue, as I had participated in paid internships in college and published research papers. In my interview, I was very clear about my prior experience and was upfront in admitting that I would need to learn the precise methods practiced in this particular lab. 
	When my manager asked me how everything was going, I told him that I did not believe that it was going well and I felt uncomfortable. When my manager spoke with my coworker, he immediately stated that I must be making everything up and that he refused to work with me. My manager told me that I should go back and just wait until things blew over. And so I did. But no one in the mass spec department would speak to me or even make eye contact with me. 

After this ordeal, my manager moved me to another department with a few twenty-something girls. Within a few months, these girls started spreading a few different rumors about me. 1.) I was sleeping with my boss (NOT true) 2.) I was doing school work during work hours (also NOT true) 3.) I was making more money than people who outranked me ( I don't know if this is true, but I never told anyone at the company how much I made). 

I spoke with my manager about the aforementioned rumors because I was really upset and because I didn't want any of the stupid office politics to impact my job. I was busting my butt, working 60 hour weeks...doing everything I good to be a good employee. 

So, the thing is, my bosses are not quite appropriate either...
About two months after I started, My manager asked me, point blank, if I had a specific mental disorder (I'd rather not say which one). And the truth is, I do. I felt really awkward because I'm not typically open, especially about that, but I also felt obligated not to lie. So embarassingly, I admitted that I did. 
I don't think my manager is a bad person. But some of the things he says does hurt my feelings. Once he said, ""a lot of people have things wrong with them, but you, you're clinical.""

The assistant manager is worse. He lies a lot and thinks that he more intelligent and all around better than everyone else. 
He makes things difficult and fines a way to argue that whatever I do is incorrect. Once, he told me that ""email is not an effective mode of communication."" Even though the company policy is to utilize and check company email daily if not more frequently.
Another time, he said, ""we have to stop hiring all of these Indian women who cry all the time."" After he said that, I felt really uncomfortable and talked to my manager. Nothing was done. 

My manager, in the past, has commented on how different I look without makeup. The overall tone felt negative. The one day I did wear make-up, he said, ""You didn't look like that last week."" 

Today, the assistant manager told me that I sometimes look like a cake-face and ""go too heavy on the eyeliner."" 

There are more little instances, but this job is really making me feel awful. I've tried to mention that these things bother me, but when I do it ends up being my fault because I'm ""too sensitive."" 

I don't know what to do..."

886x5t,0,2018-03-29,CMV:Men are actually more oppressed than women in America,TCDWarrior666,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/886x5t/cmvmen_are_actually_more_oppressed_than_women_in/,"Women get much more attention and much more empathy from both genders. It’s easier for women to make friends. Women have far more friends and likes on social media. Women are more protected. Schools are more geared toward a female bookworm learning style then a hands on approach that would benefit men. In dating its the man who has to pay for the women and impress her not the other way around. The wage gap myth has been debunked. The only reason why males have higher salaries then women on average is because women tend to choose lower paying careers. It’s socially acceptable for women to not work and stay at home with the kids. But if men do the same they are mocked. Women get far less sentences for the same crimes as men. There are “ladies night” specials for women at bars/nightclubs but no such deals for men. Male only clubs like Boy Scouts are forced to allow women but not other way around. There are far more groups and services for women then men. Men are forced to sign up for selective services but not women. In family court women are always getting 50% of their husbands money in the divorce and primary custody of the kids. Women can now get men fired for simply accusing a man of sexual harassment or rape without and evidence or his day in court. Women also control access to sex and can wield it over men in exchange for money and undivided attention. Women have a natural beauty men do not have and as a result can be paid large sums of money for posing nude, stripping, escorting or participating in porn. Men are not naturally beautiful and therefore have to work much harder for money. Women are valued for simply existing. Men are valued only if they are successful at their career. 


--------------------------------------------

Voting.

Most men couldn't vote for most of history and neither could most women. Men had to die by the millions before the franchise was given and even then mandatory conscription was the price paid for it. Women got it, just because. In most cases, at least in western countries, women and men got the vote only a few years apart or they got it at the same time.

Bank accounts:

Outside of marriage, women had the largely the same rights as men as far as banking was concerned. Things changed when marriage came into the mix but it wasn't the one sided setup that's been portrayed in popular media. Wives and Husbands had complimentary rights and responsibilities.

For instance, the marital property laws in Britain were changed when a woman (I forget her name) was robbed, and she was shocked when the police report described the cash stolen from her as being the legal property of her husband. She was outraged. She didn't have a right to own property? All the property of the marriage, including that which she had brought into it, legally belonged to her husband?

Now you can see from a reading of suits brought by women in the three courts available to them (ecclesiastical, equity and common law) at least as far back as the 1600s, that LOTS of women had no real idea that the cattle or furniture or money they'd brought with them into the marriage no longer technically belonged to them. There were suits complaining that their husband had mismanaged ""my portion"", or had sold ""my grandfather clock"" against her wishes. Decisions of the courts were a mixed bag, some upholding the woman's claim, some not. But clearly these women weren't existing in marriages where their husbands made it a point to say, ""all your shit belongs to me now.""

On the other hand, their probably wasn't a woman alive who was unaware of the privileges granted her by coverture laws, including the law of agency, which gave women the default right to purchase goods and services on their husbands' credit; their right to be held immune from marital debt; and their dower rights to a life interest in their husbands' real property.

So basically, married women exercised their special rights and privileges (re the law of agency, on a daily or near daily basis), yet most of them were blissfully unaware of many of the restrictions placed on them by the law, because for most women those restrictions tended not to impact their daily lives (unless their husbands were complete pricks). You can see this reflected in some judgments where the courts were forced to side with the husband. In one case, the husband and wife separated when she was pregnant, and she took the layette with her when she left the household. He sued her for its return (and it was technically his property). The decision of the court was that the wife had immediate need of it, and the husband clearly did not, so she should keep it until she no longer had need of it, then return it to her husband. The tone of the decision, despite its upholding of his rights, was that the husband was essentially being a total asshole, and that his claim to the property (despite its significant monetary value and his legal right to it) was petty and an unbecoming, churlish abuse of his legal privilege.

Divorce

In the past men and women still had a near equal right to divorce. The only difference was while men only needed to prove infidelity on the part of their wives, infidelity alone on the part of the husband was not sufficient grounds for the wife--she had to prove cruelty or injury to her dignity as well. This is because husbands were solely financially responsible for any children their wives bore within marriage, so infidelity on the part of the wife represented an additional risk of serious financial injury to the husband (being forced to pay for another man's child). Only women could seek divorce on the basis of cruelty or abuse. Men whose wives were cruel or abusive could not use this as grounds. In addition, husbands and wives had an equal right to ""conjugal relations"" and either could seek divorce if their spouse refused to provide them (within reason) with sex. Back in the middle ages, men accused of ""impotence"" by their wives, and who were facing divorce (and an alimony obligation) used to be made to stand in front of a panel of elder women and prove they could perform sexually. Literally, they had to show a bunch of complete strangers they could achieve an erection in order to avoid a divorce. Divorces could not be granted by simple consent of both parties, however. Both men and women needed adequate grounds to divorce.

On the other hand, women negotiating legal separation or divorce would often exploit the law of agency to rack up massive debts in their husbands' names in order to pressure him to agree to generous alimony, which was his only legal relief from her ability to act as his legal agent and make purchases in his name. This too, while recognized as the right of a woman and not punishable under the law, was frowned on by society.

Now going back to our outraged wife who had just discovered her money was technically the property of her husband. She successfully argued that this was indeed an outrage, other feminists took up her cause, and the result was that women could now hold significant income and wealth separate from their husbands (in terms of their property and earned income, they became femme sole once more). Of course, this put men in something of an untenable position, as they were now required by law to financially support wives who might be independently wealthier than they themselves, but they no longer had access to their wives' incomes in order to do it. Men were also still required to pay the tax owing on their wives incomes and property, but again, had no right or claim to that income or property (or even documentation of it) even for that purpose.

Equal pay for equal work?

CONSAD report

Running for political office?

Women who actually run for political office have equal chances of winning compared to their male counterparts. Fewer women run in the first place however.

Hold religious office?

I'll give you that there haven't been any women popes.

Inheritance to oldest male child?

As a legal default only, and as indicated above, likely because that oldest male child would likely be tasked with the responsibility of keeping the family going if things went tits up.

Social options almost never acessed by a woman unless she had extraordinary power?

Women have had extraordinary social options, far beyond what men have had for basically all of recorded western history. Women could certainly work and get educations prior to the 1800s in the west. What's interesting to note, I would hope, is that most of the women who chose to enter the trades back in the 1400s were orphans--women who were unlikely to make a good marriage. Becoming a tradesman wasn't an easy life--indentured as a child into essentially an unpaid internship that got you little more than room and board, then journeyman status (travelling from town to town), and finally you'd get master status and be able to set up a permanent shop in your mid-twenties.

A woman who married a tradesman, on the other hand, could learn the trade from him, and inherit his master status and his proprietorship if she was widowed, and even take on apprentices. All without having to go through the hardship and toil of being an apprentice or a journeyman.

Additionally, historically women were the only sex protected from spousal abuse. Laws have existed ensuring wives enjoyed ""the security of the peace"" against their husbands since before Blackstone's Commentaries, which was a compendium of already existing laws in England and Wales. Interestingly, there was nothing within the law forbidding a woman from assaulting her husband. As recently as the early 1900s (when states in the US began banning corporal punishment), men in the US were publicly flogged for beating their wives. It was the preferred punishment for men, as fines and prison (which could also be applied) were seen as causing deprivation to the wife (fines came out of the family purse, and men in prison can't earn income).


Continuing on with social options, there's even more. Lets examine women's historical rights with regards to their children:

Prior to the mid 1800s, men got the kids in a divorce. This is because he was solely financially responsible for them. Caroline Norton in the UK convinced the establishment to change the system such that children of ""tender years"" (under 8 or so, later expanded to all minors) rightly belonged with the mother. Of course, dad still got stuck with the cost of financially supporting the kids's household, regardless of whether his ex wife was wealthy in her own right.

More particulars about marital property:

Like I hinted above, prior to the mid 1800s, women handed some (not all) of their property to their husbands upon marriage. In return, they were granted an entitlement to his financial support, rights as his agent to purchase goods on his credit, the right to legal redress if he failed to support her adequately (or used her ""portion"" not to her benefit), dower rights to his real property, and immunity from prosecution/penalty even on debts she solely accrued.

First wave feminists changed things such that a married woman held her income and property ""femme sole"" (as if unmarried), meaning her husband (and children) had no right or claim to it (and again, I want to reiterate her husband had no right to even see documentation of it). Yet all of the benefits and entitlements of marriage for women remained in place. A woman could invest her money unwisely and go into debt, and her husband was held responsible for repayment. If she refused to pay her taxes, her husband could go to prison for tax evasion, because paying the taxes on her income and property was still legally his responsibility. She could still accrue debt in his name. She still maintained the right to demand he support her and the children, even if she was wealthy, and had the right to sue him if she was forced to spend a penny of her own money on her own upkeep, let alone his or the children's. Dower rights remained in place, meaning she could sell a house she owned without his permission or knowledge, but he could not sell a house he owned without her consent.

Incidentally, feminists in New York State in 1910 were claiming that these changes didn't go far enough. They insisted that rights regarding children discriminated against mothers, and should be equalized. Of course, by then, the Tender Years doctrine was in place (favoring women), and within marriage mothers were considered equal custodians and guardians of their children. The only part of the law that discriminated against women was regarding minor children's property and income, which the law rightly placed in the care of the father (the parent financially responsible for supporting said children). Feminists, however, wanted women to have equal control over their children's money, despite legally bearing no financial responsibility to them whatsoever.

Contracts:

By the late 1800s, feminists, in conjunction with changes to marital property law, won the right for married women to enter into contracts in their own names. Of course, at the time, their husbands were still legally liable for any debts their wives might accrue, so it became common practice for lenders to require a male cosigner on mortgages and loans. That is, they wanted to identify a male who would take responsibility for the debt if she defaulted, and have access to his credit rating before lending money. This avoided the inevitable sticky legal mess of locating the man responsible after the fact and getting their money back.

Imagine if your spouse could walk into a bank and be given a credit card in her name without your knowledge or consent, and then when the bill came due you were held responsible for paying it.

Incidentally, by the 1960s, feminists were complaining that the practice of requiring a male cosigner arbitrarily discriminated against women and it was made illegal. Changes ameliorating men's responsibility to repay their wives' debts came later, mostly via case law.

I'll be working in Burbank this summer and I'm currently looking for housing. I'd prefer to live in a COOP as I lived in one last summer in Austin and had an amazing time. When searching for COOPs in LA I found UCHA, but they are located near UCLA so the commute would be too long.

Is anyone aware of any other COOP housing near Burbank, or any housing suitable for interns for that matter?

Thanks!"

This aunt was super nice a when I first arrived. She took me under her wing and would even pick me up from my apartment from time to time so I can spend time with her (her kids all have families now, so it was just her and her husband with their 3 dogs)

Her kids were okay, but their words definitely don’t
hold bearing cause they barely did what they said they would (I once waited all day at my apartment cause I invited them for pizza and drinks a week before and they all said yes, no one arrived and all of my texts/calls went unanswered).

A year later doors opened for me, I brought my cousins along to every event I could take them (I got a job at a Production company) surprisingly they showed for these but never when I invited them over.

Turns out one cousin was N too and told their mom that all the events and even my internship was fake. How can i take them to an event if it was fake? Why would I drive half an hour away 3x a week if my internship was fake??

Sadly NAunt believed it and even called my mom to tell her that one particular event I was going to did not exist (This was after I sent her and my mom the email that gave instructions and who my contact person would be, the event was easily found on google too) the event existed and I ended up going alone. unfortunately my mom never told me about this until after shit hit the fan, if I had known sooner I wouldn’t have been open to my aunt about the events I had for my internship. 

Turns out my NAunt was assasinating my character behind my back. She was telling everyone I was a liar and she and my NCousin told everyone else in the family to stay away from me. My NAunt even went as far as interviewing another cousin and her husband after they went to Florida with me. 

2 months later. My mom and dad flew over from Australia and brought me home because they felt like  I was not safe there anymore. 

Now, I need to go back for an event that I was invited to help out in and my only sole cousin has been really cold to me, she knew I was flying out and staying for at least 2 weeks, took her 3 days to reply. Then suddenly I get a text asking me “How many DAYS are you staying?” Like I haven’t even gotten there and I just felt like she really didn’t want me to stay over. 

So now I’m second guessing. My mom doesnt want me to stay at hotels and such and says for her peace of mind that I stay with said cousin (she doesnt know that said cousin has been cold) "

887gm7,1,2018-03-29,"Some days I find myself wanting to believe, and others I find it to be a pile of horse shit. I just need to vent.",smp501,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/887gm7/some_days_i_find_myself_wanting_to_believe_and/,"I don't care if anyone reads this, but I just need to vent. It's easter time and a lot of old feelings are coming up.

I grew up evangelical and bought it all hook, line, and sinker. I went to church every Sunday and most Wednesdays since birth, and spent 4+ days per week in youth group as a student or volunteer all through high school and as a ""youth group intern"" my first summer in college. I did the whole thing - praying at abortion clinics, giving ""talks"" to middle- and high-school kids, etc. I even wanted to go into ministry myself, although (thankfully) my parents told me to get my bachelors degree in what I am good at (STEM) and look into ministry afterwards.

By the middle of college I began to see how braindead and purely emotional/political evangelical christianity is, and found myself converting to catholicism. I loved the history, the tradition, and the emphasis on social justice (vs. the ""give me muh guns and fuck the poor/gays"" mentality that pervades evangelicalism here in the south). Honestly I met some of the best people I know in my small catholic campus group and I do still have infinitely more respect intellectually for catholicism vs. evangelicalism.

However, one thing that both beliefs had in common for me is an overwhelming sense of guilt and shame, despite all of their ""no more guilt"" bullshit that they had to sing/preach all the time. For most of my adolescent and young adult years, I hated myself. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake the ""you're a terrible sinner who hurts God and hurts the church by sinning"" feeling, no matter how many times they told me ""God loves you anyway."" Nobody wants to be a charity case. Who the fuck wants to hear ""you're a piece of shit and you better know it, and you hurt me every day, but I overlook it and love you anyway""??? No matter what, though, I never missed church/mass. If I did, then the guilt only compounded.

Finally I met my wife, who comes from a purely cultural catholic family, and we got married. We haven't been to church in close to a year, and, honestly, I don't really find myself missing it (and she definitely doesn't). Now that I'm not in it anymore, a lot of it just seems so silly to me. I remember as a new catholic, learning about lent and abstaining from meat, especially on good friday. Now that I'm where I am, it just seems so dumb to think that the creator of the universe, who is eternal, all powerful, and is more intelligent/complex vs. us than we are vs. a single-cell microbe, not only let humanity in its current form exist for like 200,000 years before ""reaching out to us,"" but gives a fuck if I eat a burger on one day out of the year. Its like me caring and eternally judging a bacterium for squirming left vs. right. 

And don't get me started on all the heaven/hell shit. It just seems so ridiculous and man-made to think that whoever/whatever created the universe, which cannot be measured in any unit that we can fathom and is more complex than any of us can understand, genuinely cares what we do in our 80ish years of existence enough to make us suffer forever for choices that we make in what equates to a tiny blip of time. Or that masturbating as a 13 year old causes it sadness and suffering. Or that, despite us being bugs floating on a rock, it couldn't figure out a way to just let us know what is true or isn't. For an eternal being, wouldn't it be easy to just show up and let all 7 billion of us know what is true and what isn't, so we don't keep killing each other in the name of some ""god"" or ""gods""? What's the point?

Anyway, this time of year I still find myself feeling like I ""should"" go to church on easter, or fast on good friday, etc. I still miss the community that was there for me when I needed friends and who treated me so well (especially the catholic community - all my fucking evangelical friends disappeared the moment I joined a different version of christianity).

Like I said, I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess I just wonder if I'm the only one who somewhat wishes I did still believe, but just can't. Now that I see how silly the beliefs are, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills or something when everyone around me (the south) still goes to church/bible study/etc. I wouldn't totally say I'm an atheist, but more of an agnostic theist (i.e. I think that something made us, but know that it totally unprovable and that whatever did is so much more intelligent/complex than us that we couldn't possibly pretend to understand how it thinks or what it wants). 

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be somewhere where nobody really believes, like the northeast or west coast, or western Europe. I don't know. I just definitely know that when I have kids, they aren't going to be spending their Sundays all dressed up being told that they are garbage that god love anyway, or sitting in youth group being told that taking a ""second look"" at a pretty girl is basically adultery that hurts god, or that having sex makes them like ""chewed gum"" or ""used tape."" Or that atheists/non-christians have no sense of morality and will try to destroy their lives. Or that by being christians, they are living in a ""fish bowl,"" where the world is always watching them and waiting for them to make a mistake to say ""Ah ha! So Christians are all hypocrites!"" All the shit I heard for years.

I feel like the more I type, the angrier I get. It just seems to manipulative and fake - like it's not about ""god"" or ""the afterlife"" or whatever, just control and conformity. But why do I still feel bad about calling it bullshit and walking away? Has anyone else every felt like this?"

It's very long and very salacious so I do reccomend reading the whole thing, but if not here's the summary and some of the best bits

The same weird perv who created Ren &amp; Stimpy is shockingly even more pervy than his cartoon. When a 14 year old fan wrote to Kricfalusi saying she wanted to work for him someday, he wrote back. It escalates from there

&gt;Soon, she said, she began receiving boxes of toys and art supplies from 39-year-old Kricfalusi, better known as John K. ...And then, when she was still in 11th grade, he flew her to Los Angeles to show her his studio and talk about her future. She said that on the same trip, in a room with a sliding glass door that led to his pool, he touched her genitals through her pajamas as she lay frozen on a blanket he’d placed on the floor. She was 16.

So no one thought it was weird the Ren &amp; Stimpy guy was hanging out with an underage girl? Apparently not

&gt;Although sexual abuse allegations against Kricfalusi have never been made public before, his relationship with Byrd has been an open secret within animation — so open that “a girl he had been dating since she was fifteen years old” was referenced briefly in a book about the history of Ren &amp; Stimpy.

But don't worry,  having a 16 year old girlfriend was part of his beautiful personal struggle that made him what he is today

&gt;On Kricfalusi’s behalf, an attorney responded to a detailed list of allegations in this story with the following statement: ""....For a brief time, 25 years ago, he had a 16-year-old girlfriend. Over the years John struggled with what were eventually diagnosed mental illnesses in 2008. To that point, for nearly three decades he had relied primarily on alcohol to self-medicate. Since that time he has worked feverishly on his mental health issues, and has been successful in stabilizing his life over the last decade. This achievement has allowed John the opportunity to grow and mature in ways he’d never had a chance at before.""

There was also a second girl who he met through a fan letter he was grooming around this time. In true 90's fashion, they started up a steamy correspondence on AOL

&gt; In an AOL conversation he told her not to copy and send to her friends, he said, “I wnat [sic] to squeeze you,” and “I’m crazy about you, Katie”; he asked her, “Do I ever make you tingle?” In an email she printed and saved from a few days after she turned 15, the 41-year-old man wrote, “I’m thinking about you very hard right now. And I have a little tickle in my chest.” Now 36, Rice looks at these old pages with some of the compliments underlined in purple gel pen and cringes.

John shared his love of gussy with his new flame, although he had a curious and much more snazzy word for it

&gt; They never had physical sexual contact, but when Rice lived in Nevada, she remembers several late-night phone calls during which Kricfalusi said, “Repeat after me: John’s dick slides in my puzzy” (his pronunciation of the word) while he masturbated on the other end of the line. 

But back to the other plate this Chad was spinning

&gt;That same winter, Kricfalusi flew out to visit Byrd, then a high school junior, at home in Arizona. They had sex for the first time at a nearby hotel, she said, and put into motion a series of decisions that would reshape the rest of her teenage years. She’d move in with Kricfalusi for the summer and intern at Spumco, then complete her senior year at a private school in Arizona, and he would cover the tuition. He told her he could give her an animation career in Los Angeles when she graduated. She and her mother believed him.

So after Byrd moved in with Kricfalusi they were going steady, living together, working together, and Byrd possibly starring in his child pornography

&gt;Sometime between 1998 and 2000, Mora went to a party at Kricfalusi’s house that has bothered him for years. He remembered Byrd, who was no older than 20, was drunk and seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness when Kricfalusi called Mora over to him. “And then he pulled out these Polaroids of Robyn basically — how can you say it? — going down on him. … He’s like, ‘What do you think of that?’”

Byrd breaks up with him in 2002, and he begins focusing his attention on Rice, who was he'd been employing on and off since she was 18. But don't worry, thanks to one weird trick and some serious timeline shifting, it's not actually sexual harassment

&gt;In emails, Kricfalusi demanded her professional loyalty. He also continued to pressure her for affection. Through a lawyer, Kricfalusi denied harassing Rice, saying, ""John's avid pursuit of her romantically was all after the company went out of business and he was no longer her employer."" But around the time of the new Ren &amp; Stimpy show, which was produced by Spumco and employed Rice, he wrote her a letter expressing sadness over his breakup, and also told Rice she was pretty and that he wished he could cuddle with her

When Byrd was doing a stint at Disney, Kricfalusi drops his Chad act in favor of NiceGuy tactics

&gt;On Oct. 19, 2004, when Rice was working at Disney, 49-year-old Kricfalusi contacted Rice via her work email. He wrote that he’d been resentful, as a 41-year-old man, of the classmate Rice liked when she was 15. “You used to make me very jealous … and you would never admit you liked me in a romantic way.” At the end of that email, he begged her to be in a relationship with him, writing, “I would worship you and bve [sic] your best partner and friend and everything that would be good to be.

After several years of sexual harassment, there was finally a straw that broke the camel's back

&gt;Rice said she finally did leave after two incidents that happened in relatively close succession: The first was his half-threat of rape during the Weird Al job, and then, she said, she found child porn on his computer. Rice said she found images of girls she didn’t recognize, naked; she remembered one photo in particular, with a naked girl who appeared to be around 10 years old, lying on her back with her legs spread and an expression on her face that Rice described as fearful. An ex-girlfriend of Kricfalusi’s, who asked not to be named in this story, said she, too, saw naked images of prepubescent girls who appeared to be between 12 and 14 on his personal computer around 2007.

Last year, Rice and Byrd did try reporting this to the LAPD, who declined to follow up on the allegations of child porn or that Kricfalusi had sex with a girl below California's age of consent. So they took their story to Buzzfeed. If you didn't get your fill of Kricfalusi's disturbing pillow talk, check the article. It also has some drawings he did for the girls, pictures he took of them, and [romantic couples photos like this one](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-03/29/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/sub-buzz-30824-1522342902-3.jpg?downsize=1040:*&amp;output-format=auto&amp;output-quality=auto)"
887nmy,1,2018-03-30,Could use some advice about this guy friend,Smileyari16,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/887nmy/could_use_some_advice_about_this_guy_friend/,"Hello everyone!

I'm 21 y/o, in college at the moment and been a believer my whole life. Today I'd like to share a little bit about myself and this guy friend that I have and hopefully get some clarity on our situation. 

So this past summer, him and I were both interns at the same place. (We go to school in different states). We immediately became super good friends, and he was always super sweet to me. (Although it seemed he was a lot less nice to other people lol). But at some point in the summer, him and I had only hung out a few times at that point, he was saved.

The whole story of how he was saved is wonderful, and supernatural, and amazing, but at a different point, I can go into greater detail on that later. But basically, him and I started to go to church together. I was able to introduce him to a lot of people in our community, and he loved it. He quickly made a bunch of friends in church, and started doing work giving back to it. He led high-school sermons, did non-profit work, and seemed to really love and understand Jesus on a deeper level.

At some point later in the summer, his best friend was diagnosed with cancer, and it sort of twisted him. He was already definitely a guy with a LOT of edge, but he went to a different place. For a few days, he disappeared. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't see him for a few days until church when we met up for coffee. I prayed for him, talked to him for I think 2-3 hours just about life and he told me some things that made me feel really sad for him. He revealed how he lost close family members and even a parent to cancer in the past. We prayed together, and other members of our community came together later and he seemed to really appreciate it. 

I was able to hold myself together while i was with him, but afterwards I went to my car and cried for a long time. 

Then the next 2 weeks were really emotional, for both of us I think. We hung out a few times, and the change in him was really startling. He's normally a sort of edgy, giant sweetheart,(to me at least) but to other people he just became different. When we played basketball with our co-workers for fun, he took it really serious and would dunk the ball/talk mean to us on the other team. I tried to talk to him, and he just ignored me. His eyes were scary, he was legitimately in a different, darker place and I was just at a loss. 

Then with some of our mutual friends, we all went out to the beach to hangout, this is the night before he leaves to go back to school. We all had an amazing time, and his positive energy was just infectious. He was picking us up, throwing us in the water. He held me down against the sand and tickled me so much I couldn't breath. It was the best night of the whole summer honestly.

Then at the end of the night, it was just us in the parking lot. And it was just like we were in church again, we had a really special send off, and definitely agreed to always keep in touch and hang out again when we both got back home. 

It was around this time that I started thinking that he had a bit of a crush on me. Other people had brought it up before and asked if we were dating and stuff like that, but regardless I definitely reciprocated those feelings.

The issues started to arise after that a little. Because we were so busy with school and stuff, when other things happened in his life, he reached out a couple of times over the phone because he needed spiritual help. I tried as best I could from afar, but honestly I couldn't do it properly as I would have in person.

Then when our winter break happened, we hung out a few times and it was amazing. He ran into my dad in church, and met my little brother and sister, and they all hit it off. When it was just us, one on one he was the same guy. Then two days before I left to go back to school, I was spending all day with my family because I'd neglected them so much.

So he texts me saying it's really important and that I needed to meet with him if I cared about him. I would have loved to, but I couldn't leave my family because of how little time I'd spent with them. He ended up texting me a few times in a row, saying it was really important and honestly sounding a bit annoying.

It was in the moment, and because I was so busy, I forgot about it because I was worried about my packing, and family and other stuff, etc. I was super behind on all those things with only a day left.

So then the next day, he sends me another message. He said that the reason he wanted to meet was because he wanted to tell me in person that he thinks it's best that he and I not talk for a while. He mentioned vaguely about how it was about finding his true identity in Christ, and living the truth.

I just didn't know what to say. I'm saddened and hurt that he feels that way. But I just don't understand. I told him that I didn't want to question how the Lord might be speaking to him, and that if he feels that's what's best, that would be fine.

We haven't talked since then, so it's been a couple of months. I don't know what to do about him. We'll be seeing one another in about a month or so when we both get back home, with us going to the same church and having some of the same friends and what not. I just don't know what to do.

Please advise family! This situation is very stressful

887yi8,1,2018-03-30,I screamed I was Debt Free 11 years ago. This is where I'm at now,dudeman456789,DaveRamsey,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaveRamsey/comments/887yi8/i_screamed_i_was_debt_free_11_years_ago_this_is/,"I thought reading a story from a random dude, like me, who did his debt free scream 11 years ago might be inspiring to some people here. While I've never abandoned Dave's principals, I stopped listening to his podcast over the years and am now am just getting back into it. I thought I would share my story (my apologies on length). 

I screamed I was debt free live on the radio to Dave on Friday, April 13th 2007. I was 23 years old, working as a intern in Boulder, CO and delivering pizzas at night to pay rent/eat. I had paid off $32k from in 15 months. $24k was school loans and $8k was a car loan I owed my dad. My net-worth was my Baby Step 1 emergency fund of $1,000. 

In 2008, I got my first ""real"" job out of college in Minneapolis, MN making $30k/yr. I continued to deliver pizzas at night and built up my BS3 emergency fund throughout most of 2008 and started investing in mutual funds, 401k and Roth IRA at the height of the recession. 

In 2009, I saved up cash and bought a ""new to me"" car that was 2 years old and had less than 5,000 miles on it for a deal of a lifetime ($6k). I still drive that car today, even though it has over 100k miles on it and has been beat up. 

I received a job offer in Los Angeles and moved to California in 2010 for an associate job making $44k. I was 27 and had a net-worth of $90k. I lived with a friend from high school in a ""guest room"" (aka a large closet). The place was a dump and a terrible spot for a single guy, but rent was only $545/month and living in a high cost of living area, like Los Angeles... the low rent helped me save and I was still able to have a life.
 
In 2012, my income increased to $65k as I finally hit a manager position at 28. I was still renting, saving and still driving the same car. 

By my 30th birthday, I finally got a Director level job and was making $90k/year. My net-worth was $183k. I was still renting, saving and driving the same car.

I had saved enough to buy a small condo in early 2015 for $445k (keep in mind, this is LA, it wasn't glamorous by any means). I had 20% down due to diligently saving for all of those years. It was a 2bed/1 bath condo a mile from the beach and my mortgage with HOA was $2400/month. I was able to rent out the second bedroom to random roommates for $1350/month to help pay the mortgage for a few years until my girlfriend (eventually my wife) moved in. 

I got married in 2017. My wife and I combined incomes and we had enough to put down 20% on a $640k house for ourselves. Luckily, we didn't have to sell the condo to buy our home, and we are able to rent it out for $2800/month; we are cash flowing $400/month and will hopefully have it paid off within the next 10-15 years. 

Currently, I'm 34. We have a net-worth of $794k. I still drive the same car I bought in 2009. I make $140k at my full-time job and deliver for Uber on the weekends for extra spending money. We do have a credit card but pay it off every month. My wife leases her car, which...I don't like but it's worth whatever the opportunity cost is for us not to have an argument about it. 

Sorry for the novel. I don't write this as a humble brag, but instead thought it'd be interesting, since I often have wondered what happens to people after they yell the debt free scream. 

Thanks for reading. "
88836p,1,2018-03-30,I Commute With a Full Face Helmet,gingermonky,bicycling,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/88836p/i_commute_with_a_full_face_helmet/,"So, a little background to set this up. I'm a full time student and work an internship. On every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I commute from my house to my work (10 mi), to school (8), back to work, then home from there. Totaling close to 40 miles three days a week. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I only commute a few miles just to and from campus. I don't own a car, so I do this every day regardless of weather, unless I'm sick.

My point for making this post, is to mostly get feedback, and maybe convince people who are on the fence about full face helmets to go for it.

I originally started thinking about a full face helmet after my girlfriend got hit by an asshole in an F250. He didn't look when turning left. Thankfully my girlfriend was okay except some bruises, and the loss of her bike (he had no insurance, so there wasn't much we could do). I looked at my helmet at the time, the Gyro Montero, and thought about all of the angles that I was safe from in a fall. I just wasn't pleased.

After deciding that I really only care how I look when I get off my bike, and I'm totally fine looking like a goon while I commute I decided to get the Fox Proframe. It's one of the lightest full face helmets out, there it's well vented, has MIPS. Go ahead and xpost this to /r/hailcorporate, I don't care. The biggest downside. I look like a goon when I'm wearing my normal clothes on a hot day with a full face helmet. I don't find it to be significantly hotter, or heavier than my old helmet. It kinda gets in the way when I'm trying to look over my shoulder, but not too bad.

Ultimately, my philosophy on full face helmets comes down to two things. I can break my arms, ribs, or legs and at my age, I'll forget which side it was in two or so years. If I fall and smash my face, I'll be able to look in the mirror and remember it every day until I die. Fake teeth are expensive, crooked noses are ugly, and broken jaws hurt like a bitch. The second part of my philosophy is what I said earlier; as a commuter cyclist, I don't care how I look on my bike, I just want to look normal off of it.

So, am I an over-cautious idiot for wearing a full face to commute, and what's stopping you from wearing full face?"

We met in college. This past semester, he has grown really close to one of his engineering friends that happens to be female. She is really nice, and they work together a lot. I hung out with her and my boyfriend a handful of times and it didn't seem like they were actively pursuing each other, but I could sense that there was a bond forming. My boyfriend and I at the time were drifting a part because of how busy we are with school. So I wanted to have a sit down talk with him and see where we are in our relationship. We talked, and he confessed to me that he is unsure of his feelings for his engineering friend. We ultimately are working on our relationship and it's better, but I'm still constantly thinking about them together every moment my boyfriend and I are not together. I trust him that he wouldn't make any physical move, but I'm more concerned with the emotional cheating. 

He is now helping her get an internship with the same company that he is interning with across the country. The thought of him being thousands of miles away from me and with the girl that makes me the most insecure is eating me alive. How do I make myself feel better about this situation? Is it hopeless?

TLDR: boyfriend possibly working across the country with a girl that makes me nervous of them forming a relationship that's more than friends."
88aovo,1,2018-03-30,An intern's story about Hillary,peterboykin,The_NewDonald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_NewDonald/comments/88aovo/an_interns_story_about_hillary/,"An intern's story about Hillary
   
 A bespectacled and short-haired young woman walks into Hillary's office, clutching a clip-board close to her chest. Her eyes are wide - magnified behind her oversize lenses.""Madam,"" she squeaks. Hillary looks up from behind her polished hardwood desk - a near perfect replica of the Oval Office's Resolute Desk, the only noticeable difference being the swirled Ourobouros emblazoned at its centre - a black and fiersome snake devouring itself where the American Eagle should be. Like the intern's clip-board, the desk's surface is bare.""Ah. You. The young person. Yes. The young... blood,"" Hillary grins, more tooth than mouth. ""Well? What did you find? What did you Google? What are they saying? About the men? The men who lost?"" Her questions come fast and jab like prodding fingers. ""Madam..."" ""Madam. Madam what?"" ""Madam... President,"" the young woman ammends.Hillary smiles and leans back in her chair - or tries to anyway. The two dark-suited and serious-faced men hovering behind the diminished woman step forward as she leans; they quietly tip the chair back for her. Another intern, Raul emerges like a critter from underneath the broad oak slab to raise Mrs Clinton's feet, propping them on the varnished desktop and adjusting them with careful eye to look casual - carefree. ""Well?"" though Hillary's voice is powerful and direct, it carries a certain soft and playful twang with it. The bespectacled woman relaxes, visibly - shoulders loosening as the breath held tight in her chest sighs out from her in a low wheeze. ""Well... I went to the Huffington Post. I went to Salon. Have you heard of Buzzfeed?"" ""Buzz... Feed..."" the words come out in a wet slither and Hillary's eyes glaze. There is a cold fire in them. They flicker and dart, not inside her head but inside her skull; a crazy thought to have, yes, but the young woman feels it nonetheless. She rashes with goosebumps. ""Buzzfeed said it would be mine. They said it was a certainty, a sure thing.""With a machinelike precision, Raul and the looming black-suits descend on the sagging woman once more; now Raul pulls her feet back under the desk and props her elbow thoughftully on top of it, resting her chin upon her palm as the dark agents push her chair forward, upright and alert. ""You can nix Buzzfeed from the list,"" she says. Raul shakes her hand dismissively, tossing the idea in the figurative trash. The young woman smiles at Hillary, praying that it looks sincere. ""Okay. Well the Huffington Post offered the most clear picture anyway,"" she says, studying the back of her pressed chipboard intently, as if reading from her notes. ""Nobody has ever been as criticized as you. Ever - they say. Ever in history."" Hillary nods, unassisted, as if this news confirms what she already knew. ""They say you lost because of sexism. Because of misogynists."" ""And the Rusians?"" ""Y-y-yes. The Russans too."" Hillary's eyes glaze again. ""Filthy slavs. If I had that button..."" she whispers. ""If I had that button.""She makes a swinging motion with her hips and her enormous, leather office chair begins to twist. A bodyguard comes forward again and completes the motion for her, freeing her from the deep recess and then hoisting the papery-skinned sack of elderly flesh onto her feet. He then shuffles his shoes underneath hers, setting the pear-shaped woman ontop of his feet. Like this, he is able to walk Madam Clinton around the wide bureau and over to the goggle-eyed young intern.""You're new here,"" she says, swooping in close and inhaling of the young girl deeply. At this distance, Hillary's damp and fungal musk is near overpowering. ""How did you find it? Orientaton?"" ""It was-"" the young girl steels herself, quashing the unsteady waver in her throat. ""It was great!"" Her smile is wide. It supresses her need to gag.""Show me your mark,"" Hillary demands. ""The brand. Roll it up, girl."" Another bodyguard emerges from the shadows and grips the intern's arm, yanking her sleeve up and popping a number of stitches tik-tik-tik-tik-tik as he reveals the white flesh beneath. Her scar is freshly scabbed - a deep maroon crust running lengthways up the inner wrist, all the way to her elbow.""Does it hurt?"" Hillary asks. Her voice is soft again - a country grandma. Her eyes are deadly needles buried within two deep cushions. ""No. Not anymore."" ""Oh. Good. That's lovely. I hope you don't mind if I... Just... Have a little..."" Hillary's jaw widens and her tongue lolls from it, a bright pink slug, nearly a foot long and easily the most vital part of her. It seems to command the greying and corpselike hag. It drags her face down to the crook of the young woman's elbow, where it seeks out the lip of her ragged scar and peels it up.""Mmhmh,"" she slobbers as the intern stands stiff, her free hand balled and fisted inside her mouth to hush the coming shrieks. Hillary's squirming tongue wedges itself between the bloody and raw flesh of the girl's arm and runs down the fresh scar, curling the scab like a crispy roll of butter as she works her way down to the girl's wrist. ""You taste-,"" she says, crunching down on the human jerky and savouring it like a gourmet amuse-bouche. ""You taste like the eldest. Your blood is rich with knowledge. A good fortune bestowed - the suns will darken as the twin moons align. Where were you on election night?"" The girl dosn't respond. ""A thousand gallons of this... It would have made all the difference. Raul,"" she calls. ""This one is full of the secret taste. We'll need her stock for the upcoming fight. Take her to the pens. Get her on the drips. Do the same for her kin - mother, sister, cousins if they are close enough. Six gallons or more a night - we might have time yet. Do not spill a drop of it!"" she commands and at this, Raul bows. ""Yes,"" she continues. ""Time. Plenty of it until 2020. A thousand gallons burned on the pyre. If the moons are right..."" The intern shakes her arm to free it, but the bodyguard's grip is strong. There is a prick in her side. A syringe flashes as Raul pockets it. The world slows down. Darkens. She can feel her heels dragging on the floor as she is pulled somewhere, but there is no fight left in her. No bones in her flesh. No pain in her arm anymore, either. No smell of shit. No fear. Only Hillary - her white and craglike face. The pulsinng tongue between her yellowed teeth. The coiled Ourobouros, hungry for its own flesh.

88atuu,0,2018-03-30,Asking Roommate to Move Out,Visual_Web,Roommate,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roommate/comments/88atuu/asking_roommate_to_move_out/,"We live in a two bedroom apartment, my wife and I in one room, he in the other. He's a great roommate for the most part, but he has absolutely no social life and never ever leaves. This wouldn't be a problem, except we're in a modern ""loft style"" apartment, so there are no doors, except for the bathroom. There is also a foot tall gap between the walls and the ceiling. We're all in school and it's our senior year, and when we moved in together my wife and I were desperate to live close to the school instead of commuting - and were unable for various reasons to find a place in the city ourselves. We still were leaning no - because we're married, and doors and such, and we were up front about that before signing the lease. Roommate in question said he worked in the lab all the time and would barely be home, and would be working in the woodshop as well.

Fast forward, he doesn't work in the lab, ever, and the woodshop job didn't go through (he hadn't applied yet...). We have talked to him about the situation a few times, and were just open and honest, and he's always just kind of like ""Oh yeah, sorry about that"" and he'll leave for the day, but his natural pattern of behavior is still to stay at home. We usually have to ask him to leave for a bit, which he is nice and cool with, but it's awkward for us, and how often is it really reasonable to ask someone to leave their home?

So basically, right now our schedules are at least slightly different, and they ARE school labs and events and stuff. Once we graduate, we will all be working 9 to 5, and there isn't anywhere else for him to work on stuff and it doesn't feel reasonable to ask him to leave in the evening. But hey, I have to fuck my wife sometimes, so there's that.

I know some people just go with the one roommate putting on headphones and it not being the biggest deal kind of situation - this really I don't think would work for either of us. He has made it clear he would much rather leave than be here, and he's a awkward virgin who I even talking about sex makes him uncomfortable.

So basically, we would like to either move out and switch the full lease to him after graduating, or take over the lease ourselves and him sublet a different place (there are a lot of cheap places to sublet because of all the students living in the area that move out for the summer). We want to give him the option of who stays/who goes, but the thing is, the apartment we're in is kind of expensive because it is around campus and the city, and it just isn't likely a place he would want to foot the bill for being just himself.  My wife and I since we'll both be working (and we have jobs lined up, while he has an internship lined up currently) the rent here isn't really an issue for the time being. We all would have preferred a 9 month lease but it wasn't offered.

We're all on the lease, but the lease is also fairly chill about switching the lease over. So is it out of line to want to move or have him move before august? He seems to feel like we're great roommates, and he's not a bad roommate, we just want to be able to live like we're married again.

TL:DR We're married students with a roommate in an apartment with no doors, after graduation we would like to either move or take over the lease."

I take synthroid 50 mcg for hypothyroidism, birth control, and prozac for OCD. I work as a paid intern for a city and I’m in my last semester in college for Geographic Information Systems.

3.5-4 years ago, I randomly woke up one day with terrible pain in my lower right side. Thought it was a pulled muscle and later a pinched nerve and it never was relieved with steroid shots or pain meds when I went to the clinic or doctor and I was also working at this time had to quit due to the pain. 

Then my 3 year journey of misdiagnosis and  doctors believing I was making it up began. Last summer, I was referred to an orthopedist and got a normal x-ray in his office and he saw something with my hip sockets. He referred me and set me up for a special MRI called an arthroscopy and I got that done (by the way wasn’t fun getting that done) and it came back for my right hip that I’ve had a torn labrum cartilage for 3 years and my hip socket created extra bone in the socket or a bone spur. He said that was my problem and I was happy to know that I could move on and that someone finally listened. 

About a month or two later, I began having pain in my left hip and the same lingering feeling but it was not as painful as my right hip when that began 3 years ago. I called my orthopedist and he said to come back in and he did say I had a bit of the extra bone forming on my left hip socket too and he wanted to do another MRI arthroscopy, I got that done on my left hip and the labrum cartilage was torn in that one as well. He referred me to a surgeon who specializes in hip arthroscopic surgery and I was going to get it done in my right hip since it went longer with the pain, but I decided against it since I’m about to graduate and I was told this may not fix the problem overall. He also verified and I got the same hip MRIs at his hospital/office and he showed me the scans and backed up my local orthopedist’s diagnosis and findings before he talked about the surgery. 

I don’t let this bother me as much anymore and I’m just carrying on with my life and focusing on finishing this semester and starting my career, but I have been curious of what this hip socket or bone problem could be linked to or what could have caused it? At the time, I was not playing any sports and it seems the cartilages just tore randomly from my understanding? My job at that time wasn’t very physically demanding on my hips either I don’t believe.


Thanks for any input and if you have any questions, I will answer or go more in-depth about my 3 years if needed.

88bhnj,70,2018-03-30,Anyone else find it frustrating that...,Sea_of_Hope,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/88bhnj/anyone_else_find_it_frustrating_that/,"...Deku's achievements and accomplishments in the series rarely get noticed or commended on by the general public? I understand that Midoriya has a very heroic spirit and he does things without expecting gratitude, but considering what he's done for other people's sake, it's very apparent Horikoshi likes to paint Deku's achievements being unnoticed by the general populace.  


The only 2 instances I remember him being commended on his heroic actions were: 

* After the incident with Stain by the police dog chief. 

* Kouta writing a thank you letter for saving him from Muscular (_as well as an apology for punching him in the balls lol_) 


A prime example of this was during the Internship Arc where his defeat of Overhaul is kept on the DL due to it being a covert operation. Nejire even noted that he fought Overhaul in a way that would minimize risk in the residential area as well as being the one to actually save Eri (not to discredit Mirio or any of the other heroes, just saying). This event is never brought to the light of day nor do I believe any of the other heroes will acknowledge it even though Uraraka made it public knowledge to the heroes and the police there. 

I just fear that even his heroic attempts at trying to stop Gentle will, once again, never be highlighted by his peers. 


When will Deku build his reputation to the general public outside of ""the crazy boy that fought by destroying his hands at the Sports Festival?"""

I have decided to post this on a more relevant forum as /learnprogramming was only partly helpful. The original link to the thread is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/889wwa/how_to_become_a_fullstack_dapp_developer/).

*To summarise:*
I don't have a CS degree but I want to become a full-stack dAPP developer. I will do a part-time MSc in Computing and Information Systems this September, which is why I want to be able to secure a dev job by the end of the summer so I can have a technical job while I study.

I have some experience developing Android applications, and I have done some front-end web development too. I am already quite familiar with blockchain technology concepts, Ethereum (and Bitcoin as well), and I have been following the University of Nicosia MOOC. I want to spend my summer (approximately 20 weeks) coding full-time to secure an entry-level, or intern position as a full-stack developer at a blockchain start-up. I plan to study an average of 50 hours a week. I am a fast learner.

My intention is to focus on front-end web development first, become half-decent at JavaScript and some of its frameworks (angular.js, node.js, express.js). I don't know what to do after. 

Should I complete a course on full-stack web development to improve my JavaScript skills, learn the basics of back-end development, to then move on to smart contract development? Or should I move on directly to smart contract development after having become better at JavaScript? What languages should I focus on? Other advice?

Thank you :)

88bwe8,5,2018-03-30,"I [28F] ended things with [28M], want to reach out but wanted some advice",rosehost,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/88bwe8/i_28f_ended_things_with_28m_want_to_reach_out_but/,"This guy and I have a bit of history that didn't end well. He is an alcoholic and was drinking again during that time so I ended up getting kind of played.

Flash forward 3 years later and he contacts me again, I was hesitant hanging out with him and didn't agree at first, but he was persistent so I said why not. I had just gotten out of a 2.5 year relationship a couple months before that so this initially was kind of just a rebound. When I asked about what happened before, he said he was just lost at the time but wanted to reach out again because he was in a different place. I didn't think anything of it and was just having a good time. 

Flash forward 3 or 4 months, we connected really well and I caught feelings and was under the impression that he wanted more, and that I was the one giving off the vibe that I didn't. We were already acting like we were together, sleeping together most nights, etc... so I asked to make it official which ended up with him being blindsided and didn't know how to react. In those moments I kind of got my answer that he wasn't looking for anything more and knew I probably would have to end things. He said that he's just slower to those types of things (but come on it's been 4 months and we had history) and would need more time. I stuck around for another month but he never brought it up again and I was tired of not knowing where I stand so I ended it.

He said he was blindsided once again and kind of back peddled and said I was basically his girlfriend but I told him we never had that conversation which is the issue. He said well what if we say you're my girlfriend and I try a lot harder? Which didn't feel right to me so I said it wouldn't work like that and seemed like bad timing. He asked if he could call me the following day but I said it would be better if he didn't, but if he felt like there was more he needed to say after a couple days then to reach out.

I felt fine about it at first, but it's been a couple weeks now with no contact and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it and have been in a state of anxiety. Today has been the worst. I know I probably shouldn't contact him but I've been feeling so weird about it that I want to, but worried that no good with come of it. I wish I didn't tell him not to contact me but it was probably for the best.

On top of everything I'm leaving in May for a 3 month internship and definitely don't want to be hung up on him while I'm there and effect my time negatively.

So I guess I'm wondering If I should contact him and clear the air, or what I can do during this time to stop feeling so shit about it.

tldr: Ended things with a guy that was acting like my boyfriend but didn't make things official, he tried to make things official when I was ending things but I said no. Should I maintain no contact?"

My (ex)boyfriend and I met online a little over a year ago on a shitposting forum (edgy, I know). We would comment on each other's posts and over time they would get lengthier and turn into full fledged conversations. Then came a day where we started PMing each other, finding out what we both liked; interests, disinterests, and whatnot, then the topic of sexuality came up and we both said bi. After that conversations became more and more intimate until finally we decided to be a couple, albeit long distance.

Prior, both of us held a disdain for long distance relationships because they would never work, me especially from prior experience. But with him it was different. Perhaps it was because the relationship started long distance, and he felt the same. Aside from that though, this was the first time I ever felt a real connection with someone. For a long time, neither of us knew each other's faces, not even voices, it was primarily text. All we had was each other's written words; the purest expressions of our hearts and minds, and it was through that, we really fell for each other.

At six months, we finally showed ourselves to each other: faces and soon after, 'other things'. And we started talking more and more. Amidst conversation we found out we were 2 states (USA) away from each other and neither of us had a car. What's more was that he wants to enlist in the army, and was originally gonna do it this coming summer (2018) but he said he'd wait until we met, and we had promised we would see each other before hand. I said that with my next internship, I'd put the money to a car so I could drive out to him.

Something happened on my end. My sister (older), who hasn't a pot to piss in, who should've had her own life established by now got pregnant. As it stands, she has no viable skill, lives in our grandmother's apartment who got displaced now because of her and is living with my parents, and the father to be has neither a brain to fry or a back to break to make ends meet for himself, my sister, or the child; he lives with his parents. Both my parents and his are up there in age, and both having raised multiple children. Let alone where they are in life, they shouldn't have to raise their grandchildren, and they're not going to. My sister claims to have a plan which she has told me, but it's so thin spread and dependent on things that can not be trusted, herself included, that I'm taking the realist route and saying that my niece/nephew is in danger. My other sister (eldest), who shares my view, says that she and her fiance can take in the baby, which makes me feel bad because she never wanted to have kids, but with the fiance's salary and living expenses, I don't think that would be enough for everything and comfort, especially since they're gonna be starting the rest of their lives together.

So what does this have to do with me? The baby is due this summer, I'm gonna be away from home on an internship with an income... Guess where my money is going. Don't get me wrong, I'm excited about being an uncle, I'm gonna love the shit out of this kid. It's a new life and that's absolutely beautiful. I sympathize for him/her because it's coming into this world under foul, inconsiderate circumstances that could hinder him/her. That is ultimately my gripe. No matter what, I will always support my blood... considering someone else that should hasn't the insight or foresight to do so. That ultimately means no car for me, which means I can't see my boyfriend.

I couldn't keep this from my boyfriend, especially since he would effectively be putting his career, his life, on hold for me. I wouldn't want him to do that, not now with circumstances beyond his control, let alone mine. I do love him, and with that I want to see his life and his success come into fruition; to see him live fully, independently, to grow and be more that what he was before. So I told him that, and the situation that led to us not being able to meet this summer. I also told him that I know when he enlists and goes in for training, the relationship iss gonna be strained and put on hold, at the very least. Since now for an extended period, we'd be busy sorting our own lives out; him with his career, me with mine and my niece/nephew, I'd completely understand whatever decision he made. For him I would wait until the rapture, but I'd never ask the same of him, I wanted him to do whatever he wanted to do; like I said I don't to hinder him in any capacity. Needless to say, he made the sensible decision.

The thing is, I completely understand why he chose to end it, it's the reason why I told him everything in the first place because with all this shit, he has the right to know and make a choice if he wanted this kind of strained relationship. This was the first, and perhaps most wholesome relationship I've had or ever will have given how it came about. Before any of this, we both expressed seeing a long future with each other. I'm upset sure but I'm not so much sad as I am angry as to how this whole thing happened. I miss him, I still love him, but it's because I love him that I know he has to go live his own life. Between that and the rage which I'm completely containing, it's killing me inside and I need some help. Some words of comfort, wisdom, or something. I don't know, and that's why I'm here.

TL:DR - We broke up because I have to send money to take care of my unprepared sister's child instead of buying a car to see each other, because both of our lives are at a pivotal point budding into independent adulthood. I'm sad and angry because this had nothing to do with us and was beyond our control. Please help me cope."

I know this is a very broad question. I'm a college senior majoring in Finance. I currently intern at commercial real estate brokerage/investment company.
 
One of my future goals is to get into private equity. I know that it is an extremely competitive field and 9/10 times they would never hire a guy right out of college, because they look for years of experience. 

My plan was to work in commercial real estate for a few years and get some deals done, then try to get a job at a real estate private equity. 

Well I have a mentor in my life who is the founder of a decently large real estate private equity (500-900MM in holdings) and he recently called me and told me he may have a job for me. I never thought he would hire me so I never expressed intrest in working for him. This is great and would give me an opportunity to get right into where my future goals are. 

I am very intimidated though, and I'm wondering what would a new guy at a REPE be doing? Anyone have an idea on that?

Thanks

I told him he was free to use the code, no strings attached. I did, however, mention that I was a graduating CS major looking for employment after the semester ended. He told me to send him my resume with the code and he would pass it along. I honestly expected to never hear from him again. Not even two days later he offered to do a quick video interview for a paid graduate level internship in virtual reality research and development. I of course accepted, and today is the last day of that internship. Tomorrow I become a full time employee of one of the most prestigious research institutions in the world. I frankly still can't believe the journey to get here. I also know none of this would have been possible without all the people in this community who liked or shared that post. I share my story not to brag, but to let people know there are other ways to find jobs besides just applying and hoping (I actually didn't apply to any jobs and my parents were getting pretty concerned). If you put your work out to the masses you never know what a stranger can do for you. Even if you have a really dumb and immature username like me, people will sometimes overlook it :).

I'm sure you all have heard the typical ""take ownership of your patients, read up on patients, don't be annoying, etc"" and that is all very true and important. Something I severely underrated until late into my M3 year though was confidence. 

In life, not just med school, often what matters is not just what you actually know (this is important of course), but if the people around you think you know what you are talking about. Perception is everything, for better or worse. Too many times, I have seen other students who probably know way more than me but are shy, or nervous, talk really softly or stumble through their presentation on rounds, which makes the team think they don't really know what they are talking about, even though they totally do. This is something I definitely did at the beginning of the year, when I was terrified of presenting and getting pimped. However, as I have built up confidence, it has made all the difference. Even if I have gotten pimping questions wrong in front of everyone (which probably happens on the daily), given a well-thought out but incorrect assessment and plan, etc, if I have done it with confidence, more often than not I have gotten positive feedback and evaluations. They probably aren't going to remember that you forgot where on the coagulation cascade Factor XIII is, but they WILL remember if you seemed composed while you presented.

Anyways, I hope this is helpful. It is very easy to develop a learned helplessness on the wards as a third year, especially if you are starting on surgery or OBGYN, where you typically affect patient care less. Just be confident, approach each patient and presentation as if you were the intern responsible for the patient, and if you are wrong, which you will be a lot, the team will make the appropriate corrections. Don't forget basic things like good posture, speaking up and not rushing while you talk, making eye contact, etc. If you act like you know what you are doing, chances are everyone around you will think you do.

88e6yd,53,2018-03-30,Our experience with hypospadias repair surgery,hoity_toity3030,beyondthebump,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/88e6yd/our_experience_with_hypospadias_repair_surgery/,"My son was born with hypospadias and this week he had corrective surgery. I did a lot of searching on Reddit leading up to the surgery  trying to find stories of hypospadias repair, and there weren’t very many. So I thought I would share ours in hopes that parents who have a son with hypospadias will have more knowledge of what the repair surgery entails.  

Hypospadias is a birth defect where the meatus (the urethra hole) is not located on the tip of the penis where it should be. It’s much more common than I thought. Something like 1 in 100 boys has it. There are varying degrees of severity...some as severe as the meatus being all the way down at the base of the underside of the penis near the scrotum. Thankfully our case was relatively minor. My son’s meatus was just under the tip of his penis, so just a few degrees south of where it should be. He was diagnosed at birth.  

Our pediatrician referred us to a urologist for consultation at 2.5 months old, and the urologist told us that we would need corrective surgery, which they would do at 6 months olds. We were upset when we found out. Surgery on an infant is scary, plus we were adamant about our son remaining uncircumcised, and they told us they would have to circumcise him as part of the procedure. I expressed my problems with this...I asked if the corrective surgery was completely necessary, and what would happen if we chose not to treat it. The urologist explained in great detail all the pros and cons of treating vs. not treating, and he pointed us towards lots of studies and research to read. Boys with untreated hypospadias have a much greater risk of all kinds of penile health problems, sexual dysfunction, infertility, and even have a higher risk of certain kinds of penile cancers. It was hard for me to come to grips with it because I am aggressively anti-circumcision, but we weren’t willing to risk his health. Our son also had chordee, which is a curvature of the penis and is often found in boys with hypospadias. Chordee tends to get worse when boys hit puberty, and looking at pictures and reading stories of men with hypospadias/chordee is what really convinced me that surgery was the right path. But for what it’s worth, our son’s hypospadias was so mild that if he had had only hypospadias without the chordee, I’m not sure we would have repaired it. But I don’t know. Every case is so unique...I recommend parents of boy with hypospadias or any associated condition get multiple opinions from doctors that they trust.  Oh, and be wary of people (especially online) who are vehemently anti-circumcision, but are neither medical professionals nor have they any knowledge of hypospadias/chordee. They will aggressively maintain that there is NEVER a reason to circumcise no matter what. That is simply not true. Every choice has its pros and cons, and to ignore that is foolish. Stick to the opinions of real medical professionals, and ultimately use your own good judgement.  

So last week our boy turned 6 months, and the surgery was on Thursday (yesterday). He wasn’t allowed to eat anything past midnight the day before, so we followed normal daily routine on Wednesday and went to bed around 7ish as usual. Our son is a voracious eater and gets real mad when he’s hungry and not immediately fed, so I figured the morning would be rough when he didn’t get his first bottle. So around 11pm I gently woke him up and fed him a big bottle. I didn’t sleep all night due to nerves. DH woke up about 4am. We gently packed up LO in the car seat (without waking him up, miraculously) and checked into the surgery center at 5:45am. We had about a 30 minute wait till they brought us back for pre-op. During this time LO woke up and I was sure he would start howling for his bottle, but thankfully he stayed calm and didn’t cry!! I think he was distracted by his new surroundings.  

During pre-op we did some paperwork, they took his vitals, and various medical professionals began to make their way into the room one by one to meet us and answer any questions we had. We met the surgery nurse - the one who would be with him from start to finish. She was very comforting and LO took a liking to her. We met the nurse anesthetist and the anesthesiologist. My biggest concern with the surgery was anesthesia. Our son has a history of severe reflux and would choke on his reflux badly when he was a newborn, so I was scared he would asphyxiate during the surgery. I shared these concerns with the anesthesiologist and he talked me through exactly what they would do to prevent that from happening, and he told me in detail all the measures they take to make sure he would remain stable during the procedure. This helped me be less nervous. We met with the intern and nurse practitioner who would assist, and last we talked with our urologist who was the chief surgeon. He answered all our questions and was very reassuring. After about an hour of meet and greets, we handed LO to the nurse and we went back to the waiting room. We both cried when we had to leave him.  

The surgery only lasted about an hour. It was much faster than I anticipated. When it was done they called us back to our original room and the doctor sat down to tell us about the procedure. He said it went very well (WHEW!) and the hypospadias was mild enough that he did not have to place a stent or a catheter. Sometimes, depending on the severity of the hypospadias, they do have to place a stent or catheter, which stays in for a while. But that isn’t something they know until they open him up and look at the placement of the urethra.  

 We asked a lot of questions about post-op care and recovery...what he was allowed to do, medication, diaper changes, etc., then we walked to the recovery area just as LO was opening his eyes. The nurse helped get him out of bed (he still had on a blood pressure cuff, heart rate monitor and IV), and put him in my lap to feed. We started with pedialyte, which he drank two bottles of very quickly. Poor guy was parched! We waited a few minutes to make sure he would keep that down, then we fed him a regular bottle. After that we sat and rocked for a few minutes as he slowly became more lucid. The nurse gave him some baby Tylenol (acetaminophen), and then removed his IV, and stuff. We got him dressed and gently packed him in his car seat, and the nurse gave us our post-op/wound care instructions. The whole process was over much more quickly than I expected. We checked in at 5:45 am and left the hospital around 9am.  

When we got home, LO slept for about an hour and woke up hungry. We fed him again, but midway through the bottle he got really upset and started screaming in pain. I don’t know for sure but I think it was his first time urinating post-op, and it must have been very painful. The only meds he’s allowed to have are baby Tylenol and baby Motrin (ibuprofen), which we had given him max doses of, and he was still in a lot of pain. He screamed bloody murder for about half an hour. It was awful. We did all we could to comfort him, but we couldn’t give him any more medicine and I felt so powerless. I called the nurse back at the hospital and she said to just ride it out. We put him in front of the tv for a distraction (he loves that show “bed &amp; bath” on Hulu) and eventually he did calm down. This fit was really the worst part of the entire experience.   

When it came time for the first post-op diaper change, he got upset again but calmed back down much more quickly than before. We spent the day pretty much just laying in bed together...napping, playing with stuffed animals, listening to music, etc. I didn’t really leave his side until he went to bed in his crib around 7pm. He woke up at 9:30pm crying, and we gave him a bottle and a dose of Motrin. Then he slept till almost 7am! He’s usually up at 5:30am so we were surprised and glad for the extra sleep.  

He woke up in a great mood and has had a really good day so far. I am continuing to alternate Tylenol and Motrin, and he’s eating normally. He played with some toys this morning - a little less vigorously than he usually would - but still chipper, and had two big poops right around lunchtime. I was freaked out about this because the poop got allllllll over his bandages, which can’t be removed until 3 days post-op. I called the nurse to ask about it and she said it was ok, and to just clean him up as best we could, very gently with mild soap and water. Right now he’s taking his afternoon nap and it feels like a relatively normal day.  

His penis is very swollen and tender. I can definitely tell that it is straighter, and his urethral hole looks more “normal” than before. A sleeve-type bandage covers everything except the very tip, which is super red right now..The bandage looks gnarly but the nurse told us that is normal. There are multiple layers so it’s ok if the outside gets soiled. We are putting a little Vaseline on his penis at every diaper change, and he doesn’t seem to be in much pain anymore. After 3 days we can remove the bandage, and we will continue to apply Vaseline at diaper changes for several weeks. Right now we’re just doing sponge baths, and we can resume regular baths after 5 days.  

I am hopeful that LO will make a full recovery without any complications. I worry about him losing sensitivity, and I worry about him having PTSD from this experience.  But all in all I believe it was the right choice for us. We haven’t told anyone except immediate family members about the hypospadias or the surgery because we felt our son deserved privacy about it. He can choose who to tell when he is older if he wants to. But because we’ve kept it so hush-hush, I’ve felt very alone. So if your son has hypospadias and you want someone to talk to, please feel free to message me. I’m here to answer any questions as best I can.  "

88ejsh,1,2018-03-30,REU vs Internship,philipjames11,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/88ejsh/reu_vs_internship/,"Hello!

Right now I am in a very interesting spot. I've recently been accepted to both an internship at Amazon, as well as to an REU. I've been very lucky to get both, but now I must choose. 

The goal is to ultimately go into a machine learning research type position, which will most likely require a PhD which in turn requires a master's. 

I know that REUs look good for grad school applications, but turning down Amazon is a very difficult dilemma due to the prestige it brings to the table. This makes it difficult to decide if an internship at a great company is better or worse than an REU, in the context of getting into grad school. 

Could anyone offer some input?"

I was afraid of someone at work or church seeing me and loosing my job. It is awful that because of church teachings about not questioning the leaders, I was afraid to protect my children.


I am happy to say that I faced my fears and went to the March. One thing that touched me was I saw a family holding a sign which said they were there in proxy for someone else. I did not talk to them and I don’t know if this is the case but it seemed like the person they were in proxy for died. I imagined it was a suicide and it brought me to tears. I do know there was a family there which did have a family member commit suicide but I don’t know if it was this one.


Something else which was impressed on me was that they said no other religion has sexual worthiness interviews. If that is true, then there should be no excuses to keep worthiness interviews in the church. The practice is at best shaming the kids and at worst causing suicide. It is not needed and I now firmly believe that the church should get rid of sexual worthiness interviews.


The thing which concerned me the most was when we showed up at the church office building to give them the books. Earlier this week there was a memo to church leaders telling them of the protests and to report back if they happened at their buildings. That shows me that they were very aware of the March including date and time. The problem is when we showed up to the COB, there was no one there. People who worked there were coming in and out of the doors like a normal day at work. Security was finally called and came out to make sure no one touched the building and the worst part was the representative they sent. He looked like a returned missionary, unpaid intern. If they knew about it, which they did, and they were expecting it, which they were, why did they send someone who only happened to be working that day and got the short straw?


Their response was a big slap in the face saying they don’t care about those who came, and worse they don’t care about children getting sexually abused.


I hope the church will repair the damage they have done to a lot of people today."

I want to determine whether my red flags are legitimate red flags, or if I'm just stressed about taking my first job post graduation and having cold feet. I want to know if something shady is actually going on here.

EDIT: my apologies for not placing this in the weekly career/education thread!

TL;DR
Recently graduated, professional counseling, unlicensed. New employer wants me to have a (fake) business so I can be paid as an independent contractor, and apply for an NPI number with personal info, and assume all the risk involved with therapy.

I applied for a mental heath therapist position and was contacted for an interview. The interview was really different. It was a group interview led by the company CEO and included applicants from two separate listings. The CEO mostly bragged indirectly for about three hours how she was a millionaire and owned a million dollar company. Turns out the company works with DFCS and provides care to Medicaid and that all the positions they're offering are for ""independent contractors"", not actual employees. At that point I wasn't certain what that entailed. But when I was given the opportunity, I spoke about my practicum and internship experiences and offered why I thought I would be a good fit for the therapist position. Later there were more weird, bragging comments from the CEO, and we were told we'd be notified by email if we got the position. Later on, obviously, I was offered to position and accepted it. I was already feeling uneasy, but I thought I'd just go for it and count it all experience whether it worked out or not.

Apparently they provide in home services (which I've realized is because they can bill Medicaid significantly more for). There's no company car and I was informed that I would need to increase my car insurance  per injury and per occurance to 100,000 and 300,000 respectively. I had to pay $150 for various background checks and finger prints at various agencies and have the results sent to the company that hired me. And then I learned that I would need to actually apply for my business license, since I would be an independent contractor, and not an actual employee. This seemed really odd to me, and had I known up front, I probably wouldn't have accepted the job. But I had already spent the money for backgrounds/screenings so I felt like I couldnt waste the money I had spent by backing out. So I applied for and paid for my business license, gave my business a random name, and put on the application that I would be ""consulting"", because I was told I couldn't legally say I was a counselor and not have a license. (While I was at the court house I called and asked what other people said they did with their business license and I was told ""consulting"" and vague terms like that). I was really suspecting serious shadiness at this point. 

I went thru orientation and was told repeatedly all the ways that I wouldn't get paid including late fees and all kinds of penalties for not submitting paperwork on time. I learned I would ONLY be working with Medicaid and DFCS referrals for in home counseling. I would ONLY be paid per session and not be reimbursed for mileage (except for DFCS cases). I also learned that I must apply for my own NPI number and use my personal information for the business info, (as if I'm performing services out of my home.) I've not completed this yet because it feels fradulent...

I think there may be other things I've forgotten, and perhaps I've not explained things very well, but that is the gist of the main stuff. 

What sounds most questionable to you guys? Am I overreacting, or is something legitimatley sketchy here? I have no clue what to do next, whether I should back out or just make the most of things and take it for what it is. All feedback appreciated.

Thoughts would be appreciated, thanks! aaaaaaand cover letter starts here:

Do people still read cover letters anymore?  To be honest, I’m not really sure.  Maybe it’s the millennial in me or the want to try something creative and new.  Regardless, I feel like cover letters have become outdated.  However, I still believe some sort of formal delivery of my skills and past experiences is required so here we go:

My name is C and I am a recent graduate from Arizona State with a Bachelor's Degree in Sports Business.  Most of my professional experience has been with event management and game/stadium operations, although I do also have experience with social media, hospitality, and the video game Fortnite (not sure if that’s relevant but that’s what the kids are playing these days and I like to stay hip with the times).  Recently I just finished working my third year with the Arizona Bowl.  I was Chairman of Player Hospitality for the Utah State Aggies, and did everything from organizing games for player entertainment, refreshments, food, and DJ/music to planning and stocking the VIP suite, assisting team officials, and managing interns.  My two years prior to this year, I worked the Arizona Bowl in stadium operations, signage for the entire event, game operations, halftime performance, golf carts/ice, and other intern duties.  I also worked for the Chicago Cubs in 2017 as a gameday associate at their spring training facility.  There I worked on/with VIP fan promotions, game script, pregame batting practice, baseball team operations, social media, fan involvement for World Series parade, and various other sorts of things.  My other past work experience includes working with Copa America Centenario at University of Phoenix Stadium, the Final Four at the Biltmore and UofP, ATP 75k Challenger Tennis Tournament at Arizona State, and with Arizona United Soccer Club at Scottsdale Stadium.

So all this experience is fine and dandy but you want to know what makes me special?  What makes me the right person for the job? Well to start, I believe I have had some of the BEST mentors in the events/sports industry which have taught me more than I could ever transcribe into words.  [old bosses name], Executive Director of the [insert job title] (whom I’ve interned for the past 4 years), is single handedly the most experienced and knowledgeable sports event management specialist I have ever encountered.  She has taught me how to plan and excel in large sports event planning and how to translate those skills into everyday life traits.  I have worked with her with the Arizona Bowl, Copa America, and the Final Four.  I’ve also learned under [name], of the Chicago Cubs.  She taught me how to run and manage a sold out facility day-in and day-out, and how to succeed with a dynasty team like the Cubs.  Both of my mentors are the best in the business at what they do and have apprenticed me well, and I believe that is what makes me one of the most capable young professionals in the sports industry.  I’m hardworking, love learning new things, have plenty of experience, always have a chipper attitude, and love helping my team succeed.  Cons: I’m bad at normal cover letters.  But that is why I think I am the best person for the job.  I would love the opportunity to interview for the position and display even moreso on why I am the correct candidate.  Thanks for your time, hope to be hearing from you soon.  

Best, 
C

I’ve come to the conclusion that there are still people I need to cut out, and I’m very willing to. I always thought of my life as pointless, nothing more than a struggle that I should just kill myself and get it over with. Until now, I’m finally happy. I’m succeeding where you all once told me I was nothing. You all told me I wasn’t going to make it. My opinions didn’t matter. I wasn’t right for this world. Something was wrong with me. I wasn’t going to do anything right ever. Today, those thoughts that you instilled into my head are gone. My gpa in college is at 3.7. My professors tell me I’m smart, I’m going to make it, those IT companies are going to love me. I’m done with dealing with toxic people that have nothing but negative things to say. I told my girlfriend last night that I’m finally happy with my life. I’m finally happy, and I love where it is right now. You all brought me down so I couldn’t see what was possible. I couldn’t see the clouds because you brought me down into the caverns. I’m the strongest I’ve ever been, and this happened because I let you go.

I’m happy with my life. That’s all that matters. I’m happy with my direction, I’m happy with my woman, I’m happy with the career choice I’ve made. 

I’m taking my internship in the fall. I’ve got my eyes set on this company that continues to support my school and has a contract to hire out of the student pool in my major. I’m one of the ones on top of it. I know my professors will speak good of me, and I know I’m driven now. I can see light, I can see what’s worth it....and you weren’t. I’m going to succeed.

Basically: i am gay, the church would have killed me some years back, in some countries they still do now, and idc if they arent allowed to do so anymore at my place, i am leaving and i am not supporting them!!

I was never religious, i was always an atheist and i never believed in god. NEVER! I prayed as a child 1 or two times when i lost something important only to realize i just found it bc i looked at the place it actually was and not bc i was running in circles talking to myself. So yeah, i think i can say i was always sure about that. My family isnt religious either (my father is an astrophysician), but especially my mother cares for symbolism and shit like that. 

I am an university student in mathematics and currently i need to prepare for an internship (preferably insurances) for a few months. I live in germany and i HATE the weather. I need sun, everything else fuels my depression, so i tried to think of warmer countries. Its hard to get into the US, so idk about that, maybe an option. I dont speak spanish, so south america or spain: bye. Same for south corea, japan, china etc, i dont speak a word of their language. Italy was my favourite: you guessed it - i dont speak italian. My father (apperantly my parents dont know im gay) said today: try Singapur, its warm, theres the sea, everyone knows english, lots of insurances. YES BUT ITS MUSLIM, THEY WOULD BEAT OR KILL ME IF THEY EVEN LEFT ME IN! So yeah, a good option is gone again. Because religion...

We then continued talking about various things, including leaving the church (according to a few documents i am evangelic thanks to my dumbass mother who had me baptized with a few months, but evangelic bc ""she didnt know if i wanted to be a pastor as a female"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME THAT I DID NOT WANT IT AT ALL DIDNT ACCURE TO YOU??... I need to get rid of that). And my mom was FURIOUS bc apperantly you need to pay your precious taxes - completely ignoring that i could still donate DIRECTLY. How ""much the church does with caritas or red cross etc"" and ""all the work places they provide for people who would not find work elsewhere"" - congratulations you pay a cult to do the job your goverment should do you fucking moron! How is that positive?? I said i am evangelic but she is catholic and we visited rome 2 years ago. We stood on top of st peters dome and honestly, its just creepy looking down on the vatican. As if you could smell the power and the money, if the view above rome wasnt that great and the church not that massive i would have been creeped out (quote from my mom again ""if it wasnt the church who would pay to take care of the old churches who would"" - ""idk, maybe it would be payed by the money we now waste on the church bc technically its just a part of culture like anything else that gets preserved""). Anyways, i just started a tutoring job at university so i finally have a bit of money, i can pay the few € to just leave the church now without begging for money from my parents.

One last thing: symbolism. Symbols are everywhere and mostly they are reduced so they arent worth anything anymore, ofc our culture is shaped by the religion the country had historically, duh. Thats not what i mean - i mean direct symbols. Aka: crosses in classrooms or hospitals (if i needed to visit one for longer i would take them off - or be edgy and turn them around but then i probably am really sick XD), religious shit you need to have done once you are dead (can i please be buried by someone who is ATHEIST?? Not that *I* would care, but maybe/hopefully there are people who knew me...) etc. I know a girl from school who was muslim and wore niqab. She was asked why and she said "" to state her religion"" and ""she doesnt think it is a sign for female opression or being anti human rights"" - yeah sure, me wearing a fucking swatiska to say ""i am german"" but ""it doesnt mean i am nazi or anti human rights its just my country of origin"" DOESNT MAKE MUCH FUCKING SENSE EITHER DOES IT??? Sure, someone ELSE wearing a religious symbol isnt comparable to having a cross in a hospital for everyone, but especially for the latter: i refuse to let someone show me a symbol that, if i think about it, only tells me that a few hundred years back i would have been killed for who i am. This is one of the main reasons i will leave that fucking cult: i am gay.

Sorry for the rambling, i am quite tired (its 2:00 in germany atm) and i am just mad my mother started yelling at me for wanting to leave the church (she even grabbed my arm, she didnt even do that when i told her i need anti depressants... That woman is so emotional she makes me go insane one day). Like what tf is this with those damn taxes?? I dont earn enough money to pay taxes, but once i have more i surely will do research which organisation is worth donating for. If it happens to be caritas - ill donate. But not through TAXES."

88fuhr,12,2018-03-30,A horrible story of a Culinary Extern and the Insane Health Dangers of Multiple Kitchens that could Shut Down an Entire Company,abc2048,Chefit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/88fuhr/a_horrible_story_of_a_culinary_extern_and_the/,"Okay so let me get you all started, this is a fairly long story and I apologize but I would like to go into full detail so you guys/girls can fully understand the situation I am going through, although this story is 100% worth the read because i feel that it is so outrageous that it almost seems like someone made the whole thing up just so chefs can read it and say there's no god dam* way this actually happened. So we begin . . .  I am currently a culinary student in the US. After a few months of learning in the school that I attend students are assigned to go onto an externship in their third term (a type of semester) out of eight total. 

It all started out great I went to a career fair offered at our school mostly for externship opportunities but also for new jobs after graduating. I had attended my first one and instantly loved one of the sites I had talked too located in Florida which is a good 12+ hour drive away from my college so a stage unfortunately was out of the question for me. Even though I was unable to view and experience the kitchen personally I was very eager to work with the executive chef there ( it is a fairly large company with multiple restaurants). After talking with the executive chef he was as eager to have me working for him as I was to work under him as an intern.

A few months pass by of filling out forms, paperwork, travel plans, etc... and I arrive at my externship site. When I first arrive I was told that I would be meeting with the executive chef that manages all the restaurants, but instead i am greeted by an executive chef who runs one of their restaurants individually. This was not much of an issue for me since I felt that running multiple restaurants at a very busy location during a very busy time of year for their restaurants it was most likely difficult for him to get time to meet me again after months of not speaking personally. 

Soon after meeting the executive chef for one of their restaurants I am brought to the first place I will be working at. I don't want to get into too much details but the entire place was a tragedy to restaurants. Essentially every dish and food item was improperly handled or cross contaminated which greatly bothered me. I have seen raw chicken placed over pre cooked steaks, cakes and pastries placed onto the same speed racks as raw dead lobsters, lettuce for salad un washed and prepped on the same board that was used for cutting raw meats with raw meat scraps and blood still on it. I can go on and on about the dangers of working at this restaurant and this is only after three days of working. 

I quickly start to realize that my externship site was turning out to be a terrible choice. There is virtually no learning experience provided, no skill needed, and the place is so unsanitary and broken down that i am surprised no one has been seriously injured or even killed from contaminated food. After doing some personal organization and cleaning of the kitchen since the head chefs for that restaurant seem to not care about their own food or what they send out to customers and their own restaurant i find so many atrocities to food. Onions at the bottoms of bins that have sprouted weeks possibly even months ago and have foot long stalks growing out of them, dirty rags left in flour bins for God knows how long, containers of sauces for service having never been cleaned out, breads and food for service being dropped onto the floor and just served without any concern for the customers, about 95% of all surfaces have never been wiped down or even sanitized. The floor is also constantly flooded due to a leak at the dish pit meaning a majority of the kitchen floor is constantly soaked in dirty water, the best part is when supplemental orders come in they just bring everything inside and leave it on the floors to just soak up all that dirty dish water and food scraps on the ground and it can just sit there for 6+ hours raw meat or not. I have even seen a supplemental order come in at 8:00 and forgotten about and brought in after the lunch shift around 4:00 of raw shellfish and seafood that has been sitting out in 80F+ florida heat.

If you though this was terrible so far it only gets worse. On my fourth day working there i had gotten terribly ill for an unknown reason (probably eating their fu*king food for three days). It was about thirty minutes into service and I wasn't feeling well so I had told someone on the line that i NEEDED to step out for a minute and thankfully i did. I found myself puking my brains out near some dumpsters at the back of the kitchen. Shortly after one of the dishwashers came outside to take out some trash and saw me vomiting and asked if was okay etc... about 5 minutes later of still vomiting the executive sous chef (the guy under the executive sous chef who runs all the restaurants) who happened to be expediting that day walks outside and sees me throwing up and immediately just walks away back around the corner and comes back later with a water bottle and tells be to give it 15 and come back in. At this point I am just baffled at what I just head this guy is watching me standing in my own pool of vomit and just told me to go back inside and SERVE PEOPLE FOOD! Although I knew this is an insane danger to customers me being a naive 18 y/o just decided to go back inside and wash my hands and arms vigorously and put on gloves and keep on serving. Service went on for about 4 more hours and during our clean up i didn't feel well again and stepped back outside. The sous chef for the restaurant ( the guy who works under the chef who i met on the first day) came outside and was like you clearly aren't feeling well idk why you came back in etc... i want you to go home, but then a bit later the sous chef for the restaurant came back outside telling me he spoke with the executive chef for the entire company and he didn't want him to let me go. At this point I was just pissed off, sick, vomiting, and nauseous. Even though everything my body was telling me was to go home after going through so many rough days in kitchens i just kept telling myself just push on and get on with it so I went back inside finished cleaning up my station. Shortly after I had to begin prepping for the next day.

A few hours followed (this time it's around 5:00) and I am just feeling worse and worse by the minute and I have been prepping and presumably contaminating food that will be served to 800+ people for dinner service and the 1200+ people that i had served for lunch. Eventually i just couldnt take it anymore and had to step outside again at this point I just walk over to the Associate dining area and sit down to try to rest for a bit. I find myself so nauseous and exhausted from being sick and working my ass off that I feel queasy just sitting. I then decide to make the mistake of getting something to eat because i was sooooo hungry since i had essentially thrown up everything I had eaten for that day. Immediately after taking my first bite I run to the garbage and vigorously puke my guts out again (for the second time today) and run outside the dining area as soon as i pause vomiting in the garbage and find myself running to the bathroom covering my mouth but could not hold it in and end up vomiting all over my hand and arm. then running into the bathroom to continue vomiting. at this point I am physically and morally defeated I ended up just sitting on the toilet for at least an hour unable to move a muscle. Eventually I wash my hands and vomit soaked arm and leave and decide to return to work and finish prep (for some god forsaken reason) Shortly after returning to work after puking for the second time one of my co workers who is a very nice person who fortunately made me aware of the terrible decision we both had made to extern at the restaurant on my first day asked what had happened to me and I had filled him in on my entire day for the parts he was not aware of and he had essentially told me you need to fu*king go home man. Although my drive to work and succeed like many young and old chefs can drive us to work ourselves to death I continue most of the prep for our station for the next day. After completing my prep it had reached 8:00pm the same exact number for in which my shift starts 8:00am and I had said fu*k everything about this to myself and left and went to my appartment.

Now if you are insane enough to have read throughout this entire story as much as I was to continue working the remainder of my day. KEEP READING because now it is the fifth day of my externship and now it reached the third time of me saying it gets waaayyy worse. I decide to contact the only person in the world in which many of us know as the best advice we can get, my Mom. She advises me to contact the woman from Human Resources(HR) who was my main contact for applying to this externship site about the whole situation. In an effort to make this long story shorter essentially she decides to contact the executive chef for the entire restaurant group, who then notifies her that he is not at work today and that i should contact . . . guess who the same fu*king guy who watched me vomiting in the back of his restaurant and told me to keep on working and gives zero sh*ts about anyone and especially his employees ( fun side story i was working on my second day there and overheard a story he was telling someone that his wife always wanted cats when growing up and she eventually decided to get two but he absolutely despised having pets. so he decided after she got the cats a few weeks later he just opened the back door and let them outside and closed it and they ran away and never came back all because he didn't want another mouth to feed..... so yeah hes a fairly nice guy). Back to the story I eventually just decide to meet with him and the woman from HR and meet them both at a meeting room for the company in the HR department.

The meeting was fairly quick only a few minutes long but what happened was he came in knowing his job was fu*ked. Not only did he break multiple rules from their company about treating employees, but he illegally handled food, forced me to illegally handle food,  and then allowed it to be served to guests. So this is what he said to the woman from HR ""I was not aware of the severity of your condition, but if you had contacted me appropriately I would have let you go."" ( after he had watched me vomiting behind a dumpster and told me to go back into work.) His second excuse was that working in kitchens in "" THE REAL WORLD and not the simplified ones of working at the Culinary Institute of America"" (oh you fu*kin C*nt i have worked in a couple of god damn kitchens) ""You would know that when working in kitchens the job needs to be completed no matter what"" (yeah like the job needs to be completed who cares if you are puking multiple times and could cause close to thousands of people to be contaminated with a forborne illness.) The worst part is the woman from HR completely bought his BS. He just walked away and after he left the woman from HR just looked at me and said he had a very good point that working in kitchens in culinary school compared to the real world are very different. (Yeah the big fu*king difference is i hope that kitchens in culinary schools wont serve viruses to their customers while your shitty as* ""real world"" kitchens do)

So that wraps up the whole story it is currently the end of the day in which i had met with the woman from HR and the executive sous chef for the entire company. I would really love to just quit this externship and just get a new one from the CIA again, but it is a very long and complicated process. Should i just go through with it or live through this living nightmare of a kitchen and have to deal with the bs of this sous chef hating me for the next 13 weeks because of the whole situation. I am also concerned since he fills out a evaluation for externs for my school at the end of my externship he can outright just fail me at the end ( I would not be surprised if this guy does this btw he killed his wifes fu*king cats).

What is all of your opinions on this situation? What should I do now? please let me know in your comments. this is one of the most aggravating and disappointing moments i think I will have in my life and I would greatly appreciate all of your advice after working in this industry for many years.

Edit: added tldr

TLDR
My culinary externship seemed great at first but then it turned out to be completely terrible, almost all food was cross contaminated, held in the temperature danger zone for hours, raw meat and seafood just sitting unrefrigerated for hours, the meat cooler for beef doesn't even close so all beef is never properly stored at safe food handling temperatures. On my fourth day of working I ended up vomiting multiple times and forced to work no matter what. After speaking with the executive chef about forcing me to work while terribly ill and vomit along with serving customers the woman from HR and the executive chef completely BS the entire meeting and all of the illegal restaurant practices are continued and they completely ignore the entire situation.

I have several Questions about my Major (Economics) as well as the flexible major switching system of the university. 

1. I have heard Several Other Universities in New York region Consider Economics as a STEM major and give the students the opportunity to extend their Working VISAs, Does this Case apply to the University of Rochester? or do I have to Take Econometrics as a Cluster to be Regarded as a STEM.

2. How easy is it to Switch Majors and Minors? 
Even though I was accepted as Economics, I want to try out and experience Majors including Statistics/Comp Sci/Biomed and Doing a Minor in Computer Science/Statistics. Is this possible to Switch my Major and Minor to these fields?

3. Does The University of Rochester provide enough Opportunities such as internship and jobs for students? I have heard that the employment situation is not that good and that it is even hard for engineering Graduates to get a job. Is this True? or is this purely dependent on the Student?

4. Is it possible for a Freshman to get an Individual Dorm? 
I heard most Freshmen have to use a shared dorm but I personally do not like sharing a dorm. Is it possible to get a single room for myself?

88gt5u,352,2018-03-31,A sad story of a slut. :(,anu_slut,stupidslutsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidslutsclub/comments/88gt5u/a_sad_story_of_a_slut/,"I am from Mumbai, India, currently 29. I had come to Mumbai (which is Bollywood, the place where all Indian girls will go to succeed in show biz), with the intentions of becoming an actress. This is a bit sad post.

In the initial years, it was difficult, and like all girls I have resorted to being a high end escort, a waitress, a model and many other things so that I could survive. I used to work with a modelling agency as a model, but when shows became hard to come by (there is a lot of competition), I decided to supplement my income by doing some clerical work at the agency. The boss was a typical alpha male, driven, aggressive and well pretty rude to be honest. He was married, but that never stopped him from hitting on all the girls in the office. All the girls had sucked his cock, and when I came, after a while, I realized it was inevitable. I was never a morally uptight person so it didn’t bother me much.

My boss was in his 40s, and his secretary was around 30. After I came he suddenly just sidelined and later moved the secy out in other functions, she was elevated and was given a kind of promotion. I don’t think that was a bad deal, she was certainly not happy to leave, but she had to. I became the new secretary, and then I realized what being his secy meant. I was almost a slave to the guy. He made me do everything. I came to office at 8 in the morning, left for home at 10 in the night, working on most weekends. When he called me in and closed the door all knew that I was sucking his cock. I was paid handsomely, but was treated lower than an intern. His wife was either oblivious to it, or didn’t care. I was his bitch, and whenever a new model/employee caught his eye though, I would be his new crush’s bitch as well. 

He’d ask me to do menial tasks, like pick up his laundry, fetch his coffee. In time, I ended up doing the same for his occasional flings. I never talked back, took the abuse. He kept on fucking me. I blew him every day, it had become my daily ritual. Whenever there used to be a location shoot, he’d book our rooms together, and I’d invariably spend the night in his bed as his bed warmer. Sometimes he’d use me in front of his friends. I’d also routinely fuck whoever he wanted. Sometimes he told me to suck of the clients. Strangely enough, he was the only man I kind of truly love. We had many tender moments, many where he showered me with gifts. Many moments when he was kind. I don’t know what it was that drew me to him, apart from the fact that maybe I am a dirty masochistic slut with daddy issues who needs to get approval from her boss. He gropes me in public, scolds me in public and has even slapped me in public. The only person I talk to that gives me peace is his ex-secretary (whom I displaced). She is retired but has been quite successful. She retired as one of the company’s top executives. Even now when she visits, she wastes no time getting on her knees and sucking his cock, but he rarely calls her for personal purposes anymore. She says she hated the experience but misses it. She doesn’t blame him because he has never hindered her financially, but I guess she wanted to be more than just a colleague/subordinate sex toy to him. 

Last night I was receiving a brutal ass fucking from him, and after sucking him off dry later on, he casually told me that I was going to be moving. There is a new girl, who I am supposed to mentor for the next 3 months. I have seen her before around the office, barely 20, and hot like a firecracker. I am to handle a different division. It is a promotion, but not the one I wanted. I cried for quite a while, this new role is not in the same office, and I won’t be seeing him much. I feel a bit old now, a younger slut has come to displace me. I will obey him like I always did, but I am crying now.

88hxx1,18,2018-03-31,"I'm an indecisive 31 yo who could really use some input on career choice. I have already studied two different paths but have some commitment issues. Currently on maternal leave and want to make a final choice when I return, I would love your advice :-)",Saiph__,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/88hxx1/im_an_indecisive_31_yo_who_could_really_use_some/,"My issue seems to be a rather prominent topic in the community, so I felt that some people here may relate and could hopefully chip in with some advice or thoughts! Basically, I'm feeling utterly undecided in career paths and that I don't belong anywhere. I’m a 31/F INFJ. :-)

I'm one of those who enjoys doing lots of different things (seems to be a common thread here) and ever since I first started wondering what I'd like to do when I grow up, there have been two main paths: academic/languages/research or design/drawing/creative. These are obviously somewhat rough paths but I constantly had numerous job ideas throughout my teens in these two groups, such as archaeologist, animator, anthropologist, illustrator, classicist...you get the idea!

After graduating high school at 19 (or my country’s equivalent), I decided to try and apply to art university in two programs, Graphic Design and Architecture, and actually get accepted into both. Now, this happened 11 years ago and is something that has frustrated me ever since: while I absolutely knew I preferred Graphic Design, being a long time drawer and loving illustration/animation, I still decide to go for Architecture. Why? It was the “practical option”. Everyone told me that GD would be a bad choice, I’d just end up designing brochures for small businesses while Architecture is something stable and respected. I was also not that certain at the time that GD is what I truly wanted, and Arch definitely appealed to me as well, so I opted for the safer route. Needless to say, this did not go well…I dropped out after roughly 2 years. I never felt like I belonged there. Maybe I never even tried. The technical/physical stuff was difficult and oddly enough, some of the philosophizing theories never sat right with me either. My projects were very research-based and practical, so not particularly artsy or lofty. I really liked drawing the plans and making the 3D models, however.

So, to make a long story very short: feeling burnt by all things design, I started studying Linguistics after that and end up acquiring both a BA and a MA degree. I loved it there, even managed to finish it earlier than normal, got good grades and got to know some of the professors well. I did various small jobs there, helping with conferences, worked at the writing centre and assisted on a research project. It was a good time. They even started advising me about what PhD program I should go to.

However…after finishing my Master’s thesis, I was simply so done. Writing it was a surprisingly big struggle (the subject matter was actually really interesting) and I only managed to finish it just in time. I was just so tired of all the academic writing. I absolutely loved the studies themselves, the actual learning, but the constant “proper” writing starting to become draining. I actually really like writing in general, always have, and I did it well enough (although I rarely feel that way) but I guess the thought of doing this 10x for a PhD didn’t seem particularly attractive. I felt itchy, I wanted to create again, something had to change. 

So, another U-turn…I return to the art university. Yeah. I finally finish that third year and get my BA degree in Architecture. 6 years later! I obviously didn’t do nearly as well as the other kids, but I’m still pretty proud of my final project and that I actually finished it. It was a necessary closure for me. After graduation I applied for an internship and got one, amazingly, and worked there for a year. While there, I didn’t do much actual architectural design, understandably, but they quickly realized I was pretty good with color and composition. I therefore end up doing lots of finishing touches for drawings, front pages for reports and 3D models/renderings. I really enjoyed that part, so my itch for GD kind of flairs up again. But then I get pregnant! All planned, though :-)

So we’re finally returning to the present (I’m covering 11 years here!), where I am 6 months into my maternity leave. I’m staying home for a year (I’m in Scandinavia, to be clear) so I’ll return to the real world again in the fall. While it’s still half a year away, I already have a big knot in my stomach—what the hell do I do then? I want to use the months ahead to prepare and do something useful (like make an online portfolio or read up on Computational Linguistics), but then I need to be sure I want to commit to that particular thing.

My issue is definitely indecision, if that wasn’t obvious. I have major issues dedicating myself to one thing. I want to explore everything but I’m obviously at a point where that’s no longer possible, I have to pick a path. I suppose my major gripe here is the regret that I never really went for GD, or that whole path somehow, as I’m now really interested in UI/UX and motion design, and even VR. I feel like I have some potential in that department that I’ve never properly explored, something that’s even more difficult now with a small child. I definitely have a big need to create but I also have a deep need to do something, I guess you could say, intellectual? I’m not saying design isn’t that, on the contrary, but for me, Linguistics was definitely a perfect channel for that need. I loved the research, and I have no trouble sitting and concentrating for hours at the library. Then, to make matters even more complicated, there’s always a part of me that wants to *want to be* an Architect, if that makes sense. 

Then—there’s more—there’s that whole layer of feeling like I must commit to something “worthwhile”, whatever that is. Like a true INFJ, I can’t really apply myself to something unless I somehow believe I’m contributing something positive and lasting, to a proper cause. I love feeling useful. I’m afraid that if I work for a design studio I’ll just be making apps/websites for companies doing frivolous stuff that I can’t really stand behind. At least Linguistics has that whole teaching aspect and contributing to important research. If I’d go there again, I’m now wondering whether I should rather take a one year Master’s in Computational Linguistics instead of a PhD. I’m a little afraid the programming side would be difficult but the idea is still appealing, there are new and important projects underway now. And not to mention Architecture again, where I’d literally be making concrete and lasting creations. I’m know I’m being pretty black and white here, but this is something I can’t shake easily. 

If you made it this far, you deserve a cookie. I just needed to get this out on paper and felt like this was the right community to share it with. I’m not even sure what sort of advice I’m asking for at this point, but any input would be so appreciated. Maybe just the act of writing about this helps, getting it out of my head. This is actually the first time I’ve done so and it definitely feels weird to read, I’m sure most peoeple are just going to tell me to make a choice, stick with it and quite whining. I’m also very much aware that whatever I end up deciding, it’s something I must find within—although I’m constantly reading about personality/INFJ/etc, hoping to finally have that epiphany that makes everything right. 

Thanks for reading."

88ijmd,134,2018-03-31,An Angel in the Night (the disappearance of Sonja Engelbrecht)[Unresolved Disappearance],K0sak1,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/88ijmd/an_angel_in_the_night_the_disappearance_of_sonja/,"This post will try to outline the last known movements of Sonja Engelbrecht ([pic](https://imgur.com/a/j8DDV)), a 19year old  in the city of munich/germany, leading up to her  vanishing on the night of 11.04.1995  

At the time of her disappearance Sonja was living with her parents and her toddler-aged niece in a house located in Laim(a borough of [munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich), the capital city of bavaria in the south of germany), which is just a stones throw away from the center of munich. The mother of her niece, her sister Sylvia(four years her senior) had moved out to study, but was still living nearby and thus the two sisters were able to share a petite car which was given to them as a present by their parents.
Sonja herself was studying economy at a business college while attending an internship at a law firm.
She is described to be rather on the timid side, unless she was in the company of close friends.
Sonja didnt have a boyfriend but was said to have some potential admirers(one of which will be mentioned later on).  

**Leading up to Monday**
   

*Birthday marathon*  
04.04.95, on the occasion of her 19 birthday, Sonja and her girlfriends agreed the best way to celebrate would be a thorough partymarathon, stretching over several days.To list them will probably give you the best picture:  
05.04.95, Wednesday - First party took place in a club named ""Hexe"" located in Gröbenzell.  
06.04.95,Thursday - They went on to spend a large amount of time in a club named ""Tilt"".   
07.04.95+08.04.95, Friday+Saturday - The festivities peeked at the flat of two close friends of hers, in whose home she stayed until saturday.  
09.04.95, Sunday - She decided to spend another day at her friends place.

**Monday the 10.04.1995**  
  
  
*At Home*  
The prolonged celebrations left Sonja exhausted on monday the 10.04.95, hence she advised her mother to deny her in incoming phonecalls. But a male friend of hers by the name of Markus(17yo, name changed) turned out to be quite persistent, and in the end Sonja ended up taking the call which ultimately resulted in her agreeing to a meeting/night out that same day. It seems as though she wasnt particulary interested in meeting him alone, so she tried to convince several of her girlfriends to come along but to no avail. Since her sister had claimed the car that day(they were taking turns, depending on the day of the week) she was prepared to rely on public transportation.
Not beeing able to persuade her girlfriends to tag along, she started to dress herself - wearing a quite memorable outfit  I might add, consisting of a pair of black skinny leather pants, a 70style leather jacket, plus a purple pullover - and after saying her goodbyes, Sonja left her home at around 20:45 to meet up with Markus at the munich mainstation.

*On the road/Vollmond*  
Now, from here on out everything relies on the testimonies of Sonjas companions, note that none of the info could be confirmed by another party.  

According to Markus they boarded the subway on the mainstation and exited Josephsplatz. Then they traveled the remaining distance on foot, arriving at their desired location, a pub/bar called ""Vollmond"", at around 21:40h.
Upon entering the establishment, they ran into two male aquiantances of Markus by happenchance. Julian and his friend Josef(14+15yo) invited them to their table and so they continued to spend their time together. 
As the night went on, the group decided to relocate to Julians flat, which was just a mere 8min walk away. Julians parents were out of house that night, so they would have the premises for themselves. 
They left the pub at ca 00:40h. Julian and Josef will later state that there was a little dissonanz moodwise between Markus and Sonja. He seemed to be in good spirits whilst Sonja appeared to be really tired - They also stated that she pondered calling her sister to pick her up, but they advised her against it  because it would be impolite/not proper to call at such a late hour. According to them, no phonecalls were made that night out of the flat.  

*Way Back/Stiglmaierplatz*  
Sonja and Markus left the flat located in the Schellingsstrasse at ca 02:10h. Passing the aforemore mentioned club ""Vollmond"" and several phonebooths while making their way to the Stiglmaierplatz with the intention of catching a tram there. Markus stated that Sonja suddenly had to use the bathroom, so they stopped and she headed for a nearby brushy section to relieve herself. But it was not long after she entered that she returned, confiding in him that she felt weirded out and as if she was being watched. They took a quick glance around  but couldnt see anyone, so they just continued on(in later questionings Markus wasnt so sure anymore where exactly this occured).
Upon reaching the Stiglmaierplatz Sonja now again brought up the topic of calling her sister, so Markus handed her his phonecard as they were heading towards a Phonebooth. But just upon entering the both, Markus tram arrived and he made a sprint for it, not looking back. According to him, the time was 2:28h, beeing certain of this specific detail because he tried to ask a group of either americans or english travellers but after getting no answer he opted to ask the Tramdriver. Sonja hasnt been heard of since.

*Witnesses*  
The only barkeeper working that night at ""Vollmond"" couldnt confirm nor deny if she saw Sonja and friends, partly because she was asked almost a year after the disappearance on the 23.04.1996.   
A neigbhour of Julian believes she saw Robert and Sonja in the corridor, the time she stated that sightning took place (at around 22h) would be conflicting with the sequence of events however.  
The Tramdriver was questioned, but couldnt remember beeing asked for the time, and the group of travelers was never found.  
Counting the Phoneboth in as a witness, police was able to attest that there was no call made to neither Sonjas parents nor her sister.  


a map illustrating the distance can be found [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1RBQLpbdurr4OhxKFnR4sZhHTUoE&amp;ll=48.14771923900731%2C11.5378015&amp;z=13)  
* 1 Pub Vollmond  
* 2 Schellingstraße (location of Flat)  
* 3 Sonjas Home in Laim  

*Gone-aftermath*  
The parents  soon noticed their daughters abscence, but actually getting the police to akwnoledge their concerns was a completly different beast, one of the  main reasons beeing her age. 
After several tries over the next days the third time was a charm, but it also meant that the media and therefore the public was not informed about Sonjas disappearance until 15.04.95, four days after she was last seen.
It seems as though her disappearence was initially not taken seriously by police up until 2 weeks later, partly because they assumed that Sonja accompanied Markus and his family on their easter vacation to Yugoslavia(Why that was even considered a legitimate theory, i have no idea). Ever since there have been no solid leads, no credible sightnings nor items discovered.
Needless to say her parents are still desperatley searching for answers concerning their daughters whereabouts to this day.  

**Some things to consider**  
  

*Rose*  
21.03.1995 , a red Rose was left anonymously on the front door steps, the petals inscribed with chinese symbols meaning ""I love you"". Even though Sonja couldnt know for sure who left it, she had a suspicion that Robert(a guy with whom she went out with before but didnt have any serious interest in) was the man behind this show of affection.
Robert himself later admitted to leaving the rose with the handdrawn symbols during a conversation with Sonjas sister, and upon further asking remarked that Sonja was mentally unstable and insinuated she committed suicide, suggesting that Markus probably knows where she is.  

*Weird prank call on the night of the disappearance*  
About 02:00h on the night of Sonjas dissapearance a girlfriend of hers received a very strange call. Someone called her home and made obscure remarks and threats in an aggrieved voice. This friend was convinced that Markus was the caller.
On 23.05.1996, Police admitted to Sonjas parents that Markus confessed to having made this call from Julians apartment.  

*On the call to her sister*  
You can easily tell the parents especially found the claim made by the boys of sonja mentioning(several times) to call her sister for a pick up a bit outlandish. The reasons they state regarding this are as follows  
-she had never called her sister in the middle of the night to get picked up, but would usually rather call her parents  
-she hadnt memorized her sisters new, quite long and hard to remember number (she almost never called her, since they lived so close, and saw eachother every other day anyways)  
-sonjas notebook (in which her sisters number was written down) was left behind  
-the number wasnt ready available in a public phone book    

**Theories**
    
  
*Trafficing /Slavery*  
The police considered it for a while and there was an attempted scam aimed at her parents hinging on this theory aswell (which is mentioned in more lenght on the show I linked below).  

*Sk/Other women*  
Three women disappear mysteriously between 1991-1997 in Munich. Kristin Harder ((28)[reddit thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/7s2mdw/unresolved_murder_kristin_harder_munich_december/)) in december 1991, Sonja Engelbrecht (19) in april 1995 and Bettina Trabhardt (45) in august 1997. All three women were active in munichs nightlife in the 90s. Out of those three, Kristin Harder was the only one confirmed to be a victim of foul play.
But as of may 2010 police ruled out the serial killer theory, and announced in a press release that there was no connection between the three missing women ([link](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/morde-in-muenchen-drei-frauenleichen-zwei-morde-und-ein-suizid-1.736315), german)  

*Random Encounter/Tramping*  
There are conflicting reports as to how prone Sonja was to such behavior.
Allegedly Markus allured to the fact that Sonja often hitchhiked during a school vacation in England, and atleast one female friend remembered a situation in which Sonja considered tramping but under peculiar circumstances (aka they tried to get a ride from fellow partygoers as a group, but even that never came to be).
Obviously the family doesnt believe she would take a ride with a stranger.
Did she maybe meet somebody new in the days before whilst partying, unbeknownst to her friends? Is it possible she knew the driver of the car? Or did she draw the attention of an unsavory person, who followed her?
It can be anyones guess how likely it would have been for her to feel the need to engage in hitchhiking in a metropole such as munich(the trams were still driving every hour, owning a student ticket and she apparently had the desire and means to call her sister/parents), but this seems to be the theory the police is currently running with.  

*Notes*  
-For this writeup I decided to go with the name Aktenzeichen XY gave the person of last contact(Markus), in other sources he might be referred to as Robert/Robert S.  
-The title is a reference to a tv show covering this case (ungeklärte morde-dem täter auf der spur, ein engel in der nacht) and marks the moment i first learned about it. Sadly this specific episode has also since vanished.  
-I hope you guys dont mind the oddenglish, the anniversary is coming up soon.. so yeah thanks for reading if you made it through.

88ivpz,1,2018-03-31,How could trade marketing be improved at an FMCG company?,LuckyClassic,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/88ivpz/how_could_trade_marketing_be_improved_at_an_fmcg/,"Dear readers &amp; posters,
The last couple of days I have been reading posts regarding trade marketing (really interesting posts here).
Currently, I am working as an intern at a multinational company in the FMCG industry.

I feel myself very well in this role but I would like to make some improvements so they notice my contribution to the company.
Therefore I would like to get some help from some more experienced trade marketers here at Reddit.

Let me list some points:
1. We know what we sell-in but it is hard to track what we sell-out, assume a supermarket. From the sell-in point of view, we exactly know what we sell to which supermarket. Concerning sell-out I would like to introduce something how we could track more beneficially to whom we are selling, number of goods per day, ... Is there a tool to track this aside from the check-out points?
Example: I know that some key account managers take pictures of their goods on the shelves and mail it to the trade marketing department of that specific company, but I am sure this could be done easier.

AND

2. Is there maybe something interesting to market your products more beneficently? Meaning, that customers notice your products faster than from your competitors on the shelves? 

If there are any other good recommendations in order that the company will hire me at the end of the 6 months internship, I would really appreciate your help!

I wish you all a nice weekend a nice Eastern.
Cannot wait to read the comments and interact with you!"
88j10t,1,2018-03-31,Employment Feedback (for a potentially sketchy job),GenuinePersona,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/88j10t/employment_feedback_for_a_potentially_sketchy_job/,"(Xpost from r/psychotherapy) Hello all, I would like to get some thoughts and second opinions from all of you about a job I've been offered and have accepted, because I'm having some second thoughts. I want to determine whether my red flags are legitimate red flags, or if I'm just stressed about taking my first job post graduation and having cold feet. I want to know if something shady is actually going on here.

TL;DR
Recently graduated, MA professional counseling, unlicensed. New employer wants me to have a (fake) business so I can be paid as an independent contractor, and apply for an NPI number with personal info, and assume all the risk involved with therapy. Afraid I'm unknowingly about to commit fraud.

I applied for a mental heath therapist position and was contacted for an interview. The interview was really different. It was a group interview led by the company CEO and included applicants from two separate listings. The CEO mostly bragged indirectly for about three hours how she was a millionaire and owned a million dollar company. Turns out the company works with DFCS and provides care to Medicaid and that all the positions they're offering are for ""independent contractors"", not actual employees. At that point I wasn't certain what that entailed. But when I was given the opportunity, I spoke about my practicum and internship experiences and offered why I thought I would be a good fit for the therapist position. Later there were more weird, bragging comments from the CEO, and we were told we'd be notified by email if we got the position. Later on, obviously, I was offered to position and accepted it. I was already feeling uneasy, but I thought I'd just go for it and count it all experience whether it worked out or not.

Apparently they provide in home services (which I've realized is because they can bill Medicaid significantly more for). There's no company car and I was informed that I would need to increase my car insurance  per injury and per occurance to 100,000 and 300,000 respectively. I had to pay $150 for various background checks and finger prints at various agencies and have the results sent to the company that hired me. And then I learned that I would need to actually apply for my business license, since I would be an independent contractor, and not an actual employee. This seemed really odd to me, and had I known up front, I probably wouldn't have accepted the job. But I had already spent the money for backgrounds/screenings so I felt like I couldnt waste the money I had spent by backing out. So I applied for and paid for my business license, gave my business a random name, and put on the application that I would be ""consulting"", because I was told I couldn't legally say I was a counselor and not have a license. (While I was at the court house I called and asked what other people said they did with their business license and I was told ""consulting"" and vague terms like that). I was really suspecting serious shadiness at this point. 

I went thru orientation and was told repeatedly all the ways that I wouldn't get paid including late fees and all kinds of penalties for not submitting paperwork on time. I learned I would ONLY be working with Medicaid and DFCS referrals for in home counseling. I would ONLY be paid per session and not be reimbursed for mileage (except for DFCS cases). I also learned that I must apply for my own NPI number and use my personal information for the business info, (as if I'm performing services out of my home.) I've not completed this yet because it feels fradulent...

I think there may be other things I've forgotten, and perhaps I've not explained things very well, but that is the gist of the main stuff. 

What sounds most questionable to you guys? Am I overreacting, or is something legitimatley sketchy here? I have no clue what to do next, whether I should back out or just make the most of things and take it for what it is. All feedback appreciated.

88j1dt,1,2018-03-31,Advice for someone who ruined their undergrad (due to health problems).,Dzartovian94,grad,https://www.reddit.com/r/grad/comments/88j1dt/advice_for_someone_who_ruined_their_undergrad_due/,"So I graduated with a bachelor of business with a double major in International Trade and Management. However due to my bad health from my second cancer treatment and my unpredictable recovery, my transcript is a complete mess and my GPA is really low (I ""managed"" to get 2.2 with 7 fails).

So since then I've been trying to find an entry level role but there is immense competition. Grad programs most likely laugh at my application and despite my 2 years of work experience and a single internship with an accounting firm in an admin role, I feel pretty disgusted with myself.

However, I have managed to get accepted into a Grad Diploma of IT for the second half of 2018. My plan at the moment is to keep applying and if I don't get anything, just go back and study to the best of my ability (I'm a natural with technology so it seems pretty retarded that I didn't study it in the first place but oh well).

Can anyone offer me advice on any other options I have? I don't really have any specific career goal, I just want to work in a corporate environment and in general just be productive. Is IT a decent course of study? I've been told CS is preferable but I don't think someone who types primarily with one hand is going to be very employable in a programming role (which I could learn on the side anyway). What sort of coursework does IT consist of? 

I did get accepted into a CPA program but I don't think the initial cost is worth the investment and I don't really want to be an accountant either. I also have been told to ""network"" but I have no idea how or where I should go about this? 

I probably sound like a complete idiot, but I received no support during my undergrad so I'm kind of wet behind the ears. "

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

88k3n0,4,2018-03-31,"Stressful, anxiety-ridden past few months",Daisyinthedaisies3,HealthAnxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/88k3n0/stressful_anxietyridden_past_few_months/,"So, I just wanted to start off by saying that this community has really helped me to calm down by knowing so many others are going through similar things as myself. Everyone is also so kind and helpful to one another, which is even more reassuring.

I've always had a little bit of health anxiety since I was a child (e.g. thinking I have appendicitis when I have a pain in my right lower stomach), but for the past several months, I have been in constant panic mode. It all started when I went to the ENT in December, she removed the wax from my ears (which I've had done before), and then a few days later I had intense ringing in my ears, a clogged feeling in my right ear, headaches, and dizziness. I was googling like crazy, which made things even worse. That ringing and googling led to, what I now know were panic attacks in which I was feeling disconnected from the world and having episodes of shaking, like the chills, amongst other symptoms. Long story short and countless ENT visits later where they didn't find anything wrong with me, I then went to the dentist who said I most likely had a TMJ disorder as a result of grinding my teeth, which I thought would make me feel better. But obviously, it didn't, and I just started to get different symptoms instead. 

I have been having a random ""tic"" in my neck in which it will randomly slightly jerk my head. Sometimes I get a little spazz in my leg or my arm as well, and a twitch that will last for a second or two in random body areas. I also have like a ""shaky"" feeling on the inside, which will sometimes lead to my fingers or toes being a little trembly. I recently have been getting floaters in my eyes, which I'm not sure if I've always had them and just never noticed, or if it's something new (my vision has been bad for years). Also, I randomly have ""visual snow,"" which I think I've also had for a while, but was never really concerned about until now. I feel like I am so hyper focused on my body and I just don't know how to get out of this phase.

I am only 23 and I feel like I am going crazy. I'm in my last year of grad school right now, and currently doing an internship in a hospital for speech pathology. So, not only am I at a super stressful time in my life, but I am around these disorders such as ALS, Parkinson's, MS, etc, and the fact that I see these disorders frequently, makes me even more nervous because they can really happen to anyone! I am caught between that ""1st year medical school"" syndrome thing and going to the doctor to see if there is something to actually be worried about. I stopped googling my symptoms, which has helped a great amount, but this anxiety has not fully gone away. 

For anyone taking the time to read this, thank you. It is a little bit of relief being able to express my feelings instead of keeping them inside."

Contrary to popular belief, Lebanon is a gynocentric society, feminism is on the rise and Lebanese men are either tradcucks or manginas.  
As a matter of fact I have witnessed many gynocentric things at my university :  
- I practice kickboxing, and our master is a white knight tradcuck, during a fight practice he pairs us, one time he paired me with a girl she punches fairly hard and I punched her as hard she started crying in pain and left the room, the master confronted me and said that I should go easy on females and warned me If i hurt a female one more time he will ban me from his class, but if two guys are fighting and one of them gets injured or hurt the attacker doesn't get threatened that he will get banned another time, same scenario if the attacker was a female and the injured is a male or female on female.  He keeps mentioning that he is divorcing his wife because she cheated on him. In Lebanon marriage and divorce courts are run by governmental religious institutions, he is Catholic and the catholic courts are geocentric, he has 2 boys one aged 7 and the other is 3, divorce in a Christian divorce court is extremely difficult unless one of the spouses cheated, I think she will take the kids and child support.  
- In the university gymnasium there is a swimming pool, there is female only time for swimming, faculty and staff time and open for all students, faculty and staff. Male students do not have male only swimming time.  
- There is always a breast cancer awareness week but nothing about prostate cancer or men's health.  
- Men's day was not celebrated at all.  
- Many of our male professors are manginas, and so do many female professors are feminists.    
- The counselor and school nurse are women. (The nurse has some male interns and premed students).
-  60% of the students are female.  
- I suspect that 80% of the female students are currently riding the cock carousel, many of them are gym thots or insta-thots they complain about being objectified by men unless it was a Abdul (Middle Eastern equivalent of Chad) it's normal, the thots post pics of themselves on social media in scantily clad clothes like g-string bikinis , short skirts that you can their panties , they wear yoga pants to college .  
- 85% of the girls oppose legalizing prostitution and when I asked them why , they gave me disingenuous and intellectually dishonest reasons like ( because we are Arab, the women get exploited, it is wrong to sell your body, it is immoral , against religion, it is not normal, human trafficking, it will cause more moral degeneracy).  
- There is a club that is very tumblr like SJWs, and have told others literally to check their privilege.  
- The Human rights club's trending topics are LGBTQ issues and the women's quota in the parliament, instead of more important issues Lebanon is struggling with like freedom of speech, civil liberties, high taxation, inflation ,   poor infrastructure, unemployment  , corruption, authoritarianism , the refugee crisis, and last but not least good electricity telecom internet and clean water .)     

I was a white knight mangina around 1.5 years, I started slowly waking up ever since. I used to be a True Forced Loneliness , I am now a TFL-MGTOW. I am stuck in red pill rage, trying my best to put it to good use, I did some analysis that it is risky for example if I have sex with a girl she could pregnancy trap me so that the government will force me to marry her,unmarried men have no say when it comes to reproductive rights, a friend of mine is the result of a pregnancy trap he was raised by his mom, the guy is really weak because of his mom being extremely overprotective like shielding him during his child hood, his father was wealthy so she seduced him in an attempt to take his resources but it backfired the father wanted to take him and give him to his grandfather who is military officer to raise but he lost the custody, they are Muslim, even Muslim divorce courts are gynocentric a little milder than Christian. I could also get falsely accused of rape now with the #metoo movement.  

Edit : I am an introvert, I have a few very close friends who understand me and have similar values, I am better off being a lone wolf, as I can't stand most people tried to fit in with groups but no one understands, and because I was burned during my childhood and adolescence as well as being bullied I have became bitter, cynical , dead inside , jaded, and misanthropic.  I suspect I might have Asperger's syndrome bc a lot of the symptoms I have are characteristics of an Aspie.  
I hold many fringe world views, and unpopular opinions , I despise mainstream and popular culture. The Elite like The Rothschilds, Rockefellers and George Soros control us like puppets most people around me who don't understand me are not aware they are slaves to the corporate elite.  They created and funded feminism they know that women control 80% of spending and most taxpayers are men, that's why there is alimony, child support, criminalization of prostitution, expensive ~~funerals~~ I mean weddings ( in our culture the bride pays for the wedding, but Lebanese women are daddy's little girls and suffer from princess syndrome, and are also gold digging whores), shaming tactics for men

Edit 2: I think most people around me, are stupid I have learned many more things outside of school, I have realized stupid people have high social status but smart and intelligent people have low social status, I know about a lot of subjects

3. Is the internship generally held in high regard when interviewing for future jobs?

4. What sort of screening were you subjected to?

im 17, turning 18 in 2 months, in december i got withdrawn from high school and transferred to my state's virtual school to finish my high school diploma. i had only 1 semester left but i also failed my fall semester as i didnt go to school for a month before officially transferring out. i went on medications for my anxiety and depression (which i had to get over the fear of weight gain from and do it for my own good), booked therapy and psychiatry appointments, and i was in a school environment that i preferred more then physical school, totally should have been able to finish high school
i dont know where to start with this because there is a long history of things that have occurred, but in short, my family, and especially my mother, are emotionally abusive towards me. she makes me feel like im the bad guy and shes the victim and if i call her out she gets angry and defensive and shows she ""isnt abusive"" by being abusive :^)
falling back to last august, i had finally been able to escape them by moving in with my s/o and his family, but then his parents moved to a smaller house and there was no room for me, and i have no one else to fall to as all my family who isnt my parents and sister live in canada. so i moved back to my house with my parents earlier this month
in the last month, i have relapsed my ed much harder, im gaining weight which feels so bad but i just keep binge eating from the stressful environment, i dropped all of my virtual classes and im going to get my GED, and i've stopped taking my meds as im getting the paranoia again of even more weight gain on top of my bad eating habits
my mum just came into my room and basically told me im a loser and that it's my fault my s/o has educational and emotional issues since i'm influencing him based on my decisions (he actually has family history and wasnt doing well in school before he even got to high school), she told me shes going into therapy and my psychiatrist appointment to tell them i havent been taking my meds and i know shes going to turn it so that shes somehow the victim, i was supposed to move in with my s/o's dad once he gets a new house but she told me that if i do i'm going to be 100% cut off financially from them which i cant do to his dad or last especially if i can start college this fall.
i started hiding my face as she was talking to me (i was already feeling extremely physically ill from binge eating immediately before she talked to me) and she yelled and clapped her hands in my face that i needed to look at her because she needs to be in control of me and im too weak and scared to fight back (and she knows that)
i was supposed to start an internship at her work because i could get easily hired since she already worked there but i dont want to anymore because i cant sit there trapped in the car for 30 minutes a day as she makes me feel like shit and anything i say to defend myself she easily twists it back to be me victimizing her
i need to get out of this house and im so emotionally distraught, i hate myself so much and i dont want her to be controlling me by the throat anymore but i cant do anything about it unless i 1.) get a ton of money instantly to be able to move out (not possible lol) or 2.) stand up for myself and make her understand how i feel without her twisting it on me and trying to put words in my mouth (not possible either, ive already tried)
thanks for reading if you read all of that, i just need to vent and i have no where else and i know it probably doesnt make sense bc im upset and not thinking super clearly

tldr; i have an abusive parent who makes me feel like a loser instead of supporting me to get past mental illnesses and i cant escape the household so i need to suffer and vent here just for now"
88lw4c,1,2018-03-31,25 [F4M] [Venus Academy] Looking for a partner for my course projects and the 'Fellatio' club,Crazypop928,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/88lw4c/25_f4m_venus_academy_looking_for_a_partner_for_my/,"**This is an exclusive internal posting for Venus Academy students. 

**01/04/2018-Campus SexNet group**

It's just past 12 and the campus wide messenger is already filled with troll messages from the Fool's Day. It's very hard to trust anything flowing in on this day. But still there is a message rather peculiar among the huge outbreak of messages. It's a message from the campus queen itself. A lot is heard about her, a fresher toppling most of the all time Venus records within the first couple of months. Senior students are always skeptical about her until they saw her naked on the prestigious fresher event 'Miss Venus'. since then, she has been a regular topic of discussion among the SexNet forums. The group is constantly flooded with her pictures and even her most recent internship application leaks ( https://redd.it/85vglw ) 

""Hi Guys. This is not a Fool's day game and my message is purely coincidental to have posted on this day. Most of you already know me. For those of you who don't, I am Deeksha- **Miss Venus**, currently 5th on the all time Venus cumonpics entries (soon to topple 4th position Riley Reid) and the winner of various Venus level events like **""I want to fuck her!"", ""Best blowjob face"", ""Cute and Fresh""**. It's true what you might have heard, I am a pure virgin although I may have lost my facial virginity from the internship interviews. Since, we are past the midway point of the semester and need to start working on our practical projects, I am on the lookout for an exciting partner for courses in The art of fellatio, Passionate Lovemaking etc. While I am very open about my partner I expect the following qualities:

-Exceptionally passionate about **blowjobs** and **facials**
-comfortable with **nudity** with a girl involved. We are going to do a lots of naked demonstrations and artistic descriptions. So it's vital you are comfortable and confident about your body

-Preferably very experienced sexually. I had to include this as I am a virgin, so someone has to ensure we are doing things the right way with minimal time and effort. This is not a hard constraint as long as you are very skilled in it

-Preferably more composed about your **ejaculation**. It's vital for your projects to have more **control** and **precision** over where you ejaculate

-Need to have insane **chemistry** with me. This is very hard and subjective to gauge but nevertheless very important so our work is natural

-Should be fine with no **intercourse** with me. I would like to preserve my **virginity** for internships, so we are not gonna be doing any vaginal or anal intercourses. It must be hard and also we would be at a disadvantage for our projects, but I am confident I can make it up using other components

-We should be **sexually** attracted to each other. Pretty self explanatory, so that we can derive some pleasure when we work. A good ranking on the **Venus Men to Fuck** list is an advantage but not necessary

*Why me?*

I have already mentioned the accolades I received since I became part of Venus. One huge advantage of picking would be to earn bragging rights to be the first Venus student to **cum** on the Miss Venus herself. You could be greatly respected inside the Venus community. Also, you could probably be pairing up with the girl who is the next Miranda Kerr/Sasha Grey. It could add great value to your profile apart from the sheer satisfaction itself

I am also forming a '**Fellatio**' club to spread the culture of passionate and intense fellatios among the entire Venus community. Hopefully, we can lead the club ourselves and recruit passionate people into it.""

Guys, this is a second prompt of the series of prompts I am  producing which are themed in Venus Academy, an academy which trains people in sex for the lucrative positions like pornstars , escorts, models etc. If you like the idea or if you want to contribute to more prompts, you should definitely message me. I am waiting!

88m5pn,4,2018-03-31,Self project idea,Doctor_Correct,LabVIEW,https://www.reddit.com/r/LabVIEW/comments/88m5pn/self_project_idea/,"I am currently a student, attempting to learn LabVIEW for an upcoming internship.  I want to show my professor that I am somewhat adequate with the program, and am focused on creating a little project to prove it.  I don't have any hardware/sensors to use, so I am thinking about setting up an interface that control certain aspects of my computer, i.e keyboard and mouse inputs, etc.

I am having trouble however figuring out how to connect my speakers to a volume slider on the front panel.  How would I go about connecting the speakers to a volume control in the block diagram?  Any videos you guys recommend for dealing with devices or user input?  I'll take any other ideas I can implement to impress a professor as well :)

Thanks"
88mg38,3,2018-03-31,A stupid mistake,Firsttimeiategoogle,justvent,https://www.reddit.com/r/justvent/comments/88mg38/a_stupid_mistake/,"I am a computer information systems major at a state University, I pay for college with loans and I still live at home. 

This summer I was hoping to get an internship doing anything IT related. I applied everywhere and was able to get two interviews. The first one went well but I didn't expect to get the job and the second one went phenomenal and I was almost certain I would get an offer. 

Fast forward a week and I get a call from the first company offering me a very well paying internship that will allow me to work part time during the semester when I'm able. I asked them if I could get back to them in 2 days and they said yes. I still wanted to hear back from the seconds company so after the 2 days had passed I asked the first company if I could have an extension on my offer. 

They denied the extension and wished me luck on my career.

I felt instant regret. They interpreted me asking for an extension as me denying their offer. 

Company a reached out to me and told me I didn't get the internship so now I'm internless for the summer all because I didn't accept the offer when I had the chance.

I feel really stupid and wish I could go back in time just to accept the offer.... This summer is going to suck."
