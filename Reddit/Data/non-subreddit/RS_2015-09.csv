So, I just started my senior year in high school which has prompted me to start.. well you know figuring out what I want to do after high school and was looking for some input. I am going to give you all a ""little"" run down of where I currently stand.

Right now I am a senior in high school, I have been going to votech since 10th grade (this is my 3rd and final year) for what was originally ""Computer Servicing"" which last year was officially changed to ""Computer Networking and Telecommunications"". During this summer me and a friend of mine were recommended by our Votech teacher for an IT Internship at our homeschool with the IT Director. Which was required to be 250 Hours and we learned a lot and got paid $1500. We also put in 50 hours extra after we completed the 250 because it was fun and a very beneficial experience. Now this led to us now being recommended by the IT Director to our Superintendent to actually have us hired by the school and get paid during the school year (which after a board meeting happened). Basically on Tuesdays and Thursdays instead of going to VoTech we stay at the school from 8:30 to 11:30 with the IT Director and get paid minimum wage for it. Which is awesome! Other classes I have taken/are taking include Algebra, Geometry, Personal Finance, Economics, and Video Tech.

Right now my goals are to get the A+ and CCNA Certifications before I graduate, because my votech teacher has units preparing us for these tests if we wish to take them.

So, let's just say I do pass the 2 Certification tests and graduate Votech, along with my IT internship and being hired by the school to assist with the IT Director what would be my best IMMIDIATE options after school? I want to either A: Attempt to get a starter IT Job (helpdesk, etc.) or B: attend a nearby business college for an associates in Information Systems Support Technician (http://www.dbcollege.edu/majors/information-systems-support-technician/)

Any Input/opinions would be awesome!"

I have finished up all of my coursework and internship towards my degree, and the last thing I need to do is complete my data collection for my dissertation.

My study focuses on exploring the unique experiences of children who grew up with one or both parents deployed. I have a specific interest in whether the experience of parental deployment during childhood is related to these individuals’ psychological adjustment as they navigate the challenges of emerging adulthood. I am conducting research to better understand the life trajectory of individuals in this population group. I hope that by identifying factors related to risk and resiliency, interventions can be created to identify and help those at a higher risk.

I am really struggling to recruit participants who meet criteria. If you meet criteria, or know someone who does (children, friends, family members, etc), PLEASE pass this information along, or take the survey yourself.

The criteria are:
-Must currently be ages 18-24 -Must speak/understand written material in English -Must have experienced a parent deployed when you were a child -Must not be currently active duty military yourself

If I can get more participants, I think this study could be very informative in terms of helping future generations of military youth. Your participation is necessary for this to happen.

Thank you. Please PM me if you have additional questions.

3j64xi,2,2015-08-31,My 19 Y/O (F) Ex of 1 1/2 years recently broke up with me 21 Y/O (M) and I am struggling getting back into things.,lolkid2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3j64xi/my_19_yo_f_ex_of_1_12_years_recently_broke_up/,"Hi all,

First I'd like to preface this by saying I hope it doesn't go too long, I will try to include enough detail for you to make judgement though. I am a 21 Y/O Junior in College, and was dating a 19 Y/O Junior at the same college for the past year and a half. Things started well and in all honesty I was very happy in the relationship. Summers I typically spend away from home on an internship, so the previous summer i spent in mississippi away, saw her once over the summer and struggled but came back and things were good. This previous summer I was only 3 hours away so we were seeing eachother every other weekend and things were going great. Out of the blue one day she texts me saying that she wants to end things, no explanation and just turns her phone off (this was about 2 months ago). Two weeks go by of me being very depressed as I knew nobody except coworkers where I was and she texts me saying she is ready to talk. I decided to tell her that I was ready to talk two weeks ago and chose to end the conversation there.

We got back to college, and I saw her and talked briefly before things headed south, this was maybe a week ago. The next day I drop her sweatshirt off as it was the last of her items I have and we ended up talking for a good two hours. It felt like the first good communication we had had in quite some time. She had mentioned she wish she knew some of the things I had told her when she broke up with me, but was seeing someone at the time so she couldn't give me a ""second chance"". I was very distraught and couldn't eat or sleep. The next morning she asks to go see a movie, telling me this was my chance. Pick her up, things are going really well, she says she thinks things are good. After the end of the movie I knew it wasnt the same, on the way home she just told me she didn't want to be with me and needless to say I was devastated again.

This was only 3/4 days ago. Since there has been no communication, and it is a very large campus so the odds of seeing her are pretty slim. I am really just turning to reddit for help, I believe the relationship to be over and it is an upsetting fact but one I am trying to cope with.

I am typically a pretty confident person and have honestly had a great life so far. Now I struggle to eat, it affects my sleep and is starting to affect my schoolwork. Luckily that just started recently so it is not getting out of hand yet.

No matter who I meet, whether it is on Tinder or Downtown it just doesn't seem to compare. I keep thinking nobody will compare to her and it just makes things worse. Campus offers therapists I believe which I have really started to consider just to have someone to talk to about all of this.

Sorry if that was too long, and at this point I'm not even sure what I am asking for, I just really needed to get some of this off my chest.



   
**tl;dr**: GF broke up with me a few months ago, since things have been up and down. Struggling to find happiness now."
3j67dy,1,2015-08-31,It just keeps going downhill,SantiClaws,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3j67dy/it_just_keeps_going_downhill/,"I don't know where to start, but let's go with the beginning of university. I went and studied engineering, and I made a great group of friends. People that are equally as nerdy and awkward, yet fun and kind. We went through assignments, projects, labs, and even internships together. We lived together, we stayed up together, and we laughed. We weren't cool or exciting, but at least we had our group. But I was a jerk, I was mean, and I had isolated them by the time I had graduated. I never made the time or the effort to really connect and to really care for them. I miss them, and I wish I had focused my energy on them rather than studying and getting good grades. I feel like the paper I earned is so empty and meaningless. 

My final internship was with a food plant and I had the best experience I can hope for. I met some great folks, learned a lot, and managed to even get a full-time offer at the end. I was speechless, I felt like everything I've done has finally paid off. I started working there after graduation and it was great seeing the engineering team again. Work was tough, and I was busy, and soon I felt worn out. It didn't seem like I had a purpose anymore, was it just going to be working/sleeping/eating forever? At least in school I had something to strive for, and that had always been my life up until this point. It was difficult, the plant was very special to me, but I left. I gave up everything I had and left my family, however few friends I had, and flew to the other side of the country. I had a new job, this was my new life, my escape. But it never got better. I thought a change of pace was what I needed, but I missed home. I had made a big mistake leaving the plant that had given me so much. I should have been grateful for what was given to me, and I was very lucky to have gotten the job. 

I drove across the country and went back to my home province (Ontario) and got another job. This place is great, the people are nice, and I can visit home every couple of weeks. But I'm still not happy, why am I never happy? 

None of these ""escapes"" had made me feel better. I still don't know  what I'm working for, and every now and then I wish I can go back. I wish I can go back and say sorry to my friends and patch things up. I wish I can go back to my first job instead of deserting them. Geez, I'm a horrible person after writing all of this out. I whine, I complain, and I'm never satisfied.  "

The fall semester is gearing up and I've always been smitten with buying office supplies, labeling file folders, etc. So that's been going on. My GF has come out to help me move for a couple of weeks, but she's going back to our hometown to complete an internship, and I'm on my own for ten months. But in the first couple weeks of solitude, I've found that:

* I've been flossing every night.
* I joined a really great gym with a few 24/7 locations by my apartment that offer several fitness classes, and so on, that I really like going to.
* I've been eating way better since I buy my own groceries. Eating out is just an added expense I don't need to waste money on.
* I have a way better sleep schedule and I'm just more motivated to do well.
* I clean, dust, and organize a LOT more now. I have a fairly nice apartment and it feels wrong to not take care of it properly.

I've always been good at what I do, but for some reason since coming out here I just feel like I have more energy. Anyway, just wanted to share my sense of improvement with some internet strangers! Did anyone have a similar experience after moving out on their own?"
3j6xi0,8,2015-09-01,"My thoughts on Doom 3 (Why it is/isn't good, what could have been done better)",GoredonTheDestroyer,Doom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/3j6xi0/my_thoughts_on_doom_3_why_it_isisnt_good_what/,"Since I'm subbed to this sub, I figured I might as well share my thoughts on the one Doom that has been nitpicked to Hell and back - Doom 3. This is all my own, personal opinion, and should be taken with a grain of salt. I have played the game on three separate systems (Xbox Classique, PS3 and PC), and have beaten it on the former two.

First off, let's start with my thoughts on the setting:

The game takes place directly on Mars, in the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC)'s Mars Research Facility (Kind of like Half-Life's Black Mesa, but on Mars). I think this is a strong point, in the game'ss favor. Instead of the typical ""Some planet deep in space"" or Earth, we actually get a glimpse of Mars itself, and it's fairly realistic, by video game standards. This, however, can be a detractor, because in a realistic game like Doom 3, you can't just run around on the surface of Mars all Willy Nilly. You actually have to be concerned about your o2 level. Inside the actual base, however, it's dark, cramped, and claustrophobic - everything Doom isn't. I feel like the majority of the levels, creatively named they may be (I'm looking at you Alpha Labs 1-4!), look mostly the same, with the only real variation coming in the Recycling Sector, Monorail, and Delta Labs, and even then, those feel exactly the same. Some sections, like Alpha Labs, feel like they should have been one or two levels, not four, so this is a negative point, against the game. By Delta Labs, the game starts to feel almost... Boring, since, by this point, you've seen just about everything the game has to throw at you (Imps, Zahmbees, Z-Sec, Maggots, Demons, etc.). So, naturally, the game decides to throw a curve ball, and have you face off against not one, but two Hell Knights (serving as a callback to Doom 1), which I think is a nice touch. Then... Hell... Hell, I think, is the game's real weak point. Why? Well, there is so much build up for it, and... You're thrown outside of a building, no weapons, and that's it. However, it is worth noting, the weapons you find in Hell are weapons that were only in Doom 1 and 2 (unless you're playing BFG Edition), no flashlight, grenades or MG (again, unless you're playing BFG Edition), and I think this was a nice touch. However, each Hell level (of which there are two. Only two.), is relatively short, and cramped. There isn't a whole lot of room to maneuver and dodge projectiles (AND LOST FUCKING SOULS!), so Hell can be seen as a difficulty spike for some. Fortunately, if you know where to look, you can get most of your weapons back within minutes of entering Hell. The second Hell level is a boss battle, the second of 3 1/2 (explanation will follow), and then it's back to the Mars base, for more of the same. Again, a detractor. The game remains consistent in the location (Delta Labs and Site 3), until you get to the final level, and the final boss. For the setting, if I were using a 1-10 scale, I would give the game a 7.5. I mean, it's interesting, but not varied enough.

Now, let's talk about weapons:

- Pistol: Your standard Doom fare (pitiful power, only good for sniping, really). Why did they even have to include a Pistol with this game?

- Shotgun: A step up from the Pistol in almost every way, but, then again, unless you can feel your opponent breathing, it's damn near useless. I get that it's got a short barrel, but, come on. If you fire a real SBS (Short-Barrel Shotgun, not sawed off) into a wall, most of the shot isn't going to wind up in the floor and on the ceiling.

- Super Shotgun: While not included in the original game, the SSG is an important part of Resurrection of Evil (the games sole expansion, until BFG edition included Lost Mission), and is superior to HALF THE ARSENAL.

- Machine Gun: Really, they should have called it a Sub Machine Gun, but I digress. The Machine Gun, I think, is a good addition to the Doom arsenal. It's fast firing, fairly accurate, and has a bountiful magazine (60 rounds). It combines the minuscule power of the pistol with the rate of fire of the Chaingun, and reloads fairly quickly, to boot.

- Chaingun: If you know how to conserve ammo, the Chaingun will be your best friend... Just be prepared to lead your shots. For what ever reason, possibly to balance the CG out, id gave each bullet travel time, which can really fuck you over in a heated firefight. Now, the game again uses the misnomer *""Chaingun""* to describe this multi-barrel wunderwaffe (wonder weapon), when it should really be called a Minigun.

- Rocket Launcher: The good ole' Rocket Launcher. There really isn't much to say about it: Point, Fwoosh, Boom, Dead.

- Plasma Rifle: I'll be honest, the Plasma Rifle seems kinda useless in this game. Not only does it fire slowly (projectiles don't move terribly fast), but it doesn't carry a whole lot of plasma in each cell, so only rely on it for pinpoint accuracy.

- Grenades: Arguably the most pointless, useless, and useful weapon in the entire game. Why? Well, grenades seem kinda... Out of place on an uber expensive research outpost, don't they? They bounce around waaaay too much, so you're more likely to hit yourself than what you're throwing them at, but they deal a fuckton of damage, so... yay?

- Flashlight: What should have been a tool is now a weapon. id took a page from Valve's book and gave the player a flashlight. While this does sound like a good thing, it isn't mounted on your body armor. It didn't take them until Doom 3: BFG Edition to do that, and it just kind of irks me. Hey, at least the battery doesn't go out. The Xbox version of RoE kind of fixed this by putting the flashlight on the Pistol, but that doesn't make me want to use it any more than I already do.

- Fist: Balled up fist, useful for bludgeoning. Need I say more?

- Soul Cube: One of the weirdest weapons in all of Doom (second only to the Artifact, from RoE), it uses demonic souls to power itself, for use as a weapon. Even after beating the game several times, that still confuses me.

- Artifact: The weirdest weapon in all of Doom (even the Unmaker, in Doom 64, is more conventional than this), you use *human* souls to slow down time, gain impressive strength, and become invincible (Shut up, Boris.). In other words, Game Breaker, The Weapon.

- Ionized Plasma Levitator (Grabber): Doom 3 RoE got some flak for this one, since it was released after Half-Life 2 (which included a Gravity Gun, the Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator), but the Grabber actually has a cool down (you can't run with a Forgotten One and be like ""To be, or not to be? That is the question.""

- BFG9000: Doom just wouldn't be complete without it, so the BFG is back and ready to kick some Demon ass! It's not much more of a gun than it is a *Death Glove* (the model fits over whomever's holding it's forearm), which is a really nice touch, for me, at least. This version can be charged (don't overcharge it, though. You'll go boom.)

Overall, I think the majority of the weapons in Doom 3 could have been tweaked a little more before release, since most of them just feel beyond weak, it's not even funny. If I were using a 1-10 scale, I'd rate the weapons 5/10.

I'll spare you the boringness that is the story, and just move on to what could have been made better:

- First off, since the game is so dark, they could have included a stealth system, like the E3 2002 showing.

- Second, the HUD, while decent, can get pretty confusing, even for someone who's experienced in the game.

- Third, Hell could have been made into an epic journey, maybe even revisiting modernized versions of the old UAC outposts (Doom 1).

- Finally, the sounds used by the guns. Originally, they were created by none other than Trent Reznor, of NiN fame, and practically intern at id during development. For what ever reason, these were scrapped.

So, there you have it. My thoughts on Doom 3. Do I think it's the worst? No, God no. That's what the GBA ports are for. Do I think it's the best? Again, no, but it is better than many people say it is. Would I recommend it? If you don't mind dark, creepy corridors, loud noises out of fucking nowhere, I would definitely recommend it to anyone."

3j7w7n,0,2015-09-01,How should I partition and diversify my investments?,Kingdom_of_the_Skies,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3j7w7n/how_should_i_partition_and_diversify_my/,"So I have this a shot a few weeks ago but had no such luck in getting responses, so I wanted to try again.

I began interning over the summer in the aerospace industry and as an intern I receive investment benefits from the company. This is my first try at dealing with investments so first thing I did was to make sure I received the full company match of 4% by deducting 8% from my own pay. For the 8% deductions from my pay, 6% is put into an after-tax account and the remaining 2% is placed into a Roth 401k.

So as for how the money is invested, I have reworked it a bit since I last posted. Now it's  setup so that 5% goes into bonds, 35% goes into a premixed 2060 retirement path package, 15% goes into large U.S equity, 15% goes into small u.s equity, 5% into emerging stocks and 15% goes into the company stock. I made these changes before the economy began swaying a lot, so just to clarify it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.

A bit background about myself: I am 19, starting my 3rd year in college in the fall (probably still have 3 more years to go including this one coming up), have $8000 in subsidized student loans, and have a monthly car insurance bill of $150. 

One additional thing to note is that after I finish my internship, later this week, I will not have access to the company's network and therefore will not be able to making any adjustments until the following summer.

So, as a young adult hoping to have a sustainable future, what adjustments should I make in order to make the best of my investments now? Also, should I set up my account so that it has an automatic rebalancing? And if so, in what way?"

My plan is to continue Master's or find an internship in Western Europe. I will have a gap before this so I am looking to add some things in my résumé. 

There is a really good course in CNC programming in my city. The certificate is recognized in the EU and it got good reviews. This would be a pretty big investment for me so I am wondering what is the current demand for this kind of knowledge in the EU market and do you think that it's a good investment? "

Ideally I would move here right after I finish my degree in Computer Science. I've been looking through this subreddit and I've noticed a lot of people saying that jobs are hard to find. Is there a decent enough tech scene for a CS grad to find a job? I'll be graduating with 1.5 years of cumulative internships which I think might help.

How are the salaries for a Software Engineer in Bozeman? Obviously the cost of living is much lower and the salary would be adjusted as such, but does anyone have a ballpark guess? Would I be able to buy a house and live relatively comfortably on a Software Engineer's salary in Bozeman?

Thanks! You guys have a beautiful town and are lucky to live there : )"

3j8smp,80,2015-09-01,Lo prometido es deuda: Mi experiencia de cómo conseguir trabajo en USA para Mexicanos profesionistas,goosetavo2013,mexico,https://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/comments/3j8smp/lo_prometido_es_deuda_mi_experiencia_de_cómo/,"Hola redditores Mexas. Hace unos meses hice [este post]  (https://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/comments/36c1k6/rmexico_hay_inter%C3%A9s_en_aprender_c%C3%B3mo_trabajar_en/) para ver si habia interes en el tema, ya por fin decidí escribir un poco mas, en Septiembre empieza la temporada de reclutamiento de muchas empresas asi que ahi les va:

Estudié Ingeniería en Sistemas en el Tec de Monterrey Campus Monterrey y de ahi un día me enteré que Microsoft reclutaba en el campus y decidí ir. Al final, despues de varios meses y varias entrevistas me ofrecieron un ""internship"" pagado en Redmond WA para el verano. Inicie con la visa J1, e hice dos veranos con ese status. De ahi me hicieron una oferta de tiempo completo y me sacaron la H1B, en la cual estuve por siete años hasta que pude sacar la Green Card (Residencia Permanente). Me tocó reclutar a ingenieros para Microsoft por varios años en USA y México.
Fast Forward 10 anios y ahora trabajo de forma independiente con mi propia empresa y me ha tocado tramitar dos visas TN para Mexicanos y la verdad el proceso esta MUY facil desde el punto de vista del patron, la neta nomas tiene que tener ganas de hacerlo. Conozco a muchisimos profesionistas que estan trabajando aca en USA en diversas áreas (contabilidad, diseño gráfico, software, IT, etc) y con el dolar que nomas no baja vale la pena intentarlo. Ahi les van mis principales recomendaciones:

1) Si les late hacer software estan de suerte porque hay mucha demanda de buenos ingenieros (no apliquen si son ingenieros chafas por favor). Si estan estudiando actualmente la carrera o se graduaron hace 2 años o menos pueden ir a los eventos de reclutamiento en los campus que hacen las empresas grandes (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, hasta Facebook). Ahi les va un [grupo de FB] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/microsoft.friends.mexico/) en donde acaban de publicar todos los eventos de Septiembre de Microsoft (solo hacen esta campaña 1 vez al año). Que los recluten en el campus es la manera MAS FACIL de entrar a este tipo de empresas, la barra para los internships es mucho mas baja que para los trabajos de tiempo completo (full time) y te contratan por tu potencial aunque no tengas experiencia. El error que muchos cometían era no pararse hasta que estuvieran en el último semestre y tratar de quedar. No lo hagan, desde el primer semester deberían de intentar, total, no les pasa nada si les dicen que no, si logran sacarle platica al reclutador a los mejor hasta les pueden ayudar a mejorar para el próximo año. Muchos reclutadores fueron alumnos como ustedes hace pocos años.

2) Es mucho mas facil entrar a una empresa grande tipo Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc porque tienen reclutadores especializados en México y saben todo el rollo de las visas, pagan todos los abogados y hast tu mudanza. Bueno, ""fácil"" entre comillas porque quieren a los mejores ingenieros del pais (raza super geek que sepa programar, de preferencia que hayan participado en concursos tipo ACM, Top Coder, Olimpiada de Informatica o Matemáticas, etc), y tienen mucha experiencia reclutando asi que saben qué perfiles jalan. Para darles una idea, en Microsoft reclutábamos como 50 ingenieros al año de Universidades (esto fue hace 4-5 años), la mayoria para internships.

3) Si no estan estudiando o no estudiaron algo que ver con software no se desanimen, esta la opcion de la visa TN, el rollo es que tienen que haber estudiado alguna de las [carreras autorizadas en el TLC] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TN_status). Ahi esta la categoría mágica de ""Management Consultant"" que la verdad esta bastante ambiguo. Con que hayas estudiado algo remotamente semejante a Administracion y tengas experiencia como consultor en alguna empresa (ojo, muchos trabajos se pueden ""ajustar"" a este criterio), entonces puedes aplicar. Una vez si me negaron la TN porque de plano nos pasamos y quisimos sacársela a alguien de Mercadotecnia y le cambiamos el titulo a Marketing Management Consultant y aunque lo autorizaron en Estados UNidos, a la hora de sacar la estampa de la vis en México la negaron. Total si no se pone uno chistoso con los nombres debe jalar chido.

4) Si ya estan trabajando como profesionistas, no olviden actualizar su Linked-In, muchas empresas en Mexico tipo Amazon lo utilizan muchisimo para encontrar talento en México. Ese sitio si jala, asi que tengan todo actualizado y con recomendaciones, entren a grupos de su interes, etc.

5)Si deciden irse por la TN, todo el problema se reduce en conseguir una carta del empleador ofreciendoles el trabajo (o mejor aun, ustedes escriban la carta y que se las firmen) en donde se describe el puesto (usando el titulo de la lista TN, por ejemplo Management Consultant) y en donde explican quien es la empresa, cuanto les van a pagar y por cuanto tiempo es el puesto (maximo 3 anios, asi que PONGAN 3). Ya con eso debe ser todo lo que ocupan, vayan al consulado con toda la documentacion (titulo, acreditaciones, datos de la empresa, hasta documentos financieros si los obtienen) y listo.
Buscando un empleador que entienda la TN y este dispuesto a trabajar con ustedes para que la tramiten es otro rollo. Ahi he visto jalar dos estrategias:

    a) Aplicar a un trabajo y explicar en el CV que tienes ""Self-sponsored work authorization - TN Visa"". Total que vas a pagar y tramitar todo con tal de que te den la carta de oferta. Asi procedes por toda la entrevista (probablemente ocupes viajar a USA con visa de turista para una entrevista en persona) y tienes que asegurarte que acepten a trabajdores no-ciudadanos con visa de trabajo. Hasta puedes contratar a un abogado para que te ayude, van a ser como $1K-$2K por todo, pero la neta no ocupas en mi opinion. Asi le han hecho muchos amigos que viven en la frontera, estan estudiando o viviendo en USA temporalmente o viven en el interior y tienen un CHINGO DE GANAS de trabajar en USA y se las ingenian.

    b) Buscar una empresa o empresario Mexicano en USA y que te echen la mano. Parece que no pero si hay muchos empresarios Mexas en USA. Chingos. Desde restauranteros, dueños de mercados, comerciantes, etc. Todos ellos pueden tramitar la TN sin mayor problema, pero ocupas formar la relacion y ofrecerles tus servicios. Si tienes parientes/amigos/exnovias en USA, preguntales a quien conocen y ponte en contacto con ellos. Ofreceles trabajar gratis virtualmente desde México si ocupas pero hazlos entender que eres super chambeador y que no les cuesta nada tramitarte la visa. Facebook y Linked In son una maravilla para esto, usalos para avanzar tu carrera. Asi he visto a varios profesionistas (Licenciados en Hoteleria, Mercadotecnia, Economia, etc) conseguir chamba y una vez en USA, de ahi eventualmente brincar a otra visa u otra empresa.

6) Ademas de la TN esta la opcion de trabajar en una empresa gringa en Mexico (tipo HP, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Amazon, etc) y lograr que te cambien a USA, ahi estan disponibles otros tipos de visa como la L1 y la EB. Normalmente tienes que estar chambeando al menos 1 año para pedir este tipo de cambio, pero es muy ventajoso porque la empresa hace todos los trámites por ti.

Ahi esta mis estimados, como la ven? La neta hay mucho mas que se puede escribir de cada punto, pero empecemos por ahi. Tambien, no soy abogado ni experto en visas, esta es mi experiencia como empleado, reclutador y ahora como empresario. Si tienen un caso muy especifico (saque beca de CONACYT, me case con una gringa pero no tenia ciudadania y ahora quiero sacar la visa X1, cuanto ocupo esperarme?), neta paltiquen con un abogado, no se crean todo lo que sale en la internet.

saludos

Edit: los chairos son bienvenidos en USA

Edit 2: formateo y Hay una opcion 7) Si conoces a alguien que trabaje en una empresa gringa en México o mejor aun en una empresa gringa en USA, ellos te pueden recomendar o hasta contactar directamente con el manager que tenga la vacante (asi te brincas como 4 filtros de RH y demas). No te garantiza el éxito pero al menos te asegura una entrevista en muchos casos. De ahi en fuera te toca echarle ganas.

I'm totally new to Durham (only been twice), so I apologize for any mistakes.  Mostly I'm curious as to what works and doesn't work when it comes to recruiting and getting to know the student population.  I've chatted with a couple of professors about doing guest lectures, so I want to know what's been successful there in the past.

As for career fairs and recruiting, I'm well aware of Hack Duke and we'll be there as mentors (again!) this year.  What do you like to see in the way of swag, door prizes, and the like?  And what can we do to both get our name out there and help you out in your development as an engineer?  Things like ""dev with the pro"" sessions where we walk through Android and iOS development?

If you have thoughts on any of the above, drop me a line or just post a reply.  Also, if you're interested, WT is definitely looking for full-time and summer intern hires!"

3j9qap,4,2015-09-01,Respect Lady Luck,ThatPersonGu,WhoWouldWinVerse,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhoWouldWinVerse/comments/3j9qap/respect_lady_luck/,"**Character Name:** Lucia Bourche 
________________________________________
**Background:**
Still an elementary student when the White Event came, she never discovered her powers for years, simply taking herself up as a normal human surrounded in a world full of oddity. Many of her friends were taken up as metahumans, but she herself never came around. It wasn’t actually until a few years into college when revisiting her father, a compulsive gambler, at a night at a casino that she started to notice a few irregularities in the games she played. She could cause uncertainty at a seemingly sub-microscopic level, causing reactions both small (changing what side a coin landed on) and large (destroying the entire computer system on campus). 

Cutting to a few years in the future, she’s struggling at an internship in the highly competitive field of advertisement. Her friendships are failing, the money isn’t cutting the bills, and there are already too many heroes in the street for another vigilante to go out proclaiming justice. So she took the other possible option: crime. Taking up the mantle of Lady Luck, she set herself out on a quest to do evil, explore her powers further, and try to change the world for what she believes will be the better. 

**Description of your character:**
5”8, not too too lanky, brown hair and slightly tan skin, glasses when on the job, mask when out on the streets. Her outfit when as Lady Luck is a large overcoat/cape, all white on the outside, pink on the inside, with large fake shitty wings on the back, while wearing a light one piece costume wrapped with a tacky black belt. 

**Description of character's attitude and personality:**
Overachiever to the point of mentally breaking. Since she’s only really in it for the money, she tends towards Lawful Evil to Lawful Neutral, tending more often than not to be careful of toeing the line. An avid fan of wrestling when she was younger, she’s deeply involved in the theatrics of heroism, often playing the role of the scheming over the top villain when at most she probably just saw a bank and thought about robbing it that day. Despite this, she’s also rather competitive, and has tendencies towards cocky recklessness when she has the upper hand.  The most miserable self loathing drunk you will ever meet. 

**Alignment:** Villain
________________________________________
**Tier Listing:** Low-street to Mid-street (Potentially Mid-High Street by the end of season 1)

**Powers**

- She can manipulate the outcome of events slightly, though never to a 100% or 0% chance. The more directly meaningful (e.g., the event itself matters, not necessarily the outcome itself, so a loose plank collapsing causing a person to fall to their death is fine, but directly causing something like a heart attack is not fine) the outcome, the more energy it takes out from her to change, as it is also with changing unlikely events to likely events and vice versa. 

- She also has a very weak, very uncontrollable reach on smaller events on the quantum scale, which she can kind of somewhat not really play around with to do things like causing chemical reactions, fuck with electricity, and potentially endanger the space time continuum. 

**Weaknesses**

- Her moves are extremely high maintenance, so it takes a lot of energy out of her to do many of these things

- While she’s certainly been trying to work on her fitness, she’s still below peak human in both durability and in strength/agility. 

**Standard Gear**

- Her lucky quarter, which has gotten her out of an improbably amount of tight situations

- Hidden Mace dispensers just below her wrists, because villains don’t play fair, ever. 

**Skills**

- Pretty smart, good with deduction

- Some skill with freerunning gained from her experiences as a superhero

- Decent levels of charisma, friendly enough to win over a friend. 

- Solid grasp on game theory
________________________________________

**Feats**

- Burned down an entire church by starting a small flame in the back room on a wooden cabinet while in the middle of a tense fight. Still extremely regretful over it. 

- Surprisingly good with FPS PC games, owns a virtual golden banana hat worth hundreds of dollars. 

- Caused another (this time abandoned) building collapse by causing a slight pressure fault to break down the foundations.

- On one occasion overexerted herself, releasing a short range field of pure possibility that turned a single hair of hers white, caused the floor directly under her to break, gave her severe dehydration that she would later be treated at the hospital for, and gave her a severe migraine for a solid week.

- Shitty artist.

I just got off the phone with my NDad and he's asking me to visit VERY soon to see him. He didn't explain as to what he wants to talk about but he is saying he needs to talk about a ""lot of things.""

Worst of all, he specifically asked that I won't bring my boyfriend to the house with me. It's an hour drive back and forth on a busy, Miami highway.  I don't think I am mentally prepared for this and the driving will make it worse.  

Is there any advice you guys can give me? I told my nDad that I can only see him next Thursday, the 10th, at 9am and I have to leave for class at 10am. He said I can't go then(too early for him and not enough time to talk) and to think of a new time. I already know it, I didn't say it, but next time I'm available is next Saturday, the 12th, all day. I'm a really busy person with classes and looking for internships right now but they don't respect that. Any piece of advice to maybe prepare myself? How to lie about why I need my boyfriend there? 

Edit: Ok, it was my mistake to not go more in depth with my relationship with my nparents. I made a previous post and went in depth there explaining that I am financially bound to my parents because they have my residency papers meaning I can't work. At the moment I am stuck under them financially and will slowly start saving up my own money to cut them out. I've made a plan that till I finish my undergraduate, I'll be moving in with my boyfriend to go to another university, thus cutting my ties with my parents. Till then, if I don't keep ""friendly"" ties with my parents, they can cut me off and ruin my credit/won't be able to finish school. 

Also, I've calmed down a bit and my boyfriend talked to me. We've kind of came to the conclusion that my father is going to question my career choice of becoming a family therapist(which he doesn't know, he thinks I'll be working for him with a psych degree? Or something along the lines of that). The thing is, therapists aren't paid as well as he wants me to get paid. He values money as the most important thing. 

Thank you everyone who has commented so far, it's helped me a lot to relax and think things through. "

First post ever on reddit and starting it off with a bang!


Basically, I was an intern at Naked and Famous Denim  this summer, and /u/joshyle , /u/Madiau , and I thought it'd be cool to have an in-house denim fade off. We will be wearing pairs made with some of the most unique and rarest fabrics that Naked and Famous Denim has ever produced. 


Introducing our three contenders:


Matt will be rocking the Okayama Spirit 2's, which boast an incredible unsanforized slubby indigo/indigo denim. 

http://imgur.com/a/5wxlM


Josh has chosen the ultimate Tokushimas, which are hand-dyed with natural hand-fermented indigo. There are only 15 pairs ever made, so they are truly an amazing and rare pair of jeans. 

http://imgur.com/a/0OTku


I will be wearing the Made in Japan Tempi Treated denim, made with loomstate Japanese selvedge denim that are super duper soft. 

http://imgur.com/a/maX62


The first round of Fade Fest 15 will be taking place from September 1st 2015 to September 1st 2016. 


We will update you guys at least once a week with progress pictures and hopefully hold some meet ups with local denim heads in Montreal. 


This is a friendly competition, but what's a competition without a winner? At the end of the 12-month period, we will ask you guys to vote for your favourite pair, and the winner will be walking home in a new pair of jeans, paid for by the two losers. 


Group shots:
http://imgur.com/a/fhFuo


This is really just fun for us and wanted to keep reddit in the loop as well. It's also a great way for us to stay connected since Matt and I don't work at Naked and Famous Denim anymore because of school. If any of you are in the area, please feel free to message any of us, and we could meet up and talk denim and visit Naked and Famous HQ. 


Thanks for reading and we will keep you updated with more pictures!"

I have a question that I was hoping someone would be able to have an answer for. I'll be graduating with a degree in ICJ in December and I've recently been fascinated with Android Development. I've taken the google Udacity course, read some textbooks about Java, and played around with Android Studio building very basic projects.

Do you think it's possible for me to score a simple non-paid internship job in nyc to get a better understanding of Computer Science and App development?"

I thought that after upgrading to 5.0.2, it would be fixed, but it was bad news as it wouldn't even start up! Downgrading has the same ISO issues.

I need VirtualBox or something similar for college and internship, but Windows 10 fucks it all up! I can't even find any help article for it!"
3jcqtv,1,2015-09-02,(27m) (24f) My boyfriend of three years feels this relationship has nothing to show for. I don't know what else to do,throwawayidont_know,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3jcqtv/27m_24f_my_boyfriend_of_three_years_feels_this/,"Hi guys. Throwaway account because he knows my reddit name. Anyways, he's 27 and I'll be 24 this month. We've had our problems, and they've all been happening recently for 5 months now. Recently, I had confronted him and told him he is textbook emotionally abusive. I had told him this for months, but when I mentioned the word ""textbook"", he realized what he was doing was wrong. He said he was going to get counseling. Still hasn't happened. 

I'm a newly graduated person, and just landed an internship. He says it's not good enough. I also had to move out of the current house I was staying at. He wanted me to live closer to my internship, which makes sense, but it's in Orange County (very expensive), so I moved in with family to help save money. He was upset about this (he lives out there btw; I'm an hour east from him) because not only did he want me to be closer to the jobs, but also closer to him. Makes sense, but I just can't do it right now. He offered to help pay more than half of my rent in OC, but with how rocky our relationship has been, I don't feel comfortable. Always taking about putting a baby inside of me, and talks of marriage. I'm just not ready for all of that yet. 

Recently, he's been saying that I'm not talking to him very much. I try to talk to him at every moment I can, but he sees it as I'm not putting any effort into this ""relationship"". I know it's difficult with distance, and it's awful. He had posted to social media within the last 12 hours that ""he fucking hates his life"" and that these last three and a half years have nothing to show for. It hurts so much to hear these words. Also, it makes him sad to see how happy couples are, especially online.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I love him so much, but this has been so rocky lately that I don't even know what's right and wrong anymore. My friends and family all think I need to just get rid of him, but after 3 years together it's so difficult. "

**289,682** players building decks for **2** years!

In July of 2014, I was in an accident that resulted in a hospital stay of approximately five months, and the only thing that left the hospital with me, other than the metal in my femur, was my opiate and hearthstone addiction.  Unfortunately I was only able to kick one of those.  Hearthstone was one of things that kept me sane during those seemingly endless days stuck in a hospital bed, and that's why I've decided to feature the subreddit dedicated to it today.

From Blizzard's webpage:
&gt;Hearthstone is a free-to-play digital strategy card game that anyone can enjoy. Players choose one of nine epic Warcraft heroes to play as, and then take turns playing cards from their customizable decks to cast potent spells, use heroic weapons or abilities, or summon powerful characters to crush their opponent.

Hearthstone is a collectible card game much like Magic the Gathering, Yugioh, or Pokemon, and it has an ever growing player base.  The main advantage it has over the above mentioned games is that there is very little barrier to entry.  Anyone with a smart phone, tablet, or computer can download and start playing and monetary investment is completely optional.  What got me initially interested in Hearthstone, having not been too keen on collectible card games in the past, was actually watching [Totalbiscuit's](https://www.youtube.com/user/TotalHalibut/) videos on the series, and it all just kinda clicked from there.  I currently have two accounts, one is purely a free to play account, meaning I've spent no money on the game, and one where I've spent ~$100 on card packs and the adventures.  I find both accounts fun to play on, but the free to play one is much more challenging since I lack the “best” cards.

My personal favorite class is Paladin simply for the emotes, although I probably have the most wins with mage from playing arena and from when I was actually trying to reach the “legend” rank in the game.  It takes a certain kind of patients to climb the ranking ladder every month.

The subreddit is very interesting.  It can often [contain information in order to better yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1ua5c9/hearthstone_for_beginners_guide_and_resource/), [funny or lucky plays](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3iucsi/trolden_funny_and_lucky_moments_hearthstone_ep_126/), or can just be flooded with [silly jokes](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3h6v0g/seto_kaiba_plays_dr_boom_yugiohhearthstone/) or memes.  Also, it is a good source for discussion of upcoming content or [balance changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2tuv29/upcoming_balance_change_to_undertaker/) if you can tolerate some of the more immature behavior.  There also seems to be a lot of discussion, like any competitive game, of the prominent players, including both [popular streamers](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3ifvwo/kripp_got_legend/) and [eSports](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3izcmo/team_archons_official_statement_on_xixo_and_purple/) players.  Like most larger subreddits, it is what you make of it.  I enjoy the content it provides, and it has introduced me to many different streamers and personalities like Kripp, Day9, and Trolden that I wouldn't have known about before.  And it has helped me learn about the game and grow as a player immensely.

Now on to the interviews!

&gt;##1.  Tell us a little about yourselves.

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang** - Hey, I'm Meoang. Right now I'm a college student trying to finish up my degree in Computer Science. All of my work, and my school work, is online, so it really helps me stay focused on maintaining the sub without neglecting other responsibilities. I play tons of video games, especially Hearthstone, Diablo, and single player games like Elder Scrolls and Fallout.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - I'm old for a gamer (32) and a software development lead at a mid-size software company (~1000 employees). Been doing basic coding (at least HTML) since I was 10 and using AOL dialup, so I basically had my career path lined up since middle school. Throughout the entire time, I gamed, starting with FPS then moving on to RPGs once I discovered Final Fantasy VI.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - I was born in India, but moved to North America when I was 4. Ever since then, I was fond of playing card and board games, especially, and as I grew older, this transitioned into video games. I play the clarinet as a hobby, which I have been doing for 7 years now. Currently I am an engineering student in college, and so gaming is a fun way to step away from what is ~~sometimes~~ often rigorous and demanding.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - I’m scene_missing. I’m a system admin in Washington DC. I’ve been a Blizzard fan since the Warcraft 2 days.

&gt;##2.  What got you initially interested in Hearthstone? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang** - This is going to sound silly because everyone was going crazy for beta keys when the game first came out. I knew almost nothing about Hearthstone at the time, I just played a lot of other Blizzard games. One day I randomly checked my email and got a beta key invite to Hearthstone, so I looked into it and it seemed like a lot of fun. After playing it for a while, I asked around to see if I knew anyone else in the beta, and literally no one else I knew had gotten in. I've basically been playing the game since it became available in the closed beta just because I happened to get invited right away.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - Quite a few people at work played and I began watching it on Twitch. Looked interesting and was free, so fuck it, why not? Got hooked for a few months, but I play quite a bit less now that my time is absorbed by Final Fantasy XIV. I still watch it quite a lot, though, so I feel like I can pick it up again pretty easily... usually Kripp, Reynad, or Forsen.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - While Hearthstone was in closed beta, the game that I was most into was League of Legends. Aside from playing, I would often watch streams as well, and many of my favorite streamers (Scarra, Wingsofdeathx, Dyrus, etc.) would play this random card game during queues and breaks. I didn't tihnk much of it at the time, but as the open beta was drawing near, my friend brought it up to me and I decided to look it up and try it out. I haven't looked back since!

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - I had never gotten into Magic or any other TCG growing up, so I didn’t know much about the history of the genre. I put in for the closed beta because I had played a kazillion hours of WOW and Starcraft over the years, and just wanted to see what it was about. I got pretty much instantly hooked, and now play those other games and my consoles on the side.

&gt;##3.  How would you pitch Hearthstone to friend in order to convince them to play it?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang**  - It's like a card game where you don't have to keep track of your cards and you don't have to spend all your time figuring out rulings. Those are the most annoying parts of traditional card games to me, so it's like having a fun card game without the downsides.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - I really don't pitch it to anyone. If I were to, however, I would basically say it's a fun, free game you can play on your mobile device.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - A couple of my close classmates and friends have also been playing since the open beta began. I never really pitch Hearthstone to people, but I am guilty of often playing in class (even more so now that the phone version is out), and a lot of people who I was friends with would come and ask me what game I was playing. I would tell them what it was about and more often than not, they too would start playing.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - I’ve had a hard time convincing my friends to play actually - even the Warcraft addicted ones. My usual pitch is “It’s like Magic the Gathering, but more accessible and much more fun.”

&gt;##4. What is your favorite and/or least favorite card?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang**  - My favorite card has to be Kel'Thuzad. Like 80% of the reason I love him is because of what happens when you play him. He has the longest intro quote in the game, then he summons back all of your dead minions. I'd say 9 times out of 10 you win the game when you manage to pull him off, often with an instant concede. I crafted a golden one as soon as I possibly could, even though he only really works in one deck. My least favorite card is probably Mad Scientist. Way too much value, and secrets are annoying to play around in general.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - Love Deathwing. I put it in almost every deck as my unique spin and an additional win condition. Sometimes backfires, but whatever, it's for fun. Hate Flamestrike because I usually do arena... for obvious reasons.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - That's a tough one; there are a lot of fun and interesting cards in Hearthstone, but my favorite one is the humble SI:7 Agent. Coining one out on turn 2 to kill a 3/2 is one of my favorite plays in all of Hearthstone. The card I hate the most is Leper Gnome, because when your opponent begins a game with a Leper Gnome, you know it's just going to be going downhill from there.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - Most favorite - Looks like Kel'thuzad is already taken - so I’ll hype a few other ones. I love Malganis for some of the same reasons. Great effect, great sound design. Even better if you can cheese it out on turn 5 with a Voidcaller. Not going to lie - sometimes I say the lines along with the entrance. Least favorite - Alextraza. It’s a card that punishes you more for having more life. I always found that frustrating.

&gt;##5.  What is your favorite and/or least favorite class?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang**  - My favorite class will always be Druid for a couple of reasons. First of all, they're the best class to run Kel'Thuzad with, so it gets bonus points there. Second, Druid will always be relevant to the meta because of their ramp and Force of Nature/Savage Roar combo, so I don't have to worry about my class fading into obscurity. And the third reason is that there are 2-3 really strong Druid decks that are all a lot of fun to play, so the class never gets boring. I don't really have a least favorite class, but I almost never play Shaman.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - Love Warrior just because it's difficult to win with it in arena. I played it well before Patron Warrior was a thing, too, with my pay-to-play control deck. It seems to involve more thinking than a lot of other classes (especially since Math Warrior was introduced), and I dig that. I hate Hunter, again for obvious reasons.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - My favorite class is Rogue, with Warlock being a close second. Whenever I play RPGs, I always tend to pick the stealth/assassin classes and Rogue has that kind of playstyle in Hearthstone with its reliance on combos and burst. Warlock, with its Handlock archetype, relies on a high risk-high reward strategy as well, taking as much damage as you can to swing the game with huge turns. 

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - Least favorite - either Shaman or Rogue. Both are my classes with the fewest wins.

&gt;##6.  If you have any World of Warcraft experience, what type adventure (like Naxxaramus or Blackrock Mountain) would you like to see added to the game? If you don't have any World of Warcraft experience or in addition to, what card would like added to the game? Doesn't have to be specific.

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang** - I think the most iconic fight in World of Warcraft is Arthas, so I'd have to say Icecrown Citadel.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - My fondest memories of WoW are Black Temple in Burning Crusade, so probably that would be a cool adventure. With Legion coming out next year, it seems like it might be something that would crop up, too.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - I have never played WoW so I don't have any particular expansion, but I want to see more unique card draw mechanics. A draw engine is vital to any deck, and this is why there is a lot of variety in viable Warlock decks while other classes are relatively unplayable. Creating new, unique draw mechanics would bring a lot of new deck types into the game and give new options for theorycrafters.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - I was always jealous that Heroes of the Storm got to be cross world and Hearthstone didn’t. That’s what I really want - to open it up the Starcraft and Diablo worlds.

&gt;##7.  Your opponent draws a card for exact lethal, which card is it?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang**  - Warsong Commander.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - Pyroblast. Always.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - Not a single card, but I once lost to a Mech Mage who got King Krush from Unstable Portal and 4 +1 Attack Spare Parts from 2 Clockwork Gnomes and 2 Mechanical Yetis for a 1 in 1,109,262 exact lethal. I did the math right after the game to prove to myself that I did indeed have no way of playing around that. PJSalt

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - Sadly, it’s always Kill Command.

&gt;##8.  Anything else you'd like to add about /r/hearthstone or Hearthstone in general?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang** - If you're at all interested in card games, or even just Blizzard games, I highly recommend at least giving the game a download. It's a little intimidating at first, but if you learn the ropes (especially Arena) you'll have a respectable collection in no time. I know plenty of people that have tons of cards who never spent any money on the game. Collecting the cards is half the fun, and you'll constant be learning new things about the game on the way.

&gt;&gt;If you do play the game, or you're thinking about it, then come visit us at /r/hearthstone. Everyone is friendly here, we pretty strictly moderate low-quality content, and our relationship with Blizzard is great.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - /r/hearthstone is interesting because it's a delicate balance between curbing shitposts, and allowing entertaining content. So many things posted are subjective in how they're received, and we get a lot of flak because of that. It's not an easy job... which is why I stick to the CSS and bot instead and don't do much direct moderation.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - I love /r/Hearthstone and try my best to interact with the community and make it the best community in esports. I know sometimes both the game and the subreddit make you want to throw your computer out the window, but that's what makes gaming fun, right? My Battletag is ClarSoloist#1421 for anyone that wants to add me.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - Just that like all others, I’ve been really surprised to see how much it’s taken off. I never expected to see it in the top games on Twitch every night, or to see us closing in on 300K subs.

I've been able to survive off some savings and have yet to secure consistent employment. I've only participated in internships and come off way too strong during interviews. Lexapro 10 mg removes side effects from Adderall such as black under eyes and anxiety, but I seem to feel invincible and unrealtable most of the time. I thought I was using it to my advantage with the competition in graduate school, but I am starting to believe I have a distorted view of reality.  If I am truly bipolar, how would I be able to tell what a manic state is? When I remove the Lexapro and I'm solely on Adderall XR 20 mg, I am way too shaky and nervous to function. Just wanted to know if some of you had similar experiences, thank you!"
3jdoiz,55,2015-09-02,Just got back from PAX15 and got to play a lot of VR games for the first time.,randomawesome,oculus,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/3jdoiz/just_got_back_from_pax15_and_got_to_play_a_lot_of/,"My wife and I were able to score VIP passes from someone we know who works at Penny Arcade, so we were able to show up with the exhibitors and be first and second in the Oculus line 3 days in a row.  

**OCULUS**

*first impressions of what I'm assuming is CV1 or at least a close prototype* 

(All Oculus games were controlled with an Xbox One controller)

So like many who have no yet experienced VR, but have hyped it in their minds for decades, I had all kinds of ideas and hopes for what it would be like.  First things I noticed were the low resolution and limited FOV, which were a bit of a disappointment.  However, I think that's just your brain naturally and instinctively assessing the major differences between actual reality and VR... because after looking around the menu room for a few seconds, the scale and dimension of VR started to draw me into the experience.

**Edge of Nowhere**

We coincidentally both ended up picking Edge of Nowhere as our first VR experience.  For those who don't know about the game, it's an Insomniac Games developed title that has an Uncharted vibe but leans towards the horror end of things.

At first I didn't realize it was a third person game, because I was looking around for the first mine, just enjoying the sense of scale and immersion.  I was leaning in, checking out the detail of the guy in front of me, fully unaware it was the character I was about to control, haha.  

Not a whole lot to say about the gameplay - very simple, jump to this ledge, run across that collapsing bridge, etc.  the simplicity allows you to absorb the atmosphere properly, and I appreciate that design choice.

Visuals were stunning.  Simple geometry, smooth animations, great sense of scale... I think that is my biggest takeaway of VR - the sense of scale is incredible.  The ability to look around an environment and feed your brain all this data about what surrounds you in the digital world really starts to convince you that you are inside a video game.  It's an incredible experience, much like when we got radio for the first time or television for the first time; this is a breakthrough in experiencing something unlike anything else.

Anyhow, back to Edge of Nowhere.  There was this moment where I was walking my character through an ice cave, marveling at the formations above and beside me, when I spotted a corpse frozen into the lower part of the wall - I was waking forward but looking to the side and back at him, and that was probably my first real sense of ""presence"".  Such a rad feeling that is hard to describe, other than it felt like my brain was telling me that this place was real for a brief moment.

Later on in the demo, there was a moment where you are descending down this cavern on a rope.  I keep going back to the sense of scale, but it was just amazing - looking up, looking down, and getting that feeling in your stomach is just such a rush that no other means of entertainment can even come close to providing.

Towards the end, you are running away from these dark spider-like alien creatures, and the ability to actually turn around and see them chasing you is beyond cool.  Catching a glimpse of something chasing you out of the corner of your eye just triggers this natural human reaction of fear, I can't imagine the kinds of horror experiences that could be made.

In the end of the demo, you wind up in a library and you hear this voice whispering in your ear ""you shouldn't be here!"" as these tentacles wrap around you from behind.  That was an amazing way to end the demo.

Speaking of sound, everything sounded really good, but it was at a loud convention center, and the built in headphones do no block sound whatsoever.  I can imagine that once people have Rifts in their home, the quality of sound will be much more apparent.

After my first taste of VR, I was dying for another, so we both got in line the next day.

**Eve Valkyrie**

After playing a third person VR game, both of us wanted to experience something first person, so again, we both picked Eve Valkyrie (yup, we're one of those annoying couples who finishes each other's sentences).

Neither of us are big on space shooters from the cockpit perspective, but both of us agreed that we would play the shit out of Eve Valkyrie.   Not so much about the gameplay, of course, but the immersion factor.  Looking down and seeing your legs, arms, shoulders, is just really cool and also bizarre at the same time.  The extra cool thing was leaning over to the left and right and seeing your shoulders and torso moving accordingly... Erie!

Again, looking around your ship and seeing all the close detail juxtaposed with all of the massive ships in the distance is a feeling you can only convey with VR.  

One of the moments that gave me a sense of presence was turning around and looking out the rear window, but having to lean to the side in order to look past the headrest of my seat... That felt natural and real.

**Chronos**

On the third day of Oculus, my wife and I made the conscious decision to play different games.  We made mental notes of the menus last time, so I was going to play Chronos, and she was going to play Esper.

Chronos might be my favorite VR game of all the ones I tried.  It's made by the team who did Darksiders, but it feels very much like a Team Ico game (muted palette, feelings of desolation, similar sense of light and dark).

This is another game that controls from the third-person, but unlike Edge of Nowhere, the camera is fixed (but you can lean and look around).

It kinda plays like what you would expect if Team Ico made a Zelda game.  Scale, scale, scale... There is a moment where this massive creature (probably 20 feet tall, which might not sound crazy, but when it *feels* real, it's an awe-inspiring sight), walks towards you and tried to stomp on you... Such a crazy rush!

**Esper**

I'll briefly try to describe this one from what she's told me about it.

You're sitting at an office table and solving special puzzles with a snarky narrator (think Stanley Parable or Portal style humor).  You use your head to look and and move balls through these clear tubes, which she said was very intuitive.  Solving puzzles in VR works very well, especially leaning around and observing the puzzle at different angles.  The only negative she mentioned was that the chair she was sitting in would turn when she looked around, but there was no body in it, like she was floating in the chair.  Probably something they would add later, but it's interesting how the lack of an avatar in first person games can be unsettling.

**Lucky's Tale**

This might have been my favorite, definitely my wife's favorite title.  This demo was on the 6th floor, and the line was pretty modest, so an average 20-30 min wait for most.  Needless to say, we came back and played it multiple times.

The best feeling I can describe this game is like when I was a kid playing Mario 64 for the first time.  I had never played a 3D game before, so it was such an amazing experience that changed the way you looked at platformers forever.  Lucky's Tale is looking to do that same thing.

Platforming in VR just feels ridiculously good.  Again, the sense of space and scale helps tremendously with the gameplay of platforming.  If you've ever played Mario 3D Land on 3DS and enjoyed how a sense of 3D helps with platforming, then you have a teeny, tiny grasp of what this game does.  Platforming will see a rebirth in the VR world, just as it did when Mario 64 hit the scene.  If any of you here are old enough to remember and appreciate the gigantic leap Mario 64 was, you have a good idea of the feeling I'm trying to describe.

I also got to talk to the CEO of the dev team, and he was an absolute joy to converse with - smiling from ear to ear the entire time, it's obvious that these people are passionate about their games and about VR.

I should point out that Lucky's Tale was running on Crescent Bay, which my wife felt was clearer than CV1.  I also noticed it, but she seemed to notice it more.   She also wears glasses (near sighted), so that could have been a factor.  Another factor is that the Oculus booth was run by a bunch of fresh out of high school interns, and Lucky's Tale was run by the actual dev team.  Calibration and proper maintenance could have been another factor.

**MORPHEUS**

I got the chance to play a Morpheus game called Wayward Sky.  This is another 3rd person game, but with a more cartoony, almost clay-like art style that worked very well in VR.

It's kinda like a point and click platforming puzzle stealth game... Very creative.  You used a Move controller to interact, which was great for the pointing and clicking, but it was very awkward for turning valves and twisting puzzle pieces.  I'm sure that isn't the fault of the controller, but the software design.

The Morpheus and Oculus/Crescent Bay all felt pretty comparable to me, so like most things hardware related in the games industry, it's all about the software.

**HTC Vive**

The lines were pretty ridiculous for this one at PAX, and I know someone who works at Valve, so I decided to skip the Vive in hopes that I could get a Vive demo at the Valve office.... But when I got there, all of their VR gear was still at PAX... :(  at least I got to hold the new Steam controller and see the working Portal turrets, haha.  But seriously, the Valve tour was rad.... Just bummed I didn't get a Vive demo.

**[closing thoughts]**

VR is absolutely the next big thing in gaming.  EVERYONE will want one once they've experienced it, but that is the major challenge that lies ahead - how do we educate the masses about VR?  Kiosks seem like the best way.  Like one of the guys at Lucky's Tale said, you can imagine it and describe it to everyone, but you just come across as crazy and hyperbolic.  You just have to experience it.

The best way I can describe VR gaming vs TV gaming is like being there in person vs watching it on TV.  For the first time in the history of entertainment, you can now experience it INSIDE, rather than outside.  I'm a day one purchaser of all 3 headsets.

PS I should note that neither my wife or I experienced any dizziness or motion sickness at all.  We both have 3DS consoles, and we both like using the 3D, but it kinda gives you this weird headache, like you crossed your eyes or something.  VR is totally comfortable on the eyes.  We were standing in line with a girl who was very concerned about trying VR, because she said she was very susceptible to motion sickest, but she ended up being totally fine and having a blast.

I can see people getting addicted to this, because I'm seriously craving my next VR fix. "
3je97r,15,2015-09-02,"Me [19 F] with my boyfriend [21 M], he hasn't had a steady job and isn't going to school, I am starting to fall out of love with him, what can I do?",NotAGamerFanAnymore,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3je97r/me_19_f_with_my_boyfriend_21_m_he_hasnt_had_a/,"i apologize in advanced for the long post.  

My boyfriend and I met in my senior year of high school. During this time I already had an internship working for an lng company and was set to graduate with my diploma and associates degree. He was upgrading some of his high school courses because he did really bad in HS and was planning to become an apprentice under the company his father worked for.

I have always been involved in multiple organizations at a time since I enjoy being busy and am very career oriented. Meanwhile, his hobby is gaming. I thought this was great in the beginning because I was always interested in the culture and was attracted to his geekiness. I believed our compatibility thrived in the sense that he could ease my stress and keep me calmed when I had a billion things going on.

He ended up quitting the upgrading because he was going to start being an apprentice- that never happened. His father couldn’t pull through and eventually just told him to find his own way. He tried going back next semester, but quit yet again because it “bored him”. Fast forward to now and he’s in the same position I met him two years ago. He has not gotten his license yet, either. Since he lives with his grandfather and doesn’t work or go to school, he has no need to get around. He kept putting if off because he needed to read the drivers manual. Each time I’ve brought it up he claims to have been reading it and he’ll take the test “next week”. Again, same things I’ve heard for two years.

I can feel my love for him starting to diminish quite rapidly because of this. Everything about his lack of ambition bothers me. Before I used to get excited and interested in his stories of a siege, or funny things that happened while playing a game, now all I feel is annoyance. I feel he could be doing much better things with his life instead of gaming.

A few months ago he finally got a job at McDonalds. I was glad he was at least getting out of the house and maintaining a somewhat proper sleeping schedule since most days he goes to sleep at 8 am and wakes up at 3-4pm because he games all night. I started voicing my displeasure more vocally and we had a really rough time. He ended up quitting because claiming he was too sad to keep working.

I don’t even know what to do anymore. I will be graduating with a double major in two years, have many leadership positions under my belt, and am still working at the company I interned for, since they hired me on after it ended. I have tried to help him get a job the best I can. I’ve written his resume, researched job positions, schools, programs, etc. Yet nothing seems to work. I feel that he is content just gaming all night and sleeping all day.

He has tried arguing with me that he does want to change, but none of his actions prove that to be true. Each time he starts anything he quits because he is sad, bored, or just doesn’t feel like it. His parents have been going through divorce and I believe he is depressed. Each time we have a serious issue or something goes wrong he says things like, “I should go run onto a highway,” or “I should just grab a gun and end it.” I have explained many times how I hate when he says things like that and all he says is that he doesn’t mean it and he will stop. He hasn’t. This is not the type of partner I want to be with. I love everything else about him, just not his work ethic and career motivation. These are both things I value very highly.

I don’t know how to help him, and I don’t think I can. I have suggested he go to therapy, but he can’t even schedule a doctor’s appointment when he’s sick.

I guess I just want to know how long I should keep waiting until he figures himself out. I hate ultimatums so I don’t want to issue a, “Either you start going to school and get a job or we’re over.” Plus, I want him to do this for himself, not for me. I want to know that he can be driven and stay strong even if I’m not there to support him. I feel bad for even wanting him to change. If I really loved him should I even feel like he should change? Sometimes I feel that I’m just being too mean to him, but I will not be his mother. I shouldn’t have to pressure him to do things that I feel he should already be doing on his own accord. What can I do?

**tl;dr**
Gamer boyfriend hasn’t had a steady job or gone to school for two years, it’s making me fall out of love with him. How long should I wait until he changes or should I just leave now?"

I am the first engineering major from my family, though, so I know little about the schooling involved and what to expect after receiving a PhD. So I have a few questions:

1. Would a PhD in electrical engineering limit my job options because employers would think I would be to expensive to hire? 

2. How hard is it to get into the graduate program here?

3. How should I expect to afford the tuition? I've heard that your research advisor pays it in exchange for your research efforts- is that true?

4. Would it be ok to do an internship in industry for the summer of 2016 or would it be better to focus on research to increase my chances of getting admitted?

I would also appreciate it if anyone could provide any additional insight on this matter. Thank you!

I'm trying to jumpstart my carreer but it is getting hard to keep it together.,ImSoFreakingLost,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/3jfga4/gradschool_dropout_just_got_rejected_for_a_job/,"Hi!

My life has been rough since 2012 when I fucked up in grad school by not passing the qualifying exam. I was so lost that I never finished my thesis and left without even a masters degree. Since then I've been keeping myself afloat tutoring and working various jobs. I still have my BS in physics and I'm very strong in math. 

For maybe the last year or so I've been looking to get a developer job and have focused on python/data science. I've actually been coding since I was 16 and am developing my own video game on the side in C++. I'm also currently doing several projects for a local startup but it isn't paid. I want to call it an ""internship"" but I'm teachin myself everything. For python, I specialize in a statistics tech stack so numpy, sci-kit learn, pandas, theano, etc. etc. I'm no CS major but I learn quickly, I can problem solve, and I have analytics skills. 

Last week I went for a job interview with Deloitte and got rejected pretty quickly. And now this week I'm finding my hours for my tutoring job aren't being restored for the school year. They were cut all summer and it was very hard to make ends meet. I've had to move in with my aunt and cousin and living with them is very challenging as they are very demanding and are constantly yelling at me. It is really hard to keep it together and I feel like I'm on my last legs. 

I don't need money or a handout. I just need some help or advice with getting my carreer on track.  If you know of any job leads or advice on getting a junior python, c++ developer, or data analyst position please send them my way. 

Also general career advice is also very welcome. I know that I really need some SQL experience and that is something I'm working on. As well as more sideprojects, hackathons, and kaggles. I'm also networking in the DC area. I hear the jobs are out there but I'm kind of lost with this kind of thing. In particular because I was in academia so long.

3jfldy,2,2015-09-02,"I have never been on the same level as my peers, and I don't think I ever will be",beingleftbehind,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3jfldy/i_have_never_been_on_the_same_level_as_my_peers/,"I have never fit in.

In second grade, when the concept of ""popularity"" began to emerge, I did everything the popular kids did. I wasn't self-conscious or socially anxious like I am now, but something intangible marked me as ""different."" This pattern repeated itself over the years; I tried to be friendly and sociable with different groups of people, but I was never completely accepted. I was always the third (or fourth, fifth, etc.) wheel. Although I had friends, I never felt like I had much in common with most of them. While we could enjoy our time together, I neither shared many hobbies with them nor felt like I could trust them enough to talk about my personal struggles, of which the most critical was being a closeted transgender man.

I thought transitioning would fix my feelings of alienation. After all, I had been clearly gender nonconforming since elementary school, and that's enough to make you ""one of the weird kids"" in the rural area I grew up in. On paper I am successful now. The college I attend is one of the best in the world for my major, and I'm maintaining an A- average. I have made a best friend, who I have more in common with than anyone I've ever met. Although I don't party every night, I have a relatively active social life. However, I still feel behind the rest of the student body.

It seems like everyone around me is more confident, more prepared for life, and much better at being social. Even though nobody perceives me as female anymore, I have to deal with physical insecurities that would be tough for any man: I am significantly shorter than average, and I basically have a micropenis. While plenty of people around me are either dating traditionally, using Tinder, or hooking up through parties, I am close to turning twenty and have never had my first kiss. Romantically and socially, I feel stunted at sixteen. This feeling isn't helped by the fact that the culture at my college is more competitive and ambitious than I am used to. My classmates are pursuing prestigious internships and ""networking"" and preparing resumes; I don't even know where to start with that, and I lack the type-A personality (which is really common at my school) to really desire it anyway. I feel like everyone around me has far surpassed me in professional, social, and emotional development. Other students might as well be from another planet, I am so divorced from how normal people live and socialize. I literally don't know how normal people spend their time or what they like talking about. I know it's not being on the Internet nearly every spare moment of free time, which has been my lifestyle since sixth grade. At this point I think I'm too far gone and missed out on too many experiences to really fit in with anyone, and I wonder if I'll ever be able to trust someone enough to not die with my virginity intact.

tl;dr: I thought being transgender made me the ""weird kid""; came to college where nobody knows and I'm still the weird kid, don't know what to do about it. "

I'm a good-looking but somewhat shy atheist with ADHD and I'm always striving to improve myself,[deleted],Kikpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kikpals/comments/3jfp39/22_m4f_looking_for_a_friend_and_eventually_more/,"I'll admit that I feel very different from other people. Not just because I have ADHD, but I'm also an atheist and I don't drink or go out like a lot of other college kids here in the US. However, I am very genuine and a pretty interesting person (if I do say so myself :P) once you get to know me. I have 3 semesters left in college, majoring in Computer Science. I've also worked as a software development intern. I can be kind of nerdy when it comes to computers (and I spend a decent amount of of time playing and watching CS:GO), but I'm definitely not the stereotypical nerd. I'm always seeking to improve myself in regards to health, personality, how I dress, etc. and I don't fit the typical nerd mold. If you're interested feel free to PM me your kik username. I'm looking to get to know each other first, followed by getting more intimate, so 18 and older only please!

I've also been getting some questions about how I look. I'm 6'3"", thin but not skinny (also trying to put on more muscle), brown hair that I style and green eyes. Also, I am quite well endowed if you care about that, but I'd prefer to get to know each other before getting into the dirty stuff. Looking forward to hearing from you!"
3jfs3v,29,2015-09-02,"Need $400 for rent or else I will be kicked out. Whether or not you help, thanks for good vibes.",hMJem,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/3jfs3v/need_400_for_rent_or_else_i_will_be_kicked_out/,"So, I guess this begins a story.

Ran into financial problems living away from home, so now I live with my mom and step dad. 

Part of the deal was, I need to get a job. Which is fine, I have a career I'm pursuing -- writing. I write for a website associated with Sports Illustrated (Essentially an intern, unpaid) I wrote an article for The Cauldron of the Medium publication, a gaming website (with a revenue sharing program)and another website is going to pay me $20 an article.

What is the problem? I have nothing right now, and they want payment. They understand what my career choice is, but they have an old school view of what ""work"" is. I worked part time at Walmart just to try to suffice for them, but I have a terrible back. And they know this. But it's like I still had to because pursuing a career while unpaid at the time is apparently not good enough even if I was essentially acting like an intern, AKA still putting in work, not just sitting around doing nothing. I've had a crooked spine my whole life, scholiosis. If you run your hand down my spine, it's ridiculous crooked. I can't remember a day without back pain. I probably have bulging discs, I am unsure of how to describe the pain in my lower back. I've gotten used to the everyday pains, which is why at home jobs serve me a lot better. I can write on my laptop from the couch or take a lot of breaks when my back is aching, which it does from the most simple tasks.

What hurts the most is that I'm FINALLY starting to make tread in what I want to make my career. It seems like my emails semi-flooded the moment I was hitting rock bottom. Let me explain.

I worked part time at Walmart for a month, I didn't want to because I knew my back would be even worse than before, but I was pressured to. They wanted me to do a ""real job"" besides my writing I was building towards. However, besides the extreme back pains and being let go a few days ago, it was terrible. I had no time to write. Work 8 hours, get home, sleep stress for 12-14 hours until I had to work again because I was depressed, stressed, and hurting. Everyday I went in, it was a living hell. I believe I have depression problems that I've encountered throughout my life, and working at Walmart just made it even worse. To answer what may be a question: I had to move back here because of financial problems. So the small $$ I earned part time from Walmart instantly got funneled into paying off those serious debts chasing me.

The website associated with Sports Illustrated, 12thManRising of FanSided has been cutting down members. There used to be 10+ and now there are only 8 as the Football season approaches, the most important season for me as a writer. I had no time to write. It was making me anxious I would be next. I wanted to cry because even though that one was unpaid, it was my most valuable one because of its connection to Sports Illustrated.

Now we go back a couple weeks ago, and I'm at my breaking point. I contemplated running away from home. I packed my bag and was ready to leave, and my Mom asked me what was wrong. I told her everything while crying. I said I can't do the normal type job thing you guys want me to do. And I said if you guys can't support my career choice I'll just be homeless. My mom begged me to stay. The problem is my Step Dad. He has a real old school mentality to work. Where you're supposed to hate yourself when working. He's the guy who always jokes about work sucking. I don't know if he takes my back troubles seriously. However, I don't have insurance and I'm dirt poor and it's just something I've had to deal with my whole life. The everyday pains I've gotten used to, but they are still a hinderance.

The pay isn't going to be great for my writing, but it's a start. It's something to build upon. I FINALLY have gotten more opportunities. It felt insane that I was getting 5-7 replies in my email right after I had what I considered the worst day ever where I nearly ran away from stress/depression/feeling like no one is supporting my career choices. It'll bring me a far better career than just working retail or fast food could provide me and my body can't hold up with that. My Mom realizes that after I vented to her, but my Step Dad is incredibly hard to talk to and always has been. However, I don't start either of those two places for another week. And the $20 per article place mails a check a month after it was published. So my plan is to get a whole months worth of work there mailed in one check a month after the last one, so I'm more like 1.5 months away from getting paid for that when I start. The $400 would suffice for that time gap successfully while I even try to chase more paid opportunities like I mentioned. I lurk all the job boards/etc everyday for hours at morning and night.

Because my Mom doesn't work anymore (Her back is the reason) she doesn't have power to keep me in the house. Step Dad is the money maker of the house. It's very simple -- I get the money for my Step Dad, or I'm gone. And if I'm gone, unfortunately, that means being homeless. I don't have anywhere else to turn to. And obviously that scares me and hurts me because I feel like I'm FINALLY making strides in the writing game and now all of this is put on me. I just feel helpless. I finally am getting a break in writing and then I might have to throw it all away if I have nowhere to go. I don't WANT to go.

So, the $400 would be to give to my Step Dad so I can still have a roof over my head while I begin my first paid adventures of writing where I can then pay it myself. It still won't be a lot, but again it is a start. $20 per article for one place, and $1 per 1000 views for another and I'm still looking up the job boards and emailing people everyday for multiple hours and reaching out. So I write for 3 places total now, 1 unpaid (But the best opportunity for future awesome jobs) and 2 paid, but not a ton. The problem is, I don't know the exact amount of $$ I'd be totaling from these two opportunities, and even after explaining that I will be earning some money, he's just hard headed and wants something tangible now that I can't provide. 

The money I earn from writing would be used to give to my Mom and Step Dad as rent in the future until I get something good enough to move out again.

If you don't want to believe my story, that's fine. I'm really not in the mood for people to debate how much they believe me. If you're feeling generous, it means the world to me and I can share my paypal. If you just want to send good vibes, I appreciate that too. I understand how tough it is financially for so many, so I'm not going to say my situation is any more deserving than others. I would just go on to say I would be so thankful, more than I can express if someone was in position and feeling nice.

3jg9mr,3,2015-09-03,idle hands...my first post so be gentle,R_RedLightSpecial,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/3jg9mr/idle_handsmy_first_post_so_be_gentle/,"One hot and sexy affair gone astray. I had been gone for maybe two years and fully committed to my new relationship, finally convinced him to trust me to go away for the entire summer for an internship back in my hometown four states away. I couldn’t have predicted that he would choose to cheat while I was away and the psycho chick would out him to me. Angrily moving forward four states away I decided to play with fire and reached out to my ex C. C and I have such a rocky past that I didn’t know whether or not he would even respond to my call, but there was a time when I was younger when we were in love and I don’t think I ever stopped. To my surprise he did. My curiosity was peaked. I started to think of all of our crazy adventures and how he used to please me and it had always bothered me that I never managed to have an orgasm with him when we were together. I was young then and struggled to release my control over my body back then. 
One Idle day at work I texted him and told him I was starting over and wanted something with him but didn’t know how to ask. That I wanted to make myself happy with no rules or boundaries and wondered if he would be interested in helping me get happy. He got frustrated with me talking around what I actually wanted and C protested I tell him what I wanted. I asked if he would consider us having sex just for kicks since I was in town. He pondered on the thought and was hesitant to say yes. He told me if I wanted him to go to the bathroom and touch myself and send him pictures and with great anticipation I calmly left my desk to do so. He was surprised I was so down to do whatever. He began to sext me sending me pictures and messages about what he wanted to do, how he wanted to be inside me. I was sitting around maybe 4 other interns trying not to appear flustered as I read and responded to his texts soaking wet now.
He insisted I come to him right then but I had work and he had things to do by the time I got off. My lust would have to wait. The next day we met up at night and I got in his car and we drove over to a remote neighborhood. Instead of jumping on each other though we just caught up on what we had missed while the other was away, his hand touched mine an suddenly our normal chit chat about life and drama drifted away I wanted his hands were all over me. I grew antsy I did my best guide his attention away from our conversation over towards sex. I played with his fingers intertwining them with my own, never breaking my gaze. I wanted to tease him and taste his skin, I gently placed his index finger in my mouth to taste it while I slowly let him pull it out. He groaned then stumbled to finish his sentence. He put it back in once more an I moaned a little and started to kiss his hand some once he took it out looking up at him with my big ""play with me"" eyes. 
""You want me to touch you?"" C said teasing me while leaning in closer to my side of the car near my ear. My body didn’t know how to act his breath on my ear made me hot and surge with excitement all I could do is nod yes. Driving his hand between my thighs he pulled my legs up to touch me. Hard and steady he rubbed my clit through my shorts back and forth making me so wet. He paused momentarily to squeeze my thighs, I let out a soft moan. I reach down to guide his hand and without much warning he leans over to kiss me gripping my ass with his free hand pulling me in closer. His lips were so soft and firm against mine it was all making me so hot, I felt my nipples start to get hard. In heat now I start to strip down, he grabs my hands before I can do so and starts to undress me starting with my shirt and bra. Stopping to gaze at my breasts for a moment (I love it when he stares at me) he latched on to my left breast with his mouth licking my nipple and sucking as he gripped the other. I moaned and squirmed loudly as he teased me, then moved over to the right breast as I my head tilted back as I moaned. He removed my shorts and before I could assist to get my lace thong off his thumb found my clit and went back to massaging it, feeling how soaking wet I was he moved them to the side. With his index finger he stroked my pussy and then put his finger in his mouth to taste it, ""she’s so sweet, I wanna taste it"" C said while his eyes looked me up and down
""Come here."" He commanded. Without hesitation I shifted out of seat and placed my ass on the console between us and laid back. As i lifted my ass for him to remove my thong I wrapped his head with my legs and rested my weight on his shoulders, His left arm supporting me up high enough by gripping my ass underneath. With a warm wet kiss on my clit he began, sucking and teasing me with his tongue in circles. My head now upside down while my body jolting with pleasure I can’t help but go back to moaning, I missed this while I was away. C begins to move more slowly feeling my juices leak down he goes lower to lick up and down and stick his tongue in and out of my pussy. I couldn’t take it anymore I need him fully inside of me. Seconds later the little waves of pleasure start to overwhelm me and I came with a load ""Yes!"" He lowers me down after kissing my thighs and now it’s my turn to show off.
C and I haven't hooked up in maybe over a year, I've gotten older and my head game has gotten sharper and I want pull out all my tricks tonight on his dick and show him just what he's been missing. I jump back eagerly in my seat and pounce into an upright position, crawling my way to his side of the car I start to passionately kiss him but it’s not his mouth I’m wanting for so I maneuver with kisses over to his ear. Licking and sucking on his left ear lobe, I whisper ""Baby I want to taste you now, will you take it out for me?"" After saying which I stuck my tongue in his ear and I moaned softly. I could feel him tensing up. Without words he takes his right hand and places it on his bulging and now very hard dick. As he undoes his jeans I continue to play with his ear with my tongue, stopping only to give kisses and work my way from his ear to his neck. Tracing my tongue in circles up and down and then kissing and sucking hard on his neck his body started to jolt. I giggled getting the reaction I wanted, as he takes out and reveals his dick I work my way down and put the entire thing in my mouth all the way down to the balls. 
Sucking up and down I let him go super deep so as to make my mouth water and produce a lot of lubrication, as he with his left hand starts playing with my soaking wet pussy. I want to make this as sloppy and wet as possible. Working my way back up I start to play with the tip of his dick, kissing and sucking on it pausing only to flick it lightly back and forth with my tongue. Moaning the entire time, I couldn’t help myself it somehow I'm getting pleasure too from his warm hard dick going inside and around my mouth. I take it out to rub the tip on my lips back and forth gazing up at him, and start to work my way down his length kissing and licking anything I've missed. I come back up and start sucking hard and fast and feel his hands in my hair encouraging me to really go for it making more and more saliva come out of my mouth, I hear him groaning in pleasure in the background. I stop to work my way down to show his balls some attention and place one than the other in my mouth carefully and then start to play with them with my tongue. 
""Damn Rose, now your just showing off!"" he exclaimed I giggled and I told him quickly I was ready and wanted him inside me. After quick deliberation and maneuvering I moved over to his seat with his help to mount him. Now before all this he told me he wanted to go slow and be romantic lots of eye contact and passionate kisses, but as he slid his now soaking wet hard shaft into my pussy all that went out the window. I slid him in coming down slowly at first and started to bounce up and down with increasing speed. God I missed this dick. It was hitting all the right spots and I was leaking and cumming more quickly than ever before. He started to suck on one of my breasts and I stopped bouncing up and down and begin to concentrate on my hips moving back and forth and bouncing just my ass. He reached up to grab the back of my neck and with him inside of me I stopped to kiss him an say ""sorry baby, I could help myself""
He laughed saying ""somebody missed me"" and asked me to move to the back seat. Out of habit I crawled to the back seat and assumed the doggy position so he could hit it from behind. He popped out and ran to jump in the back seat. An after spitting on it a little bit slid back inside me. Automatically my back arched and I start to throw it back on him calling out yes each time he hits my spot. With his hands he did everything from grip my breasts as they bounced, to grip my neck and play with my clit. As I start to speed up his steady circles with his thumb on my clit make me start to leak all over and moan louder I was about to have an orgasm and cum and my body clenched up an I stopped thrusting. Without much warning he suddenly became aggressive and dominant using his free hand he put his index finger in my mouth commanding me to ""Cum right now for daddy"" gripping my ass hard while fucking me fast it was so fucking hot. As he thrust quickly pounding at my g-spot with a slight scream I came just when he commanded me to. 
Still not moving from pleasure he slid out of me and flipped me over ""Now it’s my turn to cum."" He said I didn't know where all this aggression was coming from but it was turning me on so much. He separated my legs and pulled me closer to him and slid inside of me and returned to the fast pace he was just previously doing. I told him to talk dirty for me and I started to play with my own clit. Looking up at him he looked so hot watching him go in and out of me covered in sweat, ""yes baby, rub on that little clit for me be my little freak...I want you to cum again on this dick"" and with that my hand motions sped up and he followed suit. My body started to spasm a bit with pleasure as I squealed and squirted onto him. I thought for sure I was done and as I relaxed from the intense moment he said ""No baby I’m not done fucking you, cum some more!"" With one hand he lifted my leg back in the air, and with the other his thumb found my clit moving in fast little circles while he trusted hard. Surprised and turned on I moaned and squirmed and with his command to once again ""Cum for me Rose"" my body jolted and I for the second time squirted on him and went numb with pleasure and he came inside of me with a load groan. With him still inside of me I pulled him down to kiss me and to hold me. Seconds later C said ""Sorry Rose that aggression wasn't aimed towards you, just haven't been inside you in a very long time."" I laughed and admitted I loved every second of it. For a long time we just laid there with him on top of me and inside of me, and that was just round one…

**Central New York, Second Mid Atlantic Republic**

**Chris Huntman**

**7:54 PM**

As the government cautiously waited for the right time to attack the Amish Mafia without Lucy Haas getting hurt, one intern decided to take things into his own hands. Chris Huntman. He drove through an outer neighborhood in Syracuse, looking for someone who could help him track down the location of the Amish base. Someone that he knew from his days as a journalist before joining the government to work with Brendan Durant.

He slowed down and stopped the SUV when he saw two men wearing cargo pants, blue shirts, and blue bandanas. ""Do you two know Cookie, by any chance?"" asked Chris, rolling down the window.

The two exchanged a look before turning to Chris. ""Who are you? Where you from?"" asked the first of the two Crips. 

Chris replied by throwing up a Rollin 20's gang sign that he hoped was accurate. If it wasn't, it may cost him his life. ""I know him, there's some stuff I need to ask him.""

The men seemed to think the gang sign checked out, so they climbed into the back of the SUV and started giving directions. Chris followed closely and ended up driving through one of the more worn down neighborhoods and arriving at a large modern looking house that stood on its own in a neighborhood that mostly had beat up townhouses. ""Cookie stays here when he's in town,"" explained one of the men. ""He might be away.""

Chris shrugged and parked in the driveway, climbing out and going up the steps. There was a sign that said ""INTRUDERS WILL BE SHOT"", and showed a stick figure getting its head blown off with a shotgun. Not very comforting. But what had to be done had to be done, Chris swallowed his nervousness and knocked on the door, hoping his old contact recognized him. 

For a few seconds nobody came to the door, but someone finally opened up, a athletic looking dark skinned man wearing a Steelers jersey. He was the gangster known as Cookie, the one who had helped Chris out by giving him stories when he was new to journalism. Chris had gotten his start covering a gang war between the Crips and the Latin Kings, and his successful journalism there had launched him into a position covering the New England war. Now at 23 all his journalism had gotten him noticed by the government, which is how he got this job.

""Chris, is that really you?"" asked Cookie. ""I haven't seen you since you was... In high school?""

""We met during my junior year,"" nodded Chris. ""I came here to ask some questions about what's going on with Lucy Haas and the Amish.""

""Funny that you ask, me and some homies were just about to go hit up an Amish guy to see what he knows,"" said Cookie. ""You coming?""

""I guess I should,"" replied Chris, as four men walked out of the side door carrying automatic weapons. They took these to a blue Hummer, a new 2038 model, and put them in the trunk. ""But what do the Amish want with Haas?""

""Well as you know, she was one of us, even though she was from a Miami set,"" explained Cookie. ""We may have had a bit of a beef with the Amish Mafia... This is revenge.""

Chris sighed, knowing the Vice Premier would be in more danger if some gangsters showed up to save her. But this was the only way, the longer they waited, the harder it would get to track them down. 

_________


The drive was decently long, all the way out to Oneida, but Cookie stopped the Hummer on one street that had only a few houses and motioned for everyone to get out. ""There's guns in the back,"" he said, and Chris grabbed a shotgun while others grabbed rifles. 

""Where's the guy we're looking for?"" asked Chris, checking the safety on his shotgun.

""Down the street,"" said Cookie. ""He's Mafia, maybe in their upper ranks, tread carefully.""

The group advanced to the house and found that the door was locked. ""Just my luck,"" muttered Chris. As the newcomer, they wanted him to be the one to climb in through the window and let them in. 

The window was pretty heavy but with the strength of six, they were able to get it open, and two gangsters lifted Chris up and let him crawl inside. He was in, but he wasn't alone. There were footsteps in the next room over.

Cursing his luck under his breath, Chris flipped off the safety and moved slowly through the hallway, which was about as confusing as a maze. And he heard footsteps creeping behind him.

Chris spun around and fired a wild shotgun shot, and he heard a scream. He had just shot an Amish man through the chest, and now everyone knew he was here. Granted, the man had been about to sink a cavalry sword into his side, but that wasn't the best move.

As fast as he could, Chris ran to the front door and fumbled with the lock, letting the others in. There were more footsteps from upstairs and they seemed to be heading down the steps. ""How many of them are there?""

""I think we found the Mafia HQ,"" replied one of the gangsters. A firefight broke out between Crips and Amish who were coming in from another room and Chris ducked under a table, hoping he wasn't noticed by the enemies or hit in the crossfire. 

As quickly as the firefight started, it seemed to be over. There was only one Amish left standing, probably because of their outdated guns, and he was the one they were looking for.

""Take us to Lucy Haas,"" demanded Cookie, pressing his assault rifle against the man's chest.

""She's not here,"" the man replied simply. 

""Where is she then?"" asked Chris, coming from under the table.

""She's on her way to Virginia as we speak,"" the Amish man said finally, before giving an address.

""We've got what we need, let's move out,"" said Cookie. ""And remember, we know where you live and we'll be back if you're lying.""

Chris gave a sigh of relief as he'd managed to get out without getting killed by crazy Amish mobsters. Now for the harder part. Getting Lucy Haas away from them.

They're using every pushback: lack of training (because office suites are so hard to use), financial windfalls (it's too expensive to switch! It isn't), security concerns (of which it's simply not their department, and we've vetted every option) and finally after we conquer all that, I swear a realistic argument against another office suite is ""I just don't like it!""

3jiv2n,21,2015-09-03,Last night I commentated the game in the press box... For a class.,easy_bake94,orioles,https://www.reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/3jiv2n/last_night_i_commentated_the_game_in_the_press/,"*Typed up last night...*

I just got home from the game. Wanted to share this amazing experience with some people I knew would appreciate it. I love sports. I LOVE the Orioles. This semester at Towson I'm taking Sportscasting. My professor has a connection with the PR guy for the O's, and has been taking students to the park for a decade or so. Free press passes, university provided equipment. Completely free to go call a couple innings with a partner(What a game to call!!). 

5:00 - Arrive at Home Plate Plaza and receive press passes. Only four of us for this game. Other two dropped class (lol bad choice), and other half of class goes in a couple weeks. Take elevator up to floor 2. First thing in the press box is a table with stacks and stacks of packets. All full of stats, fun facts, records of all teams, newsletters... the list goes on. On the left I see a large booth where the pregame crew does their work! [Rick Dempsey](http://imgur.com/0yLY2AH) was hard at work in there. Then I see the very clutch Twitter follow [Roch Kubatko](http://imgur.com/g8I0PS8) working on a piece during BP. Would've said hello, but didn't wanna come off as a fan. Gotta act like a peer. Dude was hard at work the whole game.

6:30 - After hanging out on the 2nd floor, we head up a small stairwell to the 3rd floor. Enter our recording booth, which just so happens to share a wall with Jim Palmer!! The wall had a big window, so we were able to watch him at work during the game. Here's a slight look at the scene and some [proof](http://imgur.com/vs8T4eI) of the story.

7:07 - First pitch. Watching my classmates work the first 2 innings at this point. Real fast innings, pretty sure no one got on. Total breeze for them.

Then comes the 3rd inning... My inning.

What a hellish, terrifying inning to work for a guy working his first ever baseball game. Let alone a major league game. Even if it was just a recording for my professor, the pressure was on. Gausman could not get right that inning. Arencibia homered right by the foul pole. I had to fill roughly 4 minutes with random talk about the game during the homer review. Was totally unprepared for a delay. Watched the replay and stated that it was foul on the review and Arencibia would come back to bat... Umps of course disagreed. Flustered me a bit. 1-0 Rays. Mixed up the batting order and announce Forsythe up instead of Jaso, which didn't help. Rays up 4-0 after the top 3rd. Felt like I did pretty great calling the comeback. Lots of enthusiasm on Davis's tying homer. 4-4

After the 3rd I took a break since that was technically all I was getting graded on. Enjoyed the free food, and then my classmates and I took turns practicing calling more innings. I can't even describe how much fun that was for me. What an opportunity.

We packed up before Schoop tied it, and were invited to watch the rest of the game in the Rays radio team's booth. Andy Freed, Rays radio personality, Graduated from Towson in '90 and took a class with my professor. Discovered he also graduated from my high school. Totally blew my mind. Pretty incredible watching two pros just flow through a broadcast and call the walk off. My professor and ""his prized pupils"" even got a shout out on air from Mr. Freed! Although I'm sure no one in Florida gives a crap. Great guy. The Rays are lucky.

It was without a doubt one of the best nights of my life. I got to do my dream job for a class, I got to meet a pro who has a ton in common with me, and I finally caught my first win at Camden IN TWO YEARS.

Definitely looking into jobs and internships with the team. They're loaded with former students in their media department. In fact a guy from my fraternity just got a job this season with them right out of college. If anything dope happens in the future, I'll be sure to hit up my squaaaaad at r/Orioles.

Oh and checking in from Booth [IV-C](http://imgur.com/oRxvVoP)!! "
3jivlk,1,2015-09-03,Still thinking we can be together again,getov,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/3jivlk/still_thinking_we_can_be_together_again/,"So, here's my story but first TL;DR: She's moving to other country, she broke up with me because of that, now she don't want me there even when I have an offer of that city. What can I do? I still think that we can be together if I go.

Now, I started dating this girl 2 years ago, things were going very fast but we didn't care, we were happy together, after two months dating she met my parents, one week after that I met hers, we did internship together, graduated together and took separate jobs in the same city.

I don't live with my parents so we had our own space at my house, but she still lived with her parents, our lives were kind of different there, I had all the liberty I wanted but she had her parents bothering her. So we decided we wanted to go to other city, country, even planet and live together.

After one year searching works outside she got an offer from other country very far from here. I started looking for open positions there but after one week she broke up with me.

At the beginning I was lost, I didn't know what to do, I told her that I would get a job there and be together, she told me I was very optimistic and that she was pessimistic and she knew I would not get a job there.

After a week a company from there contacted me, when I told her she was mad at me, she told me that she didn't want me there and that the relationship was over. I got a little depressed, I stopped eating and sleeping, I started to have problems in my office but I continued with the interview.

I know her, this is not like her, something tells me she's not making these decisions and after all we've been through I don't think she just stopped loving me, this is the way she reacts when things don't go as she expected.

It's been two weeks since NC, I don't know what's going on with her but I know her trip is being delayed. At this moment I've an offer in the same city and I don't know what to do, it's a very good opportunity for me but I don't know if I want to be in the same city knowing she doesn't want to see me. Something inside of me thinks that being in the same city, in other country, could make us be together again, but how can I erase that idea from my mind?

3jiwr3,3,2015-09-03,A story about my experience watching the NZIHL you guys might find interesting.,pkfc9,hawks,https://www.reddit.com/r/hawks/comments/3jiwr3/a_story_about_my_experience_watching_the_nzihl/,"So this summer I had got an incredibly lucky opportunity to get an internship at the University of Auckland, the major city in New Zealand, and was lucky enough to be there while the NZIHL season was going on.


Anyway the timing worked out one weekend and I was able to catch a game for one of the two Auckland based teams, the West Auckland Admirals. Being curious and knowing the league is relatively new and hockey isn't the biggest sport there, especially with the All Blacks going into Rugby World Cup this year to defend their title, I wasn't expecting much of a crowd. But I was pleasantly surprised, I think there were 300-350 people in there to cheer on the guys.


The rink was a warehouse-esque setup like a lot of the older rinks on the south side with stands only on one side, lobby on the other, nothing behind either net etc. The rink also seemed too short lengthwise which I'm assuming is a result of the small building it was placed in.


So anyway the game starts, they're playing the Canterbury Red Devils (the team from Christchurch) and the pace of the first 2 lines clearly over shadows the last two, the goalies seem to be playing a stand up style I haven't seen in 15 years, so I'm assuming it's going to be a high scoring affair. Which it was.


But you're probably wondering why I'm posting this here and not r/hockey and here's why, the Red Devils scored the first two but with a multiple tipped shot from the point the home team (The Admirals) gets on the board, all of a sudden I hear a goal horn that sounds awfully familiar, I'm suspicious but then I hear the beautiful sounds of ""Da-Da-Da Da-Da-Da Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da"" and I just go ""son of a bitch... that's awesome""


They use the entire audio file for the Hawks goal horn and celebration, do the people in the stands know this? Maybe. Maybe not. But I think it's pretty cool to kinda have a sister team all the way on the other side of the world. They didn't do very well this year, the Southern Stampede from Queenstown won it all, whose (extra tidbit), rink does not have glass... it literally goes boards netting.


So a little more about the league and the game. Each team is allowed 4 imports and a lot of teams actually grab guys from the U.S. or Canada, I believe on the Stampede they had a couple guys who were kinda replacement players for NCAA D1 teams, which to be at that level at all means you have to have some incredible talent. Other guys are people from SM-Liga and the division 2 or 3 German leagues, things like that. Guys that are looking to play over the summer to try to boost themselves up a division or 2, or guys just looking to play after graduating for another year or two. I guess the imports get jobs and a car and housing while they're there for the summer.


The game was kinda crazy. Like I said the goalies were jumping out of their crease to make saves. The first couple lines were pretty good but the fourth lines had guys you'd see at a local men's league chasing the play. But that variety definitely kept things interesting. The Red Devils won 7-5 with an empty but after the game was something I've never seen before. They shook hands even though this was a regular season game and they were playing again the next day. (The games are like college where you only play on the weekend and you play the same team twice in the same location) The teams stayed out on the ice for 10-15 minutes jut talking to each other like a soccer match, no jersey trading though. The guys on the Admirals spent another 10 minutes talking to fans, taking pictures and giving autographs to kids. I've never seen a goalie who just let up 6 goals smile so widely. But it definitely had a small town feel and was a really cool experience. I bought two shirts. The beer was only $5 too which in USD is closer to $3.50 and they had 5 different ones to choose from. Already missing my Steinlagers.


Anyway thanks for reading if you did. I figured this would be an interesting read to help tide you over for the next few weeks."
3jjind,12,2015-09-03,Thomas the Time Traveler and Frank the Immortal Chapter 1 Facebook Friend,KANNABULL,KANNABULLWrites,https://www.reddit.com/r/KANNABULLWrites/comments/3jjind/thomas_the_time_traveler_and_frank_the_immortal/,"Chromatic barrier quantizing, time dilation, geosynchronous trajectories over time...those calculations were relatively easy compared to suddenly finding yourself 20,000 feet above the earth and falling. It was the only safe way to predict that I would not end up stuck in the earth or floating in space, I got lucky, honestly I had no idea whether or not my body would not be sliced to ribbons by the compressed matter field. 

I lost consciousness and pulled my chute too early when I came to from panicking, but it did little harm, I floated safely to the ocean and inflated the raft. Almost drowning in the process, I ditched the chute and gathered myself thinking on the bright side of all the things that could have went wrong but did not.

The magnetic GPS device I made prior to my jump into the future said I was roughly eighty miles off shore from the nearest Eastern coast line. I made a makeshift motor out of the supplies I brought and paddled the last thirty miles. A freighter offered help but I declined and told them my boat had sunk. It took a complete day to get to the Jersey shoreline. Mother Liberty was still standing brightly in the distance, a good sign I just fucking jumped to the year 2215 and I felt exhilarated. 

Cars were literally flying, fashion was a bit peculiar and it seemed advertising had stepped it's game up holographic displays were everywhere, on the sides of buildings, on cars, even the grass in some places had semi familiar logos. I ate at a McDonald's, and the cashier told me he would accept the old cash this time but most places would not. The entire thirty thousand in bills were invalid.

Saw a cool Harry Potter Legends poster, on my way to a Radioshack outlet, but I was eager to find out about the history of the past two hundred years. 

The Radioshack employee was very kind to my naivete, I told him I was an immigrant and tried to fake a Russian accent probably not so well. I explained I had found an old bitcoin chip in my grandfather's belongings and he ran it for me. It was worth far more than I had expected, I bought a few new items on top of a animotus headset to connect to the grid or what someone would call the internet back in my day. He gave me a footnote tutorial on how to use it and what to expect. He was also able to process a temporary BC Master card which would allow me to buy practically anything with little hassle. I shared a small portion of my wealth with the cashier in exchange for him not telling anyone.

I got into a taxi expecting it to fly, but it was an old energy model terrain only. No big deal I'd buy a cool one soon when I got the chance. I had him take me to the nearest cheapest motel, it was fairly packed and the lady at the reception counter had no hair whatsoever. I drew the conclusion it was the effects of a new kind of drug from her behavior, well new to me at least.

The first thing I did with the new headset was find a familiar website in the system, servers had been crossed over and accounts, it seemed as old as when the website first began still existed. I chose plain text format as opposed to the less familiar style of avatar roaming on the system grid. As far as I could tell the system grid was basically a giant virtual world similar to The Sims video game with better graphics. It required a ton of procedure though so I just went old school, which was still an option.

I logged on to my old account which was still there surprisingly, all my photos had been archived though and I instantly received a prompt telling me the steps on how to retrieve them. I had 822 new notifications pending, and an entire list of all of my old friends on it were deceased, I began tearing up for some odd reason. After all I had just left Boston a few hours ago from 2015 and all of my friends were still living there. That is when the unexpected happened and my sadness was quickly replaced with confusion.

Frank: No. Rachel got married after her BA and never went back popped out about six kids and never wrote another study on it. Shit man, my plane is about to leave without me, maybe we will get drinks the next time I'm in bean country. Play a pick up game or something you can tell me about that batshit crazy device you are working on? TTYL, bro.

Thomas: Well that sucks, I figured she would be the one to solve it. Oh ok. Yeah I don't drink anymore but I still play every Sat. on the ole' stomping grounds. Good luck with your internship!

End of Message/Archived/April 04 2015 3:22A.M.

Frank is typing...

Frank: Hey you two hundred year old son of a bitch! We never got those drinks. If Professor Watkins was still alive he'd owe me three hundred dollars.

Thomas: Frank? Is this Frank Deveroux? What the fuck is going on?

Frank: Of course it's me you goofy bitch, who were you expecting? Google my name and it will answer your questions.

Frank: What about you? Most people thought you were abducted and murdered in September of 2015, I knew better though. It was always that quantum displacement bullshit you were always preaching since high school. You time traveled didn't you?

I opened a new grid bar and searched his name, Frank Deveroux wiki, oldest living man 238 years old. The synopsis was he became the international expert on the vascular system and pioneered the application of nanite surgery. There was alot of controversy on how he was able to stay so young, he did not look a day over fifty.

Thomas: Yeah, crazy fucking ride in, I ended up about eighty miles out from the East Coast, good thing I knew to have a parachute and life raft before jumping though. I was never good at precise variable mathematics. Lol, apparently you have mastered it though.

Frank: I programmed my own nanites to deconstruct and rebuild my vascular system in sections, my brain gets goofy every once in a while but I'm working on that. I've allowed others this same gift but the public doesn't know about them, only members with something to contribute to society. It's not quite immortality but we are getting there, nothing as profound as time travel though.

Thomas: Well shit man what have you been up to? Got any children?

Frank: Tom, fuck off with all that for now. Look, the government knows you are there and I'm delaying them in hopes of getting to you first. I've sent an autopod to that shitty hotel you are in, it's going to fly you to my facility in LA where I will meet you. Trust me, the government will probably steal your tech and kill you after they are done with you. After all that's exactly what they did with the first aliens that landed in Times Square, they basically started the first galactic war I've created a little video to catch you up with what's been going on for the past two hundred years. You can watch it on your way, it's the green one in the parking lot, here now take the headset off and run! Go man!

I took the head set off and my eyes adjusted to the dim focus of the graphic display, it was much brighter than I had expected. Like coming in from the first winter's snow on a bright afternoon, disoriented I peeked out of the hotel's window and sure enough one of those helicopter cars was waiting it had a flag on the side I did not recognize. I quickly gathered all my things scattered on the bed, but left the three hundred dollar headset that I had bought with my bitcoin account suspecting it had some kind of tracing software in it. My mind was in overdrive, how could Frank still be alive and how did the government know I was truly me in the future and not some hacker or prankster? Had there been other time travelers?

I took a deep breath and exited the hotel making sure the chromatic device was still attached to my leg, I made a quick trip to the lobby and gave them the key and entered the strange green 'autopod' as Frank had called it. The doors slid open with a smooth hiss unlike the taxi I had taken after swimming to shore, two propellers on either side were hidden beneath the carriage that instantly shot out after the doors shut. The interior was spacious and comfortable, I could almost stand completely inside, a hologram display unit lit up as the car began slowly ascending with warning lights on the outside.

The hologram display labeled everything unfamiliar to me, beverage and snack storage, slid out from beneath the cushioned seats on either side. Beneath that was a drawer full of medications and sick bags, the right side of the windshield doubled as a television, this was nothing like the older version taxi that got me here I was beginning to get impressed.

""Welcome, Thomas Hester. Please prepare yourself for sonic flight by aligning your seating position in one of the marked locations."" the voice of the car said.

I readjusted my sitting position in the red glowing bars beneath the leather like material.

""Please remain still while your vest belt measurements are taken.""

A vest on a coat hanger dropped down from a panel and a laser in the unit on the ceiling scanned my chest as I watched the harness on it readjust.

""Scanning complete. Would you like an introduction and tutorial for sonic flight? If you choose no we may begin."" the disembodied voice asked me.

""No. No thank you, I think I get it,"" I told it. ""what should I call you though in case I need something?""

""Mr.Deveroux has designated my AI core as BB, it is short for 'Bottom Bitch', I understand this is a joke that you as one of his classmates would recognize.""

I giggled remembering the epic breakup of Rachel and Frank, in which he called her his bottom bitch in front of most of campus.

""Speaking of Frank is there any way I can,"" the car sprang forward with incredible speed jolting my nutsack on the seat making me wince. ""talk to him?""

""Mr.Deveroux is discussing diplomatic terms with the senators of New Jersey and Massachusetts on your behalf, in five minutes we will be intercepted by military drones that plan to extradite you from Brazil's custody."" BB told me.

""Wait what? I'm in Brazil's custody as in South America Brazil?"" I asked her...it.

""Correct, Mr.Deveroux has many clients and associates globally and galactically, if the United States government happens to extradite you there is an 84% chance that they will steal the device hiding on your leg and torture you to learn it's secrets and then kill you. Mr.Deveroux plans to hold a press conference to let the worlds know, you are the first time traveler, the government will stop at nothing short of starting a war to prevent this. It is why you are in Brazil's custody."" BB finished.

I suddenly felt sick, maybe hoping that Frank was fucking with me, but it was real. The aliens, corrupt government, I suddenly had the urge to use the device and go back but I did not have enough voltage in the uber capacitors. Fuck me, I looked out the window and saw a blazing trail of large predator drones line up in the distant skyline of the Jersey shore.

""Fuck meeee..."" I moaned.

A holographic naked woman popped out of the display unit, an extremely beautiful blonde caught me off guard.

""No, BB. I meant it as an expression. Like we are screwed."" I clarified.

""I am aware, Frank's history on your persona suggests you are a fan of jokes."" BB informed me as the hologram skittered into static.

The display screen on the right side of the window flashed to life with a stern looking man's face.

""The Brazil government has no domain in domestic airspace, I am General McCannon of the United States airforce, you are ordered by edict 9 of the domestic terrorist act to dock your vehicle on terrain immediately or suffer extreme prejudice."" the man demanded, he had a scar that ran the length of his face.

""Mr.Hester would you like to converse with General McCannon? If it is to your liking I believe I can strategically debate a successful outcome with 70% probability."" BB asked me.

""You do it. Do it now please!"" I screamed, as a flock of drones created a complete ring around the vehicle spiraling into a cylinder of gloomy death.

""Yo! Fuck you dawg, yain't doin shit muhfucka'!"" BB's voice changed entirely from a soft caressing female voice to a strong intimidating thug like voice.

""BB what the fuck!?"" I cowered wondering what hell was going on.

""Trust in me. Now may be a good time to place your vest on."" She said in her soft voice, I took the vest off it's hanger and put it on it tightened up instantly and a magnetic chain connected to it from the seats gripping me firmly.

""This is your final warning before we open fire on your autopod, comply or be shot down."" the General stated plainly but you could tell he was infuriated because his face became flushed.

""Bullshit, nigga', yain't fittin' to do shit, y'all want my man's  n' dems cuffs too bad to throw stone. Y'all bluffin' BITCH!"" BB's new voice rang out in almost a hypnotic tone.

""BB...?..., WHAT THE FUCK!"" I said as one of the spiraling drones broke rank and fell behind the autopod I crouched down as one of the rotors of the guns on it's wings fired a stream of bullets. None made contact with the vehicle but I felt like shitting my pants.

""What I tell you! Y'ain't fittin'  tado' shit you wanna' declare war on Janeiro bitch? Get da' UN ready cause I'll break some nukes off in that bitch ass, General McFuckwad. We got Dip Immunity muhfucka' and I'm livestreaming all this shit, nigga'. We currently have 378 viewers and rising, So say somethin' else bitch made muhfucka'."" I got the impression that BB was actually imitating a real person.

The General's face became even redder and beads of sweat began appearing on his forehead, the transmission cut just as you could hear him lose his shit. The drone's spiral flying pattern fell into synch beneath the autopod and veered off into the direction they came from and I could feel my fingertips again and sat on the cushions once more.  

""BB! What. The. Fuck. Was. That?"" I asked her as my buttcheeks loosened a bit. 

""Forgive me, I had not the time to explain. I was following the directives of the President of Brazil by mimicking his voice patterns and diplomatic strategies."" BB said in her soothing voice.

""He, uh, holy shit, he really talks like that?"" I asked her.

""Correct, in fact, you may be familiar with his great grandfather, I imitated the voice of Lionel Broadus II, President of Brazil, and heir to the Doggfather lineage. He is a leader of almost unparalleled strategy despite his abnormal decorum."" BB told me.

""Holy fucking shit. I take it we are safe for now? So Frank told me he would give me the cliff notes for the past two centuries in video format."" I asked cautiously.

""Indeed, we are both safe and the video will upload now in the display screen if you would like I can synch it to the headset."" BB stated.

""No. the windshield is fine thank you."" I told her retrieving an oddly shaped drink with citrus soda and vodka from the drawer beneath me and watched the video.   "
3jjkox,6,2015-09-03,My story so far with Aspergers,zakrystian,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/3jjkox/my_story_so_far_with_aspergers/,"Hello fellow Aspies,

I posted a long time ago about my Aspergers and how I was dealing with it. It was really bad, but how my life has changed since then. I want to share this story not to brag, but to show everyone here that everything might seem bleak and not worthwile now, everything can change in a short timespan.

A while back (about two years or so) I was really depressed. I thought about killing myself. My childhood friends bot had girlfriends and I wasn't seeing them anymore. My education wasn't really working for me or with me. I was at my lowest and seriously contemplating suicide. Life just didn't seem worth it. I thought I was weird and could not understand why I was failing in school, despite a quite average intelligence.

My mother was really upset about all my personal problems. She took me to a therapist. He quickly diagnosed me with Aspergers, all the signs were there. When I got home and read some articles about it, it was like I read an autobiografy.

I became even more depressed. This wasn't just something minor problem, it was something that was me. I read sentences like ""a lot of people with aspergers are involuntarily celibate"" and was smashed. The one thing I wanted was a nice girlfriend that would also like staying in on a saturday night and watch a movie, instead of going to some crowded club. I instantly thought, ""That girlfriend is never gonna happen then"".

I was convinced to pick up my education after being around the house and only playing games. I had a small talk at school concerning ""my thing"". Theys promised a lot of stuff, but did not really pull through, which was a bit of a bummer. 

Nonetheless, I started my internship. This was part of my graduation, I had to write a thesis concerning a company (where I  did the thesis about). I came there and boy was I nervous. My palms were sweaty, knees weak, arms were heavy.

But they ""hired me""

At first I was really shy but slowly got a bit more involved. I solved problems for them. I fixed computer related issues, translated a lot for them (I have a larger then usual amount of knowledge about languages), and improved (automated) processes.

At the end of the internship they offered me a temporary job. I got to fill in for someone that was on maternity leave for four months. about two weeks in, I got offered a job as junior account manager (starting when the girl I was filling in for was back)

I gladly accepted. I was going to my job everyday with anticaption, I had fun and was just loving my job. Everything was great. 

Last week my supervisor asked me to have a private conversation. The company was starting a new division, it was a whole new product for the company. She told me they were looking for somebody that could and would like to do that. That person was me. I could not believe my ears. Half a year ago I was a nobody, I answered phones and supported customers. Now I was being asked to set up a whole new brand. I said yes (off course I did)

So that is where I am now. Two years ago I was waiting to die. Now I am enjoying every day, every hour. My life is possibilties instead of obstacles. I still don't have the girlfriend, but with the sudden influx of confidence that might change as well.

I hope everyone that reads this long wall of text and has similar feelings I had, might realize something. 

**You don't have a handicap, you have a unique selling point.**

I definitly think me having Aspergers helped me tremendously in doing my job. I excelled at a lot of things. That gave me confidence and helped me overcome (partially) my weaknesses. I am not in a total state of terror anymore to answer a phone for example. I still not am the best conversation partner, nor do I understand my colleagues a lot of times. Those are just minor things. You have a great advantage over a lot of people. Put it to use!

It might sound totally unrealistic. If I read this two years ago, I would have dismissed it, unrealistic I would have said. 

It doesn't need to be. Forget about those weaknesses, focus on what you can do really well.

Start seeing yourself more like a X-Man, every one had their weaknesses. But they aren't superheroes because of their weaknesses, they are because of their strenghts. Please start doing the same, find out what it is your good at!"

I always knew I was going to college, but I wasn’t sure what I would study, or what I wanted my future to hold. One day, when I was sitting in high school chemistry, it hit me: I wanted to be like Dr. J. When I had suffered a hemorrhage due to an arteriovenous malformation and had half my cerebellum removed at 13, Dr. J. was the neuropsychologist I saw weekly in inpatient rehabilitation. When I finally realized I wanted to do what she had done for me, for thousands of others, I had recently been in for my 2-year follow-up assessment. I had gone over, once again, my thick neurological report, wondering what certain things meant or were suggesting. That’s when I figured, what’s keeping me from finding out? Neuropsychology was my favorite therapy session to attend each week, and in hindsight, I realized it was something I could practice and do well at, especially considering my unique ability to relate to some of my patients on a deeper level. 

When I started to think about what I’d like to research, I decided that the topic that most interests me is traumatic brain injuries, and more specifically, cerebellar traumatic brain injuries. I would also love to work with children who’ve had TBI’s, because of the age at which I had my injury. I understand how hard it can be to navigate the social world following an injury, especially at the ages when you’re supposed to be finding your identity and learning how to socialize. Another one of my research interests involves sports concussions, and looking at possible correlates with concussions as well as rehabilitation practices following injury. My final interest, and maybe the most incongruous, is rehabilitation of individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder. I’m particularly interested in finding out why some individuals exposed to trauma experience PTSD while most who’ve gone through trauma do not. 

For the last 5 semesters of my undergraduate career, I served as an undergraduate research assistant in a lab run by Dr. Theresa Jones which focuses on behavioral and physical changes as a result of stroke, and optimal rehabilitation methods in animal models. This semester three undergraduate research assistants and I have begun a project related to subcortical strokes, as all other research in our lab has looked at the effects of cortical strokes. I’m excited about this project because it’s researching a more realistic view of human stroke tendencies, as not all human strokes are just located on the cortex. In the past, I’ve worked in nearly all aspects of the lab, doing behavioral training, gathering data from recordings of behavioral tasks, preparing slides, cutting brain sections and mounting them on slides, and Nissl staining brain sections. Currently, I work as a research intern in the lab of Dr. John Hart, working directly under Dr. Gail Tillman analyzing EEG data in patients with Gulf War Illness and PTSD.

In ten years, I see myself working as a neuropsychologist in a children’s ward of a hospital or some other medical setting (such as inpatient rehabilitation). I would like to both assess and provide rehabilitative services to the children I treat, as the rehabilitation would be a very rewarding process for me- I can see the differences that I can make. If possible, I would also like to work at a VA medical center caring for those with post-traumatic stress disorder.

If everything goes according to plan, I will be graduating in May with a double major in Actuarial Science and Finance. After passing two exams and working this past summer as an actuarial intern at a medium sized life insurance company, I have decided that I definitely want to pursue a career as an actuary! 

Ideally, I would like to have a job lined up for after I graduate this spring. However, I'm not sure when I should begin filling out applications. I have heard that recruiting college graduates can start extremely early. However, I do not want to hurt my chances of landing a great position at a larger firm by being thrown in the ""maybe later"" pile. 

Do you think it is too early for me to begin filling out applications now? If so, is there a ""sweet spot"" application time for larger firms in which most of their recruiting will happen?"

I'm currently living in The Netherlands in my early twenties and I've been looking for a job in Catalonia for a while now (focused around Barcelona) and haven't had much luck.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to move to Spain to be with my partner but, moving has been troublesome because of the job market,
and it has put some serious strain on our relationship (together for almost 4 years now) and i don't know how long we will be able to be together if i can't find something soon.

&amp;nbsp;

I've got lots of experience with Tech support working for big corporations as a third party support tech for a year, and a couple internships. I also have completed a secondary senior vocational study for ICT workers, and recently got some certificates for Windows and ITIL to go with that.

&amp;nbsp;

I have been applying to entry level (English) support positions with no luck, only a couple of calls but that is it.
I have been using [Infojobs.net](http://infojobs.net) and using google.

&amp;nbsp;

If anyone has any advice/help I would be super grateful!
and if you want to know more about my situation just ask me in the comments, also if you are an employer/recruiter feel free to PM me for my details!

I just accepted an intern position at Edelman, a PR firm in SoHo. I'm supposed to start September 14th, and it is meant to last 3 months (at which point they can either extend me another 3 months, bring me on full time, or let me go). Since I'm not trying to handcuff myself to a 12 month lease, I figured subletting a place is probably the best option. Since the office is in SoHo, I'm looking for something within reasonable commuting distance of that neighborhood. My budget is around $2000/month (my parents will be subsidizing the cost/signing as my guarantor).

Some things about me: I love sports, music and movies. I'm hoping to make some new friends in the city who I can chill and go out with on the weekends. I've scoured a bunch of roommate and subletting sites without much luck, but since Reddit is generally a pretty chill place, I'm hoping something good will come of this.

3jkqe0,1,2015-09-03,Two Very Different Job Offers. Need input badly!,PFthrowawayhehe,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3jkqe0/two_very_different_job_offers_need_input_badly/,"Ok everyone so background- I am currently in a situation where a month ago I had no job coming out of college and was interviewing for multiple jobs and now two of them have stuck.  I started one last week and was just offered this new one today.

I graduated with a degree in Finance &amp; Economics but a Sales internship background.  I'm not going to say the name of the company that I just started at but it is a sales job that pays 30K initially plus commission and has base pay increase once you hit certain cumulative revenue goals.  I sell adspace on a website that users can search for any business and write reviews if they choose to do so.  I'm sure you can guess this company.  

The job I was just offered pays 40K with no commission and is an Enrollment Counselor for my previous university.  One of the benefits is that you can further your Education for free.

Here is my dilemma.  I do believe that I can make more money with my current job in the first year and from what the employees have told me the average first year is 45k with commission factored in and it only increases from there.  This is obviously not a guarantee, but I am confident in my sales skills that I can make over 40k with the commission and make even more long term.  On the other hand, I could work as an Enrollment Counselor for two years while I get my MBA and make 40k flat in the meantime.  I am also considering getting a second bachelors in Computer Engineering instead of the MBA.

I don't know which would be a better long term career move.  The Sales experience from my current job would be much more valuable on my resume than two years experience as an enrollment counselor, but would that outweigh the MBA or Bachelors of Engineering that comes with it?

Thank you for reading my long post.  I am really torn on this decision and am looking for input.  Sales Job or Enrollment Job? MBA or Bachelor of Engineering?  Thank you all so much for your help!

3jl86w,58,2015-09-04,My Adopted Son is Struggling and it is Hurting the Rest of the Family,concernedparent2015,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/3jl86w/my_adopted_son_is_struggling_and_it_is_hurting/,"Hey. I'm not someone who is very computer literate, but I am at the end of my rope and don't know where else to turn.

I am a 62 year old dad to 2 biological kids ages 21 and 17. My oldest is a senior at university, and his sister is on a gap year (away from us) at an internship for one of her interests. I would like to say that we had it lucky with them. They certainly were not perfect, but looking at the bigger picture, both were fairly easy to raise and are very independent.

But this really isnt about them. It's about my youngest kid, who we adopted at age 5 (after fostering him for 3 three years). Right now he is 11 and just started 6th grade. He (obviously) didn't have the greatest start in life, but since we started fostering him we have treated him as our own and worked hard to raise him well.

But, he has always had serious issues. Maybe from his early life experiences (Think left with a stranger, barely fed, and yeah... For his first year and a half), or maybe from elsewhere. Particularly in regards to authority. Me and my wife try to discipline him, try to help him make choices, but it is always like pulling teeth. And if his brother or sister so much as has a suggestion? Well that almost always turns into a full on fucking tantrum.

It is getting to the point where it is a real struggle for me to want to spend time with him, or help him with homework. Or even parent him. He just went to public middle school after going to a charter school since pre-K, and I am worried about his behavior there. At the charter school they were very supportive and understanding of his issues. Partially due to their educational philosophy, and partially because our family was very involved in the school's founding back when our older kids were younger, but this new school won't be. 

His behavior has also driven away his siblings. Especially with the 21 year old, having them in the same room is a bad situation at this point. At the end of the summer the 21 year old took off work to come down to visit us and go on our annual beach vacation. It was 2-3 days of hell. 

And what scared me about it was while in the past, when I have gone with my wife's theory that the 21 year old instigated it most of the time by trying to parent/boss around his brother, paying attention for those three days kind of gave me a kick to the chest in that I realized that it wasn't the 21 year old. Very rarely did the 21 year old instigate anything. Once and a while he would say something, like 'Please buckle your seat belt' stuff like that, or he would actually try to calm his brother down, only to be met with a hour long hissyfit in which his brother would call him a bunch of names (Saten, fat, gay, lazy, friendless, fat, etc), threaten to call child protective services on us (for not letting him watch TV, or attempting to punish him for throwing a fit in public). 

And you notice how I keep saying we attempt to punish him? That's because every time I (or anyone else) attempts to do anything about it, my wife will step in and proceed to give him what he wants as a reward. I also think she has built this fantasy where his older brother is a manipulative, lying kid who just wants to power trip over parenting his younger brother - and yet I struggle to see how that could be the case when he went from visiting every month in his freshman year to maybe calling once a month this past year. Maybe. 

This is breaking apart my family, each and every member of which I love. I know it is hurting my relationship with my wife - who should be able to tell that he needs professional health (she works with mentally ill people every single day, how can't she see that he needs serious evaluation.

His mental health is an issue. A year ago the charter school referred him to a psychologist for testing, and they came back with some pretty serious thoughts. They suggested he might have several mental problems related to authority and possibly ADHD, but every time I suggest to my wife that we should follow up on that, she stone walls me. She points to the fact that according to testing the same school had my older son take in 7th grade, he was depressed and potentially anti-social, and he just needed time. Who cares that at the time we could see he was depressed, and the entire eighth grade year we had to lock up the kitchen knives as the older son - get this - repeatedly told us to as he had been planning suicide (luckily he turned out well, and is no longer suicidal!).

As I said, our older son has already pretty much distenced himself. He refused to even search for internships in our home city for this summer, *because he would have to live at home.* He only calls when he thinks we would worry about him without a call, and keeps it brief when he does. He never comes home for more then a few days, and actually missed the funeral of his grandfather (who he was very close with) because his mom decided to bring his younger brother, because he didnt want to be there when his younger brother flipped out at the funeral over some stupid shit (which happened).

 His younger sister is starting to distance herself as well. She now lives close enough that she can come to our city on her day off to visit with here friends. But she always comes in at 10PM, goes to sleep, and that is all we see of her. She is out before her brother wakes up, and spends the rest of the day at her friends' places. If she doesn't just cut our house out entirely. She has never said that it had anything to do with her brother, but the 21 year old has hinted that it does, and that he took on the role of the bad guy before because they both shared the same feelings, but she didn't think she could say anything while living under our roof.

My family is falling apart. Today I went and got the forms required to start divorce proceedings. I'm sitting here at 2:30 looking at sevoral forms I never thought I would even see, let alone actually consider filling out. I don't want to walk out, but I feel like I can either maintain a relationship with my two biological children, or my wife and my adopted child. And honestly, I'm at the point where I can no longer treat him like my own kid. I'm scared what he might do - he's a big kid, tall for his age and obese, so I'm scared that he could very well hurt someone, probably not on purpose, but I don't want to get that call. 

My son now hates his brother, my wife now hates her oldest son, my daughter is silent and unreadable, and my younger son? I have no clue what is going on inside his head, but I'm pretty sure it isn't pleasant.

I realize  of you likely have any similar experiences. But I am posting this everywhere in hopes that someone, with or without experience, can give me advice here. Because I'm tired. I'm older, I can't keep up. I'm tired of not being able to go out an eat, or the looks I get in the grocery store line when others are asking why that eleven year old is acting like he is 5, or the judgement of the extended family. 

So any and all advice is really welcomed. 

TLDR: My 11 year old son has serious issues my wife refuses to address, it's driving my family apart, and I'm at my wit's end.

3jlc65,25,2015-09-04,Just a childhood story/rant.,Jokkerine,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3jlc65/just_a_childhood_storyrant/,"So I was reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3jl3os/anybody_else_remember_their_first_experience_with/) fun little thread and it brought back some memories of my childhood. I feel like sharing today, so here you go. Sorry if it's rambly, but I haven't had my morning coffee yet. I hope this doesn't break the rules.




**WARNING: RANT AHEAD HOLY CRAP I SURE TYPED A LOT**




I used to have some dolls when I was a child, but eventually gave up on them. My mom however kept them and absolutely REFUSED to throw or give them away. She put them on a shelf, dressing them up and cleaning them even though I'm close to my 30's now, so... it's kinda been a while.




I was heavily abused as a child. I won't go into details, but there were these parties where they'd pass me around. My mom wouldn't do much since she mostly drank herself to sleep, and my sister was never home, always busy with something or other to stay away from the house.




The memory I can recall most clearly about my childfree stance is from when I was about 11 we were at one of her friend's places. I have fair skin, light hair and green eyes, so they were talking about how pretty my babies would be. I told them clearly that *I wasn't going to have any*, but they rolled their eyes and said I'd change my mind later. I remember feeling my blood boil in anger, but I didn't argue because I knew it would be a waste of time. I can still feel the resentment now when I think about it, but didn't change my mind. I think I have a phobia or children, really. They freak me the hell out for some reason. My hands start shaking when one greets me on the street. I am a weirdo, yes.




Many years later, my older sister was really excited to tell my mom she'd had sex for the first time with her then-boyfriend (we were in our 20's and mom had always said that *""she didn't care if we'd had sex with so on so, as long as we used a condom""* and my sis believed her). So she and my mom went for a walk. My sister came back crying and wouldn't tell me what happened. I couldn't talk to my mom because she was having a hissy fit and my dad didn't know.




I could only figure out what happened later because of my mom's constant snide comments at the table when it was just me and her and my sister was at work having tea. She'd bang on the table and complain, **""who knows how many men your sister has slept with?!""** This even came up during the weekend when the whole family was having lunch. She was really into guilt-tripping. There were plenty of fake faintings, drama about having to have surgery and bringing up my dead older sister, who died when she was just a baby, whenever we were having laughs or telling jokes at the table. Can't deny she had her own issues, really. I was named after that sister. 




My (living) older sister appreciates loyalty, so every time my mom dredged up her **UNFORGIVABLE UNLADYLIKE BEHAVIOR** I'd firmly tell her that it was none of her damn business. She'd be furious that I'd support my sister, but I know that she appreciated the loyalty I showed her, although she never returned it - weeks later my mom started asking *me* if I had sex with anybody (at university I had about three female friends - all of the others were males, including my very closest bud, who was a decidedly dashing guy with lots of girls swooning after him) and I'd again tell her that it was none of her damn business. My sister wouldn't say a peep. Same with my dad. Needless to say, I don't think my sister ever discussed sex with my mom after that.




We were watching a movie once that had a sex scene, and during it my mom said, **""I don't know why they yell so much. It doesn't even feel that good.""**




When I was finishing university and nearing 25 without a child in sight, my mom started panicking, saying that if you don't have children you get cancer and complaining about who was going to look after me **(read: who was gonna look after HER)** during old age. I'd just tell her I'd check myself into an asylum or nursing home. Again, she'd be angry. Same old, same old. She had told me that I was not to marry until I was 30 and that the religious ceremony (she follows evangelicalism) would take place at the same church hers had. And that I would have both a girl called Maria and a boy called Gonzalo.




I recently cut ties with my whole family because I'd had enough. I worked my ass off for a year to pay a ticket across the pond - finishing university for my dad's sake *(I did everything up to having my final thesis graded, but left before getting my diploma)*, doing an unpaid internship at a school, managing the housework because nobody would be there to clean it up, and working 25 hours during Saturday and Sunday as a cashier in a store three hours away from home. It was awful, but I had met my future husband who lived abroad and wanted to move in with him.




My mom had been very excited at first when I mentioned I'd got a job, because she hoped I'd use the money to help her pay off her **huge** credit card debt. My sister occasionally bought groceries, but I just gave all of my lunch tickets to my mom so she wouldn't ask me to actually give her money - you could use those at a nearby supermarket to buy food. I just ate crackers and bean salad at work sometimes. I barely ate at university too, and walked around as much as I could so I wouldn't have to waste money on public transport. I was a master penny-pincher. 




I finally paid for my ticket, in cash. It was about 2500 dollars, really expensive considering my job was minimum wage.  I remember the look on the cashier's face in the bank when I handed her the cash bundle, haha! She must've thought I was a drug dealer or something. 




A few days later, I packed a small suitcase with my books, some clothes, a few keepsakes, and headed to the airport without telling anybody. I had to wait for almost 10 hours in the airport, I lost my flight in France so they hooked me up with another flight a few hours later, they lost my luggage when I got here, and all the fun stuff that comes with air travel. But I am a lot happier here. I still do not want children, and my husband has been supportive so far. Hopefully it will stay  that way.




So, I guess what made me decide to be childfree was... well, I always knew I didn't want children. Baby commercials on TV never did anything for me, I didn't coo and ask to hold my baby cousins. So I guess it was a natural tendency (reticence?) coupled with years of abuse, being told that **sex for babies = good** and **sex that is not for babies = bad**, and the fact that I don't get periods at all because of my PCOS so I'm pretty sure I may be sterile anyway, despite having a big stash of condoms at hand. Yay!




I really miss my dog, though. She was cool and kept me company when things went rough. I don't even know if she's still alive. I have another dog here and she's an awesome big beast, but I keep a picture of my old dog and talk to it sometimes. As I said, I am a weirdo, haha.




Sorry about the disjointed rant, but I just felt like sharing something today. Again, I hope this doesn't break the rules. Rock on y'all, keep being awesome! :)"

Passion Just isn't Enough.,MoonCub,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3jli87/depression_and_anxiety_are_messing_up_my_dreams/,"My anxiety has been higher than usual lately. I keep thinking about my future.

I really want to go back to school next year. I want to continue my education and learn more about how to help others with mental illness. If I were to get accepted into a program for next fall, I would be 26, and if it takes 2 years, I’ll be 28, and then I’d have to do an internship. 

So respectively, I wouldn’t be starting my career until I was 30 or close to it.

So I’m looking at being either a LMFT (licensed family and marriage therapist) or a LPCC/LMHC (licensed professional clinical counselor/licensed mental health counselor). I’m leaning towards the latter.

My grades in undergraduate were average. I think I had about a 3.2-3.3 GPA. Luckily a lot of counseling programs don’t need GRE scores, so I don’t have to worry about that. But I’m worrying about other things.

Like letters of recommendation. Usually an application needs 2-3 letters. I can think of one person at the top of my head, but coming up with 1-2 more would be a challenge.

Due to my depression and anxiety I didn’t stick out in college. None of my professors probably remember me because I was quiet and I tried to avoid interaction with them as much as possible.

My CV is not looking great either. I’ve held 5 jobs, but none of them relevant to the field of psychology. Honestly, it’s really hard to find a job in the field unless you have a super higher education (at least a Masters). I’ve searched for internships and always come across, “Must be enrolled in a Masters program”. 

My last job was also held 10 months ago (due to life circumstances such as moving twice and my depression getting really bad) So now I’m thinking, I have to somehow find a job as soon as a can, and volunteer somewhere relevant as soon as can, and see if I can squeeze 3-4 months of reputable work, enough to ask for more letters of recommendations.

I know I would do very well on the essay part though. I have passion. I’ve wanted to be a therapist for almost 10 years now, and have 12 years personal experience with depression. 

I got a message once from someone who said they noticed that I replied to a lot of people, and that I should continue doing what I’m doing, and they thanked me.

It made me feel super good when I read that message. To know that I was helping, even in a tiny way.

So I want to go back to school, I want to work more on helping people who feel like I feel. But I’m so goddamn afraid my application is going to fall short, I’m wondering what’s the point.

I think a part of it too has to deal with that I want to not be where I’m currently at. I love my mom, but I hate the state she choose to live in. I would rather be somewhere more liberal that had more alternative lifestyles.

Grad school could lead me somewhere new and exciting. 

It could also give me the chance to socialize and be around people my own age. I’ve been so terribly lonely. 

So I’m wondering if there is even a point to try and apply for stuff this year. I have nothing to lose, but if I don’t get in somewhere I would devastated at possibly having to wait a whole other year to further my education and start my career.

I hate how it’s about who you know, and luck.

If it was about passion, I wouldn’t even be worried. I know I have that. I know I want to be a therapist and I would be a great one. 

But I feel like the admissions board won’t see that in my transcript and CV, and shake their head and set aside my application before getting to the letters, before getting to the essay.

This sucks."

You drunkenly called me one day though and told me you loved me, wanted to be with me. I was so happy.  Then, you said ""but I miss my ex and am going to see if I can get back with him.""
So I cut contact with you.  A few days later you tell me you were blacked out and not mean it.  But then you proceeded to say that you met someone in Pennsylvania already and hit it off nice.

Why would you call me and tell me that?  Do you want to see my heart ache?  I miss you don't get it twisted, I miss you a lot.  You are all I think about for the past 3 months since I legit stopped talking to you and told you never contact me again.  You were distraught that I did that to you, but I was in the right.  I had to do this, you had no right calling me and telling me all this shit that you met someone else or that you wanted your ex back.  Whatever.

These past 3 months thinking about you everyday have been so hard.  But I feel that you were just an idea. An idea of a relationship with you took over my head. It was a fantasy even though we talked about it.  The thing is the fantasy still runs through my head and then I think about you and it makes my day worse.

Some days are easier then others, but I miss you, but I can never talk to you again no matter how many times you hit me up, or even when you come home.  What you did ""too me"" with the calls, playing mind games with me, taking my emotions as a joke those few days hurt.

I miss you, but please never talk to me again."

3jmtmp,14,2015-09-04,"[X-post, rant] Just a childhood story/rant.",Jokkerine,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3jmtmp/xpost_rant_just_a_childhood_storyrant/,"Hello everybody! So someone suggested that I post this here again. I had originally posted it in the Childfree subreddit, but I wrote so much that I figured, may as well. Sorry if it's rambly! I also hope this doesn't break the rules.




**WARNING: RANT AHEAD HOLY CRAP I SURE TYPED A LOT**




I used to have some dolls when I was a child, but eventually gave up on them. My mom however kept them and absolutely REFUSED to throw or give them away. She put them on a shelf, dressing them up and cleaning them even though I'm close to my 30's now, so... it's kinda been a while.




I was heavily abused as a child. I won't go into details, but there were these parties where they'd pass me around. My mom wouldn't do much since she mostly drank herself to sleep, and my sister was never home, always busy with something or other to stay away from the house.




The memory I can recall most clearly about my childfree stance is from when I was about 11 we were at one of her friend's places. I have fair skin, light hair and green eyes, so they were talking about how pretty my babies would be. I told them clearly that *I wasn't going to have any*, but they rolled their eyes and said I'd change my mind later. I remember feeling my blood boil in anger, but I didn't argue because I knew it would be a waste of time. I can still feel the resentment now when I think about it, but didn't change my mind. I think I have a phobia or children, really. They freak me the hell out for some reason. My hands start shaking when one greets me on the street. I am a weirdo, yes.




Many years later, my older sister was really excited to tell my mom she'd had sex for the first time with her then-boyfriend (we were in our 20's and mom had always said that *""she didn't care if we'd had sex with so on so, as long as we used a condom""* and my sis believed her). So she and my mom went for a walk. My sister came back crying and wouldn't tell me what happened. I couldn't talk to my mom because she was having a hissy fit and my dad didn't know.




I could only figure out what happened later because of my mom's constant snide comments at the table when it was just me and her and my sister was at work having tea. She'd bang on the table and complain, **""who knows how many men your sister has slept with?!""** This even came up during the weekend when the whole family was having lunch. She was really into guilt-tripping. There were plenty of fake faintings, drama about having to have surgery and bringing up my dead older sister, who died when she was just a baby, whenever we were having laughs or telling jokes at the table. Can't deny she had her own issues, really. I was named after that sister. 




My (living) older sister appreciates loyalty, so every time my mom dredged up her **UNFORGIVABLE UNLADYLIKE BEHAVIOR** I'd firmly tell her that it was none of her damn business. She'd be furious that I'd support my sister, but I know that she appreciated the loyalty I showed her, although she never returned it - weeks later my mom started asking *me* if I had sex with anybody (at university I had about three female friends - all of the others were males, including my very closest bud, who was a decidedly dashing guy with lots of girls swooning after him) and I'd again tell her that it was none of her damn business. My sister wouldn't say a peep. Same with my dad. Needless to say, I don't think my sister ever discussed sex with my mom after that.




We were watching a movie once that had a sex scene, and during it my mom said, **""I don't know why they yell so much. It doesn't even feel that good.""**




When I was finishing university and nearing 25 without a child in sight, my mom started panicking, saying that if you don't have children you get cancer and complaining about who was going to look after me **(read: who was gonna look after HER)** during old age. I'd just tell her I'd check myself into an asylum or nursing home. Again, she'd be angry. Same old, same old. She had told me that I was not to marry until I was 30 and that the religious ceremony (she follows evangelicalism) would take place at the same church hers had. And that I would have both a girl called Maria and a boy called Gonzalo.




I recently cut ties with my whole family because I'd had enough. I worked my ass off for a year to pay a ticket across the pond - finishing university for my dad's sake *(I did everything up to having my final thesis graded, but left before getting my diploma)*, doing an unpaid internship at a school, managing the housework because nobody would be there to clean it up, and working 25 hours during Saturday and Sunday as a cashier in a store three hours away from home. It was awful, but I had met my future husband who lived abroad and wanted to move in with him.




My mom had been very excited at first when I mentioned I'd got a job, because she hoped I'd use the money to help her pay off her **huge** credit card debt. My sister occasionally bought groceries, but I just gave all of my lunch tickets to my mom so she wouldn't ask me to actually give her money - you could use those at a nearby supermarket to buy food. I just ate crackers and bean salad at work sometimes. I barely ate at university too, and walked around as much as I could so I wouldn't have to waste money on public transport. I was a master penny-pincher. 




I finally paid for my ticket, in cash. It was about 2500 dollars, really expensive considering my job was minimum wage.  I remember the look on the cashier's face in the bank when I handed her the cash bundle, haha! She must've thought I was a drug dealer or something. 




A few days later, I packed a small suitcase with my books, some clothes, a few keepsakes, and headed to the airport without telling anybody. I had to wait for almost 10 hours in the airport, I lost my flight in France so they hooked me up with another flight a few hours later, they lost my luggage when I got here, and all the fun stuff that comes with air travel. But I am a lot happier here. I still do not want children, and my husband has been supportive so far. Hopefully it will stay  that way.




So, I guess what made me decide to be childfree was... well, I always knew I didn't want children. Baby commercials on TV never did anything for me, I didn't coo and ask to hold my baby cousins. So I guess it was a natural tendency (reticence?) coupled with years of abuse, being told that **sex for babies = good** and **sex that is not for babies = bad**, and the fact that I don't get periods at all because of my PCOS so I'm pretty sure I may be sterile anyway, despite having a big stash of condoms at hand. Yay!




I really miss my dog, though. She was cool and kept me company when things went rough. I don't even know if she's still alive. I have another dog here and she's an awesome big beast, but I keep a picture of my old dog and talk to it sometimes. As I said, I am a weirdo, haha.




Sorry about the disjointed rant, but I just felt like sharing something today. Again, I hope this doesn't break the rules. Rock on y'all, keep being awesome! :)"

3jn204,5,2015-09-04,[20M] I've been with my girlfriend[F18] for a year and a half and things have been getting worse...,AdviceAnon,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3jn204/20m_ive_been_with_my_girlfriendf18_for_a_year_and/,"Thanks for taking the time to read this.  It's gonna be a long post, so strap in.

It started in April last year.  I was coming out of a relationship and was talking to a friend.  At the time, I had known this girl for upwards of five years.  We met online a long time ago, and admittedly, we haven't met in person.  We struck up conversation while I was in a relationship, she was there for me when I broke up with my past girlfriend, and eventually, I came to be with her.  I'm going to call my girlfriend Anna, though that's not her real name.  Anna and I had talked extensively for a long time about all sorts of things.  She struggled with abusive parents for the entirety of her life, and I helped her through a very dangerously depressive stage when we first met.  I had feelings for her then, and she admitted to having feelings for me, but we never confessed them at the time.  The most we ever became was like brother and sister, and we said ""I love you"" back and forth, but we only kept it to that sort of intimacy and nothing more.

Time skip back to a year and a half ago, we started talking in February.  I broke up with my girlfriend, at the time, in March, and in April, I asked Anna out.  The conversation began with her admitting that she liked me, upon which I said I liked her back, and things started from there.  Initially, things were fantastic. We loved each other, boasted about each other, and talked all the time with nothing but smiles and happiness.  The thing is, as time went on, she learned about my past and the things that I've done and that has caused our relationship to tumble.  Tumble to the point where I'm turning to reddit to ask for help or advice or even just opinions.

She's wonderful, and I love her with all my heart.  She has a 3.98 GPA going into college, she's incredibly funny and clever.  She's beautiful, and thinking about her always brings a smile to my face.  I call her the light behind my eyes, as she lights a fire in my heart.  I'm a college student going into my senior year with a 3.0 GPA, and unfortunately, I haven't been making my girlfriend feel happy.

To sum things up, I've had sex with two other people, one of whom was my first girlfriend at the age of 16, and another while I was in college, but she wasn't my girlfriend. I've smoked marijuana and drank, but that's the extend of my drug usage.  She, on the other hand, has never slept with anyone, never done drugs, and never drank before.  She holds herself to these morals and would've preferred that I had too, but unfortunately, I have done these things already.

The primary issue is that I've slept with other people.  She's willing to overlook the fact that I've drank and smoked, but me having slept with someone, especially someone I wasn't in a relationship with, is what's causing our relationship harm.  Admittedly, I don't think I should drink or smoke, and I know sleeping with people wildly is probably something I shouldn't do.  Granted, I was safe about it both times, using a condom and asking beforehand, but me giving away my first time is something she cannot overlook.  Her dream, as she tells me, was to share her first time with someone, and knowing that I cannot fulfill that angers and frustrates her.

Over the course of the past year and a half, I've been trying to make myself better.  I've stopped drinking and smoking entirely.  I've been working harder at school as I'm in my final year of college, and I know I've been slacking.  I've took up an internship over the summer so I can add that to my resume and I've even been trying to eat healthier and get in better shape.  Now that she's in college too, in her first year, I've been helping her with her homework, doing some scheduling for her so she keeps all of her stuff organized, and helped her study for her tests and quizzes and all that.

Despite this, I haven't changed, to her.  This morning, today when we had a fight, she told me that I have only changed a little bit, but she still sees me as the same person as I was before we were dating.  These fights happen every week, sometimes for days at a time, sometimes overlapping consecutive days.  She tells me that there hasn't been a month where she hasn't cried because of me, and having had to try to help her stop crying, I can attest to that.

The thing is....I love her.  I do.  I honestly love her.  I haven't thought about being with someone for the entirety of my life before, but I can see myself with her and being happy.  Genuinely happy.  Maybe it's sheer stubbornness, or blind optimism, but I can see our relationship working.  To spare you the mushy details, when we're happy together, it's beyond description of how wonderful it feels.  At the same time, when these fights come up, it's the worst I've ever felt.  I've laughed harder than I ever have before in my life.  I can't begin to count the number of times my face has been sore and my lungs have hurt from the jokes we tell each other.  At time same time, I can't begin to count the sleepless nights where she's yelling at me and I have to comfort her.

I've made her countless promises, and ones that I keep.  She made me promise not to smoke or drink, not to look at other girls, not to yell at her or snap at her when I get frustrated, to comfort her when she feels bad, and not to leave her.  These are just a few of the ones I've made, many of which she told me to promise her, and many of which I've made of my own volition.  Thus far, I've kept every single promise I've made, except the one where I promised not to make her cry.

She told me that every promise I make, she'd make too, under the idea that the promises we're making aren't hard ones to keep.  Problem is, every time these things come up, she yells at me.  She calls me retarded, an embarrassment, a manwhore, a disgrace.  She tells me that she wishes there was a clone of me who hadn't done anything so she could leave me and date the clone.  She tells me that I make her feel the worst she's ever felt in her life, and that she absolutely hates me.  I've had to sit and listen to her say these things to me over and over again, but I'm keeping my promise and not snapping at her.  I tell her that she's breaking her promise to me, but her response is that it's my fault that she's upset.

Every sign in my head is telling me to leave.  I know that if I were looking at this relationship from an outside perspective, I'd say to get the fuck out.  But we're still in a relationship.  We're still here.  I promised her I'd always keep trying, and that's exactly what I'm doing.  I don't want to break up with her, either.  I want to be happy with her.  I'm terrified, though, that I can't make her happy, or that ultimately I'll cause her more sadness and pain than happiness.  I know that I can be happy with her, but I want the same happiness for her as well.

A year and a half, in the grand scheme of things, isn't too long of a time, especially in dedicated long-term relationships, but honestly, I don't know what to do.  These fights have become so frequent that I'm actually worried about talking to her.  We talk every single day, and almost every single day, we fight.  I'm struggling my best to prove to her that I've changed and made myself better, but despite all my efforts, she still cries and yells at me.

I'm scared that if I leave her, I'll be missing one of the greatest opportunities of my life.  I'm worried about what might happen to her if I leave her.  I don't want to break my promises.  But at the same time, I don't know how much more she or I can go through.  I don't want to make her cry anymore, and try as I might, it seems like she still keeps crying.  I'm torn.  I'm stuck.  I don't know what to do.

So....here I am.  All of 30 minutes ago, she was telling me that I haven't changed a bit and then hung up on me, so I'm typing this out.  Please, if you read all the way through, tell me your perspective or some advice.  I don't really mind what sort of opinion you have on it, but that you share it with me.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Again, thanks for reading."
3jn5mr,7,2015-09-04,About Sales Tax....,Byebyeguy,FulfillmentByAmazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/3jn5mr/about_sales_tax/,"I know a lot of people hate this topic, but I'm curious if anyone has gone through the process of registering/paying.  I have always avoided it, at first out of total ignorance, later because the amount seemed relatively small, and then after that because I assumed that Congress would do something.

I'm to the point now where I'm just going to do it and get it done.  It'll be a short-term pain, but I'll start with the states with the highest potential liability and then work my way down the list.  Here are my reasons for doing it and something for you to think about:

1) The Marketplace Fairness Act will not change whether inventory is viewed as Nexus.  It will mean that businesses over $1M (regardless of FBA) will have to collect sales tax in all states, even if they have no presence in those states.  So MFA isn't going to solve anything, it will just make it worse.

2) It caps the amount of years the state could audit you.  The audit period is typically 3 years after the filing, but unlimited if you never file.  

3) It would be really, really easy for an auditor to just fire off letters to out of state sellers that aren't paying tax.  Literally an intern could just sit on Amazon and cherry-pick sellers name and see if they are collecting/paying tax with a little research.  And if they got a list somehow?  Forget about it!

I did the math yesterday and I save about $4/unit when I have it shipped via FBA vs. MF, plus I see the increase in sales as well.  I wouldn't consider it until the potential tax liability would hurt.

Yeah,  I know people would disagree, but when you get to a certain point you have to do things as a sort of insurance policy.

I am looking to attend SIS for my MA in International Affairs focusing on US National Security and Foreign Policy. AU's program is pretty much my dream and I was curious about what the realistic chances of me getting accepted were. I will need financial aid as I've been financially independent pretty much from the minute I graduated from undergrad.

My resume basically lines up like:

- University at Albany: Cum Laude degree in Political Science specializing in Global Politics
- 3.26 overall, 3.42 major GPA
- Year of study abroad experience at the University of Nottingham, UK
- Year of work in NY state politics
- Year of internship experience with Congressperson
- Secured 2 letters of recommendation already
- Taking the GRE in November, aiming for 160 verbal/math

I'd be looking to take night classes as I am going to have to work to support myself and pay for school. I'm looking in Alexandria right now but I don't know how hectic that commute would be. I've been on the campus twice and fell in love with it more each time, so this is really my target. 

Really trying to gauge what my realistic chances are and what people who have studied at SIS think about it. Any assistance or just general comments about SIS/coming in as an MA candidate would be great. Thanks!"
3jo6rj,1,2015-09-04,"Today I finished Rembering the Kanji 1, I would like your opinion on my upcoming new workflow.",Darkpoulay,LearnJapanese,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/3jo6rj/today_i_finished_rembering_the_kanji_1_i_would/,"Hello everyone !

As the title suggest, I just, right now, studied the last batch of Kanji in the first book of Rembering the Kanji. Now, I know that my Japanese knowledge is very abstract at the moment, only having a keyword for each Kanji does not make me able to read anything, but I am still kinda proud since I followed a study program that I made until the very end without skipping a day. That's something !

---
Before I move on to the ""upcoming program"", let me tell you a little about the workflow I had until now, to get at least a small grasp of what I am able to do to study Japanese. This method took me a little over 6 months (again, without skipping a day) to do. For this I worked with the Fourth Edition of RTK as well as Anki, in which I built up my own deck.

1. **Anki review** (no amount limitations on either old or new cards, so everything that Anki decides to put on top of the deck) : about **1 hour and 20 minutes** near the end of the book. On bad days with very little motivation, could last 2 hours or more.
2. **Learning new Kanji** : **15 minutes**. My objective for every week was 100 Kanji, meaning around 14-15 Kanji every day. That time includes making up the story and writing them down one time (or more if I have trouble with stroke order).
3. **Creating the cards** : **5 minutes**. While it's a bit short to be called an entire step, the most difficult part is finding the computer character associated with the Kanji in order to paste it on the flip side of the card.

That's pretty much it for the Remembering the Kanji workflow, but the fun doesn't stop here. A month ago, I decided to speed things up and use the most of my remaining free time. So, I've decided to pick up Tae Kim's Complete Guide (that I already did when I first got into learning Japanese) once again in a more serious way, by making Anki cards for every good opportunity, so not only the grammar but also recurring vocabulary, tips, casual forms and expressions. This also includes counters and number variations, for example the most common counters, days of month, days of week, name of months, etc...

Just so you know, I haven't finished it, I'm close to the end but I am still planning of finishing it, even if it overlaps with my new workflow in the beginning. This additional workflow for Tae Kim's adds up immediately after the RTK studying.

4. **Anki review** (same rules) : **about 20 minutes**
5. **Thorough reading** (ie reading through the lessons, including all examples, and taking notes of everything that looks worth remembering) : variable (usually around **30 minutes**), depends of the length of the lessons. If I get everything quickly in a short lesson, I do the next one on the same day.

---
And that's about it ! If you're reading this, it probably means that you are now purposely spending your time trying to help me, and I thank you for that ! So, let me just talk about a little context here. This is actually important, but I don't want to make this post too long for you, so **TL;DR : I am going to Japan for a 3 month internship in June 2016**.

If you want the specifics (and if you don't, skip to the next section), this is an internship in a field that will require me to speak English more than Japanese. In other words, getting fluent in Japanese before then is not a necessity or anything. However, because I don't want to be a filthy foreigner unable to communicate with people there, I at least want to be a filthy foreigner that is able to do so. (That being said, English isn't my first language either)

---
Okay, now I'm getting there. What I plan to do next is a study program, starting right next Monday and ending in late May. And it will focus on **vocabulary** and **reading practice**. After a bit of calculation, I managed to find a suitable pace that will allow me to do my now usual ""review - learn - make cards"" routine, by doing around **25 new words** every day, resulting in **6000 words** known at the end of the study program. Knowing that I am willing to commit almost my entire free time to studying the language, I also want to do something else on the side. And that's the part when I want you to tell me what you think. Of course, feel completely free to discuss my choice on the vocabulary study, but on this part I'm terribly unsure. 

Here is stuff than I thought about doing (**not** a ranked list !)

1. **Remembering the Kanji 2**. Knowing that the method is not really complete without doing both books (not sure about RTK3 though, that seems a bit special), it may be wise to actually follow the method to the end. However, I'm not really enthusiastic. First, because Tae Kim says that learning Kanji alone, along with each possible reading, is not a good idea and focusing on learning Kanji with associated vocabulary is a better approach. Also, I'm not really sure if I could do it efficiently with my current method, I think I would be very confused to learn all Kanji one by one all over again with readings.

2. **Playing video games or reading novels, in Japanese**. I'm naturally more attracted to this option, and here is how I would do it : simply create an Anki deck, reviewed daily before playing/reading, and adding all unknown expressions and words in it when I encounter them. This would require to stop often and have a dictionary close by, but I wouldn't mind. Having duplicate words isn't really a problem either, it doesn't matter if I learn them first on my resource list or in the game/novel. Also, I think video games or manga with easy japanese would be better at the beginning while my vocabulary is still lacking.

After retiring as a Player in 2219, Edward Ramsey was hired as coach. However, it was apparent during training camp that he could still start on the team. In order to maintain the perennial championship tradition, he was convinced to keep playing for another 17 years. Finally, after 8 games in his last season, he realized that he was no longer a starter caliber player (but could compete for, and did win, the sixth-man of the year award). Management allowed him to end his playing career on the condition that he assume the GM's responsibilities after the existing GM decided to retire after 211 years. 

Yes, this is my final season (and last day of internship, so the computer is getting wiped, and the league is way too big to export). 

It was a good run. I'm proud to have been a part of this organization, and I must say that Coach Ramsey will make a great GM.

“Okay people, that’s a wrap!! Season 2, episode 7 is done, great job everybody!”


Voice actor Roiland said to himself, because he voices basically everyone in Rick and Morty. He highfived the wall and left the recording room, going immediately to the crapper to celebrate a record of holding in his poopoo peepee. How else do you sound like a strained old man?


In the luxurious, executive suite crapper trimmed in gold and diamond, still wet with the blood of orphans on it, funded by fans on reddit, he casually flipped open a notepad to write the script for Episode 8. He kept it next to the plunger.


“ Knock-knock, you better not be writing that script without me, my Roi-toy, “ said a voice. By golly, it was Dan Harmon! The co-star/ co-writer of the show! 


“ Oh shucks you caught me in the executive brain storming of---” He grunted as he let out a fart “ -fice.” 


“Mmm, is that butthole nice and tidy for me, Justin?”


“Just a sec, Danny.” The force of the hugest butt lugie came tumbling out, pulling with it all the little bits of poopoo with it- just the bits. Give me the bits.


Dan stuck his finger in the glory hole, directly at eye-level to Justin, and wiggled it flirtatiously. Then he looked through the hole. “Hey there, creative genius”


“Hey you, you silly creative genius” Roiland lisped like a perfectly homosexual man. Unbeknownst to the mere fan, this was no act. 


Harmon barged into the spacious crapper, dick a flinging. “Guess who’s here?” He shrieked wildly and meatspun that little guy. 


“Oh hey!! It’s Mister Buldops!”


“And He’s ready for Mister Poopybutthole” Dan laughed and leaned aggressively towards Roiland.


“Dan I want you to tease me so hard, stroke my dick so much, and just basically take me to the edge and then FUCK ME like you hate me!” 


“DAMMIT JUSTIN I’M GOING TO FUCK YOU LIKE I’M GOING TO KILL YOU”


“YES DAN, JUST MURDER MY ASS HOLE”


And without any warning or lubrication Harmon stabbed his rod of creative genius into the fountain of creative genius. Roiland screamed like a little girl, but it was a good scream, like little red riding hood secretly getting plowed by the wolf while grandma watches.


Harmon did not hold back on his grunts, he claimed that territory like an aggressive bear. His rumbling roars shook the floors, but it didn’t matter- they were the only people left in the building that late. Except for the interns. Interns aren’t people.


Roiland stroked his beard in one hand and his dick in the other, alternatively balancing himself above the toilet as the force of Harmon came upon that asshole as flexible as a gymnast from years of hamburger and steak- a diet of a REAL man. Not at all gay.


“Ughhh!! I’ve been holding three days worth of poop this time, is this really all you’ve got?! I’ve had diarrhea more aggressive than you, Dan!”


“Three days? You pinched off only a tiny little shit for three days, what are you, some kind of girl? Come on, I want to hear you scream in Summer’s voice!”


“Ohhh! Ohhh ETHAN!! FUCKME ETHAN!! FUCK ME WHILE MORTY WATCHES!”


Dan moaned, “Oh yeah, Justin that’s the shit. Yeah, yeah, do Morty next.”


“Oh geeze, Oh no, No King Jelly Bean please, no!”


Dan bit his lips and fucked him even harder, but he wasn’t a pedophile, his real turn on was---


“DO RICK. DO RICK RIGHT NOW YOU FUCKING SAVAGE”


“I *burp* I-I-I-I I DIDN’T MEAN FOR YOU TO TOT-T-O CATCH ME GET-GETTING *burp* FUCKED BY THESE ALIENS MORTY, I-I-I *buurrrp* DON’T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU MORTY *burrrp* S-SOMETIMES THE WORLD JUST DOESN’T MAKE SENSE, M-MORTY, DO-DO ME A SOLID AND HAND ME THAT WHISKEY, I-I III I LIKE IT MORTY LIVE AND LET LIVE YOU KNOW”


With that Harmon came the shit out of his poopy dickhole and Roiland jizzed into the toilet bowl too. When Harmon pulled his jackhammer out of Roiland’s butthole, the sudden loss of tension released a torrential flow of poopoo, splattering all over the notepad by the toilet. 


“See Dan? I eat like a real man.”


Dan was already hard again. “Oh fuck me Justin, I just had a great idea for the show.”


“Oh yeah, Dan?”


“Ohhh, oooohhhh yeah Justie, Oh yeah, amazing idea. It’s sooooo great Justaway”


Justin was getting hard again too, thinking about great ideas for the Rick and Morty show. The anticipation is heaps better than the event and the memory as they say.


“Oh yeah Dan, you want to tell me about it?” Roiland began to stroke his dick.


“Oh totes man, oh, oh totes, just-just hang on. Just--- HHuuhhHHH”

 And he Jizzed like at least a tub load of “I can’t believe it’s not butter”’s worth of jizz ontop of all that 3 day old poopoo on the floor. Roiland came from seeing his partner so jazzed up about whatever idea he had, all over the fucking floor. Like an animal.


Panting, Roiland manages to speak out, “So, what was your idea?”
Harmon gingerly picks up the notepad underneath piles of shit and jizz. “ This. This is our masterpiece, Roiland”


“ Oh god, Dan. This is going to be the season finale, Dan. I’m so turned on right now.”


“ Do you want to go to Arby’s and order a brisket burger?”


“ Yeah man, gotta prepare for Season 3.”

I am currently doing an internship and I know this automation skill can pay off big time, the problem is, I don't know what I don't know...and I feel like I am in the dark because I am not aware of what else I need to learn in order to get a job making scripts and small tools that can automate SCCM 2012 to pull server data, collections data, etc. I want to learn DSC next, then maybe some GUI to the current tools I made, and then something else...but what? Server 2016? Nano Server? PowerCLI with VMware? Puppet? Chef? Ansible?...as you can tell...I am at a loss for my next steps. I still have a while to go in terms of perfecting my scripting and tool making skills (those are happening daily on the job and some at home).

How much does a developer with POSH scripting and tool-making can expect to make per hour? Lets say we add SCCM 2012 automation to it as well?

Thank you for your help!

Member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif) is calling for an end to the investigation. As Schiff sees it, ""the hearings can serve no useful purpose. Closing them down will save the taxpayers' money.""

Schiff, who has attended only one of the Committee's 45 sessions, reasoned that ""even if it is incontrovertibly proven that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was responsible for the lapses that resulted in the death of Ambassador Stevens and several others there is no remedy Congress can implement. The dead cannot be brought back to life. And Mrs. Clinton has already resigned the post.""

The Congressman pooh-poohed the possibility that criminal liability might be shown. ""Bad judgment is not a felony,"" Schiff argued. ""Selecting a local Muslim cadre to provide security may have been stupid. Blocking a rescue attempt may have been cowardly. Concocting a false cover story may have been dishonest, but such stories are routine tools of diplomacy.""

Bryan Pagliano, the man who set up Mrs. Clinton's private email account announced that he will avail himself of the US Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination if he is required to appear before the Committee. Schiff cited this as ""further proof that there is no smoking gun to be found by continuing the investigation.""

""At best, Congress might urge the Attorney General to press ahead with a criminal investigation, but does anyone sincerely believe a serious investigation would be undertaken?"" Schiff jibed. ""Isn't it more likely that Attorney General Lynch would either decline to take up the matter or simply issue a finding of insufficient evidence? And let's not forget that President Obama could just pardon Mrs. Clinton and spare the country further agony.""

Poor Turnout for Screening of Planned Parenthood Videos

The Susan B. Anthony List invited 2,000 Democratic Congressional staffers to a screening of the undercover videos that have been released by the Center for Medical Progress. Only ten showed up. Only three would look at any of the videos. Only two unpaid interns watched all 90 minutes of tape.

SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser acknowledged that ""viewing the horrors shown to be taking place at Planned Parenthood is difficult. Nevertheless, awareness of the enormity of the crimes being committed by this organization is an important step if we hope to end them. Abortionists in this country have murdered over 50 million children. By shining more light on some of these atrocities the Center for Medical Progress may spur the type of action needed to put a stop to the continued slaughter of innocents.""

In contrast, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) praised ""the courage of our dedicated staffers for resisting this emotional appeal aimed at diverting them from aiding our Party in its pursuit of a progressive agenda. Using pictures of chopped up babies and covertly obtained tapes of Planned Parenthood officials haggling with anti-abortion activists posing as prospective buyers of these fetal tissues is reprehensible. This time they have gone too far. I am hopeful that the callous invasion of privacy perpetrated by the Center for Medical Progress and abetted by the Susan B. Anthony List won't go unpunished now that they have exposed themselves for what they are.""

Clinton Apologizes for ""People's Confusion about My Emails""

In yet another attempt to dampen the negative implications emanating from her 2009 decision to use a private email account for official State Department business, Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was ""sorry that people are so confused by the issue.""

Clinton acknowledged that ""the decision was not well thought out. I didn't stop to think about the potential downside of using an unsecured network for the highly confidential messages my work would entail. I was too eager to dive into the much more important business of resolving the diplomatic mess left behind by the outgoing Bush Administration.""

The presidential candidate then sought to clarify matters ""for voters who have been misled by Republican efforts to use this complex situation for political advantage. My decision to use a private account for public business was not an unusual one. While it may not have been in accord with statutory law, it was a common practice authorized by President Obama and was widely used within the Administration. That I am being singled out for scrutiny is a desperate ploy by the GOP to try to block my ascension to the presidency.""

While admitting that her private email account may have been hacked (this week a private hacker offered Mrs. Clinton's 30,000 emails for sale with a $500,000 price tag), she contended that ""continued prying into this past history risks exposing vital secrets to our more dangerous enemies—not the Chinese, Russians, or even the Islamic State—but the right-wing elements who have a realistic chance of undoing the progressive reforms of President Obama that my election in 2016 would preserve and build upon.""

In related news, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's speculation that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's personal aide Huma Abedin may have shared her classified emails with her husband—Anthony Weiner—was labeled ""absurd"" by the former congressman. ""These are not the kind of emails my wife and I send to each other,"" Weiner said. ""Anyone who knows me and knows my history with emails and sexts also knows I have no interest in such matters. Huma would never send me boring memos on ISIS or Russia. She knows my taste runs more toward the erotic.""

Judge Defends Jailing of Kentucky Clerk

Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, was led away in shackles after U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered her to be held in jail until she agrees to comply with his orders.

Bunning justified the harsh treatment calling ""contempt of court among the most serious offenses against the rule of law in this country. The humiliation of shackles and the open-ended nature of the incarceration is needed to strike fear into both Ms. Davis and others who night contemplate challenging our authority.""

The judge belittled Davis' contention that her natural right to freedom of religion was being infringed, saying that ""the idea of natural law superseding court authority would be a dangerous precedent. The US Constitution firmly establishes the courts as the ultimate arbiter of justice. Government officers at all levels—federal, state, and local—cannot refuse to carry out what a court directs them to do. Likewise, any statute or ordinance that is incompatible with a court's ruling must be swept aside.""

Kerry Sees Lessons from WWII for Fight against Global Warming

US Secretary of State John Kerry told attendees at the Global Leadership in the Arctic conference in Alaska that global warming presents a threat every bit as severe as World War II did 75 years ago.

""World War II was the most disastrous event of the twentieth century,"" Kerry said. ""Over 50 million people died as a result. Global warming could easily top that toll. That is why it is imperative that the leaders of the world steel themselves for the hard choices they will have to make to combat this threat.""

An example of the kind of hard choice leaders have to steel themselves to make is ""the possible internment of potentially dangerous segments of the population. Students of history recall that US President Franklin Roosevelt took the hard step of imprisoning Americans of Japanese descent. It is not too difficult to envision a future president taking a similar step to imprison global warming deniers in order to prevent them from impeding the actions necessary to stave off undesirable climate change.""

""Maybe a stint in an internment camp will aid in reeducating these misguided individuals,"" Kerry hoped. ""But we must be prepared for sterner measures if mere internment fails to do the job. The United States undertook some harsh actions to ensure that World War II could be won. We may have to undertake similarly harsh actions to ensure that the fight against global warming is won.""

Boehner Outraged over Mountain Name Change

This week, President Obama announced he was using his executive authority to rename the nation's tallest peak Mount Denali. The peak was named after former President William Mckinley by Congress in 1917. McKinley's career of public service included a stint in the US House of Representatives, a term as Governor of Ohio, and a a bit more than one term as President from 1897 until he was assassinated in 1901 after being reelected in 1900.

A red-faced House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) called President Obama's unilateral decision to rename Mount McKinley ""an outrage. It makes my blood boil. This mountain was named by an Act of Congress. President Obama has no right to change it without Congress' consent. He has acted lawlessly.""

Presidential Press Secretary Josh Earnest found Boehner's objections ""amusing. There is nothing in the Constitution that gives Congress the authority to name mountains. There is nothing in the Constitution barring the President from changing the names of mountains. There is nothing that Mr. Boehner can do to undo what President Obama has done.""

The project's scope felt tremendous because it was all new to me, and I did most of programming (Univ. research internship). As challenging as it was I enjoyed every bit of it. It felt amazing to literally wake up to your mind already brainstorming ideas that would further the project (because a lot of snags were encountered). 

When finishing the internship I told myself I'd start doing more hardware development, specifically with drones. So to get into the hobby I bought a blade Nano QX and a raspberry pi 2b. For the past week I've been thinking of projects to do with the pi and/or quad, and found this [frontal obstacle detection and avoidance video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QQCGLKuUxc&amp;index=3&amp;list=WL). 

I want to replicate that project but with my Nano QX (if possible). 

Does this [Transceiver](http://www.amazon.com/nRF24L01-Wireless-Transceiver-Arduino-Compatible/dp/B00E594ZX0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441408120&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=2.4+ghz+radio+module) work for communicating control commands to the quad? If no, would it be more feasible to disassemble the controller it came with, and some how set it up with the raspberry pi?

Also, how do I setup the appropriate receiver for this [camera](http://www.amazon.com/Spektrum-FPV-Ultra-Micro-Camera/dp/B00N3WQVJ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441408639&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Ultra+Micro+FPV+Camera+and+Video+Transmitter)?

I don't know anymore.,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3jsshq/a_long_series_of_coincidences_i_dont_know_anymore/,"I've been an atheist since I was 11, so for more than 10 years at this point. God has never 'called' me. I've never 'felt' Jesus, and I can honestly say that every expression of faith I've ever seen has appeared completely inauthentic to me.

A ~week before the semester started, I was walking around my neighborhood, getting some exercise, stretching my legs, etc. when this man I've never met before walks up beside me (weird, but whatever). We have a nice conversation about football oddly enough, but what I remember about the conversation was the way it ended. He says he needs to get back, so I stop to give him a handshake, but instead he puts his hands on my shoulders, looks me in the eyes, and says ""God bless you, brother"", and walks off. That's it. I'm puzzled, definitely, but what happened is not completely out of the ordinary; maybe he is just a very devout Christian. 

So fast forward a few days. I'm chilling with my three best friends from childhood (I've literally known these guys for 15 years). All of them are Catholics, and they know I'm an atheist. I've very frequently taken the blowtorch to their faith, but all three of them as pretty intellectual guys, aren't offended by this and like me, enjoy the discussion. We don't actually end up having that conversation, but we do end up talking briefly about this evangelical campus ministry group. None of them are actually that hot on the group, and the friend that goes to my university remarks that they are 'Jesus freaks', and that he doesn't attend their meetings. I make a couple of jokes but I guess it piqued my curiosity. 

Fast forward a few more days. I decide to volunteer for this event where we show around freshmen to their first day of classes. I didn't know at the time but it's not actually something that individuals typically volunteer for... It's all different campus groups/sororities/frats (mostly the latter two). So I'm standing in line, feeling very out of place, but it just so happens that the person immediately behind me is alone as well (again keep in mind that *everyone* else is with a group of friends or something). She strikes up a conversation with me and gradually I learn that she is member of the campus ministry group I was joking about with my friends. She came late and is separated from that group. We have a nice conversation and in the end she invites me to go hang out with them later that night. I consider it but ultimately decide not to go. However, the chances of what just transpired happening seem low to me...

Fast forward a few more days. I walk by their table in the main student lunch area (Clubs set up for the first few days of the semester to recruit new members), and consider stopping to get information. In the end I don't, but as I'm leaving the building guess who I run into? The very same girl I met when I volunteered.... This is a very big campus, with more than 40k students on it. What are the chances that I walk by their table, and within the space of a minute run into the one member I know? Anyway we have another conversation, she invites me again to a different event, and this time, I go. 

Fast forward a few days, I'm at their event, it's crowded, nothing remarkable happens, and as I expected the whole thing feels inauthentic to me. I'm about to leave (and never come back), when one of the student leaders (not the girl I met earlier) sort of corners me and asks how I found the event. What follows is an awkward conversation, where she is trying to witness to me/convert me (at this point I think she thinks I'm just a lukewarm Catholic, not an atheist), and I am trying to contain my laughter, because she is hilariously bad at it. Ultimately I guess she succeeds in a way because I end up getting dragged along to their sort of 'after party', where I end up having a little better time. 

Regardless, I'm ready to end my flirtation with evangelical Christianity at this point. Once again though, something happens. The group has these dinners every week, and they're hosted within walking distance of my house, but if that wasn't enough, they're hosted *on the very same street* that I walk down when I go for my walks around the neighborhood. (...) I've been walking past that apartment complex for months. So anyway I'm going on my walk, and the man I was talking to before strolls up beside me. We have another pleasant conversation, but he decides to bid me farewell in a very unusual place... directly in front of the complex where these dinners are hosted. Allow me to be clear here, I am saying literally ""directly in front of"", not ""in the vicinity of"". Once again he puts his hands on my shoulders, and says ""God bless you, brother"" and walks away.

At this point I now think I'm being played for the fool. This is some sort of evangelical conspiracy. Somehow, this man, my friends, and the Christians in this group are all connected. It's not inconceivable. I go home, and I look under a lot of electronic rocks, if you will. I build dossiers on the leaders of the group, the interns, and the student leaders (I'm a computer guy, and paranoid, so I'm good at this sort of thing). I don't think my friends would do this to me, but at this point I'm questioning our relationship. However, I can't find anything that suggests this is a common tactic, and I'm not self-absorbed enough to believe that all of these people would conspire to convert/prank me without evidence that is indeed the case, so I chalk it up to a coincidence. For some reason, though, I decide to go to their family dinner. It was curiosity, and partly just to see what, if anything, was going to happen (there was a part of me that thought this was some sort of practical joke/conspiracy, still). I had a good time, but nothing happens, except that I discover a new carbonated beverage (It's called La Croix, great stuff, we will get back to this later..). I let out a sigh of relief. When I leave I'm thinking ""I'm done, that was fun, but I'm done"".

Nope. Fast-forward a few more days. I find myself stuck on campus, at the exact time one of their weekly meetings start (How this happened is quite a coincidence, but more personal than I'm willing to share) The *only* building that's going to be open at this point is the building they are actually in. I could of avoided it sure... but I didn't.

Once again the service is completely inauthentic to me, and once again they make a hilariously bad attempt to 'bring me to Jesus', but I meet a few people I seem to be able to interact with decently well at the 'after party'. I decide to go to the next family dinner as a result of those positive interactions, and have a fantastic time. 

So, third meeting night. This time I go of my own accord, no weirdness. As it turns out this is the meeting where they push their mission conferences and stuff. (They actually push them at every meeting, something I dislike, but I try and realize that it's probably very appealing to everyone else in the room) I hate feeling like I'm being sold on something, and the way they were going about was just really a turn-off to me, so I went out of the room to use the restroom and get a drink of water. As I walk back towards the room, I'm seriously considering bailing on this meeting and walking right on by, but there is this guy (a part of the group, didn't know him well) standing in front of the door pacing back and forth. He is obviously distressed. I ask him what's up and that results in a long conversation (really mostly him talking) where he was able to vent a lot of stuff on his mind to me. Throughout the conversation I couldn't help but notice how authentic his faith (and doubt) was, even though he was obviously telling me some very painful things. His authenticity was refreshing, and we ended up talking until the meeting was over.

So, fast-forward exactly a day. They are having a guys night out, but I'm late and miss the metaphorical bus. When I realize this is the case I'm sad, but I'm also mad that I'm sad. I'm mad that I've allowed myself to look forward to this event. I'm mad that I cared. So I'm walking around a field on campus reflecting on this, and how perhaps I've opened myself too much to this group, when a group of female soccer players jog by me and say something really nasty, obviously directed at me. I think they thought I was there to stare at/stalk them. I guess it looked odd that I was walking around the field, I don't know. Anyway that sort of shocked me out of my thoughts but made everything feel worse for some reason.  

About five minutes later I get on a bus that will take me back home. I'm sitting there drinking my new favorite beverage, La Croix, and I guess I looked a bit dejected. The man sitting across from me (never met him before) notices, and says ""How can you drink from the Cross and be sad?"" with a smile. I gave him a very quizzical look and he told me that ""La Croix"", is french for ""The Cross"". I laugh and make a joke about how it should be burning my atheist face off; he laughs as well but then says with a smile ""I'm not so sure about that. God has a plan for you"". I may have rolled by eyes, and he said with half a laugh, ""That's part of God's plan too, your lack of faith"". I honestly didn't want to create a scene, but I have never heard a believer say that my atheism was part of ""God's plan"". I let it drop, so he changes the subject, and we have a nice conversation despite initial awkwardness. When we get up to get off the bus, I offer to shake his hand... but he puts his hands on my shoulders, and says ""God bless you, brother"", and walks off. Dumbfounded, I get off the bus and walk to my car, where I sit for a long time.

I don't understand anymore. This shit keeps happening, and I know how this probably sounds. I sound insane; I sound like the kind of person I would mock. It is human nature to see meaning where there is none, patterns where none exist, signal in complete noise, but all of this has happened over the space of a few weeks. I still resolutely believe I'm experiencing confirmation bias, and I've made a herculean effort over last day to think of all the unremarkable interactions I've had over that period. I wasn't dragged into these meetings; there were some unique circumstances surrounding my ability/desire to go, but I went of my own volition, which makes all that has happened less remarkable and more likely coincidental... but there is still a part of me that thinks otherwise. The three farewells, done in the exact same way.. I can't even fathom that. I have *never* bid farewell that way before. It seems arrogant and stupid to think that, of the tens of millions of atheists that die every day, that God (if he exists) seems to have a plan for me, that he is ""targeting"" me for conversion... or something. There's no reason why in a unordered universe all of this could not have happened completely by chance... I just don't know anymore."

I've always been a very shy person, so making friends for me has always been difficult. After high school, all the people I knew left for out of state colleges, and I lost contact with them because I was taking a few years off. I then started working in retail, met some people, but it wasn't real friendship, just work friends, I also met my boyfriend there, and he's been wonderful.

I left the retail job after I started school up again and got an internship related to my major. My internship is good, my bosses really like me, and they're keeping me until I graduate, I moved in with my boyfriend, things are good... I just can't make friends.

I try to make friends with people in my classes, invite them to play video games, or Magic the gathering, or just hang out, but everyone just ends up flaking on me. I invite some of the guys that work at my internship to go out with me and my boyfriend as like a double date thing, they agree, but then again flake out.

I'm really depressed, I have no one now except my boyfriend, and if he leaves to go out with his friends for a birthday or something, I'm just home alone, constantly reminded that no one wants to be around me, and no body likes me, and that if I died, people wouldn't notice. 

I just don't want to be alone, but I'm forgetting how to talk to people, every social situation I just wish I was invisible. I want to make friends, but I'm tired of being rejected, I don't want to be this alone..."

I recently graduated from college and it's been a few months and right now I feel depressed and lonely. For all my life that it's been important, school has always been at the forefront and gave me social interaction and I always loved it for that. I am an introvert and value alone time but now, being at home with a parent and not being able to drive while living in the middle of nowhere, it's all getting to me. I have no job and my parent wishes for me to have one in our small town, which is fine, but I want a job in a city. I never was able to have a lot of opportunities in college because of helping with a family business and not being able to afford staying at my out of state college, so I couldn't get an internship. It's hard for me to meet new people but I can hold my own. Right now I just feel stuck.
When I was younger and in high school I did the horrible thing of pretending to me someone on the Internet that I wasn't and I hurt people because of it. I did it because I was lonely but I stopped it after one incident. I don't ever want to go back to that but I am realizing that I may have been lonely for a lot longer than I've realized.
I've always had friends but now, most of my friends are out of state aside from two who live further away from me. Not having a means to drive (no license and no car) I just have nothing right now, especially since we aren’t all that big on texting one another every day. I have some people online I can talk to but they've gotten busier as they are going to school and doing things while I'm just stuck here.
I've never felt alone like this. Even when I took a year off from school I never felt this way before. My one friends said if I got a job closer to the city we could move in together when they got a job too, but that seems so far from my grasp as no one really wants to hire recent graduates in my field unless there's 6+ years of experience to their name.
Romance has never been that big of a thing for me, I just always feel so undesired (socially and sexually. I'm nearing my mid-twenties and am still a virgin and having only been in online relationships pretending to be someone else) but that isn't what I think will make me feel fulfilled. I wish I had it but I think I more just want people to be around
I think I'm rambling now but everything seems so... bleak. I feel so alone the more I think about others going to school or going out while I’m left here alone."

A brief background between me and the girl that we will call ""B"".

Some stuff about me that I think might contribute to an answer. I don't really date at all. The last time I had a ""relationship"" with a girl was maybe in 8th grade but I don't count that since I was a kid. I remember being able to talk to girls really easily back then but now I get fairly nervous. When it comes to guys, I'll be loud and confident but this confidence flips when I talk with girls. My head goes blank and I don't know what to talk about anymore. There are only a few girls I'm able to talk easily with and that is because either they approach me or I've known them for a long time. 

B is a very dense but caring girl. Although she can't pick up on signals most of the time, I already know she doesn't mean it on purpose. B started doing an Internship during the summer which resulted in her getting to know a guy we will call ""J"". J started flirting with B which ended up turning into B thinking about dating him. She did end up saying no but I got pretty jealous. Also due to this internship, she ended up able to go on a trip to another state with our interns.

B and I knew each other since sophomore year but we didn't talk a lot until the December of Junior year(last year). We got fairly close and it eventually grew into me growing very fond of her and developing feelings that I made sure to hide. Summer of this year came around and we talked and became closer. 

I decided that I was going to ask her out. I did so during a Skype call we had one night(we skyped almost every night for hours). Basically what came of it was that she wanted to think about it. Fast forward 1 week and she says she doesn't want a relationship for a few reasons. One was that her mom wouldn't let her(her mother kept an eye on us all the time when I came over and knew that we skyped at night), she wasn't ready, and she wanted to focus in school for Senior year(saying that I distract her a lot in a positive way).

Yeah like everyone would imagine, I was pretty heartbroken. I honestly imagined her saying no and thinking I was ready for it but reality hurts. So basically for most of the summer after this event we had our ups and downs which resulted in us not talking for a few days(this happened maybe 2-4 times). I'll be honest, most of these arguments were because of me being so hot headed. No there wasn't any yelling. It was just me being sad/mad that I got rejected and also because B can be very dense. The other times that it was B's fault is because she said some things that made me pretty sad and made me think our friendship was nothing. She ended up realizing what she said and apologized but it just had lingering effects that hurt me.

Nearing the end of summer she left to go on a trip from her internship with the other interns. I was pretty worried about her going on this trip due to her going to be surrounded by people she doesn't know and that they will be a few years older than her. Especially since J was going too, it made me even more worried.

So a few days pass and we text each other back and forth. Seems like everything is going well, that's good. Right? Nope. Everything starts to fuck itself around on the 3rd night. B sends me a snapchat of her face with the caption ""This trip fucking sucks"". This just made me worry a a lot. I text her and snapchat her back asking what's wrong, do you need help etc. Then she sends one captioning ""Boys fucking suck"". This is when my heart starts beating fast making me worry a lot and thoughts kept rolling on into my head. What's wrong? Did something happen with J? Did something happen at a party she maybe went to?

I ended up telling her that I will wait for her reply if she needed any help. Then comes the part where I got pretty ticked off. She ends up saying it was nothing at all and it was just a random thought that popped up in her head that she sent to her close friends. My first thought that I told her was that either she was lying to me or she didn't want to tell me. Then I decided to rant on saying the usual, I was worried about you. I told her I didn't expect her to understand how I was feeling because she didn't harbor the same feelings I did for her as she did for me. I then said my heart couldn't take something like that again and that we should not talk for a few days while I cool down. That was the last thing I texted to her. She sent me one final text too that basically said ""Oh it was just a random though"" and ""Why should I tell you things when you don't tell me stuff too?"". Although I don't tell her things, they aren't stuff that is bad but things I would rather not talk about. I do tell her I just don't want to talk about it but I guess that leaves a bitter taste in her mouth.

One month has passed and we haven't talked to each other at all. School started and I actually see her around a lot. During the first few days of school we saw each other in the hall ways a lot. But following the next few days I noticed she started taking different routes to avoid seeing me. Maybe it's just me but it feels that way. 

So here's the problem. Did I overact and is it all my fault?Also I can't get her out of my head. I deleted her off snapchat to avoid seeing her story which reminded me of her and deleted Skype just so I wouldn't end up checking Skype to see if she messaged me. I really want to apologize but I don't know if she even wants to talk to me at all anymore and even if I was going to, I don't know how I should do it.

Any advice is appreciated and thank you for reading this."

That's it for this week, quite a lot of stuff. Since I'm back in college, more time to do Creature fan stuff. I also tried a new format with the Personal Channels, let me know if you like it or not. 

Also, some of you may know about [The Creature Wiki](http://thecreatures.wikia.com/wiki/The_Creatures_Wiki). I've noticed many Critters use it for info and whatnot, and I'm asking if anyone would be interested in helping out the wiki a bit. I've been away from working on it, being burnt out and all from working this summer, but I'd like to get back to work on every Creature-related thing I help with, including the wiki. Anything I can do to help and whatnot, I guess.

At any rate, let me know if you'd like to help with either the wiki, these weekly updates, both, or neither. Send me a message, /u/LeonZetineb here or [LeonThePeon](http://thecreatures.wikia.com/wiki/User:LeonThePeon) on the wiki. Help anywhere is appreciated!

Stay awesome, Critters!

3ju8bx,1,2015-09-06,Leaving home -- I've failed before,MonsieurBrightside,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3ju8bx/leaving_home_ive_failed_before/,"I'm 24 and live with my mother in a regional town. 

Two years ago I planned to move out of home for three months for an amazing internships that was really a dream come true. I had to move to a big city about two hours away by plane. When I got to the place I was staying I had a sever panic attack that saw me immediately leave and catch a flight home -- and I mean immediately. I probably spent about three hours in the city in total on that terrible day. 

I was able to defer my internship for a year. During that time I saw a psychologist and planned to make sure that when I tried again. I wouldn't have another panic attack. I prepared throughout the year and finally went back to the big city. 

I lasted two days. It was virtually a two day panic attack. My brother was with me for support, I called helplines, I took Valium: nothing worked and I went home again. 

I obviously have separation anxiety. I was a very sick child and spent a lot of time at home and out of school, with my mum taking care of me. I also have depression which is treated with Zoloft. 

At the end of this year, I'm going to try and leave home again, but this time to a different city that is a two hour drive away.  At first, I'm going to go for just three weeks, but about a month after that I need to move permanently for a new job. This is my third (and it feels like final) chance to do this and break out of this anxiety.

Has anyone had similar experiences that would be helpful for me to read about?

I'm still seeing a psychologist, but at the moment I'm still worried that I'll just break down again. I'm worried I'll feel alone and out of place. "

I'm French and about to obtain my master's degree, so I started to look for a job and I've got a few offers in Ireland.
One of them is asking what salary I would be aiming for in Cork, but having never been to Ireland it's kinda hard to say.
Tried to google it a bit, people are saying 25k on forums, the median would apparently be 34k and I find a lot of offers similar to the one I got between 40 and 60k, so pretty huge difference between the lower and higher I saw.

I know that here I would be asking for 34k, and for Paris maybe 38k, but the cost of living in Ireland seems different.
I do have experience though, I worked as a devops for a little over two years, and as a Linux sysadmin also for about two years. Did two other years of customer support and computer maintenance before that, but that's probably not very relevant to the offer. Some of that was part-time but most of it full-time (lots of ""internship"" in my school, where I found actual jobs instead).

Any idea of what would be reasonable to ask ? Already got a few different offers all over, but Ireland seems cool."

Here's my current one-liner:

    l=float(input('Amount: '));print(['%d%s'%((c*100,'¢'),(c,'€'))[c&gt;=1] for c,n,_ in [(c,l//c,globals().update(l=round(l%c,2))) for c in [2,1,.5,.2,.1,.05,.02,.01]] for _ in range(int(n)) if n])

3jv6yj,4,2015-09-06,My (M22) ldr gf (F21) of 3.5 years thinks I don't care enough,hubda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3jv6yj/my_m22_ldr_gf_f21_of_35_years_thinks_i_dont_care/,"We've both just entered our senior years of college. They're about 4 hours away so we dedicate about a weekend each month for visits. 

Before I get into it I'll give some background where (I think) this whole problem started. In Fall 2014 we were each studying abroad on opposite sides of the world. The time difference made it difficult to plan things but we did get to talk and Skype often enough. 

In the Spring semester, she took an internship that put her a plane ride away. Being back on my home campus myself, I was happy I at least had that. We still got to speak daily and Skype about once or twice a week. I came to visit a few times. 

Her internship went through the summer too and I had my own internship closer to my school. Still a plane ride away but we got to speak more than during the semester. We tried to have visits once a month-month and a half. 

There was one week where I had a lot going on and we didn't get to speak as much. She would call and sometimes I would ask if I could call her back later but not soon enough. At some point she revealed that she thought I was ignoring her more than I used to (it might have been true but not intentionally) and didn't think I missed her enough. I said that I'd call her more frequently, so I didn't and she seemed to be fine. 

She returned from her internship and had 2.5 weeks free at home so we spent almost all of it together. Then school started about a week ago. 

She cherishes her independence and loves being with her friends at school so I try to be as minimally invasive as possible. I'm the same way so it works out for both of us. However we do get to speak with each other for short amounts of time on most days and for an hour or two on weekends including a Skype session. 

This semester just started so both of us are excited to be back on campus. We got to talk more than usual which I thought was weird because it didn't seem like she was with her friends as much as previous semesters. 

Yesterday we were speaking on the phone and I asked her how her friends were doing and if she got to hang out with them because this was the most I got to speak with her. 

She took it as me passive aggressively saying that I wished that we didn't speak so much. My guess is that it's still the same problem that we had over the summer. I can't convince her that that's not what I meant. She said she thinks I'm not doing enough for the relationship. So now she's second guessing the relationship and whether it is actually working. 

So far, we've been calling every day, Skyped once (we had to keep putting it off for other things but it eventually happened), and am planning a trip to visit her but I can't book it just yet. I asked her what she is expecting in an ideal relationship but she said she doesn't know. 

So now I'm not sure what to do. Any advice? How can I make her feel like I care? 

Tl;Dr: gf and I are 4 hours apart until December. We speak every day, have long conversations about twice a week, and are planning visits each month. I said that so far we spoke more than in previous semesters and she thinks that was passive aggressive for ""we're talking too much"". I can't convince her otherwise. How can I show I care more for the relationship?"
3jvhxx,4,2015-09-06,"I feel beautiful, until I'm reminded that I'm fat.",SomaticAtom,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3jvhxx/i_feel_beautiful_until_im_reminded_that_im_fat/,"I've been overweight my whole life. Ever since I was a little kid. I don't know what it's like to wear a bikini, to not have to worry about if I'll fit in an airplane seat or on a roller coaster ride, or if people are judging me for what I'm eating. I constantly worry about these things.

However, when these things aren't happening, I feel beautiful. I feel beautiful when my friends and I are taking a road trip, or watching a movie. However, if I'm doing anything where my weight could be a factor, I go into a sort of panic...and hold myself back from doing things I actually want to do, like dancing for example.

Often times too when I'm getting ready to go out, I'll put on a shirt, and I'll keep having to pull it down because my hips are so wide that it rides up and my underwear hang out, because pants never fit me properly.

I can barely sit cross legged on the floor because of my huge thighs. Worst of all, I just feel guilty every time I eat...but then I taste something delicious and I cannot stop myself.

How am I, a nearly 300 pound monster, supposed to pursue my dreams of teaching English overseas if I can't even get my weight under control? I'm the biggest person in this intern house and...it sucks. I feel like I just want to rip this weight off me...I literally want to rip  my own skin off...

I know I need to eat fewer calories...I know I do. It's just hard for me to have stuff in the house that isn't processed or pantry related. I know I need to move more, but when I come home from a 10 hour day at work, all I want to do is sleep.

All of my thoughts are just getting jumbled together now...I just want to be thin."
3jvtds,3,2015-09-06,Potential Second Degree CS Student Questions,YetAnotherCSNewb,gmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/gmu/comments/3jvtds/potential_second_degree_cs_student_questions/,"I've recently gotten into programming and am decided about getting a second degree, but I'm considering different options about where to go. GMU is local to me (I live in Springfield), so it's the most convenient choice besides an online program (there's only one I'm considering), so I'm curious about the opportunities Mason CS students have. 

I've been perusing the career fair pages for the past couple years, and there's lots of good opportunities listed there, but the vast majority seem to be in the area and, to be honest, I'm looking to leave the area. Do Mason students often get internships and jobs after graduation at companies outside the area through hustle on their own? Are there any other career fairs GMU CS students can attend in the area? It's not entirely clear if GMU students can attend UMD's CS career fair, for instance, and that has a lot of internships I'd love to have the opportunity to get. 

Also, are there any particular differences between Applied CS and just plain CS? It seems Applied CS gives you more opportunity to focus on what you want to focus on, but I'm not sure if one looks better on a resume or not. I'd get a concentration in Software Engineering if I went that route, if that's relevant. "
3jvx4f,1,2015-09-06,Having trouble navigating/adjusting to new internship. Any thoughts or help?,Peasantpeace,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3jvx4f/having_trouble_navigatingadjusting_to_new/,"So, hi. Have lurked here before, never really felt the courage to really post something, but I felt I could use some help and don't know where else to really get it. 

I haev struggled with depression for quite a long time now and I have been diagnosed with it also. I have been medicated but am currently not on meds. Despite my problems, I have always been a high-achieving student although I haven't worked in addition to my studies for a while now. I quite hate myself for that, although I try to remind myself that no one in my specific program works (it's quite notorious for being a difficult program that asks a lot of its students). 

As a part of my program I am required to do an internship. I won't give anymore details as to what it is, for privacy reasons. It is however a quite draining field of work and it turns out a lot of things that I thought were arranged are not, and I need to do all these things myself in addition to learning all kinds of new stuff. Yes, school prepared me in some ways but the field is also stressful and has a lot of unexpected things happening and school can never prepare you for the actual experience. 

I have been having trouble getting up in the morning, with lots of suicidal thoughts even (I would never actually do something to myself, just to get that clear). I wake up dreading going to this intership, and I have had that with other jobs as well. I am really, really angry at myself for this, because part of me believes this to be laziness and unwillingness to work an amount that normal people work every day (the internship is full-time). However, another part of me thinks this is unfair because I do go every day, never make excuses to skip work or leave early and I work hard to arrange stuff. It's particularly bad in the morning, although I also sometimes get it before I go to bed. 

My question is does anyone have experience with this? Is this depression, or am I lazy? And is there anything I can do against it? I just keep thinking I will have to finish this internship to graduate, and also I will have to work the rest of my life, I can't possibly deal with this for the rest of my life? Thank you in advance! 

TL;DR: Have new internship, also have depression, finding it really really hard to get up in the morning and suffer from bad depression when having to go to work. Help?"

I am a current college freshmen at a small local university.  I have been networking as much as I can as a freshmen, (going to club meetings and all firms recruitment days on campus) and have discussed opportunities for freshmen to explore accounting and future internships with Big 4 recruiters.  Since applying to this school my plan was to later transfer to a larger state school after the first year, assuming my grades allowed for it, but now I am beginning to reconsider.  I am nervous at a larger state school it will be harder to get an internship and even talk to Big 4 recruiters. I also worry this year of networking and attending events may be useless if I have to meet all new recruiters next year.  Here I feel I stand out and at a larger school I may just be another student.  Does anyone have any experience or advice on this topic and suggestions on whether to stay or transfer.  Thank you!

3jx9oz,1,2015-09-06,Not sure if I should apply for this internship,bumpervb,SeriousConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/3jx9oz/not_sure_if_i_should_apply_for_this_internship/,"So I'm in my junior year studying documentary film at a university which, with how my program works, means I'm in my first semester in my emphasis area. I was admitted to the program in January so I was able to take related classes and meet my professors last semester.

One of them needed students to help him edit a project he's working on which I am continuing this semester. Before becoming a professor, he lived in New York working with a production company. Lately he's been telling me to apply for an internship there over the summer. I have never left the Midwest for more than a vacation, and I have always dreamed of living in New York or Seattle. It would be an amazing opportunity but I have a few hang ups...

1. The program requires that you pick between production and post-production. I have a lot of editing experience, and I find it really soothing. But I also love cinematography and getting well composed shots. I feel like I have more to learn with cinematography, but based on what I have seen from the website, it looks like I would mostly just be setting up talking heads and checking sound. I feel like if I take the post-production track I'll just be doing more of what I do now, but I wouldn't actually have a chance to learn a lot of new stuff if I applied for production.

2. This may sound silly, but I almost don't want to expose myself to New York only to have to come back to the Midwest. I don't see myself adapting well to the return. I've always been more eager to explore new places than my friends and family, and I struggled a lot with feeling trapped before moving out. Even now, I feel like I've seen all there is to see in this town, and I'm not sure that it'll stand up after New York. It would be one thing if I knew it was going to be an amazing senior year, but I will be spending the whole year working on my capstone on top of trying to cram in an entire second minor in my last three semesters. I can already see myself getting demotivated by a kind of homesickness for the city and I haven't even lived there yet.

3. I hate flying. This is so stupid that it's even a factor in my decision, but I've had panic attacks for a few years and the first really bad one I had was on a plane a little over 5 years ago. I haven't flown since. I know I need to just get on a plane and get it over with, but I keep wanting to prolong that as much as possible.

4. For our capstone we have to make a full documentary, and my professors recommend using the summer to film so we can spend the school year editing and getting footage we may need to sprinkle in later. But with the type of film that I prefer, I would ideally spend time with my main character and capture some sort of timeline of his/her life, which couldn't be done in the school year. If I take the internship I don't think that I would have time to find that character in the city AND film him/her when he/she is actually doing something worth filming.

5. When I left for school, I was only going 4 1/2 hours from home and there isn't even a time change. I knew several people from home who went to school and I was never far enough away from my friends that I couldn't be there relatively soon if they ever needed me. I'm just now starting to build some good relationships with people here, so I don't want to leave them in the summer when they're all spending more time together, and I don't want any of my friends to feel like I'm too busy for them or simply too far away to ask for help.


All that said, I would love to have a connection with this production company, and any work that I get to do on a film, my own or others, brightens my day. It really is what I love to do, but right now I'm just not sure whose work deserves my attention. If anyone else has been in a similar situation or has a clear view of what to do, pls halp."
3jxgbj,14,2015-09-06,An awkward question about volunteering...,Question12312312,Lessig2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lessig2016/comments/3jxgbj/an_awkward_question_about_volunteering/,"Firstly, The campaign just hit the $1 million dollar mark! Whohoo! I literally couldn't breath when I found out (and no, I'm not using the word *'literally'* wrong: I just had 2 puffs of Ventolin...)

I'm a high school senior who is really passionate about politics (especially US politics) and I really want to do something for this campaign. The problem is, however, that I'm not American... or living in the US ... or legally allowed to donate... 

But because I'm Canadian, American politics affect my country and me very much. A more democratic US will lead to a better and more democratic Canada. Hell, a more democratic US will make the world a **much** better place. Regardless, I also just really like US politics. I spend at least 4, 5 hours every day reading analysis and watching pundits. I probably can only name two dozen current Canadian politicians while I know the policy positions of most congressmen and women off the top of my head. I really believe in Mr. Lessig's cause and I want desperately to do something but that doesn't look very possible right now.

The only thing I can think of is traveling to the US and volunteering for the campaign in any office that accepts me. I can cover all my costs myself. My school allows, and even encourages, students to take time off for volunteering so it won't be a problem on that front either. 

I don't have much to offer but I'm fluent in both English and Persian. I also can code in C++. I don't have any political volunteering experience but I've done a number of internships so far (one tech internship and two university research internships). [According to the FEC it's legal for a foreigner to volunteer](http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/volact.shtml#foreign) but I'm not really sure how I should proceed. Is there even a slight chance of some field office accepting me? Should I start calling them once they open?

Thank you for you help guys. Go Lessig!"

So about two years ago (a little less) we signed up for SLS and away we went. We met some awesome people and had some great experiences. We truly liked the lifestyle and not just the amazing sex, but meeting like minded people as well.

We are both professionals, as individuals and as a couple we have always been more cautious than careless. After our first soft swap experience we decided that if we were going to go forward with this we were going to do so in the most proactive and careful way possible. We both decided to have STI tests all of which came back negative and also decided that we were going to get the Guardsil vaccine for HPV.

While waiting for the opportune time to get the HPV vaccine (my family works with my doctor so asking him for the vaccine was a not a possibility, although in hindsight I should have done so) we did meet up with two additional couples and had a full swap with them. My wife was able to secure her vaccine and took it before that time, but due to my circumstances I had to go to an out of city sexual health clinic for my vaccine. Anyway I figured no big deal, both couples seemed great and were careful like ourselves... what could go wrong?!

Anyway I took the vaccine over the course of the next 6 months (it has to be taken three times in a 6 month period) and fast forward to two weeks ago and I notice a small...very small reddish bump (right at where a condom would end). At first we thought it was just the result of an ingrown hair as I'm prone to them when manscaping), just last week I found another and this morning another.

At this point I'm highly suspect that it is genital warts. So I do some research and try the vinegar test. Basically you soak some paper towel in vinegar and soak it on your manhood for about 10 minutes. If areas turn white, it is a strong indication, but by no means definitive, sign of genital warts. Unfortunately when I did so the three places turned white as well as a few other much smaller places I didn't even notice.

Anyway my buddy came over and had a look for me (he's a medical intern), he doesn't know about my wife and I's extra-currcilar activities, so I said I had cheated on my wife. When he looked he said he couldn't tell for sure, but if one of his patients were to present that way he would treat as if it were genital warts. He told me that unless they are the obvious, that really there wasn't a definitive way to tell if they were genital warts or not without a biopsy. 

Anyway all the evidence to me clearly points out that they most likely are genital warts. I will see a seasoned doctor to confirm for sure. The strangest thing is my wife has no bumps inside or outside at all. She's going to get a test done just to be sure this week. 

So technically we don't know if it is HPV but all reasonable signs point to it being so.

Anyway we are just both so very bummed out about this. We felt like we went over and beyond to make this lifestyle successful for us and only after dipping our feet in we feel like we will be on the sidelines. After we find out for sure we have to the awkward task of reaching out to our swing friends and letting them know. Something we both are not looking forward to.

From what I read people in our age bracket will likely clear the virus in less than two years. So we have decided that we won't actively look for couples until we are outbreak free for 6 months (a reasonably good indication that the virus has cleared).

Anyway I just wanted to share our story as a word of caution. If you plan to swing get the HPV vaccine before you start, it's available and would protect you from the most common genital warts strains as well as the ones that cause cancers. In this lifestyle it just makes good sense. If people as careful as us can get it, anyone can.

Also I wanted to ask the community if you would pass on a couple that had HPV in the past. I know our answer before this would have been a definite ""no"", but we are hoping that this wont be the end of the lifestyle for us in our lives.

3jxtig,8,2015-09-07,Difficulty in Career Choices,audernaj,AcademicPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/3jxtig/difficulty_in_career_choices/,"Hi!

First of all, I'd like to thank all the folks on this sub who have contributed information about different paths one can take with a psychology degree. It definitely helps to read about the experiences of others before I make any hard and fast decisions. 

I suppose a little background info would help you guys out before I start talking about my current dilemma. I'll be tossing in a little bit of everything, but a lot of info relevant for my grad school applications.

&amp;nbsp;

- I'm currently a senior Psychology major, Honors minor.
- Current general GPA is 3.98, Psych GPA is 4.0.
- I'm the President of our Psychology Club/Psi Chi chapter.
- I've conducted one research study with a professor on eating disorders. I'm currently having another professor review it before I consider submitting it for publication. 
- I am going to be doing another study with that same professor this semester on the religiosity of a person and how that influences/is related to their decisions in ethical dilemma questions (such as the famous trolley problem). 
- I also will be helping him out with some data analysis of older data he's had sitting around but hasn't done anything with. 
- I did an internship at a local children's home for a few months in their recreation therapy department.
- I have done a study abroad program this past summer in Paris.
- I have not currently taken the GRE, but have done practice tests and received scores around low 150s for Quant, around 160 for Verbal. I am planning on taking it at the end of the month, maybe early October. I haven't studied terribly long for this but have been doing several hours a day, a few days a week for a few weeks now. 
- I am on great terms with all of my professors and would have no problem getting glowing letters of rec (my school has small-medium sized classes and I've gotten to know all the professors pretty well. Being involved in department activities and Psychology Club for several years has also helped build rapport).
- I enjoy statistics somewhat, but struggle with the more advanced topics. In a large part this is because I don't regularly do statistics-related tasks. I think that if I was to use statistics regularly, I would understand it more and do better with them. I received an A in my statistics course, but this was an introductory course and we did not cover a lot of advanced material. 

&amp;nbsp;

For a long time, I've been pretty sure a clinical PhD was the path for me. My primary interest area is eating disorders, and I thought perhaps a mix of treatment/therapy and research would satiate my interest in both. However, recently I'm not too sure that's what I want to do. I've been prepping for the GRE and as a result have been doing a lot of digging into career options, realistic scenarios with respect to academia-based employment, and overall getting a sense of what the real world is like with a psychology degree. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I'm not so sure. I'm starting to lean more towards research than clinical practice. I enjoy doing research, and have never really minded doing research projects, even since grade school and high school. Of course it depends on the topic, but usually I enjoy the process and putting together a finished paper. I don't know much about it, but I know it's not unheard of for psychology majors to do market research after graduating. Other than that, though, I don't really know much else about what I could do as a research-focused career. I am currently debating between jumping into a clinical PhD and taking a year off to maybe work at a local hospital (lots of research labs there) or another organization in the meantime. 

&amp;nbsp;

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm not sure that the path I've been focused on for almost 4 years now is right for me, and what to do if I realize I no longer want to go that way. Any advice you may be able to give me would be *greatly* appreciated. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ideally, I guess I'd like to hear from people who have taken a nonacademic or non-clinical path and what their experiences have been like. Thank you guys SO much!!"
3jyg8s,14,2015-09-07,Any advice for dealing with the Ausländerbehörde a second time?,HardTarantula,hamburg,https://www.reddit.com/r/hamburg/comments/3jyg8s/any_advice_for_dealing_with_the_ausländerbehörde/,"I think this requires a bit of context first:

I came here a few months back for an internship. I had a rough start since I did not fully understand how job visas worked in Germany. When I received the contract from the company, I finally went to the Ausländebehörde to apply for a visa so I can legally work at my job and be paid.

So I go with all the materials: my contract, my degree (I have a Master's in Electrical Engineering), my resident registration, my funds, etc. I go into the building, sign in, wait for my name to be called.

Name gets called, I go in and talk with the lady at the desk. She starts saying stuff in German. I knew next-to-no German at the time so I ask if we can speak English. She says German only. I am a bit taken aback at this given I'm certain I can't be the only English-speaking immigrant to Germany. But hey, I totally get it. In the US, you need to speak English to people when you're trying to immigrate, why should here be any different? Anyway, I let her know I am still learning the language and tomorrow I will be back with a friend who can speak it fluently.

Next day I take my roommate there. Same thing happens with signing in and whatnot. We get called in. Roommate explains I'm applying for a job visa to the lady at the front desk. We get told we will be called when someone is ready to meet with us. Okay, that sounds good.

Wait for a bit, not long. We get called back.

Meet with the counselor and this is where my trouble starts. The counselor places extreme scrutiny on my contract. She says stuff to my roommate asking a bunch of questions about it. They talk for a good half hour or so in German. Finally my roommate turns to me and says that the counselor believes I can't get a work visa with just a praktikum contract. I am completely baffled at this as is my roommate. Roommate and counselor go back to German.
Counselor scans my documents. She calls someone in, her boss or something. Bossman talks with my roommate for a bit and seems to act a bit incredulous, like my roommate was a dumb kid or something. After a while, bossman seems to understand what is going on. Bossman talks with counselor about what to do next.

15 or so minutes of more German later, I'm told by my roommate that they will send my documents to the Arbeitsamt. Arbeitsamt is the place where they review my documents to see if I am qualified for a work visa.

Wait a week and I check back with the Ausländebehörde. They tell me they are still processing it at the Arbeitsamt. I call the Arbeitsamt in Hamburg. They sent my documents and application to a team in Duisburg. I attempt with no success to contact the people in Duisburg. After waiting another week, I contact the Arbeitsamt about where my application is. They have heard nothing.

I keep attempting to contact the people in Duisburg with no success for the next two weeks thinking I'm just maybe contacting them at bad times. I contact the Arbeitsamt again to inform them about this problem. They can't contact the team either. I am sent back to the Ausländerbehörde where I inform them of the issue. Apparently someone made mistakes with my application and so it needs to be re-sent. It is re-sent and now it has been a month since I was supposed to actually begin working at my job.

A week later and I guess someone finally just got sick of me pestering them so they give me a temporary work visa which can be extended to a full job visa once I receive a full-time work contract as my employer originally intended with the internship. So now I am able to work at the place I intended to work a month and a week after I was supposed to begin.

Well, bad news: my company is not able to extend my contract to full-time employment and I will have to somehow find the time to go to the Ausländerbehörde before my contract is up so I can convince them to not deport me despite not having a job as the other option is to get another full-time job in less than a month (That means applying, interviewing, and receiving a full-paying job in record time.)

I don't know if this is how immigrants are treated normally and frankly German politics aren't really my business. More than anything, I just felt woefully unprepared for dealing with the bureaucracy here. Anyone have any advice for me?"

3jzdmd,99,2015-09-07,How to explain that you are better with an uncommon build?,binbrun,heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3jzdmd/how_to_explain_that_you_are_better_with_an/,"I'm getting sick of getting harassed in game for my talent choices. Case in point, I play Zagara and I'm better with Nydus than Maw. Looking at hotslog right now, I have a 60.2% win rate with Nydus and a 46.4% win rate with Maw. 

I know pro gamers and metagod think Maw is the only choice, but I'm bad with it. I can't seem to use it well enough to justify all the weaknesses it opens for my hero (main one being having no escape). I tried to use it, but I don't win with it. 

So I use Nydus, and with time, I develop many tactics with that ult. I got more success with it, I think it's a pretty deep and strategic ult and it gives me more wins. It opens Zagara to more diverse builds too. 

But how do I explain that to teammates in HL? The moment they see or hear about Nydus, all hell break loose. I'm a noob, I suck, I'm wrong and we're going to lose. I mean, I'm not a progamer, neither 99% of the players in the game. I'm stuck with, either I take Maw to keep the peace and lose, either I take Nydus to provoke an intern conflict but with a better chance of winning. 

I don't know if it's a common situation with other heroes, but it's really starting to get frustrating. Why people get so obsessed with the ult of others?

EDIT: Like someone suggested, giving more precision about the why and how could be interesting. Copy-pasta from one of my answer down below. 

&gt; Could you share your builds and tactics involving the Nydus?

Sure. You can get 4 nydus total on the map, I split them like this:

- 1 in your base. No more B ever, infinite health and mana.

- 1 in a safe place, like near a fort in a lane of your choice.

- 2 ""risky"" nydus.

You don't need 4 nydus in safe place. If the enemy don't kill them, you're stuck with removing your oldest nydus (and if it's the base one, it sucks).

As soon as I get Nydus, I put one in my base. Then, depending on where stuff is happening, I place my safe one near there (mid lane is a good spot). After that, the 2 other nydus, you use them to move around, push, team fights, etc. They are going to get killed and it's ok.

For a team fight objective (like seeds, temples, etc), as soon as the team fight start, I pop 1 nydus behind me. It's your escape move. Then, you go all-in, you fight. If you need mana/health, just nydus back to base. Then you can come back in the fight at full health/mana. You can out-sustain a lot of opponent like that. If you need to retreat, you nydus and that's it. You just don't die. You can make extremely risky play, as long as you're not stunned, they cannot cancel your escape. Sure, they can kill the nydus, but they have to do it fast.

If I push, I like to put 2 nydus on the lane. One forward nydus and one a little further back. Like, let's say I'm pushing their keep, I put 1 nydus nearby, to escape (always think about escaping). The other one could be near their destroyed fort. If they try to gank you, you just GTFO. Then you come back, with your backup nydus, and you can continue your push. Or you can even just nydus behind, and still drop all your abilities to continue the harass. Never push 3 lanes at the same time. Usually, I have my 2 risky nydus near a lane that I push hard and my safe nydus on a lane that I hold, ""soft push"".

You must never split push during a team fight. But you can split push up until the team fight start. It takes 5 sec to get to the fight. Since you should have a nydus near you, you just pop one near your team and you are ready to fight.

You must always have a Nydus on your screen, always. If you don't see a nydus on your screen, you are too far, you have no escape, you are dead. If you have a nydus on your screen, it's infinite life and movement.
Also, since Nydus is the health and escape you need, you don't talents to compensate for that. All the talents related to health/escape (like Rapid Incubation, Reconstituion or Bolt of the storm) are useless. You can now get new talents without worry. I like the 30% less dmg on roach because they can tank fort ammo like crazy. The 3x roach upgrade output similar dmg to 1 hydralisk. You also have Battle momentum or endless creep that you can take freely without worrying about health/mana.

With Nydus, you're not going to burst team fight or turn fights around in an instant. But you are going to outsustain or outpush any team. Especially with the hydralisk buff, where they still stay in lane even when the target is dead. I mean, you just go out, you can 2 mutalisk on whatever you want, and it's 12 sec of 2 mutalisk with rebound pushing a lane.

In a situation where you lost a team fight hard, and it's like 5v2, you can delay them. Pop a nydus on a weak lane of them, split push, then come back to base. They cannot ignore you, Zagara can push as hard a 2 tanks and 1 assassin hitting your base.

Also, split pushing means:

- You drop roachs

- You send hydra/muta

- You baneling

- You hit a little, try to attract them to your position (you want to split them).

- You get out. If you split push more than like 15 seconds, you are doing it wrong.

If you have broodlings, USE THEM. Enter/exit your nydus non-stop. It's like a 2nd wave of better minions. 20 sec is short. The push power they have is insane.

Last point, your team don't have to split again ever for mercs or for any wave clearing. They can just stay together, doing what they need to do while you manage the map. By split pushing, you force the other team to split, because you can't leave Zagara alone in a lane. And you get out, while they are stuck hitting an empty nydus. They have to get back, while you are already with your team.

TL;DR: Zagara Nydus is like Abathur but with a body to fight. Instead of a 4 sec hat, you have a 5 sec teleport.


EDIT no2:
Thanks for all the replies. Didn't taught I would get so many answer. I've read everything, I'll try to play around with Maw more, but honestly, I also think that the Nydus meta is lacking in development. It's a ult with deep strategic possibilities, and I believe there is more to it than what I could find with my hundred of games. 

Reading that it enticed some people to try out Nydus more is pretty cool. Hope you guys find good stuff with it. 

Oh, and yeah, communicate with your teammates. It's not because the guys you queued up before were assholes that the new ones are too. "

My situation is: I am 20 going on 21, going to a top college for my bachelor's in a technology field. I do have a lucrative, secure job on campus, a side business fixing computers, and 2nd upcoming internship with one of the big four. From reading the wiki, I do understand that I need to pay down any debts (small used car loan I obtained this year because my old car died) and focus on setting aside for my student loans (~20k after my third year, all government loans). I do and will continue to budget for those, with the majority of my income focused on paying those things off. 

I have an Oppenheimer Roth IRA that is composed of two funds. I am very unhappy with the funds at the moment. The performance is good enough to earn me a return but it is obliterated by management costs! I would like to transition to an index fund for it's low fees and from the advice of PF. 

Many of you may ask: ""Why now?"" I stopped contributing awhile ago when money was a little tight due to part time jobs in HS. That was fine as the investment grew little by little and had made me money. Recently, the Oppenheimer fund that is in developing markets has sustained continued downward rocky performance (20% Chinese asset allocation). I am aware that I should stay the course and ride out the market, but I also hate to see money dwindle further away that could be invested elsewhere and that I would really like to move. I am in a position to move it immediately (the investment is a bit below the vanguard 1k minimum at this point but I have enough cash to supplement to make that investment). It's just not doing me any favors where it is. I plan to wait a little and focus on debt and loans before contributing more towards my IRA after the change over.

So what does PF suggest as far as:
A. How/should I move my IRA? (do I have to be concerned with taxes)
B. Any general advice you may have regarding my financial situation that you can tell from the basic info above

3k2nez,4,2015-09-08,I think my [21 F] bisexual bf [21 M] of 2 years interacts inappropriately with other guys during our relationship. Need some outside perspectives.,Throwawaypolipop,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3k2nez/i_think_my_21_f_bisexual_bf_21_m_of_2_years/,"My bf and I have been in a serious relationship for 2 years and a few months back we had a conversation about things we have kept in secret even though we are really open and honest with each other.

He tells me that about 3-4 months into our relationship he watched porn and masturbated with one of his younger buddies that he is close with (he is the son of his parents' family friend.) This was during a sleepover. Let's call his friend Pete. So Pete was about 14-15 years of age when this happened. My bf told me that he was the one who initiated in it and he knew that it was wrong, but defended himself saying that ""it's what guys do. Guys jerk off together sometimes."" However I asked him if he was turned on by it and he said he was. I consider this cheating, but I want some outside perspective on this. I was really hurt when he told me this and he said that it won't happen again and that he was sorry for what he did. We agreed that he will have no contact with Pete again whatsoever.

It really bothers me that my bf is attracted to ""younger looking teen boys"" and he would be ok with doing things with minors if he weren't with me. Another thing I always catch him doing is having ""moments"" with other guys of this type. For example when we were sitting at a mall bench and he was staring at this adolescent guy and they were just staring at each other for about 10 mins. My bf told me that he is staring at him because the dude is really high and is funny to look at. However I knew his type so after the stoner left I asked my bf if he was attracted to him and he said yes. 

We frequently visit this mall and occasionally we run across the same stoner guy and everytime we do, my bf smiles at him and sometimes says hi even though they don't personally know each other. This happens to a lot of other guys he finds attractive. He thinks I don't notice but to me it seems like he is flirting absent mindedly with other guys but always playing the ""being friendly"" card. We have talked about this and he assures me he won't stare or act inappropriately with other guys.

During the summer we were interns in the same work place. When there were social events in bars my bf and I would chat with some of the college interns but I notice that my bf only chats with guys that seem like his type. I was in close proximity with whoever he chats with and they would be talking about professional work stuff and nothing flirty or personal, but he would only have conversations with guys I knew he found attractive. He would kind of dismiss girls and other guys that weren't his type that try to talk to him. It seems like these meetups are a way for him to interact with attractive guys without really being called out on being flirty. But again I probably need outside perspective.

He recently got a new job where he works with a lot of teen boys and deals with customers. This makes me feel nervous because I should trust him but his actions in the past have not been perfect.  His actions have made me feel really suspicious, jealous, and insecure. Am I overacting or are these feelings totally reasonable?

Tl:dr: bi bf has been acting weird with other guys, am I right or am I just a jealous gf?

Thanks for the advice if you have any!"

What framerate does Snapchat's mystory run on? is it based on the phone's camera it was posted on, or is it based on the OS of the unit you download the entire Mystory video on?

Hello!

I'm currently an intern at a larger media corporation based in Europe.

(My issue is listed after the following paragraph)

I'm helping out with a project they've got going on, where they sent out one of their regular radio hosts to travel around the world, only getting food and places to sleep through social media. Plane tickets were pre paid. She has one camera man following her and throughout the trip she is regulary posting updates on Instagram and Snapchat.

Yesterday, I was given the responsibility to save her Mystory from Snapchat to ease her work amount, since up until now, she was the one who saved her Mystory. She is using an iPhone btw, I don't know which model.
So I logged in and saved her Mystory to my phone (Huawei Honor 6) and transferred the .mp4-file to a USB-stick, plugged the stick into my personal computer (Windows based) to check if the file was working. I played it through VLC media player and it looked okay. So I popped the file onto one of the iMacs at my workplace. I played it then through Quicktime movie player, and to my surprise half the screen was green. On the entire video. Some corrupt files, was my guess. Apparently, Huawei, Android and iOS doesn't play nice together. 

So I headed over to tech support, and we decided to transcode the file through Adobe Media Encoder CC 2014. We decided to transcode it to a HD Apple ProRes 422 1080p format. Just as the tech support was about to render the file he asked ""Wait, what framerate does Snapchat have? I bet it's like 24 or 30.""

The file finished rendereing, and I thanked the tech guy for his help and went back to my desk to check on the file. The video file was running smoothly, but I noticed one problem. The sound was off sync. So, yeah. What framerate does Snapchat's mystory run on? is it based on the phones camera, or is it based on the OS of the unit you download the Mystory video on?"

And as my username shows i am really sick of studying and uni altogether (as shown by my name). So i was curious, which engineering is the safest in terms of job supply and also job pay? Please be brutally honest because i'm in my first you and do have the opportunity to transfer before everything get's to complicated. And also, if anyone is currently doing an engineering internship (specifically an ICT one if possible), what is it like and was it difficult to land?. Sorry about the long post. "
3k30rr,5,2015-09-08,"Me [22 F] with my (ex)Boyfriend [26 M] of six months, very recently broke up, are now friends, thinking about starting an open relationship.",sexystuff123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3k30rr/me_22_f_with_my_exboyfriend_26_m_of_six_months/,"Boyfriend and I have been together for the past six months. I was his first long term relationship in a very long time and he was the first good person I've ever dated. We started dating at a point in my life where I had lost most of my motivation and drive. I lost my passion for the career field I was in, I had just graduated college, all of my friends moved away. Boyfriend was the only real source of human contact and happiness I had. I was bordering on co-dependence.

On top of this, Boyfriend was struggling to break down walls he had built up that had prevented him from loving someone for years. He had had the idea that he would just date people for short periods of time basically for the rest of his life, never making a true connection because he felt that he just didn't work in a real relationship. Then I came along and he told me he found the true and deep love, commitment and loyalty he'd been looking for for years. So we tried a relationship.

But, like I said, I was miserable in my life. I brought nothing to the relationship, and Boyfriend, who has problems with feeling caged and with having limitations, had to carry the entire relationship. He started to get terrible migraines and basically started to physically break down trying to make this work.

We decided to take a month ""off"" to see if we could make changes and then figured us out. Within the first week a few things became very clear. Firstly, I had found my drive again. I went out and applied to five jobs, I got interviews and call backs for multiple ones, I started an internship in a field I'm loving and want to make a career out of. 

He realized that a pretend break up wasn't good for him. He needed it one way or the other, he wasn't feeling any better and basically was feeling worse. So he went back and forth the whole week between knowing the relationship wasn't good/working and not wanting to give me up. The relationship was bad, I was good. What to do?

So, yesterday he picked me up to drive me home from my Aunt's house where I was staying for the weekend while he was on his way home from his parents. He told me he needed to break up, it wasn't working, etc. We talked about it for a while (I tried to convince him to try again, like I said, he's the best guy I've ever been with) and ultimately decided we would try to be friends.

Now, our sex life is fantastic. Easily the best sex either of us has ever had. And that's not something we wanted to give up, but also knew it could really fuck with our heads. So we decide to be up in the air about that and see what happens. We get back to his apartment and immediately have sex. Then afterwards he tells me we can't do that anymore because he doesn't want to feel like he's using me and it's really messing with his head, too. 

So, we talk about our relationship again, sitting on the couch. At the end I ask him to just hold me for a little, not as friends but as an ex who loves me. He agrees. So we lay down and he's really holding me, not just half assing it to try and appease me. And the after about 15 minutes of just really nice cuddling, he asks me what I think  about open relationships. I tell him it's not something I ever really thought of because I'd be afraid I'd get very jealous. He said he felt the same, but then went on to explain stuff he had read about it and what he had talked to his therapist about it. He said since being with me he's never wanted to be with someone else, but the fact that he can't be gets to him. When he doesn't have limitations, he can get really creative in his life and meet the needs he has that keep him at homeostasis and happy. 

And, it would allow both of us to explore different avenues of our sexual lives, as well as not feel pressured to settle down. We are both really young and not really ready to do that. Also, with this kind of relationship, there would be clear cut rules and boundaries that we would implement and follow. Which I like. It's a good balance of having boundaries, but in a way that removes more traditional boundaries, for both of us. I am a flirty and sexual person, and he likes to be able to explore all aspects of himself. 

The thing about this is that we would be each others' rock. We would have the love and commitment and loyalty. We would have the deep connection that we do have, and be the ones to care for each other when we're sick or whatever. We'd take care of each other in the way that whoever else was coming into our lives wouldn't. And that's an idea I really like.

So, I guess my question is, people who have opened their relationships: why? what rules did you set? what were things you didn't expect to be hard that were and didn't expect to be easy that were? do you regret it? is there anything you should have talked about before that you didn't?

This is still very up in the air and right now we're just friends. But I want to keep this option on the table for myself and go into any potential conversations prepared.





   
**tl;dr**: Boy and girl break up, still love each other, thinking about nontraditional relationships and their feasibility."

I cant graduate early because certain classes are only offered certain times a year (private university...), but I can pick up a minor or work this winter quarter full time if I like/look hard enough (bay area university).

Would it be better for me to pick up a minor or to work a quarter? I pretty good at putting myself out there and I am not too worried about not finding a job after graduation. I am already minoring in Math, but I wouldn't mind picking up maybe a Computer engineering minor, studio art or EE minor... Another option is taking about 3 courses over the rest of my college years rather than the usual 4 or taking random ME electives or grad classes...

Ps: I am taking a a large amount of loans to get my degree, so I don't plan on jumping into grad school after my bachelors and I am very fond of most majors/minors and career paths."

I cried, yelled and wallowed that I was never gonna see my friends again. The innocence of a twelve year old. I thought my life was perfect, playing barefooted footy in unpaved streets with an oblong ball, and occasionally going inside to play pirated PS1 games and fantasising about the unnobtainable PS2. I was so used to seeing glorified, ramshackel, corrugated iron boxes that passed as someone's home. To me, life couldn't get any better. I could not---for the life of me---understand why anyone would need graphic comercials to stop them from fording a river and risking their lives for a shot at the american dream.

All that changed as soon as I landed in a strange land. Everything was so clean. The toilets didn't smell of piss. And when we finally arrived at our final destination I couldn't help but notice the lack of aerial wiring, glorified corrugated iron boxes, litter, and potholes on the streets. I was amazed at the bus timetables, as well as the availability and pleasantness of public transportation.

I loved how relaxed school was, yet how much I learned. The fucking weather was shit, but I'd trade daily drizzle over 40 °C heat. I loved the fact that I got to travel around europe and see so much. I loved how big and tasty fruit was. Though I missed the sweets and corn flour. Life was great, and we forgot. We forgot how much our old life sucked compared to this. And so we yearned to be back. We wanted to see our family and friends, and we wanted to start anew in our country. We were so full of hope.

Hope which was shattered soon after arrival. Divorce, drug war, insecurity, financial turmoil. I woke up early and went to bed late. I wondered whether I would make it through the day... whether my life or someone's I loved would be over before nightrall. Not by our own hand, for our wills are strong and our perseverance dogged. But by a stray bullet, a robber, or a kidnapper. And so we all had our escapes from reality. Some where healthier than others, but that's how we coped. And we coped well, we had fun, we enjoyed ourselves, and we were happy.

When the time came, I left for university. I lived with my friends and we were happy. I thought that a year away from my little brother would change him, make him a better person. I was wrong. What an irresponsible, agressive, freeloader he is. A normal person does not have an overall failing GPA, nor does he or she beat, then and threaten people with knives for eating their breakfast after waking up after 3 pm. Nor does he hit or push his mother in a fit of rage brought on by eating the same food for the third day straight because all her money is going towards *your* education, which you're throwing away. You fucking bastard.

I came to realise that some people grow up to be gigantic assholes. Some of whom were supposed to help, but rather shoot you down. They even got in my head, and for the first time in my life I doubted myself---seriously doubted myself. But i kept on walking, head held high, despite everything. Despite being made an example, despite being ridiculed, despite being shunned and shamed. Despite it all, I didn't sell out, I stuck to my ethical values and did not back down from injustice. I got bit in the ass for it and my GPA suffered, but of all the fucks I don't give that was one of the biggest ones---which made them despise me. 

When the time came for me to do summer internships, they threatened me. Told me they had eyes and ears where I was going, and that I should watch myself and not ruin 'my university's' reputation. FUCK YOU, PRICKS! I came back with a first authorship, a simulations package, a bunch of codes that would put my name on at least 3 future publications and a letter of recommendation saying I'm one of the top 1% of *all* undergrads to have worked at the department of *all time*. And you know what? I did it because I didn't do your fucking homework, I did it because I went out of my way to learn things outside of school. I did it in spite of you trying to prevent me from taking the classes I wanted to take, I did it by auditing those classes because you wouldn't let me take them. And that time you took me with the head of the school for 'disciplinary' action because I didn't shut up and bend over so I could take the unfair and unethical policy changes up the ass like everyone else, is one of my proudest achievements. Because despite being a small, insignificant voice against the roar of power, I value my integrity. And when my thesis advisor---a member of his field's high elite---told you I was the best he's ever worked with, because I never required his help and did all my work alone, only then did you realise your mistake.

And to the jobs that rejected me for 'not being the right profile', fuck you too. I know I aced your exams and your interviews. Not only did you tell me so, because you did. You rejected me on the basis of being too young, too good, too impressive, or saying that I will eventually be successful but not with you. You allegedly want someone who's proactive, independent of thought and action, a self-learner, someone with integrity, with highly developed ethical reasoning, a team worker, a visionary. You want all those things, but only when proactivity is limited to a microverse, when independence of thought and action aligns with the company's interests, when integrity and ethical reasoning are subjective and benefit your company directly, when working as a team means doing whatever the boss says despite a lack of logic, and when vision is bounded by your creativity-stiffling restrictions. Despite all of you being liars, you made a grave mistake.

So I ended up with a job I hate, with people I like, who like me back. Now I must endure one more year. One more year of working 50 hours a week for innadequate pay that does not allow me to save thanks to all the student debt I carry around with me. One more year of having buses pass me by because they didn't feel like stopping; one more year of overcrowded, swaying buses with no air conditioning; one more year of dealing with my asshole brother; one more year of waiting for a way out. One more year so I can go back to the life I discovered 11 years ago and lost 4 years later.

I will miss you all my friends and my family. But you all made me for greatness and I expect nothing less. Unfortunately this country of ours does not allow one to be great, for one must first lose the very things which make one truly so. And despite all I say of wealth and power, I want none. I do not want my name in the history books. But I want you, and me, to be proud of who I am and what I do. So I will return, but not as quick as last time. Oh no, I will return after accruing money, experience, and people in similar positions. I will return and make this country of ours better. I still have no idea how I'll do that, but I've never really had any idea how to do things other than working towards a defined goal.

Even if I don't make it, I'll be proud to have tried and failed than not tried at all. I won't do it for me, but for those who have loved me, but most of all I'll do it to prove those who have cast me down and out, so very wrong. "

My goal was to explore the future possibly create a flux to send information back to the field I had jumped from and try to rebuild the technology I needed from scratch. Things had changed so quickly and the more I thought about it the more it made my head spin from the etma weed.

""So why does the smoke turn blue like that and green when we exhale it?"" I asked Frank who had just finished hid Corona.

""Beebs you want to handle this one? I'm gonna' grab us some more drinks, you barely touched your Corona want something else? A Zima perhaps?"" he said jokingly.

""An Old E would be nice, like we drank in the dorms our freshman year, I doubt they still make them but Corona is just too skunky for me."" I added handing him the bottle he chugged it all down in a single go.

""Etma Hangira is almost identical to the cannabis indica found on our own planet, except the Lyrians hold their floral species far more important than humans do. This extreme balance in their ecosystem system often leads to long term symbiotic relationships with the insects and fauna on their planet. In fact due to this nature their entire planet has not seen war on their planet foreign or domestically in over three millenia. The Etma Hangira plant has a distinct relationship with an algae spore  like species similar to Earth's bio luminescent phyto plankton. They remain dormant in the Etma's trichomes using them as a colonizing base, theycan survive extreme heat so when heat is applied they hatch early, the blue reaction is their defense mechanism of being exposed to Earth's oxygen rich environment giving them their blue pulsating effect when the smoke is simply burning. When it is introduced to a human's lung and the oxygen molecules deplete and are turned into carbon monoxide. This rapid decrease in available nitrogen rich atmosphere causes their luminescence to go into warning mode thus giving it a green effect. The Lyrian's blue sun would filter their bio luminescence to have a purple effect and red when in distress our yellow sun however shows blue when pulsing and green through the filter of the natural filter of our own. This causes the algae spores to die, but they have no detrimental effect to any other fauna or flora, for their lifespan is only eight minutes. On the Lyrian home planet entire fields are grown to celebrate a festival much like Earth's own 4th of July that was legally celebrated until 2170. Several species of this algae spore will often flock to create beautiful asymmetric designs in their sky for their eight minute lifespan when they hatch."" BB told me as Frank reappeared with another Corona and 40oz. and handed it to me.

""That sounds awesome I don't suppose you have any video of this Lyrian festival taking place do you BB?"" I asked her.

""No but next time Tom makes a descent from the moon base I could ask him in his native tongue."" BB stated plainly.

The 40 oz. did not have the familiar Old English label but instead had a picture of what looked like a more stoutly jawlined picture of Snoop Dogg that's when I remembered the term BB had used in the autopod during our debacle with the drones. Doggfather Drank.

""So Snoop Dogg's grandson is the President of Brazil, is this him?"" I asked Frank looking at the bottle's label again.

""Great grandson, master wizard in chess at age seven, served as a private in the American military during the civil wars in Colombia after the third ice shelf broke most of South America tried to flee to North America. Three years later and he was a General conducting evacuation procedures more efficiently than any human in history. When the barrier was put up he practically spent his entire family fortune to rebuild Colombia. Legally sanctioned the drug cartels and practically controlled their leaders from gaining too much wealth and explained why. Those that refused he gunned down, those that agreed started a union. 
It was not long before Brazil became more stable than America itself, so the CIA tried to have him killed, he literally saved America from becoming over populated and they try to kill him. I was the one who warned him by the way, they actually consulted me to ask how they should go about doing it, can you believe that? He was able to catch the agent that proposed to kill him and forced a confession and released the man into Americas custody who they killed instantly, anyway. The neighboring politicians from all the countries of South America decided to make him President of Brazil. There was no voting, and very little resistance, here we are almost thirty years later. 
Brazil is the New America over there, crime is down, they have the best medical schools and colleges, their economy is solid, and it's where I do most of my business. Lionel is like the anti Genghis Kahn of his generation despite his diplomatic strategies."" Frank seemed lost in those memories and a melancholy look of sadness began to creep on his face.

""So,"" I said breaking his concentration ""do you want to know about time travel or not?"" I asked him opening the 40 oz. and taking a deep chug, it tasted exactly like Old English and I felt that surge of nostalgia you often get when a smell or taste will take you back to a better time.

""Of course BB said you were a bit paranoid about telling her about it in the autopod, Beebs run a sonic sweep for bugs please and create the cone of silence."" Frank said jokingly.

""I detect no recording or audio bugs within the penthouse and surrounding two mile perimiter, would you like me to expand the radius of detection, Mr.Deveraux?"" BB asked Frank.

""No, but if you would be so kind as to prime the cognitive functions on the Cymodels 4,6, and Cherry and send them to the penthouse I would be much obliged."" Frank told her sipping his Corona.

""As you command, Sir."" BB confirmed.

Frank propped his fist on his chin staring at me clearly waiting for the explanation.

""Hmm."" I thought wondering where to begin. ""As you know after my physics major I was given an internship into CERN at the LHC which I turned down. What you don't know is that I created a smaller model of the LHC in my basement. Extremely illegal stuff I spent two years creating a Faraday cage around it to prevent any anomalous surges from being detected by government instruments."" I began.

""After that I wanted to create a small amount of quark gluon plasma to determine exactly how fast expansion could actually occur during the creation of the universe. The team at LHC only did this days prior to my first jump, I discovered the exact speed in 2009. It was almost three billion times faster than the speed of light. For the non physicist terminology it was like a caveman trying to figure out why a ferrari car is faster than a stallion. Now at those speeds time and space no longer become a defined construct but a template.""

I looked at Frank to make sure he was keeping up, and he shook his head yes.

""So when you read articles that say expansion and immersion occurred instantly, that's simply not the case there is an exact speed it just seems instant to humans. The funny thing is that the two molecules which I created were so hot they fell through my accelerator and burned a giant hole that went deep into the ground they likely stopped miles into the earth's surface and created all kinds of geodes and I thank god they were stable otherwise they could have created an explosion that would have leveled Boston. 
Crazy shit but, it taught me everything I needed to know chromodynamic quarks could not only be fused to gluons but stabilized and controlled through a field. This meant that with a universally transient substance they could be moved from point A to point B. Like water."" 

Frank was still able to keep up and I was surprised by how he seemed fascinated by what I was saying rather than his old self who would show no interest.

""So what you are saying is that by discovering how the universe expanded has a direct relation to how time was created, I'm with you so far."" Frank told him.

""Well in a sense, we already suspected that weak fields may have existed prior to expansion and immersion and that one is still up in the air as far as I know. My next step was to prove that time was a linear construct and had no deviance. I did this by creating a perfectly white room eight feet cube with four windows on every corner and recorded the particle accelerator to spin the gluons for a complete twenty four hour schedule. Something strange began happening in a cycle of every eight minutes when the sun's light began filtering through the gluon field. The light particles slowed down when entering the concentric donut shaped field and then sped up at twice the rate when exiting it. 
I bought the most expensive phantom camera and did this experiment again, except this time I introduced a collection of monarch butterflies into the room because they have a high tolerance for extreme heat. It was beautiful, Frank, they would fly into the field and basically suspend in midair it took them half the day to get to the other side of the field."" I continued.

""So basically you slowed down time within the field. Would have loved to see that."" Frank commented.

""Did the butterflies survive this hypothetical experiment?"" BB chimed in.

""Some of them did, those that did not land on the particle accelerator or get too close to it's epicenter did survive."" I told her.

""From there it was 2010, and I was plagued by the idea I could transport the field from one space in time to another, 2011, was a very difficult year for me. I had to get a job at McDonald's to keep up with the things I needed to buy for my ongoing experiments. I stole quite a bit of money from the cash registers and replaced them with fake bills, something I'm not very proud of but it seemed like the safest solution close to robbing a bank.""

Frank laughed as I continued.

""So I decided the best solution would be to build two particle accelerators in separate rooms which required another room and another particle accelerator. From there I was finally able to afford and build two ion cyclotronic torroid wave resonators to direct the gluon plasma and one to receive it and one to send it. The vectors took months to calculate. When it was finally ready I decided to use a mouse in a plexiglass cube to send to the other room should the experiment work I used water as the mode of transport.
When I turned the machines on I was certain everything was set but the only thing that happened was the mouse slowed down and the water inside the cube slowly evaporated. If it was not for one of the neighbor kids running by the window's light I never would have discovered it was possible. The aimed portability was only possible in the absence of photons through the field. As soon as the kid ran by the cube disappeared instantly.I shut down the gluon field accelerators but kept the cyclotron machines going or else the mouse would be lost or obliterated or, I don't know at this point it was all theory. 
I waited in the room that the mouse was to be transported into and at the exact moment of when I started the accelerators and stopped them the mouse reappeared in the room on top of the second cyclotron still alive and kicking."" I finished.

Frank had a look of astonishment on his face.
""So you sent the mouse into the future. using a wage budget from McDonald's while CERN was spending almost three hundred million annually. Dude that is so recreational it's mind boggling. When we have time later I'd love to hear about how you fit all of that tech on the device on your leg."" Frank said.

""How did you know? Also, how did BB know back when we were headed here?"" I asked him curious.

""Cameras are everywhere now, I control quite a few, they are all equipped with infrared, when you entered the autopod BB made note of a device strapped to your leg I naturally assumed it was your time travel device,"" Frank told me. ""oh yeah you are no longer allowed in Boston or New Jersey for the time being. You are safe on the West coast though. If you would like I could set up your sister's families here on the West Coast in case the government tries to use them as bargaining chips to retrieve you. BB has already set up the thirty two homes and all transport and necessities needed for them to start new lives over here."" 

""Do you think they would really do that? Never mind. I believe it, I suppose if they want to come but make sure they know the situation in detail and don't make them go against their will. Hey Frank how did my sister die?"" I asked while chugging the rest of the forty ounce suddenly feeling depressed.

""She died at the ripe old age of 120, I swear I did what I could but her brain was already too fragile by the time my nanites were still in the prelim stages of dealing with neurological issues. If it's any consolation I told her that I believed you were still alive and she did too. She named her youngest son TomTom after you. She had eight children, who went on to have sixteen children of their own. Beebs please inform my West coast attorneys to make the arrangements and make a list of all the necessities they will need."" Frank informed me as a flood of emotion hit me and I could not help but water my eyes.

""Thank you Frank I could not ask for a better friend."" I told him as he got up and grabbed my empty forty to throw away he smiled and pointed at the elevator.

 The elevator doors slid open revealing three females whom I recognized instantly, the first was a younger version of Jessica Alba, in a tight red dress. She walked forward and cocked her hip and placed her hand on it. 

""Hey handsome."" she said, as I instantly blushed.
The second was Gillian Anderson in her later years, and Frank knew I had a infinite crush on her she looked divine in a pasty orange sequins dress.

""Mulder, we have to investigate this next case but the hotel clerk says only one room is available. You ain't sleeping in the car this time I won't have it."" she said as my heart skipped a beat and I giggled at the reference to one of my favorite childhood shows.
The third woman stepped forward and said nothing but I instantly recognized her as the 80's version of Melanie Griffith in her leather clad outfit and iconic red hair.

I smiled knowing which one I already wanted.           "

I have 4 months left in my work term and I already can't wait to go back to school. I cannot seem to last this lifestyle for even 8 months, I can't imagine doing this forever.

After I graduate next year, I plan on backpacking either in western Europe or southeast Asia... but what about after that? Just work till I die? Get married so I don't feel lonely along the way?

For now, I've developed a few hobbies to keep me occupied (hiking, programming, swimming, etc) but I can't help but think it's to distract me from the inevitable :/

&gt;#1. What should I do if I have a computer virus?

&gt;&gt;**/u/LadyCailin:** OH MAN U HAVE A VIRUS? HAVE U TRY TURNING COMPUT ON AND BACK OFF AGIN

&gt;&gt;**/u/Ooer:**  Before you even think about what you need to do with a computer virus, you need to understand the virus itself. For example, you don't take antibiotics for a viral infection, and you don't saw off a leg for a headache. If you take the computer virus on a date, somewhere nice, candles, olive bread etc. and just ask it a few simple questions you will quickly be able to understand what they are all about. I always watch and see how they treat the waiter/waitress too, that tells you a lot about a computer virus.

3k404p,7,2015-09-08,Coming out and changing my name.,cats22015,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/3k404p/coming_out_and_changing_my_name/,"Hi everyone, 

Thank you all for your comments on my name-questioning post.  Although I got some great suggestions for alternative names, I have decided to go with James/Jamie.  I just feel a better connection to this name than any of the others, and knowing that I can use ""Jamie"" as a gender-neutral nickname seals the deal for me.   (Also, I'm kind of excited to be a 40-year-old named Jim.)

Anyways, because my name is now very different from my birth name, I realize that I will no longer be able to quietly transition like I had planned to.  Originally, I would change my name on Facebook to Jenner, without any announcement or explanation.  Everyone who  knows me already would keep calling me Jenn, and new people I meet would call me Jenner and assume that Jenn was short for that. 

Now that I can't do that, I have started on a new plan.  It goes something like this: 

Nov 2015: Hopefully by this time I will have a gender therapist appointment booked.  I'll start talking with the therapist and look into low-dose T.  I'll keep bugging CAMH about top surgery. 

Dec 2015: Before winter break, come out ""officially"" to my close friends.  I'll try to tell most of them in person, but I'll also send out a private Facebook message to the ones I can't see in person.  

Dec 2015: Visit my parents for Christmas, get all of my remaining ID from them.  On Boxing Day, I will come out to my parents, sister, and any relatives who are there, by giving them a physical copy of the letter I have written.  The rest of my family will receive the letter over email.  

Jan 2015: Change my name on Facebook and other social accounts with a short message.  The message will simply call attention to the fact that my name has changed, indicate the pronouns I would like to have used, and request that questions be sent to me privately.  However, I will likely have to leave my LinkedIn account under my old name. (see below)

After this, I will have to begin legally changing my name.  I am still working an internship until the end of next summer, and I would prefer not to come out to them until after I finish working there.  Which means my bank account and LinkedIn account must stay in my birth name until September 2016.  I would like to change my name with my school, with the understanding that all documentation referring to my internship will be filed under my former name.  My school is very accommodating so hopefully they will be able to do this. 

I think that the next step is to change my name legally in my province.  Once I have acquired legal name change documentation, I can use this to change my name on my driver's licence, citizenship certificate, and my social insurance number.  However, I am not sure how much of this I can change while keeping my bank account under my former name.  I expect that I would only be able to do my provincial documentation, but not my social insurance number.   

After I finish this job, I will finish my Canadian name change, and change my name at my bank, on LinkedIn, and on my resume.  I may have to retroactively come out at my workplace in order to use them as a reference for future job applications.  Or if I return, I'd have to come out before starting again.  But at least I will be able to distance myself from any awkwardness if it happens. 

The tricky part is my other citizenship.  I may have to fly to that country, and stay there for a certain period of time.  It is really important to me that I maintain my citizenship and right to work in that country.  I will spend time and money to keep my rights in that country if necessary.  However, would it be possible for me to keep my birth identity on those documents, while changing my identity in Canada, while still maintaining the ability to use those documents? 

The other issue is changing my gender marker.  I can change it in Canada without surgery, but in the other country ""sex reassignment surgery"" is a requirement.  If I changed my name to a male name, but kept the female gender marker, would this cause problems? What if it was M in Canada but F in the other country?

Of course, then there are the little things.  Changing my name on my PO box, cell phone bill, coming out to my landlords (or avoiding coming out to them), various online accounts like PayPal and Amazon.  

Am I doing this right? Am I forgetting anything? For those of you who have done this before, what can I expect? Am I likely to run into problems?

Thanks for reading my logistical rant!

Edit: Oh, and I need to apply for financial aid as well.  Forgot about that :(

3k4c4c,379,2015-09-08,The Power of Lifting: An Asian Girl's Journey to Self-Confidence,chubbynubbies,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/3k4c4c/the_power_of_lifting_an_asian_girls_journey_to/,"Disclaimer: Long time lurker, am trying to start posting/responding a bit more on reddit. A lot of what I’ll be rambling about has to do with my own personal experiences as an Asian girl with Asian culture, so please understand I’m not some representative for all Asians.
In the Asian community that I grew up with, there was a lot of emphasis on femininity. This could range from having light skin (the paler, the better) to long cascading black hair, but the biggest thing would be your weight. Weight defined you: too much and you wouldn’t be able to find a boyfriend/husband, too little and you looked too much like a boy, although what counted as “too much” and “too little” varied.

I was the definition of skinny-fat: skinny, but also flabby, no muscles whatsoever. Prior to joining the gym, I weighed a whopping 118 pounds at the age of 21. I say “whopping” because to my mother, this was far too much weight. Meals became my mom doing portion-control on me or talking with the aunties over how I needed to lose the weight. “I was 95 pounds when I married your father,” my mom would say as she tsk-tsked my appearance. Some aunties would jump to my defense by saying, “Oh, but don’t worry because you are very talented, you’re attractive in other ways.” Which just reinforced that my one negative was my weight.

I went off to graduate school right after undergraduate and by the end of it I gained 4 pounds. But how I hated myself for gaining those 4 pounds! If I didn’t have those 4 pounds I would have the perfect model figure, I would think. I still ate terribly – a busy schedule of graduate school, internships, and attempting to have a social life meant eating a lot of ramen noodles and chugging 2 – 4 cups of sugary coffee to stay charged.

When I returned home Winter 2014 (I had just graduated with my masters and hadn’t seen my mom in a year), the first thing she said as I walked up to her and my aunties and uncles was, “How much weight have you gained?” At this point (and to my horror), I had to acknowledge that I had gone over the 120 lb mark (at 122 pounds). That was perhaps one of the worst feelings I had to mull over on the car ride back home.

I was now in “fat territory.”

Girls my age in the community suffered the same watchful eye from their parents, aunts, and uncles. Some became the “hot button” for gossip; one girl was whispered to have started having sex (purity is another big deal) because why else would she weigh 150 lbs? Every day while I was home, I would weigh myself obsessively to see if I gained or lost – a day where I went from 122.2 lbs to 121.9 lbs would have me filled with relief, and a day where I bumped from 121.9 to 122 lbs would make me furious with myself.

Despite this, I never really went to the gym. Or, I did, but I never really worked out if that made sense. I’d lay around, maybe do the elliptical machine here and there, but nothing that would really force me to make progress. To my mom, women weren’t supposed to lift weights. There was a fear that if I started to lift, I would turn into a body builder and lose my feminine body. So I never touched it.
After break, I was working a busy job where as soon as I left my work computer I was on my home computer redditing, watching youtube videos, or gaming: sedentary lifestyle at its finest. I moved into a new apartment around June 2015. Moving was difficult – boxes were too heavy for me to lift and I felt winded going up two flights of stairs. I was embarrassed and ashamed because my friends helping me move managed just fine. I was down to 118 lbs (“20 more pounds to go,” my mom would remind me). Even if I wanted to join the gym, what would I do?

At some point in July, I finally got around to chatting with one of my roommates (he had been gone every weekend and I was locked up in my room playing games or browsing the web). He was telling me about how he’s getting into the habit of going to the gym, and – partly joking, partly serious – I told him how I wished I knew stuff about weights because I’d love to be able to do a single squat one day. This got my roommate hyped and he proceeded to tell me that he would go to the gym 5 days a week and if I wanted to join, he would help me/be my gym bud and that, yes, we would be lifting weights.

I signed up for a membership the next day and paid with my own money (prior to this, gym memberships were through my parents or part of the college plans we had). The first day I tried to run on a treadmill and within 5 minutes I was out of breath. I tried to stretch and couldn’t touch my toes (I could only go down a little past my knees standing up and bending over). The heaviest weight I could lift was a 5 pounder, maybe a 7.5 pounder if I was pushing it. I felt a mix of discouragement and shame, but my roommate continued to encourage me by saying, ""Dude, I couldn't touch my toes when I first started. It took me a month of stretching a lot before I even could. Don't worry about it right now.""

That first week was hell on my body. The first time we had leg day, I felt like I couldn’t walk (I compared myself to the ghost from the Grudge and how I would have to drag my poor body around). The first time we did chest day, I had my hands on my chest as I walked up and down the stairs in our apartment. My legs were shaking and I was incredibly sore, to the point that sitting became such as task. Even putting my bag over my shoulder sucked. But my roommate reassured me that my body needed time to get used to what I was doing.

To have my roommate encourage me to push myself and for us to both hold each other accountable to going to the gym, I started feeling more confident; I had more energy, and I found it a great de-stressor from work (I look super forward to workouts when I’ve had a particularly shitty day). I started drinking protein shakes without fear that I would suddenly become a body builder (after my roommate had to convince me that, no, I would not hulk out). But little by little, I could feel myself getting out of the funk of ""not being the perfect weight"" to ""I'm getting stronger.""

It is only September and I definitely have a long way to go, but I feel stronger. I’m still skinny fat in a lot of areas and while I myself still can’t see a lot of physical changes, I can feel it: I can now touch my toes (the first time I was able to do so I skipped the whole way home). I can run up stairs without getting out of breath, and even making the 10-15 minute journey back home from the grocery store doesn’t kill my arms or leaves me exhausted. I’ll look in the mirror and see leg muscles I didn’t even know existed. My proudest achievement to date is squatting 75 pounds. And now I’m starting to slowly begin to adjust my diet in an attempt to eat healthier.
I know to a lot of people, these aren’t the most impressive accomplishments. But for me, this is amazing because these are things I didn’t think I would be able to do something like this.
I haven’t stepped on my scale since I first signed up for the gym. I don’t feel like I need to right now. I know my mom will probably ask me to when I return this upcoming winter, but I know that whether the number goes up or down, it doesn’t matter. For the first time, I am more confident and comfortable with my body than I have been in a very long time. And I think that’s pretty rad.

***EDIT***

I actually just came back from the gym and just wanted to say that I'm both surprised and happy that this managed to gain a lot of attention and that I was able to provide some inspiration to all you ladies out here, especially to my fellow Asian ladies who have dealt with a lot of the similar cultural knit-pickings over our bodies. I'm glad that my post was able to bring about some inspiration to you all. **Just remember:** it *doesn't* matter what others say about your body, it comes down to you feeling comfortable in your own skin! :) So do you, hustle hard, and keep up the good work!

I am always looking for new partners willing to engage in long-term, thoughtful roleplays!

As usual with my prompts: *As long as you are willing to play a female character, I will accept all partners!*

My Kinks:**Bimbos, unrealistic cock size and expansion, tit play, heavy cumplay, lingerie and sexy outfits, soft domination, incest (M/s), Ageplay (No pre-teen), and hypnosis and mind control.**

Hope to hear from some potential partners soon!

**Mommy is my Alarm**

Mommy woke up at 4:30am every day. Whether it was her sincere devotion to her son or love for the taste of cum, Johnny will never know. 

She begins with a slight amount of fitness, although it seems that her body is impervious to age. She looks like she is only in her mid-twenties. Her fantastic bust is perkier than ever, her ass is taught and firm, and her lips are a beautiful, puffy pink. She held true to the 'bimbo'-ish aesthetic quite easily. It was good for her son to have such and example of womanhood. 

She then proceeds to the bathroom where she showers, puts on makeup, and finally does her hair. Her long, blonde locks fall in shimmering waves down past her shoulders. Her gleaming blue eyes shining back at her underneath her magnificently painted face. She smiled, and thought to herself about her son's occasional inability to... control himself... when he saw her in the mornings. 

After turning off the lights in the bathroom, she moved to her closet. Upon turning on the lights it was readily revealed that she did not, in fact, own any real clothes. The closet was packed with lingerie of all colors and styles. She quickly set to work picking out her set for this morning. She pulled a solid cream corset, a black laced bustier, and a lacy, translucent red teddy, from her racks and placed them on the bed. She held a brief internal debate on which set would make her tits look the most fantastic. She chose the teddy and slipped it over her legs and onto her body. The soft lace danced shadows of naughtiness over her tan skin. She smiled as the straps of the teddy vaulted over her tits, the deep cut in the fabric exposing her heavy cleavage was sure to arouse quite the response from her son. 

She departed with one last toss of her hair. She readjusted her tits into the teddy, covering her hard nipples with strategic lace as she quietly opened the door and stepped into the hallway. Her walk was stealthy to John's door, she didn't want to interrupt his sleep (yet). 

She slowly swung his bedroom door open and turned on the lights ever so softly. The entire room was now light in a sensuous glow, illuminating her curves under red lace. She tip-toed into bed, sliding back Johns covers to reveal is early morning wood. She glanced at the clock which read precisely at 6:45am. This was by far the best sort of alarm clock. She straddled legs, on her hands and knees at the edge of the bed. Her perfect lips gently wrapped the head of his hard cock in a warm, wet embrace. Her tongue darted out, welcoming the morning to his shaft, and as her head slowly lowered down, John's eyes opened to a good morning moan.


**The Gentlest Hypno-Mistress**

We had known each other for a long time, and this all began as a hobby. She was beautiful. Tall, wonderful 32GG breasts, a narrow waist, curvy ass, plump lips, soft, luscious hair that fell in slow waves and a seemingly endless supply of lingerie; I did anything she asked, and hypnosis came up. She wanted to take control in bed, but in the nicest way possible. She was always a little cumslut, but it seems she wanted more this time. I went under so easily and she made it feel so good. We had to continue. 

Now we are here. She loves using me, allowing me to satisfy her cum fetish with earth shattering orgasms that shoot massive, pearly white loads of cum. I never got to complain (not that I really wanted too), she was just in charge, and that's all there was too it. I was waiting for her to be ready for the night. She always did love to tease me into trance with some sexy outfit. 

My eyes instantly locked onto her womanly frame as she opened the door to our closet, sensuously hidden underneath black lace. I could already begin to feel my mind beginning to dull with each high-heeled step across the floor. My eyes drooped down to two 32 GG breasts bouncing towards me in slow motion. My eyes tracked each little movement. ""There's a good boy, just stare and sink."" A confident voice cooed from a pair of perfect red lips. The tits stopped just before my face, my entire body relaxed to paralysis. A soft hand grazed the zipper of my pants and began to pull down. ""Just keep staring, good boy."" A soft hand slid into my pants, feeling my cock. ""Hard for me."" From the sound of her voice, I could tell that the perfect red lips were smiling. Her fingers snapped and my cock instantly rose, hard in a matter of moments.


**Office Productivity at an All-Time High**

On any given day in the very near future thousands of beautiful women can be seen bustling between the towering office buildings of any major metropolis. The arrive just shortly before the men arrive to their workplaces to ready themselves for the day. These women are Productivity Assistants and are privately contracted by different businesses to bolster focus and industriousness within the workplace. Smaller businesses might have a few assistants at their disposal, larger corporations can have a much more personal ratio of assistants to workers. 

Assistants usually had their own spaces to prepare themselves for the workday. Their early arrival allows them to properly do their hair and makeup. They are also provided a company wardrobe that is both massive and constantly adding new articles. Formal business attire for these girls is a complete outfit, from lingerie to outerwear. 

Just before the men arrive, all the assistants line up by the doorway to greet the men on their way to work. The men's eyes often stray down their professional-but-plunging necklines that reveals a hint of lace, tight and naughty against tanned skin. The assistants always glow from the attention. It would not be long before they were as swamped with their work as the men. 

*Mr. Emmerson slams a fist down onto the table just moments after he begins to open his spreadsheets. His coffee cup rattles, sprinkling a fan of manila folders on his desk. In an instant, a blonde assistant turns the corner into his cubicle. She was wearing a fitted jacket and a flowing white blouse that was perfectly tucked into a tight pencil skirt that hugged her thighs. The blouse had a severe shortage of buttons, and she was at least missing three, not that they were of any use. Her bust was incredible, and even during the most casual of glances, one could feel their eyes being slowly pulled down the rolling slope of her soft neckline to her breasts. Just barely visible above the final button was a hint of pink lace.*

*The assistant's eyes settled on him softly through her black-rimmed glasses. She parted her full lips,*

*""What's wrong, Mr. Emmerson? Are yesterday's files not on the company server?"" She cooed sweetly, stepping into the office and swinging her arms around Mr. Emmerson's chest.*

*""They let the fucking interns touch the file and now the equations aren't correct!"" Mr. Emmerson yelled in a huff, his face was turning puffy and his cheeks flushed red. His fists clenched.*

*""Now now, Mr. Emmerson,"" The assistant said softly as she got down on her knees in between Mr. Emmerson's legs. She slowly undid his zipper on his pants. His eyes immediately locked onto the soft lips of the blonde.*

*""I'm certain we can figure all this out and get right back to work."" She smiled at Mr. Emmerson, taking his cock out of his pants and holding the hardening shaft just inches away from her lips. His face flushed red, but for an entirely different reason. His closed fist relaxed the assistant's lips wrapped entirely around the head of his cock.*

The Productivity Assistants left just after the men finished their workday. After the final worker left the office, the assistants all filed back into their quarters in the office. All of them had been stripped of their business attire and most had removed some or all of their lingerie. There was cum everywhere. Every hole filled, every face, breast, and ass coated in cum. They all giggled at the sight of themselves in the mirrors, cum often still dripping off of faces and tits from final staff meetings, and last minute projects thrust onto workers. Some licked the last load off before retreating home to rest for tomorrow's workday. 


Thanks for reading!

3k4opz,0,2015-09-08,26M4F Unleash your inner bad girl; several prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3k4opz/26m4f_unleash_your_inner_bad_girl_several_prompts/,"So I've got a soft spot for bad girls. ;)

I've had a lot of fun with several of these prompts in the past, but there are a few newer ones I'd love to try out as well. I'm game for pretty much anything as long as it doesn't go into my ""dislikes,"" which can be found at the bottom of the page. I'm around most of the day and would love to play any of these out!

1) It's your standard party scene. You pick the venue (night club, pool party, strip club, etc.), but regardless of the location, it's hopping, with booze flowing and scantily-clad women (and maybe men, too) running around looking absolutely perfect. Whether you're a partygoer, a bartender, a stripper/hooker, or any other role you can imagine, you're out tonight for one reason: To get fucked hard.

2) You're an intern at the office I work in. We don't deal with each other much, other than idle chit-chat. However, in my side job editing video for some shady clients, I notice a familiar face working a stripper pole and giving lap dances. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to confront you with the evidence.

3) I've married an older woman and have entered into an open relationship. My new wife has a daughter younger than me, and you're her best friend. We've been thinking of you as a bad influence, but lately, my eyes have been more drawn to a body that's absolutely built for sex. You and my step-daughter come home late one night, and my wife isn't around.

4) I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. Every time I go, you're there, strutting your stuff in an ill-fitting sports bra and short shorts that barely constrain your juicy ass. You turn heads and you know it, and one day I work up the courage to introduce myself.

5) Anything else you can think of that doesn't fit my dislikes!

---

My kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, bimbos/bimbofication, dirty talk (the raunchier the better), oral sex (giving and receiving), group sex, multiple orgasms/cumplay, bad girls (partying/drinking/smoking all encouraged).

My no-go's: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, heavy BDSM, incest, noncon.

Hope to hear from you!"

3k4rkp,592,2015-09-08,I GOT HIRED AT SEPHORA!!!,putontheglasses,MakeupAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3k4rkp/i_got_hired_at_sephora/,"I have been trying to gain employment with these guys for about a year now, and I DID IT!!

Although to some people it may ""just be a retail job"" this opportunity has so much meaning to me. A little over a year ago I decided to leave a career 20 years in the making to try and become a makeup artist. Starting a new career path from scratch is one of the scariest decisions I'd ever had to make, and all I had to go on was whatever experience I had doing friends' makeup and my ongoing vested interest in the beauty industry at large. I reached out to makeup artists to intern for them, took classes whenever I could afford them, did countless makeup jobs for free just to start to form professional relationships, and started applying to makeup counters. Sephora was my dream workplace from day 1; I've been a loyal customer since I was a teenager, and the more research I did on how the company operates, the more I wanted to be a part of the team. I knew with my limited makeup experience, a regular job at a counter would improve my skills and knowledge and expose me to more potential clients, but since I had no retail experience I was rebuffed over and over again. BUT, a few weeks ago I was FINALLY called in for an interview at one of the biggest locations in the country, and (if I say so myself) I NAILED IT.

I'm so much more confident in my skills and knowledge now than I was a year ago, and my pro MUA website is almost ready. I will  also continue to work freelance, but having a regular ""survival"" job that actually is directly related to my dream career is something I've never had before. I am SO grateful and proud of myself, and after years of struggle with depression, horrible restaurant and other side jobs, and disappointing myself over and over again, this means more to me than anything else. I've done good work, and it paid off. I can take pride in something. I am worthy.

And more than anything, I made the right decision. This IS the path for me.

Thank you for all of your helpful comments and compliments, /r/MUA. They really have helped with keeping my spirits up when I was questioning my choices. This is a great community, and if you have any questions about the interview process or about how my first few days go, don't hesitate to message me!

I'M SO EXCITED!!!!"
3k4sjj,2,2015-09-08,Denied for a credit card and struggling for a next step,captain_craisins,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3k4sjj/denied_for_a_credit_card_and_struggling_for_a/,"Hey PF!
I am 26 years old and currently an intern at a nature preserve in South Florida. I am about 7 months through a 12 month internship. I graduated from college with a bachelor's in biology. With my internship, I receive $317 every other week, plus a $5000 education award at the end of the year. I also own a reliable car that is paid off.
My current financial situation:
* A checking account with about $19 in it
* A savings account with about $1 in it
* A credit card (Opened 2 years ago) with a $3488 balance with a $3500 limit. Payment around $90 a month.
* An EBT card that receives $180 a month
* Federal student loans totaling $52,000 that are deferred until March 2016
* Two private loans totaling $50,000 that I pay $250 a month

I recently applied for a Chase Slate card because I wanted to transfer some of the balance from my current credit card to it. The Chase Slate card had 0% fee for balance transfers and a 0% APR for the first year. Today, I received a notice that stated I was denied the card due to :
* High debt relative to income
* Length of time since oldest credit card was opened is too short
* Total available credit on credit cards is too low
* Too many accounts with a high balance compared to the credit line.

It also told me I have a 613 credit score. With my current credit card, like I said, I pay about $90 a month. Then, interest charges are usually around $60 a month. So I end up paying around $30 towards paying down what I owe for my credit card. 

I have been working my butt off at my internship, meeting a lot of people, impressing a lot of people, and gaining a lot of experience in my field. I hate to count of chickens before they hatch, but I shouldn't have a problem getting a career, well paying job once I get done with my internship. It's just surviving these couple of months. 

What can I do to help my situation? Could I request a balance increase on my current credit card? Should I apply for other credit cards? Should I not bother with credit cards, put my head down, and pay my minimum amounts for the next 5 months?
Thank you!

3k5270,3,2015-09-08,Used MINI for a soon-to-be law school grad?,badmusebears,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/3k5270/used_mini_for_a_soontobe_law_school_grad/,"Greetings! I'm currently in my second year of law school, and plan on graduating in May of 2017. For the past few years I've been driving a 2002 Ford Taurus; it has about 146K miles on it and has just been slowly falling apart lately. I've got my sights set on a 2012 MINI Cooper Countryman S with 53K miles, priced at $17.8K at a local dealer. Real clean, real nice.

My question is - being that I want a car that I like to last me until I start making some lawyer money, is this suggestible? Or am I too in love with the car? Thanks for any help you can offer!

I need a 4-door car, with some cargo room as my fiancée and I have stuff to move around occasionally and two small dogs to chauffeur around.

This car is up towards the top of my price range, but I plan on trying to negotiate it down a bit; I can do about 10% down, and plan on trading in my Taurus.

It's a stick-shift, and I love that. It'll mostly be used to commute around town for classes, internships, etc."

As soon as I graduate, I plan to move.

Right now, I'm thinking austin, dallas, or houston.  Although all are cheaper than here in terms of cost of living, I've heard dallas and houston is cheaper than austin but what about job prospects?  Are they all about equal?

Currently, I've been looking for accounting internships here (HI; big 3 favored but highly competitive), working an unrelated business internship, and participating in BAP (heard it's good on resumes but also a chance for me to better myself and meet others).

The biggest problem I see in moving is finding a job (I wouldn't know a lot of people there vs. here...).  I plan on visiting friends in TX this dec-jan and was wondering if it would be too soon in applying for jobs.  I could interview in person then or wait to apply later (either before or after graduation).  Is there a specific period of hiring for firms in that area?

Any advice on the issue?  Another option for me is to find a FT position here, work a year while taking my CPA exam.  My issue with that it may be harder for me to leave then.  How would I go about letting them know I plan to leave in 1-2 years?

A friend of mine was able to find a job lead in her hometown through one of the Big 3 here.  She had mentioned moving back after graduation and they were able to place her there because they currently did not have an open position here.  Is that something I should even mention in an interview/interaction?  Feels like it would be a deterrent for a recruiter/hiring manager. "

Please help.",vlin2,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3k6iyv/hi_reddit_i_think_im_depressed_from_a_best_friend/,"im 23 [F] and have been best friends with a 23 [F] for almost 10 years since beginning of HS. We've always been opposites in which I am the introvert and she Is the extrovert.

I believe it started when I went to a family internship across the country for about a month and a half. I think it was because I've never been away from my home for more than a week vacation and I'm not much of a Facebook user or texter. My best friend also became friends with a girl I learned not to like and I'm usually good with being able to tell a good person from a bad one. This friend is the provocative type and my best friend is always weak to wanting to look her best / the best but was insecure. At the time I was secure about myself but since I came back from the trip I felt like I was replaced, not pretty enough, insecure and I guess I also felt repulsed by this girl/ trying to be opposite that I started letting myself go. 

The friend was of course let go for money stealing reasons but my best friend carried on with this new behavior. Of course I will be there for her through her times of hardship, insecurities and drama but at the same time, it became a habit of only her talking and me rarely talking. When I would talk it seems like she would try and out talk me with her stories (sometimes the same stories). I felt like I wasn't important anymore so I somehow developed a habit of only listening. And now at my youth i really have nothing to talk about or stories to tell as all I hear are hers. 

And when I'm with friends and she's not there I feel like myself again, happy and talkative. I feel dull all the time and i dont have that spark of energy as if day to day are all the same. There are times when i create an idea but she uses them as her own which makes me self-loathe because i feel like whats the use? aI believe it started when I went to a family internship across the country for about a month and a half.

I feel dull and I know it shows because some of our mutual friends now want to know more about whats going on in her life than mine or how I'm feeling. This has dragged on for about 3-4 years. I feel like i need to distance myself from her but at the same time we are considered a package as we live close to one another and are always rogether. As time, college, career life, opinions have changed, i almost feel like we are really opposite to the point that i dont feel equal with her and need to venture off on my own. I just don't know how i can handle this without breaking our friendship as she takes things pretty sensitively. What should I do Reddit?

3k6luc,13,2015-09-08,A Functioning Junky's Take on DNM Dope and the Lifestyle,computersmack,DarkNetMarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3k6luc/a_functioning_junkys_take_on_dnm_dope_and_the/,"I'm really bored and decided to write this post for a few reasons.  Every day I see posts come up on drug subreddits asking the classic ""should I try opiates"" or some dumb shit like that.  I see reviews for vendors that consist of an orgasm-in-text about that 'fire fucking dope' that was as hard as a rock, pure-white, and hit like a freight train for an hour or two before instant sobriety.  Maybe (probably not) my experiences will help people avoid getting ripped off, and I'll give my take on ECP across vendors I've ordered from and cities/hookups I've sourced in person.

I've been on-and-off ordering heroin off darknetmarkets since about one year ago.  I use dnm sourcing for it typically out of desperation when I'm in bumfuck nowhere or the alternative (cold-copping on west/south side of Chicago while small and white for scrabble) is the only option.  I've been robbed, shorted, waited 5 minutes at the corner 20 times consecutively and multiple days for a crackhead to finally drive over with some of the shittiest dope in Chi-town.  I've crashed my car on the way to work still high from the last night doing h on top of a pile of xanax and got pulled over in downtown NYC high on coke with my dealer in the passenger seat right after his reup.  I've also totally alienated myself from most of my friends, blew an amazing internship this summer, and completed the destruction of the relationship with my family.  So, there you go kids, if you haven't started and are thinking of asking - don't fucking start.  It begins as nothing and gets better and better until it leaves you broke, alone and emotionally blank.

So enough of the whiny bullshit and onto that sweet sweet heroin.  I only have done ECP since I've always lived in the midwest/east coast and want the option of snorting it.  I've IV'd a few times but ran away afterwords for a couple reasons - my veins are pretty hard to hit and it feels too damn good.  I typically stuff it up my nose through evening/night until I can't afford to get more or haven't shit in over a week.  With that in mind, here's my take on the vendors I remember ordering from.

**PCCubeSensei** - Waited forever, overpaid more than usual for dnm, it *was* alright quality a year back but not worth almost 20/stamp.

**DayDreamer** - I'd put it on the line of OK and decent for quality, no serious complaint about that and service was fine.  This is the stamp bag game - they almost never are even close to a full point, so I ended up paying 30 dollars for 45 mg of dope.  Not sure he still vends.  Pass.

**RealDope** - Again I'm not sure he's still active, but holy fucking shit this was the second-worst heroin I've done in my life.  This shit barely got me high, came in packaging handmade by Tyrone Biggums, and had me over the toilet for the better part of a few evenings (oh hell yeah I kept doing it after the first night).  Fuck this guy.

**Dragoncove** - Service was nothing special but no problem.  This was what chicago-grey consists of in dreams: nice soft rocks that break up easy into beautiful light powder.  It's very potent.  But it was over $200 per gram, which you should not be paying.  I read complaints about him fenting later on but not sure that was true, same for scamming, but he's still vacationing right now as far as I know.

**AlexSosa1KG** - This is probably my favorite overall vendor.  I've never had dope from him I'd put below a 7/10, and it was very similar in appearance and potency to the best shit I scored in NYC: tan-colored, powder/flaky texture after soft rocks break down.  He always shipped fast-as-fuck and was either really nice, a douchebag, or just flat out ignores you in comms depending on the day.

**Sweet_n_Stoned** - So... I might get some complaints for location-specific info, but this was how he originally advertised and it isn't exactly a secret.  This, this is Chicago-area heroin.  It's grey.  Sometimes very dark grey.  The rocks are hard.  Maybe a bit harder than one would like.  But it isn't bad.  It's at his worst a 6 being extremely harsh, but most of what I got was more 7-8.  His service and comms are the best I've encountered, even doing favors with shipping packages as requested, so I'd probably put him on top of the available Abraxas vendors.  One problem that needs to be addressed - mylar the damn bags bro, fuckin' dogs.  But his decoys are good.

So there you go.  For those who don't know, good #4 heroin should:

* be light brown, tan or light grey
* rocks should not be very difficult to break on a hard surface
* with low/no tolerance, get you fucking destroyed snorting a point
* not be extremely hard-hitting and quick fading (fentanyl)

Anyway this helped me occupy myself for a little while so thanks for reading.  Feel free to tell me to fuck/kill myself in the comments or argue with anything/everything I said."

3k84px,5,2015-09-09,Do I need to seek professional help?,throwaway12902845349,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/3k84px/do_i_need_to_seek_professional_help/,"It's very relieving for me to find this subreddit. I've always really enjoyed videogames, but for the past few years it's been too much for me to be happy. I'm going to try to be thorough in writing about my problem, but I'll also do my best to include a good tl;dr list at the bottom, too.

When I was very young I lived a boring life. I'm sure many of you can relate to this, as video games where a way for me to alleviate the boredom I felt on a daily basis. Regardless of what I was doing, I was bored if I wasn't playing one of my games. My parents were relatively lax about this, of course they did limit it a bit but as long as I got good grades they were happy.

In high school this continued, I became more social, but I struggled with depression and low self-esteem like many teenagers. In retrospect, it makes perfect sense to me why video games were my go-to escape: they were familiar to me, they allowed me to forget about the world, and they didn't have any explicit ""negative"" side effects that I could see.

Entering college, I was really lucky to see a lot of my problems go away. Classes were easy, I no longer had any money issues (low income family to full scholarship and well-paying job), and being social became much easier for me. I made a lot of new friends, which got rid of all the loneliness I was feeling in high school. I also struggled a lot with talking to girls, but a few months into my freshman year my self-esteem really shot up and approaching girls became a piece of cake.

But back to why I'm even writing this post: I'm entering my senior year of college. I still have good grades, and I was lucky enough to get an internship that will be turning into a job as soon as I graduate. Friends are good, sex life is fantastic, for all intents and purposes I have exactly the life I hoped to have when I was younger. And, for the most part, I feel very happy. But there is this part of me that still craves video games. Back in high school when I had no friends I would play League of Legends most of the time, and it was fun. I still think it's a very fun game. But the thing is, as fun as it is, when I look back at the time I spend playing it, it just seems like an hour wasted. An hour I could have done something productive. An hour I spent just sitting in a chair staring at a screen. Disgusting.

I would much rather go out with my friends, study (not enjoyable but it's good for me), work out, etc. And the thing is, I do all of those things. I only play ~4 games of LoL a week, usually concentrated into one or two days, so about 4 hours. To most people, the obvious response is, ""So what? We all have hobbies, it's okay to play a bit if you enjoy it.""

I understand that viewpoint, but for me, it isn't okay. I don't want to spend any time playing when there are other things that I enjoy, that are better for me, that I could be doing instead. But especially lately, it's so difficult for me to not play. No matter what I'm doing, sleeping with a girl, going to a party with my friends, I'm *dying* to play a game of LoL. When I do let myself play, I feel incredibly tempted to play all day and night without rest. I find that pretty disturbing, I don't want to desire that, but it becomes so difficult for me to fight off my craving.

A lot of posts I see regarding video game addiction involve some other problem. Some sort of mental disorder or other condition such as low self-esteem tend to incite the person's desire to play video games all day. Looking back at my younger life, I completely see this. That makes sense to me. But now, it doesn't make sense to me at all. I just want to stop, cold turkey, but I can't bring myself to quit.

I have tried uninstalling the game, but a few days after I just reinstalled it. Honestly, I know it sounds absurd because of how little I *actually* play, but please understand that this is something that I want to get rid of, but it is very difficult for me to do so. Any help is appreciated.

**tl;dr**

* Addicted to video games since youth due to low self-esteem, depression, and overall boring life** Start playing League of Legends in high school, becomes only game I play (forgot to mention earlier), very fun escape for me

* Entering college, life improves drastically. Very happy with everything, no big stressors or problems.

* Still feel intense cravings to play LoL despite better life. I want to enjoy other things because I know they make me happier, but it's so difficult for me to avoid my addiction to League of Legends. I want to quit cold turkey but I relapse so easily."
3k8st3,3,2015-09-09,MBA Safari video problem,Nilas_T,applehelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/3k8st3/mba_safari_video_problem/,"While using Safara, I can usually play videos just fine, but there are certain issues:

1) I can play embedded YouTube videos on Facebook, but if I try to make them fullscreen, the fullscreen instead becomes my Facebook wall (like I'm ""seeing through"" the video).

*EDIT: I seemed to have solved this problem with an extension called ""YoutubeWide""*

2) Sometimes, intern Facebook videos (doesn't seem to happen for YT videoes) will stop completely, with the timer still going.

3) Certain video formats on other sites just won't play (or will play with black screen and sound only.

I believe my Flash Player to be updated, though I might have an old version installed as well (not sure how to check)."
3k94ta,1,2015-09-09,I don't know what's wrong with me,Diyanzou,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3k94ta/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,"As the title describes, I have no idea what's wrong with me. I'm 21 with little to no job experience. The only job I've had was an internship I had when I was in college -Speak about that a bit more down- and it was only for two months. I don't even know how long it's been since I've been unemployed since then.. maybe a year or nearing two. When I think about it, I feel hopeless, I feel like a damn failure. 

When I was finished with high school, I jumped straight into college like everyone, now I won't lie, I messed around my first time, I still had a playful mentality and I failed. . I felt bad, cause I had now realized, I wasted my parents money. . So I told my self I would give it one more try and putting in all my effort, so I did. . . In the end, I failed again and I honestly could not understand how and all I could think to my self was, ""even at your best, you still failed. . fucking failure"" and besides that yet AGAIN, I managed to waste more of my parents money. .  it's been two years since college and I still can't get that feeling to go away, I wasted their money and at my best, I was nothing. 

. . .I feel like I'm a bad friend and a bad son. I used to think about suicide. . .there were some days when I was just so damn close, days when I thought ""It's obvious you have no place in this world, you're just causing your self hurt and causing hurt to others around you."" . . .

And it's not like I haven't tried to talk about it openly and see if i was just being stupid or silly but. . ugh. . I just can't shake this feeling like I have no place in this world. . .

The biggest things that makes me feel like shit are I'm jobless and I can't help out my mom, I still depend on my mother and father for money and the biggest of all, I feel like a major disappointment to my mom and pop. . for some reason more so my pop. . when I visit him and i see him, it's like when i see him look at me, I see sadness/disappointment/shame . . and it honestly tears me up inside. . sometimes I try to avoid visiting just so I don't see that look.

I recently got some advise from someone and it goes, ""Different strokes are for different folks."" and right now, that's the only thing keeping me going right now.

. . . Sometimes I wonder how i truly feel about my self, is it hate, dislike. . or do I feel nothing for my self.."

3k982j,3,2015-09-09,Do you find yourself apologizing frequently in the work place?,bagelsandcoffee,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3k982j/do_you_find_yourself_apologizing_frequently_in/,"Since about mid-way through college, I found my stride and became an individual who is(was?) very confident. I communicated directly with everyone and always spoke my mind. This served me well in the professional world all the way through college in every job I had.

The summer after college I took an internship where it didn't work out as well. The people I worked with did not respond well to directness, and I was also at an out-of-town internship so I didn't have any friends or anything and was essentially more or less isolated completely and always walking on egg shells.

I took it as a lesson in learning how to be a little more sensitive with people who need it, but now that I'm back at my regular job I've found that it impacts my actions with others and it frustrates me. I have a propensity to sign e-mails with ""sorry for blah blah blah"" when I'm speaking my mind, or I backtrack if I'm bringing up something that contradicts what my partner thinks.

It pisses me off! I know I wouldn't say these things if I didn't think they needed to be brought up, and I don't think my experiences or opinions are invalid, so it makes me so frustrated that just two months of a horrible experiences after 3 years of great ones has affected me as a person so drastically!

tl;dr was very confident, horrible internship experience killed that and now frequently apologizes for having opinions.

Did/Does anyone else have a similar issue? How did/do you deal with it?"

I'm moving down to Atlanta this weekend to start an internship, but the housing hunt is getting the best of me. Craigslist seems to be mostly spam and autoreplies (is there just one annoying realtor with a ton of listings?!). 

I'm looking for shared housing with roommates, since I'm coming from that situation in the northeast and love it. My budget is &amp;amp;lt;= $700 (with some wiggle room), and since I'm looking to live car-free, I've been looking ITP in Midtown and Decatur, and all along the east-west MARTA (gives me traffic-independent access to the office). Any tips or leads for finding housing? Am I on the right track? I've read through past housing posts on the subreddit, but wanted to check in with folks on the current state of affairs.

Thanks!

Edited to be more specific about roommates. If anyone has any leads or is looking for a roommate, let me know!"
3k9qn7,12,2015-09-09,I really need to get my shit together,benevolenttoast,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3k9qn7/i_really_need_to_get_my_shit_together/,"It's 12 AM (sorry if some parts don't make sense and I'm sorry for how long this is. I'm really sleepy and anxious and English is not my first language) and I decided to write this post because I am SO scared. I am always depressed and anxious. I guess making this post is a way of releasing my emotions? Anyway, I am a twenty-two-year old female and I graduated college a few months ago. I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE LOST IN MY LIFE. And because my depression and anxiety got worse, I decided to see a professional! Finally. I didn’t do this earlier because I thought I could handle it by myself. Like, some days it really felt like I had my shit together but when I didn’t, it was bad to the point where I felt like I needed medication to ease my anxiety. I have ALWAYS been an anxious person ever since I was a kid! And I was sick of it. Also, whenever I brought it up to some of my friends, they’re like “I never really talked to one because I know what they’re going to say.” But recently, I realized that they’re not me. They don’t know what I’m going through, and they don’t handle things like me. Maybe they didn’t need help, but I did. So last week, I saw a therapist.

Even though I expected it to suck, I showed up. And it was a good decision because we were able to talk about things that I didn’t get to talk about when I saw a school counselor. I cried lol She was able to lead the conversation into topics that had a connection with what was currently happening in my life. It made me understand my emotions a lot better, and it even got me excited to get my shit together.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Honestly, we talked about a lot more things but I cannot list all of them down, so here are the most important ones:

1. My childhood- I was bullied a lot growing up and that was the first time I talked about it with anyone. I didn’t know how much it affected me until we talked about it! This is the part where I cried and it felt good, haha. I can’t even talk to my friends about it without feeling embarrassed or like I’m overreacting. 

2. School/bullying- In high school, they never gave me a chance to do my thing because I was the quiet kid and that was all I was known for. Even teachers didn’t trust me with jobs because they thought I was stupid. I blamed myself a lot for this because I didn’t prove to them what I was capable of. But then I remember that I tried to volunteer to do some stuff but was never chosen because everyone knows that in high school most of the time when you get labelled as something, that’s what you will always be your label until you graduate. I was that quiet weird girl that wasn’t ANYTHING. Like, they couldn’t even think of anything to give me for my senior certificate but “Most Keen” and even I got shit for that. It was terrible. Even when I was at college, I constantly felt like this is what people would always label me as. I was very paranoid of putting myself out there. Whenever someone from college would ignore me in the school hallways, I automatically got flashbacks of high school.
 
When it came to doing work, I got so anxious that I dropped subjects even before I knew if I could do them. I excelled for the first two years and was even chosen to join a quiz bee. IT FELT GREAT because I didn’t know I was capable of that. And then came third year. I started to feel incapable and all that jazz to the point that I couldn’t even sleep at night because I was SO nervous. 

3. Work/career- I have never had a real job except for a small internship and the reason for that is I AM SCARED OF WORKING BECAUSE WHAT IF I FUCK UP. I had a better internship option but I chose the less demanding one because… well, I’m me. I don’t even like reading emails right away related to jobs because it made me so nervous! I would move them into a folder that I don’t automatically see when I open my email.

4. Family- MAN OH MAN. Myyyy mother is the most controlling person on earth. I don’t know things that I should know at this age because she never let me experience anything for myself. She was VERY protective and is still is! She’s nagging me while I’m typing this. That’s all I can tell you because I’m getting pissed lol

----------------------------------------------------------------
Some findings. Sorry if these are too short. I am so sleepy and my needing to type all of this out is decreasing:

1. I am always scared of trying out new things because my mother never let me do anything by myself growing up. She was very controlling (still is) and she loves to nag. She always pointed out my flaws and it made me feel insecure. She’s the same way towards my brother and sister and to be honest I don’t really like how their lives turned out because even they didn’t get to experience a lot of things. I know that my mother cares for us deeply but God stop making decisions for us! I don’t blame her for everything. She’s a nervous wreck too. I have to change the way I react to her comments and find a family counselor to talk to her. Doesn’t have to be an expensive therapist but someone she listens to.

2. I am scared of people because I got bullied a lot growing up and I expect everyone I meet to be the same as those bullies. I need to stop judging people right away and give myself a chance to get to know them. If they don’t like me, then they don’t. It sucks but I’ll find people who I get along with eventually.

3. I need to stop comparing my skills to people. And I won’t really know what I am capable of if I don’t take risks. Even if I’m not sure of what I want to do with my life, I can try out different things and find one that works. Even my therapist didn’t know she wanted to be a therapist at my age.
4. Nutrition plays a role in depression and anxiety so I’m gonna slowly increase intake of healthy foods, and also I need to go out more and exercise.

5. I need to talk to my friends more and show up to gatherings, but also rest when I have to.

6. Some days are going to suck but I am going to survive them like I survived all the shit that happened in the past.

7. Download a lot of self-help books and podcasts. I did this before even starting therapy and it was a big help. I listen to the mental illness happy hour and get busy living podcasts. Find one that works for you. I read a lot of Brene Brown’s and Susan Cain’s books and follow them online. Watch their TED talks when you have the time.

----------------------------------------------------------------
This is all I am capable of typing at the moment. My eyes hurt. Lol

I am not saying this will work for everyone. I just wanted to share MY experiences. I just want to tell you that if you need help, please don’t hesitate to ask for it. I really wish I had done it sooner. 
I know that I will still feel shitty about life sometimes, but I hope I can find a way to handle that now. I feel overwhelmed right now, but I am also looking forward to continuing my therapy sessions and getting better. I really really don’t want to always be anxious and depressed anymore.
I'm not really looking for advice but feel free to share some if you have any.

1. I'll miss walking along the lake, and just looking out at the jete every night.
2. I'll miss drinking in the park, surrounded by other ex-pats. (ain't no public drinking in North America..)
3. I'll miss the public transit that ran like clockwork.
4. I'll miss how all of Europe seems so accessible from Geneve -- Annecy, Nice, Lyon, etc... all seemed like a stone's throw away.
5. Walking over the bridges around the lake.
6. The different neighborhoods... the charm and restaurants of Carouge, walking around Old Town, shopping, drinking and hanging out in Plainpalais, the gelato of Paquis... even the dumpy concrete of Petite Lancy (my hood..) was so comfortable.
7. the music festival was one of the best i've ever been to... 

Didn't like...

1. The cost, the cost, the cost... I've spent time in Paris, Tokyo, NYC, and only London comes close to the ridiculousness of Geneva.
2. The restaurants weren't great... I spent a lot (comparatively) of cash at some restaurants, and the food usually left quite a bit to be desired.
3. While everyone I met was friendly, it would have been nice to meet some actual Genevians... it seemed like ex-pats were the only people who ever went out and socialized.

My and my boyfriend live about 2 hours away now and I have a very happy relationship with him. We see each other when we can which is more often than not but we each have our own separate, fulfilled lives and love each other so much. 

Things have been going good until my beau starting taking a lot of interest and took the first steps toward applying for an internship in China for two months. Freaking out. When I freak out, he ensures me how much he loves me and wants to marry me and that he'll fly me out to visit. 

I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW... this is a great opportunity for him (and us if I visit), two months is nothing, he is not even accepted yet, I should be happy and supportive and confident about his career and focus on possible internships or jobs for myself this summer. I just need you guys to remind me of this. You always know what to say. 

We spent this whole last summer traveling and everyday together. I can't help but feel we'll be missing out on that. Insecurity keeps rearing its ugly head. Reddit, tell me to let go... it's not until next summer for heavens sake Im going to overthink myself sick. 

I just miss him already :-(

I'm 20 and just started my junior year of University, I went to a community college first to save money so I don't have any debt, but now that I'm going to University everything is a lot more expensive and I'm going to have to take out a loan this semester. I did the math and i'm going to end up in about 12k debt when I graduate. I have a debit card but it really limits me since there's only two locations for it in my state so it's a hassle when I have to deposit money or do anything (it's a federal credit union, I don't really know what that means?) so I want to cancel it and open up a new one with a different bank along with getting my first credit card too. But I don't know where to begin?

I'm going to take classes online next semester and live in Mexico for a couple months with family, then I'm doing a paid internship in another state for two semesters, and I want to teach English in Korea after I graduate. Which would be the best foreign country friendly credit card for a broke college student??"
3kb5jz,1,2015-09-09,Is this considered emotional abuse?,Blucove,emotionalabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/3kb5jz/is_this_considered_emotional_abuse/,"So I've had problems with my mother since I was 8 (am 17 now) and I've occasionally thought about whether it was abuse of some kind. Nothing was ever physical (excluding being slapped or spanked for bad behavior or the occasional tantrum), so I never thought it was abuse of any kind. Then someone told me about emotional abuse and well... here I am.

I'm not sure if this is considered emotional abuse, but it feels really fucking awful. I'll type out what I can recall her doing and the things that bothered me most, but I was driven to write this post after a fight not five minutes ago with her, so my mind is probably not the clearest. :c

Ever since I can remember, I've always hated her. I've seen videos of her and me on a cruise and we're laughing, but I don't remember any of that and it seems weird to see that kind of interaction between us. I can't stand her at all. If she's in the room, I'll leave and I can't stand her touching me. It's like a sting or something. I don't know how to explain it, but even if she brushes past my arm, it bothers me alot. 

She can be extremely bipolar in her attitudes. One second she'll be happy and having a normal conversation (though she's always cold towards me) and the next, she'll be extremely mean. She's basically a 47 year old bully. She'll pick at you for anything you know you're self conscious about and then she'll comfort you, later.

Ever since I started going to school, I'd always be asked about my grades, always pushed more and more, even when the grades were literally perfect. Yet at the same time, I was always told that I would never be good enough for anything (clubs, extra courses, internships, etc). This was really annoying especially now in my senior year of highschool when I look back at all the things I could have done, that I KNOW I could have done, but I never did because I listened to her. I've always known I was smart enough to go where I wanted to go, but she's always the one telling me I can't do shit, and I'll never do anything useful with my life. Because of this, college was my ideal escape from her. Being a senior, now's my time to get out and start applying to places far away from home. Ever since I started doing my college apps, she's always telling me things like ""We'll see how you feel when you get back all your decline letters."" ""You're wasting your time, you didn't do well enough in school to go anywhere."" ""No school wants you, and you're sure as hell not staying here."" YET, at the same time, she'll say ""Why not apply to Rice?"" (Rice is a very VERY good school in my area.) ""Why not apply to better schools? You could make it in with your scores, I'm sure!"" This is really annoying and it's been like this all my life, constantly eating away at me. The constant disapproval/encouragement from my mother is taking a toll on my mental health or something. I never know what she thinks of me and one minute, I'll think I'm doing well, and the next, she'll shut me down and tell me I'm worthless and shit.

There's also my younger sister. She's 11 while I'm 17. That's a 6 year difference. My mother compares me to her for EVERYTHING. How long she takes her shower to how she does in school. She just got out of elementary school, and of course has all A's (which I do too) yet my mother compares her grades to me and CONSTANTLY asks why I'm not more like her. My sibling has become an ideal mini-me of my mother. She piles on the makeup just like her, spends an hour taking pictures with my mother in the morning (I'm not kidding. They take that long.), and bullies me in all the ways she can. Every morning, I get told by both of them the things that are wrong with me beauty-wise. They also refuse to let me eat the food they eat. We got a box of sushi last night from the store, I took some for lunch today, and my sister came out to tell me that I now owed them both $30 because I ate THEIR sushi, when it was everyone's sushi. They also mark the food they buy with ""-insert my name-, do not eat!"". I also have to report to my sister every day (keep in mind she's 6 years younger than me) and tell her what homework I've done and whether or not I've done all my chores for the day. She then tells my mother and won't refrain from twisting the story to make the day more entertaining for her. (Meaning she'll lie and say I didn't do anything so I get yelled at and told I'm useless and have to do everything over plus more. This is almost a daily occurrence and there's nothing I can do to change it. If I bring up the fact that she's lying, she'll just say ""Oh but she wouldn't lie. She'd tell me if she was lying."" This happens with almost everything. 

She used to give me the silent treatment for weeks after we had an argument. I'd say something and she'd ignore me. Now it's become a constant ignoring and only speaking to me when she needed me to do something or to berate me for something I didn't do or something I did wrong. This is also really really annoying. When I need something or my sister's literally following me around hitting and kicking me (this happens quite often because she knows it annoys me) she'll just turn away or not respond at all. When I persist, she'll get up without a word, and go to her bedroom and lock the door.

She frequently says things she knows will bother me like ""Make sure to do -certain chore-"" While I'm literally standing there doing said chore. Or like the other day when I was talking about certain things being in the Bible, ""Oh so you're a christian now? Wow I didn't know you were religious"" and then proceeded to ask me about everything about the religion then tell me I wasn't really chrisitan becuase I couldnt answer some questions even though I NEVER said I was of any religion in the first place. Or after I just got a new job ""when are you going to take me out to dinner? When I got my job the first thing I did was take my family out to dinner. You're such a greedy child. I'm glad -insert younger sister's name here- isn't that greedy."". 

My father used to help me with all this, but recently he's been busy with work and is never around much. He's gotten tired of all my complaints and doesn't do anything about it anymore. He rather chooses to ignore it all. He's not home to see what happens so he doesn't know what to believe. I believe he mentioned the term ""gaslighting"" when they were about to get divorced, but I don't remember what it meant or why. But he brought it up against my mother many a time. 

One other thing my mother does is tell my younger sister that she'll leave if my sibling suddenly doesn't love her anymore. This puts my sister in a tough position. With one parent loving her and one parent conditionally loving her this becomes hard. I don't blame her for constantly being rude to me and making my life miserable. That's all she can do, because if she's nice to me, she feels my mother's rage as well. This has driven us apart to a point where it's unfixable. 

She will hold things above my head as well to get me to do things. It'll be things like ""Clean the entire house and if I find a speck of dust anywhere, you're not going to your Orchestra Spring Trip."" and of course she'll find something and I won't get to go. I've since learned not to tell her about anything until the day before it happens, to minimize the loss of anything. But it's always like this. She'll always hold these things over my head to make me do some ridiculous tasks that are impossible to do just for the satisfaction of taking it away later.

There's only one point where it got violent between us two. One night, she had come into my room late at night and saw my phone on my desk. (on the other side of the room from my bed) She accused me of using it late at night and started yelling at me and taking all the electronics out of my room. I had grabbed my lamp and pulled it out of her hands telling her she was crazy and she shoved me, but I resisted and pushed back and she hit the wall claiming, later, that I had punched her, which DID NOT happen EVER.

This is just a quick list and I'll add more when I remember it, but as for now, this is just a few of the big things that she does consistently. Any thoughts on what to do? I really don't want to live like this anymore."

As a young child I believed the Peace Corps to be my opportunity to save the world, ending hunger and eliminating poverty in the span of only a couple years. However after my bachelor’s degree, an internship at the Peace Corps Headquarters, and extensive travels, I have gained a more realistic expectation for my two-year service period. In my time as a Peace Corps Volunteer I will pursue active and passive goals drawing from my work with nonprofits, as well as use my travel and outdoor experience to overcome any physical, emotional, and mental challenges.


My first reason for wishing to serve abroad is to take an active role in the community which I am chosen for. Utilizing past experience working with nonprofits I will implement tangible, sustainable improvements in local communities in line with Goal One. Throughout high school and college I involved myself with volunteer organizations including the local animal shelter, a bicycle cooperative for the homeless, and two different organic farms. Drawing upon these experiences I partnered with AmeriCorps’ City Year program to create the East San Jose Bicycle Cooperative at two middle schools. These experiences have given me the confidence to continue working with existing organizations as well as leading new projects.


My second reason for joining the Peace Corps is to advance Goals Two and Three by integrating myself within international communities as well as acting as an ambassador for the United States. Sophomore year I studied in Italy and spent a month couch surfing northern Africa and Europe. While couch surfing I lived in the homes of a range of people from different cultures, experiencing daily life from within their communities by sharing meals and making new friends. After I returned home, I began welcoming couch surfers into my home and have now hosted travellers from South America, Europe, and Australia. These experiences expanded my knowledge of international societies and allowed me to be a positive representative for the United States in line with Goals Two and Three. 


My experiences backpacking and time spent in the outdoors have prepared me for a range of physical, emotional, and intellectual challenges. Physically, I am an avid hiker and bicycle tourer and have endured a range of weather, terrain, and dietary conditions. I am prepared emotionally and intellectually from time spent alone in the wilderness; I once constructed a shelter and spent three months living by myself in the Santa Cruz mountains. These events taught me how to always be adaptable when faced with difficult situations even if they require unusual solutions.


My experience working with nonprofits, engaging with foreign cultures, and problem-solving abilities will all prove to be an invaluable resource for advancing the goals of the Peace Corps. While it is unlikely I will solve all of the world’s issues during my service period, I know I will leave both a positive impact on the community I work in as well as come away better-equipped to respond to the challenges presented by a global society.

3kbjez,1,2015-09-09,Just want to vent,hm9408,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3kbjez/just_want_to_vent/,"Hey guys, how are you doing? I hope fine.

Well, I'm just here to let it all out, because I feel awful. I just started feeling well, perhaps starting July, right until yesterday. I've had a shit day: I had two exams and I am pretty sure I've failed them both. Not because I didn't study, I did, but for reasons I don't feel I could have controlled. The reason why it makes me so upset and depressed, is that this is my last semester in college and my graduation hangs on these very two courses, which makes me feel like I've already failed at life and like I don't want to go on with it. I've always been a good student, but as soon as I started college I've been barely okay: flunked 4 courses, multiple exams, and had to go to several Summer courses to keep up with my curriculum. 

However, I've managed to be ""successful"" to the eyes of the others: I was an intern at Intel, my GPA is somehow above the College of Engineering's average, and I'm really good at learning foreign languages. 

I'm tired of the way people measure success: it's shallow and pointless. But most importantly, it's not how I measure success, which means most people will never even realize I'm deeply unhappy and unsatisfied with life. Additionally, (and this will sound like a dick thing to say), I have three friends and none of them cope with my constant depression. They never seem to care enough, and the advice they have given hasn't helped at all. My family, on the other hand, is rather dysfunctional. My parents always cared about academical success, and completely banned me from society when I was a teenager (I'm 21): my social interaction is almost inexistent and very awkward, I always try to win others' affection by being affectionate, but it never works, I was never encouraged to like girls, so I stuck to finding girls online (yes, I've never had a girlfriend, kissed a girl, had sex, you name it). My brother I love very much, but I haven't spent much time with him since my parents outcast him when he was young since he has dyslexia and I came to a different city for my college studies.

So, here I am, fourth year engineer who doesn't know what love is, doesn't have a goal in life, whose friends don't understand, and who is physically alone in a cold, small apartment.

What do I do when I feel like this? I further isolate myself from human contact, go into my room after class, cry while blaming me for my unhappiness, and fall asleep while listening to the OST of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (it is very dissonant, so it helps me get in the mood). Wake up and after three days I felt alright again.

These episodes used to happen every week, then I did my internship and it got er since I had to hide it, but they happened more often.

Last time it happened before tonight was in June this year, and I had been OK since.

How do you guys manage to cheer yourselves up when completely alone?"
3kcndc,1,2015-09-10,Spring internship hours,IASIP211,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3kcndc/spring_internship_hours/,"So as job postings are starting to come in for fall recruiting season, I'm noticing things I didn't quite expect. I haven't had an internship during a school semester, and this is my first real recruiting season for me, so excuse any ignorance I may have about how it works. 

So I assumed spring internships that are designed to target undergraduate students would be part time, and somehow work around a school schedule. However, some of them that I am seeing are full time, 8-5 or whatever, and request that the student take minimal or no coursework during the internship. Are they really expecting students to just take an entire semester off? I feel like delaying graduation would also delay when I would be eligible for the CPA and so on, which wouldn't be in the student or employer's best interest. Undergrad programs (at least mine) don't usually offer many upper level night classes for the accounting major, so I wouldn't be able to work and take a full course load. This just feels a bit off, are many spring internships set up this way? Asking in the US if that matters."

I have been kind of wanting to live on my own. I asked my dad about this and he thinks I should live with him for a while but I hope to own my place within the next few years or so. I currently go to college 2 times a week from 11 to 6pm. I don't have a job but I do plan to go to an internship for a computer store either this week or next. I do some job helping out my dad at his store but that is only on some days where he gets merchandise. Right now I am currently focusing on school and would like to move out and live on my own eventually. I am hoping that I can find a nice and cheap apartment so where in the city and I would like to know how do I go about doing that.

Almost three years ago I think I was raped or sexually assaulted. I'm not sure if it even counts. 

Extra background on friendship with potential attacker. We had been friends for about five years at that time. We were extremely close. I struggled with depression and self harm for a long time and he helped me through that. At fifteen I decided to end my life and called him to tell him goodbye because he had been so good to me since we met. He realized what was going on and immediately dropped everything to talk me down and just in general be a good friend. I loved him very much in a non romantic way and have been very grateful for everything that he had done for me through the years. On to the actual story.

I had just graduated high school so I was 17 at the time. I was at my friend's house who we will call Kay. Kay's mom was out of town so we had the house to ourselves. My best friend at the time who we will call Joe called me asking if I wanted to hang out. Kay, Joe, and I decided to hang out at her house and get drunk. (Joe's mom bought him alcohol whenever he wanted it) Kay never drank much so she had a couple of shots and decided to take a shower for whatever reason. I drank almost an entire botte of vodka and Joe drank all of his own bottle. We were both pretty drunk.

While Kay was in the shower Joe started putting his hand in my shorts. I pushed his hand away and he did it again. Maybe three times. Then he grabbed my hand and used it to rub himself through his pants. I let him do it because I felt bad for pushing him away. He was my best friend afterall. Kay got out of the shower and came back to the living room where we were so he let go of my hand. She could tell something was off and asked if I wanted to go to bed. I told her no. She insisted that I follow her and go to bed. I told her I was fine and to go without me. She agreed and went to bed. 

After she went to bed Joe started putting his hand down my shorts again and I told him to stop. He apologized and we had normal drunk conversation. Partway through the conversation I went to the bathroom and he grabbed my phone snd started reading my text messages. He read texts of a sexual nature with my boyfriend and teased me about it by reading them out loud when I came back. I asked him to stop looking at my messages and he gave my phone back but continued to tease me by asking if I liked this or that.

 He decided to drink some more and did that while I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up some time later to his hand in my shorts again. For some reason I was very disoriented when I woke up and thought it was my boyfriend? It took about a minute for me to realize it was Joe. I tried to push his hand away but this time he wouldn't let me. He sat next to me on the couch and grabbed my wrist and forced it down his pants. I wasn't sure what to do and physically let him do it while telling him I did not want to do it. I guess that confused him. He finally let go of my wrist and I pulled away but then he put one hand on my chest and held me against the couch with his other hand in my shorts. I was scared and drunk and thought he was my friend so I just closed my eyes and kept whispering no no no. Yes I know that was dumb of me, I should have done something. He pushed me onto my back, pulled my shorts and underwear to the side, and penetrated me. I started crying and trying to push him away but at that point he was using his body weight to keep most of my lower body from moving and kept both hands on my chest to hold my upper half still. I asked him to stop and he didn't and at that point something finally clicked and I started yelling at him to stop and get away from me. It woke Kay up and her bedroom door slammed open. I guess the door startled Joe because he only stopped when the door was loud and I ran outside to the porch crying.

 I heard her yelling at him inside. She came outside and I told her what happened. Joe came outside (he went from being piss drunk to seemingly completely sober?) and tried to tell me nothing happened and that it must have been a dream. I pointed out a couple of things that I would only know of it had happened and he tried to hug me and I pushed him away. He begged me to look at him and talk to him so I tried to because we had been so close for so long but I felt dirty and violated and looking at him made me sick so I told him to leave me alone. He got upset and went inside. He passed out of the couch and I went to bed in Kay's bedroom with her. 

We both woke up around the same time and I told him to leave. He asked me again to talk to him and I told him no. He left and we didn't speak for about a year. People kept finding out some how but nobody talked about the fact that I didn't want it. Joe's girlfriend even texted me the next day to tell me he didn't mean it and asking me to forgive him because he was very depressed about it. I told her no and she got upset with me. I explained exactly what happened and she said it wasn't a big deal because he had obviously been thinking of her the whole time? Multiple people accused me of cheating on my boyfriend and even had someone who used to be a mutual friend walk up to me and say ""Hey I heard you fucked Joe."" I had problems afterwards with depression again and started drinking and smoking to cope. I ended up failing out of college.

Joe and I started talking again some how about a year later. He claims he doesn't remember it happening at all but sometimes the way he says stuff makes me wonder if he does or not. Apparently he was the one telling people and even commented once that one of his friends congratulated him on finally having sex with me. He kinda laughed it off. We ended up getting high one night a couple months after we started talking again and he took me to his bedroom and put his hand in my pants. I felt like this time wouldn't be as bad if I didn't stop him because I felt in control of the situation. I let him do it until he was done but got upset and cried afterwards. He felt bad and took me home. He said he thought I wanted it. I apologized for sending mixed signals. He sometimes texts me really dirty stuff and makes comments about wanting to fuck me or whatever. It makes me uncomfortable but I never really know what to say so I blow it off. We are mostly friends again though. Not as close as before but we talk often and still hang out. 

I just needed to get it off my chest because I am having a bad day. I can't go back to college because I lost my financial aid for failing out before and can't afford to go without finacial aid. Sometimes I get kind of angry with Joe because he still got to go to college for free and is now fairly successful starting a career in politics. He was on the news for his political stuff recently and is doing an internship in DC next semester. I get angry because as much as it was my fault things happened I am still upset that I lost so much and he only gained from it. I lost friends, sleep, respect, college, my best friend, and peace of mind. He gained friends, gained respect for ""scoring"", is successful in school, and his girlfriend didn't even get mad at him. I guess I am just bitter but sometimes it really sucks.

Thanks for reading. Sorry for the wall of text."

3kf3d9,1,2015-09-10,Getting rid of (relatively small) debt and improving credit score.,debtoff,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3kf3d9/getting_rid_of_relatively_small_debt_and/,"Hi all,

For the past year and change I've ignored my credit card debt and finances in general. I really didn't want to get a credit card because I know I'm quite financially irresponsible, but I was told it was much harder to get one after college so I signed up for one my senior year in 2012/2013.

I had an on campus job but I still wasn't able to make my payments on time. I eventually graduated May 2013 and wasn't able to get a job. Started grad school September last year but still no source of income. In that time, Wells Fargo closed all my accounts (checking, savings, college card). Like I said earlier, I ignored all this, ignored their calls, everything- because that is my extremely immature coping mechanism.

I've lived for the past year without any bank account. I'm fortunate not to have any student loan debts as I'm supported by my parents/scholarship, and I have an international bank card I use for my expenses (i'm an international student). Because I'm here on an F1 visa, I can't work off campus except it's an internship or coop related to my major... and I've not been so fortunate.

Anyways, I finally got an on campus job and I'm hoping to get an internship this fall. I finally summoned the courage to look up my wells fargo account and turns out I owe them $884 and my credit score according to credit karma is 544 (transunion) and 533 (equifax). As expected.

I would love to get rid of this debt, start afresh and dramatically improve my credit score. Wells Fargo gave me an offer to pay half the debt and then they'd report it as settled; either as a lump sum or a through a 6 month installment plan. I agreed to the payment plan since it's more feasible with my on campus job, but I'm curious to know which option is better for my credit score. Also, what can I do from now on to improve my score? I need to open a bank account but I'm also worried my credit history would be a hindrance.

Sorry for the long read and I look forward to the replies.

EDIT: I've spent the past half hour reading about debt settlement and it seems like the general consensus is that it's bad and hurts credit score even more. But considering my credit card account is already closed (and I already agreed to the settlement option) how else can I get rid of this debt? I'm curious about the 'pay for delete' option but I'm not sure if my debt is even with a collection agency, considering I got the offer directly from Wells Fargo. Please help!"

My studies have focused primarily on object oriented programming (JAVA, C++, a little javascript). I was approached by the CMO of a company (lets call him Ralph) who is a family acquaintance, to help with their database as an intern. I have very little experience working with databases, and I made this clear to Ralph. Initially he said he wanted someone with a ""programmers mind"" to help clean up their database. Ralph has little programming experience, but is a more of a database/business mind. 

Here is the setup of their company's data. 3 Sources of data:
1) Redshift, the data warehouse (Ralph wants this to hold ALL Data)
2) Netsuite, the CRM (Ralph wants this to hold only ""high value"" data)
3) Pardot, a salesforce marketing automation software (this holds the data for email campaigns, and how customers responded to them)

Currently, Netsuite is the ""version of truth"", but many of the records are dirty, duplicates, or both. Ralph's idea for phase 1 was to move this data into a SQL environment (Redshift), where it will be far easier to clean, then migrate it back to Netsuite, all while implementing for the future this back and forth connection between Redshift and Netsuite. If something changes in one, it reflects in the other. On top of this, he wants Pardot(which is used for email campaigns, and stores information about responses to emails) to also be synced with Redshift.

Now, with my limited knowledge of any of this, I've spent the last month researching every bit of info I could to make this work. Here is what I have come up with, and I would love for some feedback on my thought process:

1) Redshift should only be used as a data warehosue, nothing else. There should be no two way conneciton, only a one way path INTO Redshift. I don't think this is even possible anyways without paying an arm and a leg(Snaplogic is one service I found online that might be able to do this, but costs tons of $$$)

2) Netsuite must be the ""version of truth"". If we make a two way connection, it will further compromise our data's integrity.

3)Pardot isn't even able to connect to Redshift, so thats out of the question

Where Ralph and I have been butting heads is that he wants there to be a two way connection between Netsuite and Redshift, while I think that not only is this completely unnecessary, it might not even be possible. What do you guys think?"

Met my wife a little over a year ago and fell in love while in my 5th year of college (damn engineering degrees).  We're arranging to get married next summer, and want to be able to put away a little bit for  a down payment on a house in the next 3 years when I graduate.  

My financial situation is as follows.  Currently about $40k in the hole with student loans, but finally began receiving Pell Grants and was awarded a $6000 yearly scholarship through my school's engineering program.  This scholarship will also assist in networking to find a good job (hopefully) after college and I have already begun looking for internships for the summer heading into the summer of 2017, as I will be graduating fall of 2017.  

I work a full time job during the summer and winter breaks and average roughly between $450-$700 every week depending on performance incentive and overtime.  During the semester it has been right around $260 every week.  Our monthly expenses including rent are $115 for cable and internet, $150 for gas with both cars, $200 in credit card payments with a $1500 balance remaining, $300-$400 in groceries, $100 in renters and car insurance payments, and a $300 car payment with a balance of $11000 remaining.  I will be disbursed my $3000 scholarship for this semester in the next several days, and this leads me to my question:

Is it better to put all of my scholarship towards the next 3 months rent to make sure we have that security of not worrying about making rent while I am in school, and then pay for our bills with my weekly paychecks, or should I put the $3000 in savings as a safety net in the event of a major emergency?  We just sold our 3rd car and will be receiving $1000 cash tomorrow as an added booster.  

I would greatly appreciate your help with this situation as I am 25 and trying to transition from a broke college kid who blew his money at the bars every week, into being the sole provider for our family while still in school and mama stays at home with our beautiful new baby.  Thank you in advance for all of your advice!"

What do I do?,sodakdave,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/3kh1mn/eight_days_into_the_school_year_what_do_i_do/,"This is my first post here, so I apologize if I break any rules. This is kind of a complex circumstance so I apologize if I wander.

My son is 9 and just entered 4th grade. He loves school, and is very scientific. His teacher this year is new, and is teaching as an internship for her masters degree.

School has been in session for 8 days now, and 4 of those days he's gotten in trouble for mostly minor things. One one I truly agree with. 

* Friday he was talking with his friend, and kept talking when asked to stop. Non issue. No argument there. He was sent to the hallway.

* Tuesday he ""made a disrespectful noise"" when the teacher ""lost her train of thought"". He was sent to the hallway. He repeated the noise when he got home, and it was basically him taking a deep inhale and exhale through his nose. Nothing I'd consider disrespectful, but then I know my kid. He was sent to the hallway. No warning.

* Wednesday, the class was waiting for the teacher to get the supplies down and set up for the next lesson. He was bored, and started (as he says) lightly drumming on his math book. Again sent to the hallway for being disrespectful, and when the teacher talked to him and he said it was because he got bored, she told him ""Only boring people get bored. Everyone else finds something else to do."" He broke down in tears telling us this because he hates the thought that he's boring. No warning.

* Today, Thursday he was held back from recess. They were getting ready to start a project, and it was not a quiet time project. All the kids were talking while they prepared. He pulled a piece of notebook paper out that had been misprinted and said ""What the..."" Only those two words. He does that a lot. He never curses. He didn't get in trouble for cursing. He got in trouble because the teacher ""doesn't like that phrase"". No warning.

I don't want to take what my kid says as the totality of the story, but I've tried getting in contact with this teacher since Tuesday. I've sent emails and left voice mails for her with no response. What am I supposed to do when she won't give me the time of day to respond? All I have to go on is what my kid says.

So I started digging. I did a bit of research, and I come across an article that she wrote as a columnist for her college newspaper with the following quote.

Her dad attended this school and would hunt and kill the *small animals* prior to games. 

&gt;...my dad and his friends would take the *small animals* out of their full-length *school mascot* coats and throw the *small animals* out onto the floor. No one noticed them and they inconspicuously settled into the crowd. That's school spirit.

&gt;This act was outlawed a few years after he graduated. And I feel like it needs to be reinstated, only with people.

&gt;All of the people walking around campus with *other school* gear need to be kidnapped, smuggled into the dome and then hurled onto the floor at halftime. Then all of their *other school* backpacks, binders, pencils and *other school* lanyards need to be thrown in after them.

I may be overreacting, but I find it quite concerning that someone who publishes an article suggesting kidnapping and violence (one could even assume killing) other students is a practical way to deal with wearing the wrong ""colors"" on campus. At the very least it's an extremely poor decision, and a sign of mental issues.

My son and his friend are the only two kids (according to them) in the entire class that have been sent to the hallway or held from recess. Everyone else is warned multiple times and never truly punished. Again I can't confirm this because the teacher refuses to respond, and the principal asks to try to resolve the issue with the teacher.

Am I over reacting? should I be concerned? How do I deal with this? "

3khkd4,1,2015-09-10,Dem Feels Post,siphayne,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3khkd4/dem_feels_post/,"This is the first long post I've ever written so please bear with me with formatting and such.

I'm a 27 year old college student and I played Destiny beta on my friend's PS4. After about 10 minutes I was hooked and knew I was going to buy a next gen console for this game. I bought Vanilla Destiny and a PS4 (still kicking myself over not getting the vanilla bundle). I enjoyed the shit out of this game solo PvE. I never got the hang of solo Heroics and Nightfalls but I had a grand ole time with the story and patrols. I tried the raid once before TDB but my team didn't make it. TDB was released and I finished the story, but I had lost motivation to play since the only way to level at that point was raids. So I hung my hat up and focused on school. I ended up getting a internship in Idaho for the summer so right around finals I picked my hat up again and decided to give HoW a shot. I enjoyed the shit out of PoE 28 and really wanted to try the higher levels. The motivation was great! I could get max level without grinding raids! And just like that I was back in it.

The week after finals I was out dragon striking it up and per usual someone dropped right at the beginning of The Dust Palace (I swear that had a huge weight on it at the time). Me and my matchmade teammate continued kicking ass anyway. With ~1 flayer left someone popped in and helped us finish up. I got a message from the guy who I two-manned it with to join his clan. We'll call him DK. Apparently the guy who hopped in at the end was from the clan. We'll call him Yoshi. So the clan originated from the100.io. I got all hooked up there too. It was grand! I could post a game and have chill teammates who would kick ass with me! Finally I could do Nightfalls! Finally I could do PoE32-35! This was an exciting time. It was also time for me to go off to my internship where I knew zero people. So naturally Destiny took over. 

Before I knew it I was on sherpa runs making it through Raids. Then our group sherpa disappeared into the Darkness. We had no sherpa. I figured I had done VoG a few times. I'd sign up to sherpa VoG and help people get through that one. With the high level cap Normal and Hard were easy enough. So I do and I end up running about 4-7 raids per week. Eventually I want to break into running Crota as sherpa. There's a swordbearer in the group so I ask him to teach me the ways of the Jedi. It was really rocky at first but I eventually got the hang of it. At this point I had run VoG so much that I had all the gear (except those damn hunter gloves which I just got last week). So I start running the same amount of raids per week but mixing it up a bit.

I also realized how many friendships I had made. DK and Yoshi are still around. DK has been running PoE 35 like crazy to get people their MoT. I hopped into Yoshi's game one day and we were shooting the shit running the daily story. Kicking ass per usual. He messaged me the following day asking for my address. I thought that was odd so I asked why. Apparently Yoshi knows someone who works for Bungie (We will call him Mario). Mario wanted to send me a signed poster. I was shocked and stoked (or is it stroked?). So naturally I give my deets because who can turn down a kickass poster signed by some of the Bungie staff? I'm still not fully sure to the motivations of Mario but apparently I had made some impact in my clan. After some reflection about the  previous three months I realized how the Destiny community had impacted me. This summer would have been very difficult. I panic in the face of social [interaction](http://i.imgur.com/kbfi1YM.png). Bonding over a game like this is much easier for me. I value the friendships I've made. 

So here's to everyone in the community. Who've helped my clan become better. Who've helped me become better and happier. Also to my significant other who is insanely understanding of my addiction. 

(In no particular order) Thank you to DK for getting me into Echo Company 661. Thanks Yoshi for talking me up to his friends. Thanks Pab for all the raids and Nightfalls. Thanks to my friends across the pond, Andy and Stu. Thanks to the Hammer Brothers. Thanks to Tek. Thanks to Thirteen. Thanks to Giant. Thanks to stray. Thanks to Boogie. Thanks to GuysAAAAAAAHHHH. Thanks to my now Sherpa-in-Arms Agent. Thanks to my quiet friend Bub. Thanks to Dale. Thanks to Forrest. Thanks to Trail. Thanks to Mind. Thanks to Leaf. Thanks to Bee. Thanks to Gooch. Thanks to Ninj0. Thanks to cat. Thanks to bigs. Thanks to /u/solofatty09 (who isn't in EC661 but ran a public Crota run with me and was generally awesome). Thanks to Hellvetica. Thanks to Sh0gu. You've all helped me get through the summer. There's no one I'd rather be friends with going into tTK. Thanks to all of reddit for giving me arcane knowledge of Destiny that has made me a better Sherpa and player. 

Bring it on Year 2.

3khqoh,1,2015-09-10,Need help on punctuality,cyoonit123,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3khqoh/need_help_on_punctuality/,"Hello everyone, i'm a lurker here but i think it's finally time to reach out for help. I have long battled depression and suicide and have made leaps over the past few years. I have overcome feelings of worthlessness (comes back periodically but it's not a concern anymore), finally decided that my life needs a purpose (currently pursuing my goals), and am actively trying to beat depression. 

Some problems i've run into:
1) having some tough times in life: lost an internship position, gf broke up with me, losing motivation in school
2) I also have anxiety which, as strange as it sounds, prevents me from going to things on time. It's so hard to explain but everytime I get ready to leave for something, i have waves of anxiety and it takes so much effort to be on time. This causes me to be late to everything and has really hurt me in life.
3) I have a constant dreadful feeling that depression will never go away. It caused the drift between my girlfriend and I and it just seems like it'll be something that will haunt me forever and causing pain in others and myself. I don't know how to get over this or deal with it. 
4) I still have so much fatigue that i'm moving in slow motion and can never really function. The only time where I haven't felt fatigue was the past weekend where I was at a videogame tournament and I was so focused and anxious that I constantly had blood flowing (lol). 

Obviously I can't ask help for the 1st problem but any help on the 2nd-4th problem would be greatly appreciated!

Prescriptions:
Clonazepam - 5mg
Paxil - 10-20mg
Adderall - 5mg

Supplements:

- I'm very sensitive to supplements and have tried a few but not too many. Open to suggestions. 

I appreciate all that you guys have done! Let's hope for/have a better day tomorrow!"
3kiauc,4,2015-09-11,Long Distance Relationship advice?,hannahprettyinpunk,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/3kiauc/long_distance_relationship_advice/,"It's been a year since I've even posted on Reddit, because I haven't had wifi but I moved into an apartment in a college town! Yay for new chapters in life! Anyways.

I don't feel like giving my entire life story, but I just need advice, I think, idk. My girlfriend and I have been together for five months. Love her to death, since we've been together I've realized she's the only person I've ever been in love with. We started dating in April. I was enrolled to go to this school that's in my hometown and she was already going to that school, so we were supposed to start the school year at the same school. Well, in the beginning of May (seriously we had been together for like two weeks), we got drunk and I had a mental breakdown at 3am because I hate that school, I never wanted to go there, they didn't even have a major that I wanted, and I was only going because I inherited a house that has been in my family for a while and I could have lived there for free while I went to school (it was already paid off). She talks to me and I calm down, and I told her I was going to apply at the school that was originally my first choice school and go there. I don't think she really thought I would do it but I did. Long story short, here I am! 

I only live two hours away now so it's not like we're extremely long distance. Honestly, this is my third weekend living here coming up and this is the third weekend in a row that I'm going home (the first two were to work at my old job until I found a new one, this one is for a wedding). So I haven't even gone more than three full days without seeing her because I stay Friday-Monday. But she's just not handling it nearly as well as I am...like I said, I love her and I miss her, but I also love my new life and I'm very happy that I decided to come to this school. I've had like 10 quizzes and two tests so far and I still have a 4.0/100% in all six of my classes. I was NEVER a good student in high school. But I love this university so much and I love what I'm learning, so I want to do good! I'm also super excited about my career! I made the decision to follow a track to become a 4H extension agent, basically someone who runs a 4H program. I wouldn't say its super professional like on the level of doctors, but it works a lot with kids and the community and such. I've volunteered with the program I grew up with for the past four years and I know that it's a career where you have to have connections to find a job. And a good education. Most jobs won't even take you until you have your Master's so I'm probably going to get it as soon as I graduate. 

So here I am, super duper excited to be doing what I love. I got accepted to be a student ambassador, I'm in an honors society, a professional biology club, and LGBT. On top of that, there is a paid internship that I'm applying for that I think I have a pretty good chance of getting because it's a direct 4H internship doing things that I've already been doing in the past four years. TL;DR I'm adjusting really great to college life.


My girlfriend on the other hand, i don't think she could be taking it any worse. Now it doesn't help that she just started nursing school and she's a contracted ROTC cadet in a leadership position, so she has more on her plate than I could possibly imagine. I feel bad for her, I really do. I try to be a good girlfriend and one of my weekend visits was a total surprise for her. I told her I was in the library studying when I was actually pulling into her driveway. But it's just like...I don't know how to explain. Like when I told her I was applying for the internship, her first response was ""great another three months without you."" But I would have weekends off and it's paid and it's a great career builder! Then I also told her today I might join marching band because there is a scholarship involved, and I came here knowing 5 people at this school and they're all in MB so I think it'd be fun. And her response to that is that I'll never have time to talk to her and I'll be too busy for her. I understand where she's coming from, I really do, but it's like she doesn't want to enjoy these years of our lives. I love her so much but I want to live at the same time. I want to do fun things in college so I don't get burnt out and hate it like she does. I guess she really just needs space but I was wondering if anyone else had ever dealt with this before."

DEBT

Don't do it, i know you want to take out loans but dont. Ask yourself this, are you smart? If so go take the military asvab, it's free and you don't have to sign your life away, just do it. Then if you score above a 90 (like myself) you could get a job working for the national guard or reserve, 2 days a week 2 weeks a year, doing something like data analysis, or IT, or blowing shit up, or naval intelligence (data analysis but on a boat).

I did this straight out of highschool, it took one year out of my life but i gained a whole hell of a lot.

1: put me in amazing shape, i was and still am a fucking machine thanks to this.

2: i have security clearance, aka i can get a job for the fbi, CIA, nsa, homeland security.

3: i get to put that i work data analysis for uncle sam on my resume.

4: i get around 800 USD a month for living stipend while i attend college, books are paid for, classes are paid for. Plus i get paid around 250 a month for drill.

5: Free healthcare, so much this.

6: did i mention it turned me into a fucking man.

""But i'm a leftist vegan treehugging fucktard who hates imperialist america!?!""

Okay barbie well I have free college, free healthcare, a grand a month, i can dismantle an AR, am now a great shot and have the stamina of a fucking ox so i beast fuck every girl i meet.


NEPOTISM WILL GO A LONG WAY ADVICE TO PEOPLE WANTING TO GET INTO BUSINESS AFTER COLLEGE.

Join a fucking social fraternity if your school has a large greek life

1: connections to super rich people; check.

2: girls fucking check

3: guys who are mostly already redpill double check

4: not having to deal with liberal arts major; so much check

5: the connections go beyond your fraternity chapter, EXAMPLE we went to vegas to pregram spring break havisu. Got in line at club and the VIP host was in the same national fraternity as us; free table three free bottles of vodka.  My current internship was hooked up by a guy in another fraternity, a guy i helped get elected.

6: student government; we rig elections and occasionally launder money. Yeah okay the laundering part isn't the best idea but when you want a dj or rapper to play at your party you'd rather not use dues.

7: test banks

8: easy access to jobs post college

9: parties

10: you pay to not have to deal with blue pill guys, it's great.

""But those frat guys are douchebags, why do i need to pay for friends, i can make my own connections, nepotism is bad, youre everything thats wrong with america...""

1: Yes we are, at least we seem so to blue pill cucks after we pass around their ex girlfriends.

2: you pay to keep people out and for the dare i say, privilege.

3: connections in a frat are to either middle class bros or rich guys, also the more traditional the fraternity the better the brotherhood.

4: cry me a river

5: boohoo


FIRST YEAR LIVING

LIVE IN THE FUCKING DORMS, THE NICE ONES even if you brings you back. richer kids tend to live there, avoid the stoners. socialize like a mother fucker, try hooking up yes but focus on the network.

2nd year

if you went fraternity move into the house, holy shit it's a fucking disaster living in a frat house but it's also an adventure. It happens to be an easy way to get laid and contract a disease so watch out for that.

3rd year frat house or house close to campus

4th/5th/6th house close to campus.

On top of that go to almost every event, get your homework done the second you wake up, do it in between class. That way on the weekend it's time to rage and enjoy the dayfade.


OH and one last thing, workout everyday, eat clean as fuck. You need to counter balance the liquor with a amazingly healthy diet and heavy workout regiment. Don't do the juice until youre done with school or 25. Try not to get to heavy into cocaine, and only do molly as huge edm festivals. 


Oh as for studying

vyvanse &gt; adderall 

take that shit earlier though.

Oh and for hangovers.

I forget the name but it's the stuff babies drunk to be hydrated, that, and coconut water."

3kkr1j,1,2015-09-11,My fiancé is having a job identity issue. It's effect her so much she cried to sleep last night thinking about her job.,inyofaceee,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3kkr1j/my_fiancé_is_having_a_job_identity_issue_its/,"Hello s/TwoXChromosomes

I am here at the mercy of this sub with no other option or idea of what to do. 





My fiancé who is beautiful smart extremely talented has finally lost her cool with her job. She spends her days angry frustrated in anxiety, sneaking off to the bathroom to cry and send me texts about how miserable she is and comes home after work upset distraught complains about how much she hates her coworkers and boss and that how badly she wants to quit her job yet she feels obligated to stay at the company even when it causes her so much emotional anguish, I mean she goes to sleep crying. Not a simple complaint about her job and it goes away hour later. She cries to sleep. 




I feel incredibly bad, especially because I know I can't force her to quit her job, i wouldn't want to pressure her into any decision. I try to tell her she's young and that she has a great opportunity to do anything her heart desires and that obviously i have her back. She hears me, but it doesn't sink in. The idea of losing that security bothers her and she tells me she doesn't feel confident taking ""risks"".



She fears that she won't find another job, she fears that she will be unemployed and her biggest concern is that she won't be able to cover her means and she's very independent. I tell don't worry I can cover us, but she's adamant on working and having an income of her own. 



Her job situation let's face it isn't that different from many other people who aren't happy with their jobs. She works at an engineering company where she does all the sale administrative work for the sales department (organize proposals, send proposals, make sure the invoices are correct, make sure the invoices are paid, tasks like that).



She has a bachelor degree in business but has zero passion for engineering, she just landed the job straight out of college and has been there for almost 6 years. 



She's excellent at scheduling, keeping tasks in order and detailed at keeping a minute to minute calendar. She is always organized (She calls it her ""OCD"") and is always on time. Fast typer, smart young girl straight up. She is exactly what anyone who has a busy schedule or any company who needs to stay on agenda would want yet this is not a something that is utilized at her job. 



She's very passionate about creating material. She loves to write. She blogs, she's very articulate and she can write very well. Due to her natural organization skills she's great and planning and coming up with creative ideas. She has a high attention for details and sees everything through until it's done.
In **her** mind the problem is that she's 31 and says ""I don't want to start from scratch"". She feels she is to ""old"" to intern and try to grow in a new field of work. 
I do my best and try to reinforce what I've always told her which is follow what makes you happy you shouldn't have a job that emotionally brakes you every time you come home from work. Do what makes your heart happy. 




I don't know what else to say and I know she's tired of me telling her it will be okay and she has to be strong and get through it.





Any advice for me to help my fiancé? I just want her to be happy and instead she just spirals and pulls everything else that's going on around her into one big snowball.



How can I get her to realize that it's not the end of the world and all she has to do is find something that doesn't upset her to do on a day-to-day basis. 



Any advice on what I could tell her so she's not worried and feels encouraged? 


TL;DR




My fiancé 31 years old has a business bachelor degree from (Southern California), hates her job comes and crying every day wants to quit her job but she's too scared and worried about what she'll do next. Please help figure out what I can tell her or what I can refer her to maybe a book or a video to help her realize what she has to do with more confidence please. 

Thank you in advance."
3kks5x,12,2015-09-11,"""Are you ready to stop with the diet food?""",immortal_nevermore,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3kks5x/are_you_ready_to_stop_with_the_diet_food/,"Warning: rant ahead, but I need to get it off my chest and I don't know who else understands what I'm going through quite like you guys.

I'm in college and I'm trying to complete a 40 hour a week internship while also taking a full 12 hours of night classes. Cooking to lose weight is difficult with this kind of schedule and expensive for my college budget. My mom, who lives close by, has been kind enough to cook food for me that I can pick up on the weekends. She helps me track the calories and has been pretty wonderful, and I'm extremely grateful for this. I think I say thank you a thousand times when I see her.

My mom has also always been skinny. I don't think she has ever struggled with weight gain. However, once upon a time, we joined Weight Watchers together. She wanted to lose 5 lbs, I needed to lose 50 to be considered a normal weight. She did it in a couple months. Three months in and I was down 30 pounds! But then things started to slow down as I hit a plateau. She was cooking for me then as well and became frustrated with how slowly I was taking things, as though I was sneaking food on the side. ""I don't understand,"" I remember her saying. ""Why don't you just lose it all at once?"" I tried to explain that this isn't how weight loss works and losing 5 lbs is very different from attempting to lose 40 or more. She wouldn't listen.

I upped my game in Weight Watchers and was told by a friend after analyzing my diet that I needed to stop immediately - I was consuming 800 calories a day on average. After quitting, I couldn't maintain and gained it all back. I'm starting at square one now. Two months in and I'm down 20 lbs, and I'm so proud of myself for the restraint I've had and the motivation I've shown! But now things are starting to slow down again. I admittedly had a rough weekend where I overate for my boyfriend's birthday dinner, and getting back on the horse was difficult after for some reason. I think I had been losing weight so easily I thought I could do whatever I wanted for a bit, and now I'm trying to get back into the swing of things. However, for the past three weekends, the same conversation has happened between my mom and I. 

Mom: ""How are you?"" 

immortal_nevermore: ""Good!"" 

Mom: ""How's  the weight loss?"" 

immortal_nevermore: ""Good! I'm down another half a pound""

Mom: ""Oh...ok. Well, just let me know if you're ready to stop with the diet food""

It's a phrase that has really gotten to me. I get it - she's working hard to make all this food and it's frustrating her  that I'm not losing more. It's frustrating me, too, that I'm not losing more, but hearing that stupid phrase makes me feel like I've failed already and it's not worth pushing forward. I've tried telling her to stop, and explaining how it makes me feel, but the message just isn't getting through to her.

So I'm looking for some advice. I need to find a way to break through to her, and I need to get back on the horse. I'm facing some difficult months ahead with Halloween, Thanksgiving, and my birthday fast approaching while trying to juggle school, work, and life in general. 

Guys, I'm not sure how I'm going to get through this."

I ask this because I have been looking for internships here in LA and in other areas like Seattle however, most of what I can find seem to be quite a ways from downtown or even the main city in general. Right now i'm a microbio major and some research places seem to be rather far from the cities whilst other stuff that I was able to find in Washington are way farther from the city than I would like. Any feedback would be appreciated thanks!"
3klkqa,9,2015-09-11,Internship question,_Pandasaurus_,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/3klkqa/internship_question/,"Right now I'm only at a community college but it is required for me to do an internship at a social service agency. I really don't know what is normal, what to look out for or how to go about doing things. I have to get started with this by the end of next week so I'm pretty worried.

Agency #1: They posted an ad on a volunteering website. I replied. The volunteer coordinator has be in touch with me, e-mailing and calling for the past few days. She is relaying messages from the person I would actually be working for...the person who posted the ad. The ad said I would be interning, helping women in recovery who were recently released from prison. However, when she asked about my employment history, she got excited about it being primarily data entry. Saying, ""Well, we have to get something out of this too."" During the last phone call she asked me to ask my instructor the bare minimum amount of tasks I must do in order for the internship to count. 

My excitement quickly turned to worry.

I have received e-mails from two other agencies saying they would be able to accommodate my hectic schedule and to call for an interview. Those places were less desirable to me since they are in very unsafe neighborhoods and I have to take public transportation/walk.

Does the first place seem kind of shady? What would you recommend I do in this situation? What the heck do interns usually do?"
3klw9z,9,2015-09-11,My [27F] heart tells me I've found my soulmate[27M] but my head is being logical and says it's just attraction - which do I follow?,zolarose,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3klw9z/my_27f_heart_tells_me_ive_found_my_soulmate27m/,"Hello redditors, first post here. Have been reading for a while and am always quite impressed with the advice given! This is a long one so please bear with me - there is quite a bit of back story.

The Background:

I met this man 2 years ago; it was a classic ""eyes met across a darkened room"" moment, only it was in the Student Union Cafe and he was sat with a friend of mine. We immediately hit it off, and after a couple of coffees and long, deep chats, we started a very intense, very close, quite emotional (in a good way) relationship. In addition the sexual attraction off the scale (sorry if that is TMI). We discussed the attraction between us and discovered that even on the day we met after we got chatting, we had both had the same thought - ""we are going to set the world alight in the bedroom"". And we did, it was unlike anything either of us had experienced before.

Neither of us was in a very good ""headspace"" to use a colloquialism; he'd just come out of a long-term relationship and was badly bruised by it, I was going through a massive crisis of confidence after messing up an important exam (I passed the resit with flying colours, thankfully). I think we needed one another at that moment. We sort of ended it when he went to an internship in another city. All in all it lasted about 5 weeks, and though I tried to keep in touch, his responses got more and more infrequent until they stopped altogether. I was hurt by his lack of communication but put it down to circumstance and tried to forget how much we appeared to ""match"".

Issue is, I was never been able to shake off the feeling that we had unfinished business. I kept thinking about him. He'd pop into my head at random moments. I'd find myself thinking about him if I saw the coffee shop we hung out in or someone who looked a bit like him. I dated other guys but something was always lacking.

The Current Situation:

I was on holiday in London over the summer and was hunting through a quirky little bookstore in Covent Garden when there was a tap on my shoulder. It was THE GUY -  and his girlfriend. We were both astonished and quite lost for words at the start. We hadn't seen each other in 2 years and yet we managed to find ourselves in the same place at the same time almost 2 years to the date that our relationship ended. After the ""oh my goodness, isn't this weird"" vibe disappeared, we had a chat (including his girlfriend, who seems lovely). Whatever it was between us - attraction, lust, destiny?! - was still there, at least on my side. I had a train to catch and so made my goodbyes about 5 minutes later and ran for my life, heart racing like I'd run a marathon, head telling me to grow up and get over myself.

I thought then - I'll message him on Facebook and say ""it was nice to see you, very random, keep in touch"" etc. I found him via the search (I removed him from my friendship group ages ago to stop myself from being reminded about him) and opened up a new message to him. I was stunned to find out he messaged me 6 months ago saying ""that he regretted the way he abandoned me, that he'd debated messaging me for months to apologise, that he'd finally had the guts to do it and that he hoped I was well"".

Well, I was getting seriously weirded out by this point. I'm not a big believer in fate, destiny, Venus being in alignment with Mars, or whatever you call a string of coincidences like this, but I was starting to wonder what the heck was going on. 

I replied in any case saying ""no grudges held, hope you're well, nice to see you"". He replied. Turns out we now live in the same city - about a 5 minute drive away from one another. 

Cut to 3 weeks later and we decided to go for a proper catch up. I was always very conscious of his having a girlfriend and he did message her on and off throughout the evening, so nothing inappropriate happened. The undercurrent of attraction was still there but I thought as the evening went on that ""it must just be me feeling this way"" and my head ruled the day.

As we parted ways, however, he gave me the biggest, fiercest, most emotion-laden hug I have ever had. It went on far longer than it should have done between a man with a girlfriend and a single woman. My heart galloped off into the sunset with him and my head banged itself on the proverbial brick wall. We parted company and agreed to meet again to have a further catch up.

My dilemma:

There is something about him and all the strange coincidences which makes me think he may be my soulmate. I just can't shake off this feeling that there is some kind of ""connection"" between us which keeps pulling us back together. 

I'm about to move to another city 4 hours away to take up a new job, and he seemed genuinely disappointed when I told him. He also genuinely seems to like his girlfriend (always helpful!) and I confess I liked her when we met briefly in London. I have no wish to ""break them up"" by confessing my undying love for him prior to disappearing 300 miles away.

Long story cut short:

1. Do I wait and let whatever this is run its course (fate, destiny, Venus aligning with Mars etc.)?

2. Do I tell him how I feel, maybe lose him if he doesn't feel the same way or find out he feels the same way and then my heart and head are happy because I've found ""the one""?

3. Is he even ""the one""?! Heart says ""YES"", head says ""this is lust, pure and simple. Grow up.""

   
**tl;dr**: A strange long list of coincidences led me back to a now-taken ex/are there such things as soulmates?!"

I applied for it two months ago and have heard some stuff from the recruiter but have mostly remained in the dark.

Anyways, in short, I'm nervous since this seems like the ideal internship for me (especially regarding the potential experience and location of a branch location of t-mobile) and I'm not sure how to approach making myself stand out since all I get from the recruiter is that ""the hiring team is working on it, we'll let you know when a decision is made""."

I've decided to do a Tax internship this coming Winter (it'll last from around January 2016-Aprilish, depending on the firm). Just from talking to Professors and recruiters, I get the feeling that there's a high chance that I'll have multiple offers by the time I'm done recruiting due to lack of interns in the Winter.  

I seriously have no fucking clue what the difference between any of the big 4 is though. I've schmoozed with at least 3/4 people from each firm, and besides vague descriptions of ""company culture"", they all kind of seem the same. So I've divided the decision making process into a few separate categories, and it would be great if you guys could help me with this. The companies I'm most interested in are all of the big 4 and Grant Thornton.

**Pay**  
Which one pays the best, and what kind of pay might I be looking at? A big part of the Winter internship decision is I'll be getting paid a lot more than my Summer counterparts, so I'd like to maximize that.  

**Actual Experience**  
Another perk of Winter interning, especially in Tax.  

**Perks**  
I know KPMG has a national training for a week in Orlando, and PwC kind of does something similar at the end of the internship. So which company has the best stuff like that?   

**Reputation**  
I came across a thread here where someone commented that PwC and Grant were ""joke firms"", and that kind of got me worried. Random internet commenters shouldn't have that big of an effect on my life, but I was wondering if any of these firms had a bad reputation that I wouldn't know about since I've pretty much only talked to campus recruiters.  

**Anything Else**  
Anything else you could think of that might be relevant to my decision making process.  

Thanks for your help guys, I really appreciate it.

3kmvp7,1,2015-09-12,Question about moving from a P/P/L back to SL or SS or Greyskull.,Noxiide,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3kmvp7/question_about_moving_from_a_ppl_back_to_sl_or_ss/,"Alright, so kind of long but here we go.

Started lifting last November, made shit progress at first because I let my ego get ahead of me and started too close to my max. Stalled out on squats at 115lbs for SL 5x5, and I was about 5'11 160lbs. Decided to restart SL, no ego this time. Road the gains train to about a 225lbs squat in a few months, along with I think around a 275lbs deadlift.

After this, I was tired with squatting every day, and my upper body was lagging behind. I was squatting 205lbs x 5 and benching 95 lbs x 3, and OHP was like 65lbs x 5 or something. So I was pretty pissed, so I moved to PHUL. Did PHUL for awhile, Squat kind of stayed the same, bench went up to 105lbs x 5 pretty quick, OHP went up a bit too. Then I moved onto a P/P/L, I dunno, cause I wanted to believe I was an intermediate. Did that till like July 15th this year. Squat stayed the same, if not went down, because I got an internship and wasn't working out that much. Got my bench up to 135lbs x 2, OHP to 80 x 5. 

Membership ran out on July 15th, went back up to college August 1st. They wouldn't give me a half month membership, and the college gym didn't open till August 24th. So I didn't workout till like September first, so I almost took two months off. Wasn't eating right, so squat went from like 195lbs x5 to 175lbs x 5. OHP went to 75 x 4. Bench went from 135lbs x 2 to 115lbs x  2. Barbell rows dropped like 20 pounds too, along with cable rows and lat pull down. Only thing that stayed close to the same was curls, lateral raises (can't do more than 10lbs due to AC joint), and tricep push down.

Now after all this has happened, I realize that the reason I'm not getting a whole lot bigger, is because doing 8 reps of 95lbs on the bench won't get me jacked. Doing 75lbs OHP won't get my shoulders big, etc. I mean, it's obvious, but I think I had to go through all this to really realize that even though I've come a decent ways, I'm not that strong or anything, and I need to get stronger to get bigger.

_________________________

So, the question is, do you guys think I should go back to like SL or Phrak's Greyskull LP variant? Or maybe back to PHUL? I mean, I think that I'm still beginner enough where a P/P/L isn't the most efficient, that I should be doing full body exercises multiple times per week.

Also, I want to get my bench and OHP up. Is it possible for me to OHP and bench every workout, like every other day? Or at least bench? Or would this actually result in less gains for my bench and OHP? I feel like OHP and bench 3 times every two weeks isn't enough, but hey, what do I know."

# /r/Hearthstone

**289,682** players building decks for **2** years!

In July of 2014, I was in an accident that resulted in a hospital stay of approximately five months, and the only thing that left the hospital with me, other than the metal in my femur, was my opiate and hearthstone addiction.  Unfortunately I was only able to kick one of those.  Hearthstone was one of things that kept me sane during those seemingly endless days stuck in a hospital bed, and that's why I've decided to feature the subreddit dedicated to it today.

From Blizzard's webpage:
&gt;Hearthstone is a free-to-play digital strategy card game that anyone can enjoy. Players choose one of nine epic Warcraft heroes to play as, and then take turns playing cards from their customizable decks to cast potent spells, use heroic weapons or abilities, or summon powerful characters to crush their opponent.

Hearthstone is a collectible card game much like Magic the Gathering, Yugioh, or Pokemon, and it has an ever growing player base.  The main advantage it has over the above mentioned games is that there is very little barrier to entry.  Anyone with a smart phone, tablet, or computer can download and start playing and monetary investment is completely optional.  What got me initially interested in Hearthstone, having not been too keen on collectible card games in the past, was actually watching [Totalbiscuit's](https://www.youtube.com/user/TotalHalibut/) videos on the series, and it all just kinda clicked from there.  I currently have two accounts, one is purely a free to play account, meaning I've spent no money on the game, and one where I've spent ~$100 on card packs and the adventures.  I find both accounts fun to play on, but the free to play one is much more challenging since I lack the “best” cards.

My personal favorite class is Paladin simply for the emotes, although I probably have the most wins with mage from playing arena and from when I was actually trying to reach the “legend” rank in the game.  It takes a certain kind of patients to climb the ranking ladder every month.

The subreddit is very interesting.  It can often [contain information in order to better yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1ua5c9/hearthstone_for_beginners_guide_and_resource/), [funny or lucky plays](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3iucsi/trolden_funny_and_lucky_moments_hearthstone_ep_126/), or can just be flooded with [silly jokes](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3h6v0g/seto_kaiba_plays_dr_boom_yugiohhearthstone/) or memes.  Also, it is a good source for discussion of upcoming content or [balance changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2tuv29/upcoming_balance_change_to_undertaker/) if you can tolerate some of the more immature behavior.  There also seems to be a lot of discussion, like any competitive game, of the prominent players, including both [popular streamers](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3ifvwo/kripp_got_legend/) and [eSports](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3izcmo/team_archons_official_statement_on_xixo_and_purple/) players.  Like most larger subreddits, it is what you make of it.  I enjoy the content it provides, and it has introduced me to many different streamers and personalities like Kripp, Day9, and Trolden that I wouldn't have known about before.  And it has helped me learn about the game and grow as a player immensely.

Now on to the interviews!

&gt;##1.  Tell us a little about yourselves.

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang** - Hey, I'm Meoang. Right now I'm a college student trying to finish up my degree in Computer Science. All of my work, and my school work, is online, so it really helps me stay focused on maintaining the sub without neglecting other responsibilities. I play tons of video games, especially Hearthstone, Diablo, and single player games like Elder Scrolls and Fallout.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - I'm old for a gamer (32) and a software development lead at a mid-size software company (~1000 employees). Been doing basic coding (at least HTML) since I was 10 and using AOL dialup, so I basically had my career path lined up since middle school. Throughout the entire time, I gamed, starting with FPS then moving on to RPGs once I discovered Final Fantasy VI.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - I was born in India, but moved to North America when I was 4. Ever since then, I was fond of playing card and board games, especially, and as I grew older, this transitioned into video games. I play the clarinet as a hobby, which I have been doing for 7 years now. Currently I am an engineering student in college, and so gaming is a fun way to step away from what is ~~sometimes~~ often rigorous and demanding.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - I’m scene_missing. I’m a system admin in Washington DC. I’ve been a Blizzard fan since the Warcraft 2 days.

&gt;##2.  What got you initially interested in Hearthstone? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang** - This is going to sound silly because everyone was going crazy for beta keys when the game first came out. I knew almost nothing about Hearthstone at the time, I just played a lot of other Blizzard games. One day I randomly checked my email and got a beta key invite to Hearthstone, so I looked into it and it seemed like a lot of fun. After playing it for a while, I asked around to see if I knew anyone else in the beta, and literally no one else I knew had gotten in. I've basically been playing the game since it became available in the closed beta just because I happened to get invited right away.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - Quite a few people at work played and I began watching it on Twitch. Looked interesting and was free, so fuck it, why not? Got hooked for a few months, but I play quite a bit less now that my time is absorbed by Final Fantasy XIV. I still watch it quite a lot, though, so I feel like I can pick it up again pretty easily... usually Kripp, Reynad, or Forsen.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - While Hearthstone was in closed beta, the game that I was most into was League of Legends. Aside from playing, I would often watch streams as well, and many of my favorite streamers (Scarra, Wingsofdeathx, Dyrus, etc.) would play this random card game during queues and breaks. I didn't tihnk much of it at the time, but as the open beta was drawing near, my friend brought it up to me and I decided to look it up and try it out. I haven't looked back since!

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - I had never gotten into Magic or any other TCG growing up, so I didn’t know much about the history of the genre. I put in for the closed beta because I had played a kazillion hours of WOW and Starcraft over the years, and just wanted to see what it was about. I got pretty much instantly hooked, and now play those other games and my consoles on the side.

&gt;##3.  How would you pitch Hearthstone to friend in order to convince them to play it?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang**  - It's like a card game where you don't have to keep track of your cards and you don't have to spend all your time figuring out rulings. Those are the most annoying parts of traditional card games to me, so it's like having a fun card game without the downsides.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - I really don't pitch it to anyone. If I were to, however, I would basically say it's a fun, free game you can play on your mobile device.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - A couple of my close classmates and friends have also been playing since the open beta began. I never really pitch Hearthstone to people, but I am guilty of often playing in class (even more so now that the phone version is out), and a lot of people who I was friends with would come and ask me what game I was playing. I would tell them what it was about and more often than not, they too would start playing.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - I’ve had a hard time convincing my friends to play actually - even the Warcraft addicted ones. My usual pitch is “It’s like Magic the Gathering, but more accessible and much more fun.”

&gt;##4. What is your favorite and/or least favorite card?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang**  - My favorite card has to be Kel'Thuzad. Like 80% of the reason I love him is because of what happens when you play him. He has the longest intro quote in the game, then he summons back all of your dead minions. I'd say 9 times out of 10 you win the game when you manage to pull him off, often with an instant concede. I crafted a golden one as soon as I possibly could, even though he only really works in one deck. My least favorite card is probably Mad Scientist. Way too much value, and secrets are annoying to play around in general.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - Love Deathwing. I put it in almost every deck as my unique spin and an additional win condition. Sometimes backfires, but whatever, it's for fun. Hate Flamestrike because I usually do arena... for obvious reasons.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - That's a tough one; there are a lot of fun and interesting cards in Hearthstone, but my favorite one is the humble SI:7 Agent. Coining one out on turn 2 to kill a 3/2 is one of my favorite plays in all of Hearthstone. The card I hate the most is Leper Gnome, because when your opponent begins a game with a Leper Gnome, you know it's just going to be going downhill from there.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - Most favorite - Looks like Kel'thuzad is already taken - so I’ll hype a few other ones. I love Malganis for some of the same reasons. Great effect, great sound design. Even better if you can cheese it out on turn 5 with a Voidcaller. Not going to lie - sometimes I say the lines along with the entrance. Least favorite - Alextraza. It’s a card that punishes you more for having more life. I always found that frustrating.

&gt;##5.  What is your favorite and/or least favorite class?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang**  - My favorite class will always be Druid for a couple of reasons. First of all, they're the best class to run Kel'Thuzad with, so it gets bonus points there. Second, Druid will always be relevant to the meta because of their ramp and Force of Nature/Savage Roar combo, so I don't have to worry about my class fading into obscurity. And the third reason is that there are 2-3 really strong Druid decks that are all a lot of fun to play, so the class never gets boring. I don't really have a least favorite class, but I almost never play Shaman.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - Love Warrior just because it's difficult to win with it in arena. I played it well before Patron Warrior was a thing, too, with my pay-to-play control deck. It seems to involve more thinking than a lot of other classes (especially since Math Warrior was introduced), and I dig that. I hate Hunter, again for obvious reasons.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - My favorite class is Rogue, with Warlock being a close second. Whenever I play RPGs, I always tend to pick the stealth/assassin classes and Rogue has that kind of playstyle in Hearthstone with its reliance on combos and burst. Warlock, with its Handlock archetype, relies on a high risk-high reward strategy as well, taking as much damage as you can to swing the game with huge turns. 

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - Least favorite - either Shaman or Rogue. Both are my classes with the fewest wins.

&gt;##6.  If you have any World of Warcraft experience, what type adventure (like Naxxaramus or Blackrock Mountain) would you like to see added to the game? If you don't have any World of Warcraft experience or in addition to, what card would like added to the game? Doesn't have to be specific.

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang** - I think the most iconic fight in World of Warcraft is Arthas, so I'd have to say Icecrown Citadel.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - My fondest memories of WoW are Black Temple in Burning Crusade, so probably that would be a cool adventure. With Legion coming out next year, it seems like it might be something that would crop up, too.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - I have never played WoW so I don't have any particular expansion, but I want to see more unique card draw mechanics. A draw engine is vital to any deck, and this is why there is a lot of variety in viable Warlock decks while other classes are relatively unplayable. Creating new, unique draw mechanics would bring a lot of new deck types into the game and give new options for theorycrafters.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - I was always jealous that Heroes of the Storm got to be cross world and Hearthstone didn’t. That’s what I really want - to open it up the Starcraft and Diablo worlds.

&gt;##7.  Your opponent draws a card for exact lethal, which card is it?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang**  - Warsong Commander.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - Pyroblast. Always.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - Not a single card, but I once lost to a Mech Mage who got King Krush from Unstable Portal and 4 +1 Attack Spare Parts from 2 Clockwork Gnomes and 2 Mechanical Yetis for a 1 in 1,109,262 exact lethal. I did the math right after the game to prove to myself that I did indeed have no way of playing around that. PJSalt

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - Sadly, it’s always Kill Command.

&gt;##8.  Anything else you'd like to add about /r/hearthstone or Hearthstone in general?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Meoang** - If you're at all interested in card games, or even just Blizzard games, I highly recommend at least giving the game a download. It's a little intimidating at first, but if you learn the ropes (especially Arena) you'll have a respectable collection in no time. I know plenty of people that have tons of cards who never spent any money on the game. Collecting the cards is half the fun, and you'll constant be learning new things about the game on the way.

&gt;&gt;If you do play the game, or you're thinking about it, then come visit us at /r/hearthstone. Everyone is friendly here, we pretty strictly moderate low-quality content, and our relationship with Blizzard is great.

&gt;&gt; **/u/depressiown** - /r/hearthstone is interesting because it's a delicate balance between curbing shitposts, and allowing entertaining content. So many things posted are subjective in how they're received, and we get a lot of flak because of that. It's not an easy job... which is why I stick to the CSS and bot instead and don't do much direct moderation.

&gt;&gt; **/u/theclarinetsoloist** - I love /r/Hearthstone and try my best to interact with the community and make it the best community in esports. I know sometimes both the game and the subreddit make you want to throw your computer out the window, but that's what makes gaming fun, right? My Battletag is ClarSoloist#1421 for anyone that wants to add me.

&gt;&gt; **/u/scene_missing** - Just that like all others, I’ve been really surprised to see how much it’s taken off. I never expected to see it in the top games on Twitch every night, or to see us closing in on 300K subs.

&gt;&gt;**/u/LadyCailin:** OH MAN U HAVE A VIRUS? HAVE U TRY TURNING COMPUT ON AND BACK OFF AGIN

&gt;&gt;**/u/Ooer:**  Before you even think about what you need to do with a computer virus, you need to understand the virus itself. For example, you don't take antibiotics for a viral infection, and you don't saw off a leg for a headache. If you take the computer virus on a date, somewhere nice, candles, olive bread etc. and just ask it a few simple questions you will quickly be able to understand what they are all about. I always watch and see how they treat the waiter/waitress too, that tells you a lot about a computer virus.

3kp0gm,1,2015-09-12,"First post on TRP, requesting advice. Thanks in advance.",hainspuerterican,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3kp0gm/first_post_on_trp_requesting_advice_thanks_in/,"Hi TRP, where to start?  I'm 23 just out of college now, discovered TRP a few months ago and have been slowly implementing positive changes into my life style.  To be honest I began to stumble upon a lot of what TRP teaches throughout my college years.  Reading TRP has confirmed a lot of my out thoughts and conclusions based on experience.  I, like many here, used to be a beta blue pill champion of sorts, submitting to every whim of the women I was interested in.  I've come a long way since, but I recognize that I still have a long way to go and come here to humbly seek a little more specific advice now.

A little about me today.  I graduated from a good university with plenty of internship experience.  Got a very good job in finance out of college.  Throughout my college years I lifted on and off but could never keep the weight on.  Since July of this year (not that long I know) I have been going to the gym at least 5 days a week and have noticed significant gains since then.  One thing I did keep from the years of inconsistent lifting was my form and general knowledge.  I know my body and how it reacts to certain foods and exercise routines.  Currently live with my parents at home to save money, could easily afford to move out if I chose to do so.  My weekdays consist of work, gym, eating, and then normally 2 hours of free leisure time after all is said and done.  My weekends also consist of some leisure time, but I attend social events and try to be productive with my hobbies as well.  Overall I think I have a strong foundation to build off of.  I should also mention I have a few plates that have been hanging around for a while now.  As I mentioned before, I stumbled upon a lot of what TRP teaches on my own, but now I hunger for more.  More knowledge, further self development.

The main subject matter of this post is about a single girl that I have been attracted to for a long time.  She was my high school crush (red flag, yes, there are many with her). Brief background on her, she's my age, we flirted a lot in HS, dated for a short time.  I went full on submissive blue pill and she got bored really quickly.  Went off with another dude and I became the worst of beta orbiters.  I ruined other relationships for her in the future and alienated her even further by doing so.  I have only talked to her a few times since HS, she seemed less than interested in conversing with me in each instance.  The last time I talked with her directly was about 4 years ago.  

For about the past 2.5 years she dated on/off a long time acquaintance of mine (he would call me his friend but I do not share mutual respect for him).  To put things in context he is 28, lives with his mom, thought he would get famous with his band which went nowhere, drives FritoLay trucks for a living, no education past high school.  Average looking dude, is taller than me but also has never touched a weight a day in his life, slim build.  

Upon graduating high school my love interest was dating the valedictorian of our class, she was also going to a good college out of HS.  Fast forward to today, she dropped out and is still taking some college classes at the local community college, lives with her parents (who have a good bit of money), works at a local jewelry store as a counter girl, and has officially ended the relationship with above mentioned acquaintance about 2 months ago.  Towards the end it was obvious that she was using him for attention while she failed to attract another man that met her standards.  My friend/acquaintance is still pretty torn up about it and as a result tells me a lot about her.  Apparently she still thinks I'm obsessed with her, wonderful, although he did say her phone history had her searching me up and a few other dudes back from high school some months back.  He claims that she suffers from ""High Value Misinterpretation"" which I couldn't agree with more.  Like many white American women, she thinks she deserves nothing less than the absolute best.

I know that pursuing her is a very bad idea and that there are a million red flags but frankly I dont care.  I have virtually nothing to lose by going after her again and I want to, so I will.  Don't try to talk me out of it, because I will do it, practice if anything.  Was wondering what TRP would suggest for an approach though?  Currently I know she works at that jewelry which my family used to do a lot of business at.  I don't know any other public place that I could cross paths with her.  I was thinking of going with my buddy who she also knows from HS to check out engagement rings (a front) because him and his significant other have been together a long time now, so it's somewhat believable.  The idea was that we'd go in, see her there, start talking because it's been so long.  His girl would give him a call and he would step outside leaving me with her at the counter where I could then take control of the frame of the conversation best I could and casually ask her out to catch up over coffee.  Not sure how bad of an idea this is, seeking advice.  I would hear all so please, have at it.  I appreciate anyone that took the time to read this far.  What is my best course of action for making this girl another plate?  Thanks in advance.  "
3kp5se,94,2015-09-12,I told my Nmom that her boyfriend had been sexually abusing me about four years ago. Now she wants me to go to therapy with her.,oakboar,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3kp5se/i_told_my_nmom_that_her_boyfriend_had_been/,"**Tl;Dr: My mom has a new boyfriend that appears to be manipulative. This has caused my mom to want to drag me to therapy for reasons she can't explain so we can talk about how horrible I am for breaking apart her previous relationship.**

This is a throwaway. 

I don't want to go into graphic details, but about four years ago, when I was home for Christmas during my first year of college, I woke my mom up in the middle of the night to let her know that her boyfriend had just sexually assaulted me. This wasn't the first time it had happened, but I was able to confide in some new college friends who advised me to tell my mom. 

The next day, I went to stay with one of my new college friends. I stayed there for a week, and thought for sure that when I got home, things would be a lot different. I thought for sure that my stepdad would be gone. I was dead wrong. When I got back, my mom said that I had misunderstood what had happened, that it simply was an accident, and that my stepdad would like to apologize to me. I remember her dragging me into the living room where my stepdad was sitting so he could say sorry and that it would never happen again. Like I said, I will spare you the details, but what happened was very much not an accident. Even now, I still fear that I will not be believed. 

I didn't know what to do. My mom swore me to secrecy. She told me if I told my grandparents, they would surely have heart attacks and die. She told me if I told my dad who lived out of state, he would gloat and make life miserable for her. With the dorms closed until the start of the new semester, I had no one to turn to or anywhere to go. 

For spring break and summer vacation, I went to stay with my dad. I didn't tell him what had happened. I still had to go home to my mom for about a week after getting back from my dad's and the start of the new semester. 

When the new semester started, I went to one of the campus counselors to just talk through some things. That's when I finally told someone outside of my family and that one friend who knew what had happened. My counselor immediately told me that if I didn't want to see my stepdad again, I didn't have to, that I had that option. That very evening, I got on the phone with my mom and told her that I would not coming home for Thanksgiving or Christmas or really ever again as long as my stepdad was there. I was out of my mind with guilt. My older sister started calling me daily and leaving voicemails that I was the reason why our mom would be alone forever and that was overreacting over a small, little singular incident. 

That's when I told my dad, stepmom, grandparents (they are still alive and well, in case anyone is wondering), and close family friends. That's when my mom turned it around and tried to paint herself as a victim. She said if she kicked my stepdad out of the house, she wouldn't be able to afford to pay the bills. Her and my little brother would be homeless because she wouldn't be able to sign a lease at an affordable apartment because her credit score would be too low. She then started saying that she felt victimized by my stepdad as well (something I really don't doubt because he was always extremely emotionally abusive to her, something which I witnessed). She then said that we needed to go to therapy together because we were both victims and needed victims counseling together. She also wanted me to go to counseling with my stepdad. I didn't want to do any of these things, mostly because I felt victimized by her as well. I especially didn't want to have counseling with my stepdad because I never want to be in the same room with him. 

After about 10 months of not going home, my mom kicked my stepdad out of the house. That's when my mom and I started having a normal relationship again. We would go shopping, have pedicures, etc. She admitted to me that she was in a better financial situation because apparently my stepdad didn't contribute anything to the household expenses. She said she almost lost our house during a bout of unemployment because my stepdad wouldn't pay a single bill (he was employed at the time, by the way). She said she got to have friends and go out for the first time since she started seeing him. Apparently, he wouldn't let her go out without him. 

Everything seemed to be a lot better until just a few weeks ago. My mom started dating a guy about four months ago. Since I'm out of state right now doing an internship, I haven't had an opportunity to meet him. When they started dating, the calls from my mom went from being once a week to about once a month. I chalked that up to her just having fun. One night I called her, however, and she got really angry that I had interrupted her time with her boyfriend. She called me the next day and told me that her boyfriend has almost broken up with her because of her overbearing children. Then, a week ago, I informed my mom that I would probably need to move back in for a couple of months when I get back from my internship in three months. I have a job lined up, but it's not going to start for a little while and I need an opportunity to save up a little before getting my own place (my internship provides my housing right now). 

My mom's response was no, that she had rented my room to her boyfriend and that there was no room for me. I thought for sure she would change her mind, so I called her back the next day. That's when she said ""Sweetie, I was going to wait until you got home to tell you this, but a therapist of mine told me that I should be afraid of you.""

That's when I said something along the lines of ""Your husband sexually abused me in your home. And you should be afraid of me?"" 

I never finished the conversation with her because I hung up the phone angrily. A few days later, my mom told me that she wanted to have therapy with me. I told her I didn't want that. I had been cast as the villain when trying to get to a point where I didn't have to be around my stepdad anymore. I don't want to have to justify my actions to a therapist. I told my mom that if she feels afraid of me, that we probably shouldn't talk anymore. She keeps on insisting on having therapy with me, but when I ask her what she needs to work on, she keeps telling me she can't say that outside of mediation. She also says she knows the real reason why I don't want to have therapy with her, but, again, she can't divulge that reason outside of a therapist's office. 

I have a few theories why she's acting so weird right now. My first one is that she is trying to take attention off of herself. For the past three months or so, my mom has been skipping work, buying things she can't afford and falling behind on bills (according to my grandma). All of this started around the time she started dating her new boyfriend. She can divert all of this attention to me so my grandma will get off of her case. 

Another theory is that she has been telling lies about me to her new boyfriend. If she told this new guy that I lied about being raped and that's why she had to break up with her ex, then I can imagine her new boyfriend being afraid of me. Lying about rape is a serious thing. I think the prevalence of false accusations made it that much harder for me to be believed when I finally came forward with me story. 

My grandma now things I am some sort of monster because I don't want to have therapy with my mom. She says she thinks it will be good for us. But I am afraid of my mom going back to the idea that I took a little accidental thing and made it into a much larger idea. I also really don't want to revisit that part of my life. I have moved past it and wouldn't even be making this post if it weren't for how my mom is acting towards me. I told her I will find alternate housing. I also told her that if she wants to continue to talk to me, then she needs to quit with the idea of taking me to therapy. I told her it was a hard and fast boundary of mine that we not talk about going to therapy with each other again. She said that it was her boundary that we go to therapy together. I told her that that wasn't a boundary. 

My plan is just to not talk to her until she can at least tell me why she wants to go to therapy with me or why she's afraid of me. Until then, I think going will do more harm than good. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Does anyone have any ideas of how I should handle my mom going forward?"
3kpl90,30,2015-09-12,Big Long PTS Feedback Post,tavarner17,Tribes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/3kpl90/big_long_pts_feedback_post/,"**About me:** I was a comp player on Team Emporium, and for fun I also ran numbers stuff for the weapons in T:A generating discussion on the subreddit. I have done far more analysis on the weapons in this game than anybody else who has shared their findings.

With the advent of PTS, I have developed some opinions about how the game should change and I will go detail what these changes are. Due to my background, I hope my opinions carry some weight.

Hirez, generally I don't want to provide specific numerical targets for you to implement. I'd rather present arguments and explain mechanics that you can consider when altering the numbers.

Furthermore, I want you to consider [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/3jt0cm/suicide_respawns_and_broken_stuff/cus3q6b) I made recently, displaying why you need to be balancing the game for high levels of play to promote the game's health.

**Balance between the three classes**

As it is in the PTS right now, I see each class having a niche and I think that's great. Lights have the most powerful defensive tools and greatest mobility, but are made of paper. Mediums are the best fraggers, and Heavies have the best area denial tools and staying power. I think this is a healthy archetype, and while most weapons need major adjustments, I don't think Lights need a 3rd weapon to viable. They *should* be definitively worse fraggers than Mediums.

**Weapon Categories**

I'm disappointed I even have to talk about this. /u/Sleemani had the the right idea in his [post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/3kirjf/spinfusor_thumper_tcn4/) So I'll quote him and leave this here.

&gt;Explosives|Non Explosives
&gt;-|-
&gt;On impact |Projectiles
&gt;Delayed |Hitscan 

Where each unbolded box is a weapon category. Heavies get one from each, Meds pick 3 of the 4, and Lights pick two. Really I thought this was the obvious implementation since A Person Communicated that the weapons would be split into ""trees,"" which I shared in my [Scouting Report post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/3ixjd2/scouting_report_from_midair_event/)

**Cloak Pack on Lights**

Invisibility is a huge problem, especially when combined with the sniper class. That said, I think limiting Snipers to the Energy Packs is a bandaid is the truest sense of the word, and is only being thrown around because T2 did that. There are better ways to balance the pack.

First, I'm going to reference an old post I made discussing the pack [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1i8cfh/how2_balance_stealth_pack_features/)

Making the pack burn more energy with speed on a linear scale prevents quick and mobile getaways. It fixes inviso-capping, and since it binds your invisibility to a set distance you can tune the specific rates perfectly to match our current maps. Furthermore, it allows opposing players to track invisible people better since they can estimate where the Cloaked opponent will reappear.

In addition to that we need to make it so invisible people can't fire or use 'nades. I refuse to even talk about Smoke 'nades, they just need removed. Edit: Also, make jets visible regardless of whether the user is invisible or not, because duh. /Edit

With those changes in addition to the Medium's Jammer increase in viability on PTS, I think the Cloak pack would be much closer to being fair. I would want to implement these changes and then look at the Cloak Pack's balance again.

**Shield Packs**

I'm going to go against the grain and say I like having the Shield packs common. It provides a really good reason to run explosive and burst damage weapons, and make fragging more interesting, complex, and skillful. That said, it needs some nerfs.

Generally speaking, I don't think the Shield pack should completely shield you from a groupound/disc jump.

If we need further nerfs after that, let's consider making it burn more energy at faster speeds, just like my Cloak Pack suggestion.

**Sniper/Defensive Balance**

This is my philosophy on the O/D balance: each of the three defensive positions (HOF, LD, and Snipe) should be capable of stopping a grab *alone* if they are *undisrupted.* 3 player offenses need to prevent them from doing their job by killing, disabling or distracting them.

We should be balancing the defensive tools allotted to each position based the fact an *undisrupted* player should stop the capper every single time.

An example to set the premise: an undisrupted HOF that pays attention will be able to see incoming routes from the stand. He has a number of options: chain the capper from a distance, attempt to bodyblock, groundpound with an explosive, or go for a midair. Using a combination of these tools, a HOF has plenty of options for destroying cappers.

My point is that we need to set a standard for snipers that looks something like this: if you as the sniper can click the fast dot x times over the course of set-up, approach, and return, you should get the kill. Hirez, you get to say what that number 'x' is.

[Little's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/3ko2xx/the_future_of_the_sniper_role/) on the sub goes a different route, but his idea fits into this one. Making a sniper rifle that deals damage 1:1 with speed requires a sniper to click the dot less times when the dot gets faster. This is appropriate because a fast capper is harder to hit. Furthermore, it makes the capper/sniper confrontation more interactive. Since the capper can slow down to take less damage he can feasible counter snipers to a point. Finally, cappers will take less damage while they are at the top of the arcs they use to gain speed, and that is when cappers are easiest to hit. Big +1 from me.

**Explosives/Egocentric and the Capper/Chase mechanic**

I'm hoping most weapons in this game will recieve damage nerfs. I want to point out that if the explosive tools get nerfed strategically, we could get rid of the Egocentric perk while maintaining our current routes. This will help out chasers, and potentially justify a nerf to Rage.

I'll spell part of this one out because I don't want anybody to get the wrong ideas here.

Tool|Old Damage|New Damage

Explosive Nitron|650|425
Nitron|300|200
Light/Duel/Blinks Spin (Splash)|550|425
Spare Spin (Splash)|600|425
Spinfusor (Splash)|650|&gt;425, 500-600ish?

Nerf the other guns less, and ***LEAVE IMPULSE ALONE!***

This setup would retain the following combos:

* **Light routes:** Light Spin- Nitron- Nitron
* **Light routes:** Exp Nitron- Exp Nitron
* **Med routes**: Spare Spin- Spare Spin- Spare Spin

The virtue of the Spare Spinfusor dealing less self damage and therefore becoming more viable for capping gives it a niche that the standard Spinfusor won't intrude on. Obviously, the standard Spinfusor would be the better choice for players intending to frag.

Other explosive weapons in the game should recieve appropriate nerfs, too. However, that would be too much to get into in this post.

**Chain Guns**

Some nerfs plz, just like explosives. But that's not what I really want to talk about here.

In the combining of the medium classes, we run into a real problem with the chain guns available: there are 7 options, and the TCN4 is far better than any other gun. If we remove the TCN4, there will always be a next best option. It would be a real shame to waste all this potential complexity, especially when the models are already made. You could also make the extra guns into skins, but that decrease in options makes the game shallower.

It's my opinion that the chain guns should be changed so that players can pick favorites within the weight class, and encourage the spergs to go into depth about which option is more viable in specific situations in order to capitalize. In addition, I think the game should encourage strategic play as opposed to spamming projectiles. In this case, I mean encouraging players to swap weapons strategically and choose their shots. Furthermore, everyone who plays T:A seriously recognizes the ease of using the chain gun.

My suggestions to HiRez on chain:

**a)** appropriately nerf the hitboxes

**b)** provide a spectrum of chain guns that each fit a niche within each weight class and

**c)** reward the players who have good aim and swap strategically.

As for ""hitboxes,"" I'll just point out how absurdly large they are. The hit registration radius for a Blue Plate is 10 Unreal Units. The Plasma Gun's radius is 25 Unreal Units. I want to note that this makes a tiny bit of sense, considering the Plasma Gun's projectiles are a tiny bit slower than the Spinfusors. Realistically, the Plasma Gun should have a slightly larger hit registration radius, but 2.5 times is too much. Now to compare to the chain weapons like the AR/Gast, their projectiles travel 5.3 times as fast as a Spinfusor, and have a hit reg radius of 50 Unreal Units. So +5x as fast, and 5x the hit reg. THIS is absurd, and this is why chain is on top in T:A.* I'm not* saying that we need to nerf chain's hitbox to be less than a Blue Plates. I would advocate normalizing hitboxes and then balancing the damage and projectile speed around that.

While I'm speaking on projectile speed, please normalize all chain weapons to have the same projectile speed. This includes the Chain Gun and Chain Cannon. I have reason to believe the projectile speed values you listed in the Weapons Data chart that got posted were incorrect for those two weapons. /u/HirezSean can justify, I went through and did a bit of cleanup on the values shown, including making sure that the data indicated the Mastered versions. I found mistakes, and an intern at HiRez should go back through every value and verify it. Or you guys could give me access to that data and I'll do it for you.

On to the ideal spectrum of chain weapons. I want to point out that damage per second (DPS) is not the end-all-be-all of balancing guns.

When you fire a chain gun, you don't have to wait for the first bullet to appear, as common sense dictates. However the consequence of this means that when a high damage/low rate of fire (ROF) gun races against of a faster/low damage gun of the same DPS, the heavier hitter basically jumps the starting gun and starts out dealing higher damage. Speaking mathematically, a slow and powerful gun will have a higher y-intercept, which means it will kill first given the same DPS. This means it's OK to give faster guns higher DPS than slower guns, because the DPS bonus can mitigate how high damage results in an advantage.

Spinup time is an interesting mechanic because it effectively gives your Damage vs Time graph a *negative* y-intercept. This makes it more OK for these guns to have higher DPS. However that's only valid when the guns work as intended. The X1 is animated to have spinup time, but sometimes it deals damage as soon as it's fired. Please fix this bug.

Second, it's easy to see in game that with higher ROF it gets easier it is to track opponents and aim. It also means that you can get more hits in while an opponent is vulnerable. One can easily conclude that a faster the ROF on the weapon, the more it's spam should be limited by forcing you to reload. This means smaller magazines.

Edit: Kinda feel like elaborating a bit more on these niches.

Really what I want to present the player is a choice between taking a the higher ROF gun with high DPS, or taking the lower ROF gun which grants a player the option to continue firing for longer since it has larger magazines. The high ROF guns force you to reload quickly, which means you can't maintain a threat for as long without reloading.

Regarding passive reloads, consider the situation like this: Assuming every gun take &gt;3 seconds to empty a clip, you get your explosive back when you empty a whole clip with any chain gun. This means that the high ROF guns would have an advantage since they deal more DPS, and more damage in that amount of time, correct? Not necessarily. Assuming you used the same explosive alongside each gun, you will have to swap back to you chain at the same time, after 3 seconds. When that happens, all the chain guns are reloaded, and you swap and begin firing. The heavy hitters get their jump start again, and we're still left with question of which would be better.

Lessening your options and forcing yourself to reload every 3 secs can prove fatal. But the DPS! and the ease of use! See, this is the catch 22 I think we should be able to inspire within the game. /Edit.

This gives us some interesting niches to work around. Slower chain guns should have larger clips, and faster chain guns should have more DPS. Balance the hitboxes, then do the damage/rof stuff using a graph.

**Shotguns**

They were overnerfed. I'm sure you have plenty of other people yelling at you about this, so I won't discuss it further.

**Nova Colt/ Eagle/ Sparrow**

Nerfing the Nova is much better option than making all 3 guns useless. Again, other people have been screaming about reverting them. I would have been more on board with the move to projectile if you implemented the netcode changes you mentioned first.

**Edit: Terminus**

Is a great map. That said, IDK why it was advertised that it would be like ARX base swapped 90 degrees because, there literally is no back route. They are all diagonals...

But overall, great flag stand, pretty good terrain. Bad inside base but really who cares about that. Overall 8/10 map, on level with the best in this game. /Edit.

**Edit: Perks**

I'm in the camp that Quick Draw should become standard, because it opens up a LOT more creativity for Secondary Perks. Survivalist, Potential Energy, Sonic Punch and other cool mechanics would become viable. /Edit.

**Tl;DR** would negate the point of this post.

Mods/Fixious, this is it's own post because it's quite long and the suggestions thread wouldn't provide the exposure and discussion a new post would encourage.

I welcome critique and questions."
3kpzml,28,2015-09-12,We're the Computer Science Club at Texas State (EXE)! And this is what we're all about!,martialfarts316,txstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/txstate/comments/3kpzml/were_the_computer_science_club_at_texas_state_exe/,"(tl:dr down at the bottom!) 

**Hey Bobcats!** I was originally going to submit this as a reply to /u/owlex_68 's [post about the CS club](https://www.reddit.com/r/txstate/comments/3kcqfr/is_anyone_in_the_cs_club/) yesterday but, after reading some of the comments and seeing multiple people interested and wanting more information, I realized it might benefit more as it's own post. 

Firstly, to comment on your post, /u/owlex_68:
 /u/IAmABrandon , /u/Joel_Ramirez , and others were giving some great info in that post but to add on, yes CS does have some stereotypical, socially awkward guys. But as far as the club goes, they usually stay away due to their social awkwardness, so you shouldn't meet anyone like that at all. Our club has a good mix of all kinds of races, gender (though we can always use more girls), and personalities. If the idea of the male domination is causing some hesitation in joining, I can hook you up with some of the girls in our group (my gf included!) so that you can begin to feel more comfortable before you decide if you want to join.

--------------------

As far as info about our club, we have 2 main focuses:

#Projects

We are a purely student led club, so we decide what we want to work on and how we want to run things, unlike many national orgs around campus. That being said, **our main focus is on our 4 Projects** (more info on them below). We discuss at the end of each semester on what technologies interest us that we would like to learn but are not taught in our classes, then vote on making them official club projects for the following semester. When the semester starts, we divide into groups depending on your interest and simply work together to learn and create a project for each group each semester! ***Regardless of your personal skill level***, there is something for everyone to do and learn! The projects we work on are:

- **Android App Dev**: We get together to learn Java and Android Studios with the goal of creating an app to publish to the play store. We discuss exactly what we want the app to do, how it's designed, and learn the ins and outs of the development of mobile applications. (We chose Android development due to iOS development costing money and the fact that a majority of our members had android phones.)

- **Web Dev**: The Web Dev group is currently undergoing a new renovation. We originally planned for the Web Dev team to create a website for the club from scratch, but since most of the members of the Web Dev group were basically brand new to web development, that was a pretty big task to ask of them for one semester. So, instead, we are focusing on creating smaller web apps that are much more manageable for a semester project for newbies.

- **Game Dev**: The Game Dev group is currently working on creating a small game in their chosen game engine (I believe it's Unreal Engine 4, which is free). They will be going over the basics of game development and the use of the game engine to work towards finishing a small game by the end of the semester.

- **Python Dev**: The Python Dev group will be working on....Python lol. We will be starting from scratch on Python as if you are brand new to the coding (as some of our members are). We will be learning the syntax and basics of Python, then, each week, developing a small program/game in python to get your hands dirty on actually coding with the new language you are learning. Each meeting you will bring back the small project you worked on for that week and compare contrast yours to others code in an effort to learn how others solved the problem or did something differently. And for those that are a little more advanced, there will be bonus requirements for each weekly project to implement some more challenging aspects.

If you have any further questions about the projects, please comment or PM me! Our second main focus to EXE is:

#Professional

We are focused helping you land that job or internship and help set you apart from all the other CS/CIS graduates. By participating in the projects above, this shows potential employers that you can work in teams, are willing to learn outside of class for your own benefit, and that you are able to actually have something to **show** them besides just a GPA and completed degree like the hundreds of other students. 

Besides the projects, we work on setting up job/internship opportunities for our members. We consistently have local business such as USAA, IBM, Freescale, Samsung, Microsoft, Sogeti, Bioware, and many more come down to talk to you guys about their businesses, internships, job opportunities, interviewing/resume tips, and what they look for in potential candidates (We actually just had a 7 hour tour of USAA's main office in SA today!). This networking is invaluable to you guys when it comes to learning what you have to do to get hired or land an awesome internship. You don't want to miss out on these!

We also do what we can to reach out to the community to encourage local high school kids to chose a STEM career path or simply choose to go to college in general. We are currently planned to give a tour of our campus and demo some of the stuff we've worked on to Dripping Springs High school and others next Friday (9/18)! 

#For Fun

Outside of the our projects and business stuff, we also do some fun, optional, recreational events! Such as:

- Tubing
- Movie Nights
- LAN Parties
- BBQs
- Eating Out (sometimes on the club!)
- Etc.

To participate in our projects only is completely free! We do have an optional membership fee but it's only $25 a semester! Your member fee gets you an EXE T-Shirt plus access to:
- Recreational Club Events (those mentioned above)
- Business seminars/events
- And more food for each meeting/event! (PIZZAAAA)

--------------------

That's pretty much the gist of the Club! ***We meet every Tuesday at 7pm in DERR 231.*** If you want to join and have a Facebook, you can request to join our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TxstateEXE/?ref=br_rs) where we post announcements and other discussions (this group will be replaced by our website when we flesh that out). 

If you have any questions, feel free to comment or PM me! Hope to see you there!

#tl;dr
- The CS club (EXE) is a student led club and focuses on learning what you aren't taught in class and networking with other students.
- We have 4 main projects for this semester; App Dev, Wev Dev, Game Dev, and Python Dev.
- We work on having businesses come talk to you guys for internship/job opportunities and interview/resume tips.
- We also do some fun stuff on the side like LAN parties, movie nights, tubing, etc.
- Participating in projects are the ""free membership"" but all other events (and the tshirt) require being a paid dues member ($25 a semester)
- We strive to make the environment as friendly and welcoming of all personalities and skill levels as possible. 
- We meet on Tuesdays at 7pm in DERR 231!"
3kqb0h,1,2015-09-12,Hello! new in town and looking to meet new people!,Ness_PKfire,BurlingtonON,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurlingtonON/comments/3kqb0h/hello_new_in_town_and_looking_to_meet_new_people/,"Hi, I am a 24 yo guy who came to Burlington a few days ago to work. I come from pretty far away (Spain) and well it's hard to meet people at the begining. I'm a currently studying a master and moved to Burlington to do my internship. After such a travel now I'm finding myself without any social group. I know it's different in comparison if you travel to another country to study: u are suppose to meet new people in the uni, but since it's not my case then things are a little bit more difficult. I tried to look for social events but either they are far from burlington or are aimed for older people.
I understand that the situation is natural, up until now I've been an student which means friends are from the childhood or came natural because of the studies. So let's say I didn't have to ""make"" friends...

So I guess this is my situation and I just wanted to know if there are some group of young people in their early-mid 20s within the Burlington and not-so-far areas that would like to meet up and have a beer/coffe together. Also any advice on this matter would be really appreciated.

Thanks for the help!

3kqqn4,7,2015-09-12,"Today I threw out everything I had, I'm still not sure if this was a good idea. (a bit long)",CommanderCuntPunt,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3kqqn4/today_i_threw_out_everything_i_had_im_still_not/,"I've been in a bit of a downward spiral for a few years. I started having issues with depression in my senior year of high school and never dealt with them before going off to college. 

When I got to college I was struggling with depression, but when I got to school I just gave up. I didn't bother making friends and just hung out and played video games and made friends with people online. Academically I did ok, mostly B's but some A's but kept myself above water, this continued for two years. I then took a year off for an internship (this is expected in my program) and kinda blew it.

When my internship started I had been drinking a lot on weekends (all in games with online friends) and decided to start smoking weed occasionally to deal with depression in the evenings. This quickly became a nightly thing and I would be up until 2am smoking and watching tv.

My office was really relaxed, nobody really cared when I would show up at around 10:30 since I was staying late and getting everything done. I definitely was not the most reliable employee, but my boss never said anything and at times basically said he didn't care when I showed up as long as I get all my shit done. 

Eventually my internship ended and I left the company. While I know I was not a fantastic intern nobody ever complained about my schedule. My boss seemed to like me but the entire time I felt like a shitty employee and I knew I was not getting as much out of my internship as I wanted to.

I decided to take the entire summer off to work on personal projects and study. Instead of working I spent the entire summer smoking and hanging out at the beach. An ounce would last me about 6 weeks, so it wasn't like I was high every second.

So finally we come to this past month, I'm back at school and kinda fucking up big time. I haven't been studying and am only doing fine because I haven't had major quizzes or tests. I was getting high every evening instead of working or meeting new people. 

I've been smoking or drinking to deal with my mental health issues for so long that I really don't know any other way to deal with my problems. If I was sad I got high, worried that I'm fucking my life up meant time to get really high. I tried telling myself that I was getting high to deal with these issues, but I realize this was kinda a big load of shit.

I've been trying to limit myself to weekends, but I lack the self control to keep myself from smoking. Any time I think about life without weed it just seems empty and pointless. The idea of having to actually confront my issues and not just get lost in my high is a bit terrifying. I know I need to do this though, I've fucked my life up and at this point I either deal with my mess or have a shitty life. I used to have passions and hobbies, I miss that so I know its time to quit. Today I threw out all my weed and avb and since I don't have a dealer (used DNM's) I think I have a chance to beat this.

The problem is I now have to deal with all the shit I've caused. I know I need to stop smoking, but I can't help but think that quitting and dealing with all this is a terrible idea. I have no idea what I'm doing, I just don't want to fuck my life up more than it is.

Thanks for reading, sorry this went so long, I kinda ended up just typing up a summary of the last few years to explain why I'm so fucked. I really want to get better, but I just cant shake the feeling that I've made a terrible mistake."
3krf7x,5,2015-09-13,Gulf Countries Political And Economic System Similar To Syrian Regime,Yann_Somou,Syria,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syria/comments/3krf7x/gulf_countries_political_and_economic_system/,"With the Syrian refugee crisis in full swing, a lot of the public and governments have pointed out that Arab countries of the gulf region have hardly taken in any refugees.  Countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and Bahrain have hardly done anything except contribute about a $1 Billion towards refugee assistance.  This sum is small by comparison to the United States which has contributed close to $4 Billion.

Northern Europe has taken the bulk of the refugees, with around a half a million in Germany already and more are on there way.  Where as Christian Northern Europe has opened their doors and hearts to these refugees, the pious Islamic Gulf states have hardly taken any in. The Syrians that are in the gulf were largely recruited for work and are professionals and not really refugees.  Due to a lack of skilled labor, Gulf countries regularly imports workers from around the Arab world and South Asia. When Gulf countries are compared to their middle eastern Arab/Muslim neighbors, their inaction become even more stark.  Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, has hosted nearly 4 million refugees with Turkey having taken in over 2 million and tiny Lebanon taking in 1.1 million refugees, which constitute a quarter of their population.  They have taken most of the refugees during this crisis and have done so with often less resources compared to the Gulf nations.

These gulf countries also share responsibility and blame of sustaining the Syrian Civil War by funding the opposition, and often those funds are directly going to hard line Islamist factions. Although these governments are opposed to ISIS, as it threatens their own despotic rule, they are actively funding and stoking Sunni factions and pursuing an anti-Iran, anti-Shia strategy.  Syria, an Iranian allay with a minority lead Alawite dominated regime, is a crucial part of this strategy to deny Iran influence.  Alawites are a variant of Shia Islam.

Although the Gulf countries must be blamed for their apathy in the midst of the humanitarian crisis that has befallen their own Arab/Muslim brethren, what must be understood is the lack of desire for Syrian refugees wanting to emigrate to the Gulf countries.  The Assad regime represents a sectarian and authoritarian form of government with a thin veneer of socialist ideology, much of which was abandoned in recent decades.  The regime's military officer corps are largely recruited from the minority Alawite sect as well as most top government officials.  The Assad extended family occupies high positions in military and intelligence apparatus to ensure obedience to the Assad dynasty. Additionally, like most classical authoritarian regime, power with in the military and intelligence fields are subdivided and made to monitor each other so as to ensure no one component can overthrow the Assad regime.  

The Arab spring which took hold take in the Syria was in reaction to the corrupt authoritarian Assad regime and a desire for a more democratic and open economic system.  The Assad's were more than willing to kill their own people to remain in power and Syrians took up arms to overthrow them. 

The similarities between the Assad regime can be largely extend to the Gulf states.  Saudi Arabia, as the biggest and wealthiest, has divided its military into two components, the Saudi Arabian Army and The Saudi National Guard.  The Saudi National Guard is the more powerful organization with better equipment and it's members largely recruited form tribes allied with the Al-Saud ruling monarchy.  Furthermore, the Al-Saud clan made an ideological compact with Muslim religious scholars/imams by  making Wahabbi Sharia law the Constitution of the country.  Additional, large support from oil money is given to this group to spread their intolerant Wahabbi ideology through out the Muslim world.  In return these groups legitimize the rule of the house of Al-Saud and do not challenge their rule based on Islamic principles.  This has the effect of mollifying the conservative Saudi public and leaving no room for political space.  The Saudi economy is wholly depended on oil and most jobs are in the government, with very few private sector jobs.

The arch of the Saudi government can be extended to Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain.  Bahrain and UAE are slightly unique, with Bahrain being ruled by a monarchy from the minority Sunni government which practices near apartheid like polices for its majority Shia population.  UAE, has a tiny national population with a 10 times larger foreign population that are not citizens and can never be one, but has largely bought off it's citizens with oil money welfare.  The commonality between the Gulf countries are that they are monarchies, oil economy driven, often sectarian, and authoritarian.

This is not necessarily the case in rest of the middle east where Jordan and Lebanon, which are developed countries, have economies are not oil based.  Turkey has a fairly developed economy with large consumer electronics, shipbuilding , and engineering sectors which have been growing fast in the last several decades.  Due largely to lack of oil, these countries have had to develop their economies in other ways which have lead them to be more integrated into the global economy.  This intern has had the benefit of more open government, at least by Middle East standards.    

The Syrian refugees, having seen the similarities between the Gulf Countries political and economic system are instead focused on getting to Europe where Democracy and an open economic system is the rule.  Instead of trying to get into Gulf Countries, they are willing to risk drowning to cross into Europe, perhaps that is the greatest damming statement of the Gulf nations."

I got hired for an internship until the end of December and I'm looking for a flat.
I've been looking for the past two weeks and I can't seem to find one. I'm getting really desperate because the hotel is absurdly expensive.  
I've been looking on wg-gesucht because it's the only website with an english interface that I've found. I'll call the numbers but invariably they'll tell me it's not accessible or just not answer the phone. When there is no phone numbers I'll leave a message on the website but these don't ever get a response.  
I also looked at http://www.studentenwerkfrankfurt.de/ but their faq say they don't have rooms for small periods of a few months.

&amp;nbsp;

I asked at some information desk and they directed me to some agencies, one of which hung up on me when they heard me speak english, the other took me to see a 2200 euros/month flat on the eastern side of the Rhine...

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know what else to do, do you guys have any advice to find a place to live before I'm broke :(?"

3krl03,7,2015-09-13,[Rant]My new mentor is abusive and manipulative..,zavaa,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3krl03/rantmy_new_mentor_is_abusive_and_manipulative/,"I study medicine and last year I wanted to start my internships and got my mentor assigned. Back then I was still in aftershock from the ADD-diagnosis and the revelation of Narcissism in my family so I couldn't start.

I had to write a reflection on my study so far for my mentor. She knows of my mental health issues. 
My ADD-medication wasn't properly adjusted when I started so my language was a bit unspecific let's say.

She read my first draft without my permission (on the internet) and proceeded to share it with the board of education telling them that I'm crazy using said ADD language against me. This lead to them changing my first internship location to a hospital which is closer to our university. All that without talking to me about it first. That's a little shameful. It's supposed to be a relationship of trust and respect isn't it?

At first I wanted to believe her actions were in good spirit and I, still being a little vulnerable to this kinda thing, totally surrendered thinking that I as someone with a history of depression and ADD has to take this shit now.

Then I realized that that woman treats me like a stupid maniac. She hints at me being schizophrenic (""you think associatively, that did not seem coherent to me""), contradicts herself in her endless criticism of my documents (In the same sentence she tells me I'm to aspecific and too detailed without giving me examples) and I just feel shamed over and over.

She didn't want to tell me that we had to have a new meeting so she asked me when I thought we should have a meeting.

Instead of telling me what she doesn't like she just says that I should read over that again and think hard. She acts like I'm too insignificant, lazy and bad to deserve her attention.

She told me that the study is a lot of paperwork like this as if to tell me that I better stop.

Tomorrow I'll talk to my therapist about it as well as the university's councillor to figure out how exactly to proceed but I will not stay with that woman out of fear."

I'm already ""cool"" with it, but there's a lingering ""guilt"" that I'm feeling. So here goes my story...

There's this girl at work, we'll call her J.

She's really nice and cool to me and we get along pretty well. At the beginning at least. But the more time passed, the more I noticed something in her that I really just can't stand : She's self-centered.

Everything is about her, her life, her activities, her dating life, everything. At first it was fun hearing her talk about these guys she's dating randomly via Tinder, I was like ""Oh cool, a new girl and she already has some adventures"".

But then she talks about everything involving her life every single time. Whether it's just me 1-on-1 with her; us with just a couple of other interns or even if it's like a full table of 10+ people, she somehow manages to make it ALL about her.

And I dislike that. Like, I'm way too honest to even pretend that I'm interested in that. And quite frankly I don't want it. I value my lunch-time, I want to spend it well, I don't want to spend it with you J.

So the thing with J is, she's really trying hard to be closer to me. Like, we're already sort of acquaintances/friends as coworkers, but it's really obvious (even other co-workers, her supervisor, my supervisor, other interns are pointing this out), but I'm not receptive to it. I DO recognize the effort that she's putting into, and I'm grateful for that, but... at some point I just have to be honest with her and myself right?

She's not someone I want to spend time with. Simple as that. When we talk 1 on 1 she can be okay SOMETIMES, but other than that, the more she talks, the more she annoys me.

I guess what remains for me to do is to open this up to her and tell her straight up. Trust me, I've wanted to a couple of times already, but the timing was always bad. It's either I was super pissed because of other issues, too busy, or she was feeling down (and I didn't want to add any bullshit to her life).

TL;DR - Sorry for the long post by the way. A girl at work named J is making lots of efforts for us to become closer as friends. I'm not receptive to it because she's a VERY self-centered person and I just can't even pretend that it doesn't bother me.

PS: There really isn't any ""relationship"" element into this. I say this not to be defensive, but I just figured I would get that out of the way right now, since when I talk to this about her, people are quick to jump on the ""Oh maybe it's because she's a girl and you're a guy"" kind of thing way too quickly. This issue is more about our personalities being different (incompatible) with each other. I'm asking for advice on how to handle this tactfully.

3ktrft,7,2015-09-13,(CAN) Overly anxious about my finances,neverspagett,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ktrft/can_overly_anxious_about_my_finances/,"I first want to say thank you in advance to reading this and responding. I am a bit of a worry wort and finances have cropped up as a pain point for me.

I am 31 and graduating with an MBA this December. I am expecting to have around $15K in student line of credit debt post-graduation. To this date I have used my savings to finance my education and have about $65k in stocks that came as the result of an inheritance (they are being managed well and have seen good growth over the last 4 years). I'm very fortunate to have that. I have no dependents and am single.

I expect to start with a salary of $60K-$70K per year upon graduation. I have not secured a job yet but was very successful in a management consulting internship this summer and hope to continue down this route.

My anxiety is that I am way behind in terms of building a nest egg and that I am not on the property ladder yet. I live in the most expensive city in Canada (Vancouver) and find it difficult to save because of the cost of living.

I may be in a position to live rent free for a year upon my return which would help with my financial goals.

So my questions are:
1. Am I positioned well financially for 31 years old?
2. What sort of timeline should I realistically set for eliminating my debt? Should I cash out my high growth stocks (about 10%/year) to pay it off or pay the line of credit with salary? The line of credit rate is 3.5%.
3. Do I still have time to properly save for retirement? Is 30% savings rate a good target?
4. Would it be better to save for retirement or buy a condo as an investment? The condo market is hot and it is forecasted to stay that way for the foreseeable future as Vancouver is a city where many people have investment properties.
5. Last, and possibly most important, how did you psychologically just focus on your own financial/career path and not let comparisons bog you down?

Thank you so much!"

I don't expect any pity or help but I just really need to say something because.... I don't get to express myself very often. 

But for a long time, I always thought I was the happiest human being on earth. My childhood wasn't bad or good, but it was rough to say the least. I grew up to be a quiet kid up until the 5th grade. I used to be picked on quite a bit and I would used to cry quite a bit. But one day I just suddenly exploded with emotions, confidence, and I became sociable. Maybe it was because I was tired of the bullying or maybe it was because I was tired of not talking but I wanted to do something about it. Then the best years of my life happened in my opinion up until I hit high school.

I transferred to a new school and left most of my old friends behind. I had to remake new friends, which wasn't very hard at all. But being the only Asian in a predominant white christian school, I learned a lot about the ignorance and the ugly side of people. As usual my parents weren't much of a help throughout my life. But I understand the problems of what they had to go through and I do my best to make them proud and not have them put up with my problems. Anyways high school was very uneventful and all I mainly did was spend time with my bigger brother (who is actually my cousin but he was my role model). In one- I made one friend in high school, who I can say is one of the best things to have ever happened and I feel blessed to call her one of my best friends.

So now I am in college. This is the part where I am not sure where the depression came from but I feel like as if it was a manifestation of what was building up in the past along with current events. During this time, I was always quick to always give people my time and be as supportive to people that matter to me. What really hurts is when you get disregarded and treated like trash by people you think are there for you. Not to mention that I also ended up failing a class. It was the first time I felt like I was at a low. Maybe because life felt really easy until now. I picked myself back up and removed some people from my life and did a lot of revaluation. In summary: terrible friends first two years, along with my first and only failure in class. And then probably the worst thing happened.

It kind of sucks to say, but I met a girl in my junior year. She was a sweet and beautiful girl who was currently dealing with her own her inner demons. For me, I was attracted to her in more ways then one. I especially wanted to be there but I learned quickly it isn't easy. We had a relationship for a good while but eventually it didn't work out. Maybe it was due to my inexperience and also due to unfortunate circumstances but in short we broke it off. She later hooked up with someone a week and half later. Right there and then, I pretty much fell apart. A good 4 months, I just haven't felt the same. She eventually broke up with him but I'm forced to stay in contact due to us being close to our mutual friends. I stayed focused on school and she went through a lot. 

This leads me to senior year, which is where I currently am. I have an internship, life is going really well, and I'm on my way to graduating. I started working out and things are looking up. But there are times where I just feel depressed for no reason. And it makes me think about her, life, and just all sorts of stuff. I get moody and listen to music now and all in all just to cope. But I just don't feel like I am that same person that wanted the people in my life to be happy. In short my bigger brother doesn't talk to me anymore. My friends are well, just friends. And the girl that I have an attachment to is currently unhappy with herself and theres nothing I can do about that. The only thing thats really keeping me going is I guess my family and the determination to make something out of myself. I made it this far so why does this happen to me. Basically, I have only told one person about this depression I have and its a close friend of mine. It just scares me because I am not sure if it is going to get worse. Responses are welcome but in short, I thank you for taking the time to listen. To be honest, I feel better just typing it and letting it all out like this."

TL;DR: Girl with financial troubles agrees to sign a lease with me in April. Because she doesn't have enough money to pay rent for the first six months, my parents agree to be the sole guarantors, on the condition she pays me back and takes care of the last six months. After a minor incident, she decides to move out while I'm staying at a hotel, still owing me for the first six months of rent (around $10.9k). Should I pursue legal action?


DETAILS:


I met Hailey* in January of this year, as we had a lot of mutual friends in common. We weren't the closest of friends, but we generally got along well. 


In late March, I move from one dorm to another. My new suite contains four people: my new roommate, Hailey, and her roommate. Surprised by the coincidences, Hailey and I grow closer. I was planning to go off-campus the next year, and she was looking for someone to live with, so we agreed to do so together.


Side note, Hailey and I come from radically different economic backgrounds. My parents are both of international origin (as am I, currently in the U.S. on a Visa), while Hailey has had a history of physical and substance abuse plaguing her family. She has implied she was abused by her father (and is very vocal about it), and that her mother had been previously addicted to opiates, and now depends on $900 of methadone per week. This information worried me, but Hailey seemed eager to join me and live together, so I never doubted her trustworthiness.


As we begin seeking people and resources to plan this effectively, Hailey tells me her mother just lost her job, meaning she won't be able to contribute to rent until later, possibly after the summer. I inform my parents and we accommodate her accordingly. 


We eventually find a place, which accepts international guarantors. Turns out, Hailey's mother doesn't have satisfactory enough credit to be our guarantor, so I save the day by asking my parents. They agree, but begin to question Hailey's reliability. I strive to defend her, believing she's being honest when she claims she'll pay us back in September. We sign the lease. My family (specifically, my mother) is the only guarantor. Hailey signs the lease as a roommate, implying she also needs to pay for rent, along with me.


This summer, Hailey decides to leave the city while I stay. She talks about trying to find someone to sublet her room, and strangely enough, refers to this as a responsibility for the both of us. My parents were uncomfortable with the idea of me living with a stranger, but i figured that if that would speed up her paying us back, I would have not had a problem. She urges me to work with her to find someone, even though I had other things to deal with (my move, finding an internship, packing to come back home briefly, finals earlier than everyone... You name it). It was always her responsibility to find someone to sublet her room, and when she realized I had my own problems to deal with, she gave up on it. I didn't say anything because then she started talking about having a summer job, which would have helped, and I was not too eager to live with someone I didn't know, so I figured it was going to be fine.


Hailey and I communicate electronically over the summer, and she claims to owe me a certain sum (~8.6k). This includes rent, the application fee (paid for by me), and one of the broker fees. Bear in mind, we paid TWO broker fees along with the first six months, which means that in actuality she would also owe me half of that (bringing our total to 10.9k). However, she had also said she was gonna pay for the other broker fee half later. I have screenshots of all of these conversations on my phone, her saying verbatim ""I owe you THIS much."" 


When she returns, three weeks ago, she tells me she doesn't have enough money for the next six months, and cannot afford that on her own (it was around 14.3k). I tell her that as long as she has the 8.6k, my parents will help. At this point, they're both really reluctant and skeptical that Hailey even has this money, but decide to help me prevent homelessness. Hailey says the money will be there by the second week of September. I tell her that is pivotal because my parents need to receive an international wire transfer, and then transfer it again (which could take more than week, and seeing as rent was due on October 1, I didn't want to risk it.) 


Side note two, my mother and I were the people who organized the entirety of the apartment. We bought groceries, furniture, and made the entire place look homely, since we assumed Hailey could have not afforded it. When she came back, I asked her to let me know when she was using my items (food, international groceries, drinks etc.) she started using my ingredients and also poured herself a drink that I came home to. I said nothing because it didn't bother me at the time, but I should have seen it as a red flag. Also, this girl did not clean up after herself. She washed the dishes regularly, but left her hair in the shower whenever she shaved, (after I asked her not to, since it's my pet peeve).


This takes us to last week. I freak out when I notice that there are pigeon feathers, cockroaches and bugs in the apartment. I take all the necessary precautions and seal openings, clean everyday, and organize as much as I can. This particularly bothers me because I remember that, when we signed the lease, our landlord was proud to show us a certificate claiming they had a history of ""over twenty-years pest-free."" I know unwanted visitors are likely to show up here in the city, but after I was shown that notarized paper, I expected them not to appear as frequently, at least. Let's just say I ended up living in a sty during the summer, and while I was disappointed, I dealt.


The reason for my freak out on Monday is that I spotted a mouse frolicking about outside my room. I can kill insects, but I cannot kill mammals, and the thought of mice touching my shoes and other items made my skin crawl. I wanted to vomit. I call Hailey, who is out, asking for help, and she agrees to contact the landlord. I say ""I mean I can do that too..."" But she doesn't know what else to do, so I just leave her alone. I ended up seeing this mouse again, inside my room, and it starts touching my feet. Utterly disgusted, I call my friend who I was supposed to have lunch with and tell her I will be late (I was very disturbed at the thought of the mouse being around my clothing, and so wanted to wait and see if I could spot it again). Not to mention, I was severely sick with the flu, at the time, and had just come down from a fever, so I was worried about my health and my hygiene.


My friend tells me she's coming over with rat traps and means to kill the mouse (I didn't ask her to.) When she gets to my place, she asks about my roommate. She tells me it's important that Hailey joins us because we have been lied to by the landlord. I realize how much I've been ripped off, so I leave a really angry message at the landlord (not the wisest decision, but I later apologized for it, and was sick, stressed, and felt absolutely lied to and ripped off).


Hailey reluctantly returns, and looks very annoyed. My friend and I set up the traps and look for the mouse as Hailey gets on the phone and talks to someone. She doesn't talk to us or offer us much help. My friend thinks her attitude is weird, but I just leave it alone. The super comes over, but seeing as it is Labor Day, the only work he wants to do is have us buy more traps to set in. Because that seemed useless and ANOTHER waste of money, I tell him that I'm over this, and that I felt like I was spending too much for such a bad deal. We got into an argument over the lack on hygiene and cleaning in the halls (I also spotted feathers in our stairwells for weeks at a time), and he leaves. 


My friend urged me to call exterminators to cover up holes with silicone, and to stay with her in the mean time. I agreed, packed some of my belongings and told Hailey I was leaving for the week. She seemed okay with it.


Later that afternoon, I received a call from my landlord. She said she just spoke to Hailey, who ""had been trying to calm me down for a long time."" I wondered how that could have even happened since Hailey had barely spoken to me or my friend when she returned home. I was surprised about how much she wanted to paint herself in a good light and throw me under the bus, especially when she owed to me all of or appliances and basically rent. The landlord further told me there was nothing to be done about the mouse, and that the document that she showed me in April was still valid. I knew the conversation was going nowhere, so I just ended it and contacted Hailey. I was upset about her lying to he landlord and asked her why this had happened, to which she was very evasive. 


Two days later, I returned home to talk to Hailey. She told me the exterminator would have been there the next day. She tells me the reason she lied was that she thought she was claiming me down by coming back, and proceeded to apologize about divulging false information. I accepted her apology, and also apologized about having been so disturbed. We seem to be okay with each other, until I bring up the money. I tell her that it is now the second week of September, and it's time to pay me back. She tells me she will head to the University's bursar to request them to disburse the loan the following day.


I tell her that my family isn't happy about this, because we can't keep paying for everything, and there's only so much we can do (at this point we'd already given in more than 20k!). And she tells me that she knows, that she wouldn't scam them, and that she will pay us back. She offers herself to talk to my parents, but I claim it's useless because both of them are by no means fluent in English. I give her an ultimatum: the money needs to be here by next Wednesday (next week's Wed), or I will take matters into my own hands. I told her I was gonna start paying for groceries and maintain the apartment, so that she could save the money that she had to pay me back. She didn't seem to have a problem with this, so we agreed.


The next day, the exterminator shows up. He only stays for ten minutes, and doesn't really do anything except for looking around, so I become even more skeptical about the whole thing. Mind you, he apparently appears while Hailey is there (I was in class). 


Two days later, I return to the apartment to get more clothes. Upon coming back, I find a note by Hailey, her stuff gone, and the keys on the table. It reads something like, ""Hey InterruptedOrWhat, I don't think this is going to work out. I fear this will not work. Best of luck finding a new roommate, and throughout the rest of the school year, I wish you the best for your future endeavors."" 


Yes, she still owes me almost $11k.


I can't even see straight, but decide that I will move out. I am now staying at a hotel and finding myself a nicer studio to live in. If I can afford it, I will. I need to stop accommodating people and trusting them. 


I tried contacting Hailey, but she sent me straight to voicemail, never responded my texts about giving me the money back, and just dropped off the face of the earth. I would like to pursue legal action at this point, but I don't know if I should. My parents are worried about how much lawyers would cost, and how Hailey's relations to drugs may associate her family with possible threats in regards to me. I don't believe the latter to be a problem, however, I've been so wrong that even I don't know what to do. We are also not American Citizens, if that is a factor. I just want my money back.


TL; DR: at top."

I told myself I'd post progress pics when I breached 200. I wanted to post it this past Photo Friday but was suck at a frustrating 200.2 that day! I'm sorry Mods for breaking the rules but I didn't want to wait until next Friday. :(

This whole ""making fitness goals and sticking to them"" thing is pretty new to me, so I'm happy to be here.

**[Pics!](http://imgur.com/a/epyRS)** 

My story: I was always a bigger kid, but managed to keep things in check in school via sports. I did a 9-5 internship the summer after high school and started gaining weight due to very available snacks and zero exercise. I remember weighing in at 204 around then when I was 18 (2004). Fast forward a few years later to 2006, I made it down to the 190s (Dance Dance Revolution obsession + not having that much money for food). That didn't last long and I've yoyo'd within the range of 200 - 220 since then. 

In the past few years I made some half-assed attempts at Weight Watchers online and generally ""eating better,"" but never committing to any diet or exercise plan. In May 2014, I moved apartments and noticed when I was packing that I was a lot less flexible than I used to be, wasn't as comfortable getting up and down off the floor, etc. Once we were settled in the new apartment, I bought a scale and weighed in at 223, the highest I've ever been. I had started looking at /r/progresspics and /r/xxfitness around the same time and realized that if all of these strong people could take charge of their bodies and their lives, why couldn't I do the same?

I used MFP lazily over the next year, tracking for a week or 2 and then stopping for several months. During that year's time, I lost about 10 pounds. This summer, I lurked a lot in /r/keto and after seeing all the delicious foods everyone was eating and people's results, I decided to give it a shot. 

I don't follow a super strict keto diet, probably eating around 20-50g carbs a day, those mostly coming from veggies. Other than veggies and occasional fruits, I eat a lot of eggs, chicken, beef, pork, bacon, avocados, cold cuts...and CHEESE! Cheese is probably my favorite food, so any diet that lets me eat it every day and lose weight is a good option for me. :) 

I look at /r/xxketo and /r/progresspics every day, and definitely owe a big amount of my weight loss success to the support of this community and seeing everybody else's commitment and success! Thanks, guys. "

He graduated from college on the 16th of December. We spent every day together from the day we met until the day I had to return to school (2.5hrs away) in January. Then we didn't see each other for a month because of busy schedules, after that we were able to see each other more often. Like over spring break, and at least two weekends a month. In April we saw each other every weekend. 

During this time he started a job and lived at his mothers until he could move out in July. I accepted a job for three months in Alaska for the summer.
Those three months did a lot of damage. He became really depressed because of missing me and his mom causing problems. He became a bit better once he moved out of his mom's but was still not the same and withdrawn. 

About a week before school ended and we parted ways for the summer, he told me he loved me. We said it for about a week until he told me that ""he did not love me and thought he should say it, and if I wanted to break up it was my choice, but he didn't know if he saw a future for us because I was constantly at a distance.""
I cried and was heart broken, things seemed to change from there but I didn't want to give up because I know distance isn't forever.

It got worse over the summer while I was gone, we talked a lot less than we use to and he became very withdrawn.
I came back and stayed at his place and things seemed to get a lot better. But then after about 20 days I had to leave again, this time for an internship 4 hours away that lasts until May.

Things were great the first week, we called and texted...but then I was told about a possible job I could apply for several states away. I asked him what he thought about it and made sure there was a branch of his job near by, but he went quiet. The next day (yesterday) he broke up with me because he ""didn't want to help me back and wanted me to go achieve my dreams.""

He said that if he went with me that would be tying him down and that he had been unhappy for awhile because he realized I was in for a long-term relationship and he wanted to have an exploration phase because he has never gotten to. 
He changed that week before I left, I think it was because it really hurt and he said he ""turned off his feelings.""

Now his feelings have hardened and he says things like the ""tie down"" comment. This is not the man I knew before. I don't understand how he has changed so much. I feel like it is all my fault for leaving, I think I hurt him real bad and it changed him.
I am not sure what to do, because I still want to be with him. I feel like he can still be the man I met in October, but what to do?

We have been discussing an ""open-relationship"" so that he can try that fooling around phase, but still be with me. I just don't know."

During these pre-interview dinners and interviews I feel I will be trying to make up my mind based off of these interactions.

(University Club Scenario),Touch_of_BossaNova,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/3kv2eu/how_to_combat_feelings_of_infatuation_towards/,"In college; I recently joined a new club and I'm looking forward to getting more involved with my school and meeting new friends. There's a girl on the club board who is also in one of my classes too, which I found out after I saw the same girl from the club a day later in my class.


At the 1st event this girl talked to a small group of new members, including myself, for around 15 minutes about the club and opportunities for involvement, internships, etc.; right away it seemed that this girl is a real go-getter, and she seems a bit more interesting a lot of other girls that I've met at my uni. For some reason I think I'm attracted to people that are achievers or go-getters, male or female, in that I like getting to know them and being around them.


Next time we had class I sat next to two empty chairs, and she ended up sitting next to me and we both said ""hi"" to each other, but class was already in session so we didn't talk after that. I was pretty tense and fidgeted a little bit, and I started realizing that it was like having a crush on a girl again, and I haven't had one since early 2013, when I was still in high school.


I kept telling myself there's no logical reason to act up the way I did during class, that ""people are people, not objects or pedestals"", ""there's more to looks and you just met them too"", ""you can't be so immature"", and anything to knock some sense into me.


I'm guessing because she's smart and also a board member of the club, I want to make a good impression, and because we have the same class together it means that there's a chance we can become better friends than just having the club alone, but I know that if I'm having these feelings it's going to mess with my ability to talk to her and get to know her better in a platonic way, and the last thing I want to do is scare this person off.




Any advice on how to just be cool, calm, and confident the next time I see this girl and properly introduce myself? I'm not interested in this girl romantically (at least not right now-it's just infatuation), but my body isn't letting me keep it like that."

Basically, I'm here in Europe till next May and it's a dream of mine to drive on the Nurburgring. Unfortunately since I'm only here for a short period and there's a lot to do in Europe, it's hard to save money especially when I'm only an intern :(. Plan is to save up some money and rent a car from RSRNurburg, but not sure how much I can realistically save (especially with living in Switzerland).

So would anyone be crazy enough to let me drive their car on the 'ring? Or know of anyone who would? Have a C63 back home so not foreign to fast cars - not that I would be doing a time attack or anything, would just like to experience driving on the green hell more than anything.  Not sure when the next time I'll be in Europe is so would really love to make this happen.  If anything, a ride along would be super cool as well.

Cheers :)

Long post.,UnsureOfReality,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3kwhmq/unsure_of_life_afraid_of_future_anxious_of/,"This is my first time posting here and I'm relatively new to reddit. I visit the forum for LoL most of the time. But I created this new account just to post here. I'm venting my frustration and my story of how I ended up where I am now. 


I have been suffering from depression for the past couple of months since graduating back in December. My story starts back when I graduated from college with my BS in Mechanical Engineering. Though I could never admit I was depressed until my Dad pointed it out. I still live with my parents and I am unemployed while attending Masters. My father is currently paying a house he can't pay off before retirement. So I or someone needs to pay it off. My story goes like this:

January - February 2015 [Job searching]
I worked for my internship for 2 months after graduating (about a year in total) before finding a mechanical engineering job. At this time, I was afraid that I might never find a job and I did not want to be that guy who works at an internship for a year after graduating.

I asked my professor about my resume and he ended up forwarding it to an alumni who wanted to hire me. I immediately took the job after the interview. The interview itself was a nightmare. I had 7 interviewers who asked me mechanical engineering questions which I got wrong. I ended up asking what I answered wrong out of curiosity and to make it look like I care about my mistakes (cause I worry about them a lot). The worst part was when the head of engineering and practically the 2nd in command only to the CEO (This is a small company) asked me if this was my first interview. He said ""It shows how inexperience and naive you are. If you don't get the job, no hard feelings"". This made me feel uncomfortable as I've never had anyone tell me that to my face during an interview. I ended up getting an offer 2 days later. I told my internship boss and he was happy for me, even though I could barely explain what the company did. 

February - April 2015 [Working and my role]
I took the job and found it to be super unorganized. My coworkers and fellow engineers told me, ""they're throwing me into the fire because they fired someone who asked for a raise"". I basically had to fill in where the previous guy left off. They were a thermal solutions company which specialized in cabinet coolers and engineering solutions. My role was to model any items which were only drawn by hand and to relabel all the materials/sizes/finishes on the parts. They placed me in R&amp;D 2 weeks in because they never had an R&amp;D department before either. My main focus was to complete the tasks on the Gantt chart while simultaneously performing R&amp;D with my supervisor. I even got a project to work on a customs solution for a customer. 

My supervisor had been telling me to ""milk it"" since every engineer in my department agreed it was terrible working here. I didn't like the idea of milking it, but it made sense a few weeks in. I wanted to perform to be the best, but I hated my boss and I hated how long it took me to get to work. I would wake up at 5am to get stuck in traffic to get to work at 6 AM. Then I wasn't allowed to leave until 3:30 PM due to both parking and how the company operates (The cars were stacked in front of each other so no one could leave until the last guy who parked left first).  Then I get home around 5-5:30 PM on a good day. I felt like I barely had time for anything. I felt unsatisfied because I would spend 3+ hours in traffic for a job I hated. The contract also made me a temp worker until a year in. I can understand the reasoning, but I just didn't feel like a real employee.

[Old habits]
My college habits caught up to me. I would watch youtube videos for hours on end until late 11 or 12. Or I would play LoL until 11 or 12. Or I would masturbate to porn until the same time. This left me sleepy and tired for work the next day. I just couldn't help feeling like I needed stimulation from LoL, porn, or youtube in order to fall asleep for work. I felt like I needed a lot of reward and satisfaction. I couldn't bring myself to put the effort in to try hard for this company that hated and felt like I could lose my job at any moment.

[Signs of trouble]
I fell asleep during a meeting. Granted, the meeting was going nowhere and my boss (the same guy who told me I looked experience) was making fun of other employees. He literally called someone a fatso (despite being fat himself) and asked if he ate too much during lunch, AT A MEETING. I fell asleep, and got called out for it. It was a laughing moment for everyone else, since the meeting was going poorly, but I'm sure it left a horrible impression. 

This is where things went south. My CEO had an idea to make our line of Cabinet coolers safe for dangerous areas. This requires making the steel change from 304 to 316 if I recall correctly. This was an entirely new product line, we needed to perform tests on the new models while designing new parts to replace older parts. To simplify, we needed to make sure everything worked before sending it out. I was assigned to redesign the Brackets which held the Stainless Steel Filter. We decided to make the filter bigger to reduce the shaking found in the normal Cabinet Coolers. This meant ordering new parts and making sure they fit. But here is a list of problems that happened while we were designing:

1. There was no reliable documentation for any testing for ANY PRODUCT
2. All the files were hand drawn and needed to be found to CAD
3. The company that makes the filter brackets were short on the correct steel and sent us samples of another steel (with permission of course). 
4. The steel filter samples were the incorrect size.

Sounds all fine and dandy right? Nope. My CEO decides she doesn't want to be part of the loop/process and decides to make a sale for these new products and she wanted it by the end of the week. The parts weren't coming in until 2 weeks at the earliest. I was sent the Filter samples to inspect for correct size. They were incorrect and I needed to inform the Vendor. But 3 people from 3 different departments came in asking for the part IN MY HAND because THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE ACTUAL piece. I had to explain to them, ""No, this is wrong, it is a sample and the parts will come in next week"". Then my CEO comes in and literally grabs it from my hand saying ""Oh, I need this for the sale on Friday"". I had to stop her to tell her that ""it is the wrong size and not meant for the system"" But I failed to mention that it was a sample. Then she called in my boss  and left afterwards. 

My boss asked me what was wrong with the filters. This is the moment where I fucked up. I was holding a steel filter in my hand. I thought it would be okay to show my frustration at the misunderstandings today by sighing. My intention was to place down the filter and sigh before explaining everything from the start. So I laid down the steel filter on top of other steel filters. BUT it made a loud sound because of their material. Before I could even sigh or say ANYTHING, my boss tells me ""If you don't like it here, you can get out."". Hes usually a dick, since he talks shit about others and would make means jokes like this. But I looked him in the eye and told him ""No, I'm staying, lets talk this out"". My coworker stepped in an explained the situation instead. 

My coworkers took me out to eat and were talking about how badass I was. But I couldn't shake the feeling like I was going to get fired. Sure enough, when the end of the day came, I was called into the office and was handed my termination letter. I asked why and was given the response ""Because you're too stressed out"". My boss walked me out of the building. I was stopped by my supervisor and another engineer. They told me ""don't worry, everything will work out"". They handed me their numbers for references. 


[Depression and worse habits]

April - August

I began to sink into depression. During the first month after being fired, I didn't do anything productive. I basically sat around my room doing 3 things: Watching porn, playing video games, and watching youtube videos on end. I didn't leave my room unless it was for food and bathroom. I didn't search for jobs. I didn't study. I lived with my parents and I hardly spoke to them. I had too much anxiety to look for a job, and even opening my resume made me sweat like mad. I just didn't want to leave my comfort zone. I just wanted to feel good about myself. I wanted to make myself feel good. I didn't want any of it to end. But I was scared of trying and failing. 

It took me a week to write a cover letter because I was just so anxious and scared. I would put things off and procrastinate to no end. I didn't think I was depressed. I can barely tell my own feelings apart. During the second month, I only applied to at most 3 jobs. I felt like shit. I hated myself and I couldnt look myself in the mirror. I had gained weight and I was ashamed of everything. I wanted to cry and kill myself because I was a failure. I was living off my parents and I just couldn't stand the idea of growing old and being unemployed while living with my parents. This fear paralyzed me to no end. 

The next month comes and I get maybe 5 applications out. I knew that the deadline to apply to masters was closing in, so I applied as a back up plan. My dad had always wanted me to get a masters cause he believed I could make 300k with it. I'm pretty sure that is never going to happen, but at this point, it was better then what was happening now. I applied but it took me 2 weeks to do it. 2 weeks of doing nothing but procrastinating. I was scared, scared of trying and failing. So I ended up not trying at all and didn't apply to jobs. 

July comes and I decide to kick it into high gear. I started to apply to 2-3 jobs a day for about a week. But at the end of it all, I caved into my fears and worries. ""Will I ever be successful?, What if I'm not?. Will I live with my parents forever? My parents can't pay the mortgage without help. I don't want to live with my parents even if I found a job. Oh god I can't move out because I have to help them pay the mortgage. What if I don't get a job, will we lose the house? Is this failure at my old job holding me back? Did it screw me over in looking for a new job?. Should I even mention I had a job?. What about the time game between graduation and now??? IT WAS 6 MONTHS AGO!? What do I do? Oh god someone get me out."" I just stopped doing anything and laid in bed. I screamed and cried. I don't remember what happened the rest of that day. All I remember was not wanting to be where I was. I just wanted to stop feeling pain. I thought of suicide but I always came up with painful answers to why I should never do it. ""Because your dad is suicidal, don't give him a reason"" ""Your family would suffer because you couldn't deliver"" ""The end will always be there, why end it now?"" ""Doesn't matter, you're trash anyways"". 

August to present
I was accepted into the masters program and began adding courses. I had to tell my professor I was ""Laid off"" and he said ""Oh shit"". Everytime I'm in class, my thoughts overwhelm me and I can't focus anymore. 

But the tuition after the university grant was 1000 dollars. I only had 3 days to pay and I didn't want to burn my savings anymore then I had already did. My dad wanted to pay for it. He handed me the money, but not before I told him ""I will pay it back when I get a job"". He has a history of people never paying him back, I don't want to be another, especially as his son. He is also suicidial, one day after coming home from school. My mother was crying and my dad was standing and crying as well. I asked what was wrong and he said ""I want to suicide"". I told him ""Thats stupid, it won't accomplish anything"" He held his anger and drove off until the next day. I tried searching for him but to no success. I'm not sure when he came back that day, but I never spoke of it to anyone else except my therapist at school. When he handed me the money, it felt heavy. Like I couldn't bear failing. 

This wraps up the story and leads to the present. I'm worried about my future, worried I'll never get a job, and worried for the sake of my family. I couldn't admit I was depressed until my father told me to Cheer up. something I didn't expect him to say ever. My mother took me to a family friend who was also an engineer to talk about her story. It was in hopes that I would cheer up as well. I felt a little better.

I feel like a failure. I can't do anything right. I've fallen behind in my studies since undergraduate days and I'm playing catch up right now. Some days I wake up and I don't want to do anything, I'm too scared to. I'm paralyzed with fear. I often think about killing myself but I can't bear the pain I will inflict onto others if I do it. 

I don't know who read this. I don't know if anyone read everything. I'm sorry that its so long. But if anyone read this, I wanted to say, Thank you. I didn't know where else to turn. I'm not sure of what I should do. I don't want to make my parents sad. I don't know if I'll get a job. I'm scared to try, I'm scared to fail. "
3kwmtz,2,2015-09-14,I don't know whether I'm abandoning my Dad or doing the right thing. Either way I think I'm in real trouble.,Roc__Ingersol,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3kwmtz/i_dont_know_whether_im_abandoning_my_dad_or_doing/,"I'm potentially about to do something I'm not proud of. But I'm starting to feel I have to put my own needs in front of his because of the circumstances that got me here. I may be an arsehole, but I feel like I'm losing my mind and something has to give, I only hope someone understands.

For context. I've had something of a chequered career thus far for someone at 23 through bad luck and poor decisions, to the point where an interviewer this summer told me I had a history of failure on my CV. It's a remark that's stayed with me as I've tried to do everything in my power to make a success of myself and finally find out exactly what it is I'd like to do with my life.

Throughout the summer I did internships, bar jobs and helped my Dad's business out with a hope of getting the foot in the door in places after middling through life and not really succeeding where I needed to. It paid off. The place I did an internship with offered apprenticeships and were going to sign me up to one. Perfect, I really liked the place in spite of it's poor reputation, the people there, and couldn't wait to get started in spite of the terrible money.

I was working with my Dad at the time temporarily as his business was in trouble, and he was starting to suffer mentally, holding together representing 3 companies including his own as well as a divorce, a house sale with a house falling apart, and the impending serious operation of his new partner. He no longer has any employees after his previous ones tried to stitch him up whilst he was ill. I'd been helping him all summer try and weed through this mess that he'd created through his own poor decisions and hardships, leading him to become something of an anxious wreck. He was obsessed with creating to-do lists that got nothing done, obsessing over every minute detail of how he had been wronged. He wasn't well. He begged me to stay. Told me that he could give me a start in graphic design and marketing through his vast array of contacts and that we'd start all over again as father and son, with me being given Directorship and shares. I felt the opportunity was too good to ignore and turned down the other job, feeling that I could make my mark and I could help take his company back to the point it had once been. But things were only going to get worse.

Through my Dad's desperation he has involved himself as the squeaky clean front of a PLC company full of crooks and shisters, as well as a becoming managing director of another company to cover for the fact that the man behind that one as well is being chased by debt collectors. Oddly enough, as a result, he isn't being paid for any of the work that he's doing for these people and is following them for the promise of ridiculous pay off at the end. He stresses, runs around, works ridiculous hours and never sleeps and I keep telling him to leave these projects alone and focus on starting up his endeavours again, but to absolutely no avail. Of course I had no success. This is a man who doesn't even shut his computer down at night, throws things down when he doesn't need them and then wonders why he loses them. Working with him on anything is really really hard, and the learning opportunities I was really hoping to undertake to fill in the gaps in my knowledge simply are impossible to talk to him about. In fact, I haven't even been paid for any of my work yet. We do a project for the second client and it is an absolute disaster thanks to poor information and my Dad's inability to lead for some reason, my faith in him was really beginning to wane.

I've been doing all I can to suggest new ideas and how we could approach new customers up to this point, even though I've started to become very aware that this isn't what I want to do. That I've in reality made an awful mistake and that this opportunity doesn't really exist. This morning though, he gave me some unbelievable news. He's going to step down, and hand me sole control of the company to go and work with the second client full time. Should I not accept assuming full control of the company then he'll wind the company down.

I don't even really know what to say to him. Whilst I have some experience in this industry from previous roles. I have nothing like the experience to do this by myself, with minimal support and without the drive to do this 24/7 that I'd need to get this off the ground again. I just don't think I can do it.

I'm really upset actually that he begged me to turn down my other job just to do this. It's left me in an incredibly difficult position where I have to start all over again with a patchy CV and having contacted a great many employers I could have worked with over the summer. I may have to start again in a different industry all together. I don't know. I might just be panicking. Either way. I just don't feel like I could single-handedly start a business in this manner. He'll be devastated as he'll feel like I've abandoned him. But I feel like he abandoned me. I've just been left paralysed in the office this morning not really knowing how on earth I'm going to go about fixing this.

TL;DR: My Dad brought me into his business and then sprung on me that he wants me to be sole custodian of it with no other employees here. I'm completely not ready, and feel like I have to quit instead, leaving me with a patchy CV and few prospects."

Copy pasta from my post in another subreddit:
&gt;I'll get the early filters out of the way:

&gt; - our office is in Plano at the Shops at Legacy (Legacy/DNT).  You have to be able to be in the office.
&gt; - We're looking for a minimum of 20 hours a week between the hours of 8am and 6pm M-F.  Working more than 8 hours a day isn't really allowed (so no 10 hour MF schedule unfortunately).
&gt; - You have to be a citizen or have a work visa/EAD.  Unfortunately F1's or H1Bs aren't something we're able to work with right now unless you're really fantastic (honestly if you're awesome, we'll work around it, but understand there's a commitment on our end to do the visa dance and we'll expect a similar commitment from you)

&gt; OK, now to the good stuff:

&gt; - You'll be using a lot of the latest web tech: AngularJS, node (although not necessarily as the backend), gulp, karma, etc.
&gt; - You'll have the opportunity to build hybrid mobile apps: Ionic, cordova
&gt; - You'll be exposed to Microsoft backend technologies (ASP.NET, MVC, WebAPI, etc.)
&gt; - You'll get a handle on SQL Server (queries, database design, sprocs, etc.)
&gt; - Did I mention this is a paid gig?  Most of our interns have worked here for 2+ years before either converting to full time or going elsewhere.

&gt; If you're interested, shoot me a pm and I'll send you my email.  Ideally you'll have code samples (github, sites, code samples emailed directly, etc.) so that we have something to base where you're at right now.

&gt; We're interviewing candidates on Friday.  So if you're interested, make haste."

The first job was given to an intern, the second was between me and another person but the other guy had direct experience in one test that I didn't. This one test is completely automated so I believe the experience in it is a moot point.

There was another job posting for the same position and I was told that there was another intern who has been there for two years and has just graduated. Here is a little about me.

I have been working in a nationally accredited lab for 5 years come October and have plenty of experience for the position, the one hang up I keep having is they have interns that are a seemingly easy hire. They don't have to worry about personality or work ethic because they already know how they work, and they have experience working the position.

Some more background: I have a Bachelors of Science, the position only requires an associates and one year of experience in a certified lab. The company has extremely good benefits and pay, many times better than my current company which is why I am interested. I know higher up positions at the company that I would also be a good fit for but they only hire people from within their company. I would like to get my foot in the door, and they have never mentioned anything to me about being overqualified, but they always go with an intern because of the ease of that situation.

Want I want to know is what I can tell them to convince them I am a better choice for the position? Or is there really nothing I can do?"

Right now I am lost as to what type of jobs I should be going after as far as it pertains to accounting. I have virtually no accounting experience, so would I even be qualified to apply for a position such as a staff accountant? Would it be wiser just to apply for internship positions as well.

Second question is that I am currently searching for jobs through indeed, school's career services, school job board, friends, is there anywhere else I should be looking?

A couple summers ago I became very good platonic friends with a girl in my friend group. I live in New York City and she was here on an internship from a different state. She had a boyfriend of 6 years back home which kept both of us from any romantic feelings towards each other for a long time. It was the kind of relationship where I would have one night stands or little flings, while she was the constant female in my life that I would grab drinks with or go see a movie with. By the end of last summer, she started to have a rough patch with her boyfriend and they broke up, which led to me kind of realizing I had feelings for her, but her internship was over and she went home before anything happened between us.

About 8 months go by and she gets back together with her boyfriend, while I start dating a new girl. She comes back this summer to work, and we kicked off our friendship again in full force. We would even do things as a group with my girlfriend at the time. But everything changed about 3 weeks ago.

We went out one night and ended up getting into a very serious and intense series of events that led to us basically turning into Bonnie and Clyde for a night. The night ended with her and I having sex and telling each other we loved each other and that we had feelings for each other the whole time. Which Im realizing was very true. We had a very ""Jim and Pam from The Office"" kind of relationship where we obviously had a secret crush on each other which drove our close friendship and where all of our friends always rooted for us to be together. I had broken up with my girlfriend a couple weeks before so I didnt feel wrong about it, but she was still in a relationship so she felt conflicted about it. Her boyfriend was only the only guy she has had sex with for 6-7 years so I think she really surprised herself by having sex with me and not feeling sorry for it. We hung out sparingly the next 2 weeks because of our schedules, but this week we have hung out and basically been quasi boyfriend and girlfriend for about 5 days straight.

Here's where the confusion comes in; Saturday night she told me that she was breaking up with her boyfriend but was waiting until the beginning of October to tell him in person because she owed him that much (they were in a long distance relationship the whole summer). But I swear he could sense that and he ended up writing her an epic ""its now or never"" email about their relationship. She got very guilty about everything and went noticeably cold towards me. I think she was thinking she was going to just ride everything out for a month and then break up with him, but now shes realizing the reality of the fact that she's hurting him, having an affair which is making her guilty, and building a relationship with me which is'nt fair while she has a boyfriend still. So she's having to make her decision right now instead. We left things off last night on good terms with her and i, but things also felt cold and up in the air.

So does anyone have any advice for me? Part of me wants to stay invested because this is one of my best friends in the world, and the feelings are real, but it also feels like the timing is off. I also dont know if i should just back off and let us be distant for a second, go back to just being friends, or to make more of an effort to be romantic towards her because I do want it to work out in the long run.

Thanks!

P.s. There is a lot of this story that I am leaving out, but her and I have a lot of history and memories together, so it's not as crazy for us to have fallen in love as this short version might suggest. If anything, the fact that we finally said it to each other was probably one of the bigger moments in our lives within the past few years.

tl;dr 
Got involved in an affair with my best friend. The hammer is finally dropping on us and its making the entire situation awkward and I dont know how to handle it. Also, I love her."

_______

**Brandenburg, Germany**

Most people would feel pretty nervous about meeting the leader of the country, but Jurgen Kruger-Wolfe somehow kept up his usual smug look, as he stood in the mirror and made some final adjustments to his outfit. The circumstances of the situation would make most nervous too, but Jurgen was strange in that he didn’t really get nervous, a skill that had helped him a lot in politics. Thirty nine, he was about to officially become the President of Germany, and he knew that confidence was key in these kinds of things.

Perception was reality and Jurgen got away with acting like he knew a lot of things he didn’t really know about simply by acting as if he did, which all came back to being confident in himself, and now that trademark confidence had landed him the job as President, after winning an election with seventy percent of the vote. 

“The meeting is in thirty minutes, we should be going,” said Jurgen’s assistant, a political intern named Liza. 

“I’m aware,” replied Jurgen, nodding. He was wearing a casual outfit, the same one he had worn to the recent press conference. Black jeans, a tight black sweatshirt, and a skullcap that had a small Dynamo Dresden logo on one side. Not what you’d expect a politician to wear, and definitely not to a big meeting like this, with Edmund Dieter. But Jurgen wasn’t just any politician.

Originally born in Munich, he’d got his political start in Monaco, learning the ropes in that tiny little city state before becoming a big player in German politics and eventually becoming a Member of Parliament and representing the right wing of politics in Germany. With no real major right wing opposition party, the center right had rallied around Jurgen, helping him to a successful Presidential election. His charisma played a big role in that too, and many thought that he would be the most powerful person in Monaco had he stayed there. 

__________

As the taxi pulled up to the golf course where he would be meeting Dieter, Jurgen checked his watch. He was one minute late, but that was fine. Being slightly late made someone more anticipated when they finally did arrive.

“Ah, there you are,” said Dieter as Jurgen approached the course. “A minute late, but better late than never I suppose.”

“Fashionably late I guess,” chuckled Jurgen. “I’m pleased to be working with you now, I’m Jurgen Kruger-Wolfe, but everyone close to me just calls me Wolf.”

“With that beard of yours, it almost seems fitting,” laughed Dieter. “You already know who I am.”

“Yes, I’ve heard a lot about you,” replied Jurgen, examining a golf club in his hand. 

“I could say the same about you and your exploits in Monaco before coming back home to Germany,” said Dieter. “We’ll work well together if you do as good as you did there.”

“I will, Chancellor. Don’t worry, I definitely will,” said Jurgen with a chuckle, and that was something he truly believed.

3kydkj,3,2015-09-14,I denied being depressed until today,throwawaydepressedon,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3kydkj/i_denied_being_depressed_until_today/,"I have a lot of fun on the weekends with my friends in my home town. I recently graduated from college and am currently unemployed, hopelessly searching for unpaid internships to gain experience for graduate school (which I'll talk about in a moment). The perks of a Bachelor of Arts, right? 

Things took a turn for the worst this year. I can definitely say it has been the worst of my life. After scouting graduate schools with my then girlfriend last fall and winter, we made a decision to go together. Her family is very religious, which doesn't bother me, though I am not. After hearing of our plan to move away together, her family pressured her to cancel it and stay at home. She shouldn't be running away with some atheist, childfree guy. I don't blame her family though. I blame her for falling victim to their influences. 

Anyway, this led to the demise of our relationship essentially. We stayed together for a few months after, but there was always the elephant in the room that our futures weren't set to align. She broke up with me on Valentines Day. I don't know if I've even gotten over it honestly. It ended pretty badly. Of course she wanted to be friends, because she was the one who did the breaking up. I said no.

A month later, I found out that I was declined from all of my graduate school choices anyway. Kind of ironic, given the breakup conditions, really.

I've spent the summer attempting to apply for jobs that I'm not interested in to stay afloat while I get my life together. I am still interested in graduate school. I've had no luck on the job hunt (though I'm not surprised with a BA). I have had a couple interviews for unpaid internships, which will help me in the long run.

On top of all of this, I have the stereotypical hard working, conservative parents that suggest the solution to my career problems is to ""buckle down"" and work at gas stations. 

Just to sum things up, within the last six months, I've been dumped, declined to graduate school, became unemployed, face financial doom and have no support from my family.

I didn't realize that I was depressed until today. I spent the weekend with my friends and had an amazing time, as we always do. The minute I got home, I felt my stomach sink and my attitude become incredibly hopeless. I've spent all day in my room, crying like a child. 

The little money that I have left I am about to wager on graduate school again and I really can't foresee happiness for myself any time soon. I'm stuck in my shitty high school home town in my parents house while unemployed. I'm starting to think of just ending it all. 

You're told constantly growing up that you can do whatever you want. The truth is you can't. Unless you are in the STEM field, you face daunting adversity in the attempt to find a job with the degree you decide to pursue. I wouldn't change what I did for the world because it is what I wanted; it's my passion. But I can't help but feel cheated by doing so.

Thank you for listening."

I worked up a decent algorithm in python and am in the process of writing up a white-paper to describe the process. 

Part of the algorithm uses combination and permutations to generate geometry. The code basically does the following (simplified for demonstration):

&gt;{a,b,c}, {d,e,f}, {g,h,i}, {j,k,l}, {m,n,o}

&gt;for each set, one letter is taken to create a list of characters (ie. a,d,h,l,n). Only one letter from each set is allowed, and the resulting list must include one letter from each set, and the list must maintain the same order of the set list (first position must be a, b or c; second position d, e, or f, etc). Each letter represents a unique item, there are no repetitions. All possible permutations are created using these rules. 

I think that covers it. I was hoping someone could help me work out how to write the formula for this type of permutation. I literally know enough about permutation formulas to know that they exist, but would really like to figure this part out, since I don't like the idea of putting this out there without at least grasping the math behind it.

The reason for me thinking this is that for the past months of Kevin being the editor for Game Grumps, he has not made a good impression among a good bunch of the fans. I guess it is justified when you compare his work to that of Barry, but if you just want to judge his work as just an editor of a show, he is doing a good job, in my eyes. I don't care if you think he is funny or not. I only care about two things with an episode: Can I watch it? Is the audio balanced well and synched to the video?


Although, he has made many mistakes. MANY mistakes with these two points. Which begs the question, is Kevin lazy, or too busy?


Let's look at some points of why he could be considered lazy or busy:


**1. LAZY: He has clearly stated that he has free time when editing.**


Kevin, in the [Grumps Q&amp;A - Part 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L8GPhCT8QI), said that he has a lot of free time on his hands when editing and between editing videos. Now, this could mean two things. One, he has time between recording sessions and he uses his time to do whatever he pleases, instead of doing a quality edit. OR, he has time while videos are rendering. Rendering is considered by Let's Players to be one of the most time consuming and tedious parts of the YouTube scene. Kevin has also posted a video to his instagram where he is playing pinball to pass the time while videos render which could mean that rendering is taking up most of his time.


**2. LAZY: He is among friends who will not chastise him for poor work.**


Kevin, obviously, gets along with everybody and he is good friends with them. So, you could say, why would he try? Why would he try to do good work if it doesn't feel warranted? You could be right. He could be slacking off due to his friendships with the Grumps. He could be doing just the bare minimum because he is doing his job, just not well. But, he knows that his friends wouldn't insult a guy who is their friend because this could lead to friction and argument among the guys. You could also say that maybe. The truth is, you can't really know for sure.


**3. BUSY: He has other obligations.**


Kevin has said in the Q&amp;A video that during his free time he also does freelancing, which means that he is doing work for other companies, while also working for the Grumps. This could be something that is taking up a lot of time as well. Maybe Kevin is having trouble balancing his time with editing videos and freelancing. But, it also raises another point, If Kevin is too busy with editing and freelancing, why does he freelance? Why doesn't he just say NO?


**4: BOTH: They have an intern.**


Jack, their bashful, Irish, well-spoken intern seems like a really swell guy. So... my question is, what the hell does that guy do for them? Does he edit? Does he work in business with Suzy? Does he help with set-up and maintenance? I mean, this guy has made like 4 appearances on the channel now and we still don't know anything about him except he is the Irish intern. If he does help with editing, like uploading and thumbnails, then you could say that Kevin is getting a little lazy. But, if he isn't editing, then they should at least verse him in a little bit of design and editing to lift a bit of the load off of Kevin's back.


**5: BOTH: He is not as passionate as Barry.**


Kevin, to be honest, does not take his job as seriously as Barry did. And I don't blame him. This is his job. That's what he signed up for, a job, and that's how he is going to treat it. So it would be hard to find a passion in your day job. Day job's are tedious to some and a bore. If that is the case then, why is Kevin an editor? If he likes editing then that means he should put his time into editing more. The reason that Barry was such a good editor was because his job probably did not feel like a job. He was new to the experience and did not go to school, like Kevin did. So, he probably felt like sprinkling in special edits was a way for him to feel like a part of the experience. To Kevin, he probably does not see editing the way Barry does, and we probably should not hold that too him.


I am open to any opinions and discussion about this topic. To me, I want to believe that Kevin is trying his hardest at his job because he seems like a really good kid and he tries hard at what he does, but due to other obligations and time constraints, he makes many mistakes that misleads people to believe that he is lazy and doesn't care about his job."
3kzpmr,1,2015-09-14,I don't know what's wrong with me anymore.,drakathaz,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3kzpmr/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me_anymore/,"Well, this is a somewhat'ish long story, that I'll try to keep concise. Back last September, I met the girl who I thought I would marry. I'm not the type to fall deep into love without giving it good thought, nor was the girl who I was with. It was the best relationship of my life until January. During our second date in September, girlfriend of the time had a skype interview with a NGO from Nicaragua. Little did I know she would end up accepting a 10 month internship in Nicaragua. Well, things became pretty serious between our starting to date in October and her shipping out in late November. Something changed in January though. She stopped talking about our future and became a completely different person. She understood my emotions, but it was as if she didn't care. Essentially, she turned into a complete narcissist. Any time I spoke to her about my emotions, she would flip the subject on me and make me feel like shit. My attendance in law school suffered, as did my personal life.

Finally, in March I had a trip planned to see her. I had saved up money while being in graduate school in order to visit her. Little did I know the trip would up being a mixed bag of emotions. While we dated in the US, she was a very affectionate and loving person. When I met her in Nicaragua, she was a cold, inhumane person. She kept telling me all the way from January, that ""she hadn't changed, and this is who she was."" The only thing is that everything pointed to the contrary because she was such a great girlfriend. During the trip I broke down multiple times because she refused to show my affection while she on her period. Moreover, it was just the fact that she was the first girl I related sexual experiences with love. In essence, she was withholding love from me and it destroyed me. I came home from the vacation feeling like although there were problems, that we could sort them out and make things work. After two weeks of her acting completely strange, we broke up. I was on hydrocodone at the time because of back pain caused by a car accident the year before - it was the only reason I even made it through things. 

After the breakup, I tried to become friends with my ex at her insistence. I remember specifically her telling me that she loved me when we broke up. It was a ""mutual"" breakup so she would feel better about kamizakazing our relationship. I was pushed to my breaking point to break up with her. I wasn't ready for it, nor did I want it. Alas, a few days after we broke up she posted something on Facebook about it being ""National Kissing Day."" She wrote (roughly translated into English), for those of you who are married, kiss your loved one - for those of you who are dating someone and love them, give them a special kiss - for all of us searching for god's special love, you will find your special kiss. Now, this completely destroyed me because it went contrary to everything my ex spoke to me about. I confronted her about it, and the issue was completely turned against me. After this issue, I came down with mono. However, because of my depression, and the lack of a sore throat for three weeks, I took it as lymphoma. If I wasn't depressed I'm sure I would have been more rational, but frankly I couldn't deal with it at the time.

Fast forward two weeks or so. I try to ""maintain"" a friendship with my ex. She hasn't messaged me on her own since we broke up and she is completely uncooperative since we broke up. Additionally, the first message she sends to me in two weeks says ""y did u delete me on FB."" After she knew I was suffering with lymphoma like symptoms and going crazy. She didn't even give a shit enough to ask me how I was doing. At this point, and while on an anti-depressant for a week I realized what a piece of shit she was. I told her off and cut complete contact with her for six months.

In June, I had a double jaw surgery that changed my appearance quite a bit. I was already a somewhat attractive guy, but I became pretty confident in my appearance at this point. After the surgery all was going well. However, approximately three weeks later I developed what I learned would be an aneurysm in the artery in my nose.

Over the course of a week, I lost nearly half my blood during arterial nosebleeds that would last two to three hours. At this time, I begged my ""best friend"" to come visit me at my house because my parents refused to let me go out when I was pouring blood from my nose at random times. My so called ""best friend"" never came - because he was to busy with his new girlfriend. Yet, when he was in trouble I was always by his side, oh the irony.

The great part about my surgery is I was on oxycodone the entire time. That chronic back pain I felt from the car accident was gone. I was a fully functional person who could exercise and enjoy myself for the first time in two years. However, the oxycodone eventually ran out and the pain came back. I have had cortisone shots done which have fixed absolutely nothing in my back. At this point I'm at a loss for words because I don't think anything will fix my back.

Overall, I've been left with chronic back pain, lost multiple best friends because I've learned what jerk-offs they were, and lost a girl I thought I would marry. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. In May, my anti-depressants and medicine were working amazingly - I was never upset and was able to deal with my problems. In mid-August, everything stopped working and I fell into a deep depression again. Alas, I'm stills stuck in this depression and here I am. I don't know what I'm looking for, but I needed to vent."

                            McDonald's Madness
                             by Kiriakos Vilchez
     
I slowly brought my beat-up sedan to a halt as I waited for one of the McDonald's employees to hand me my calorie-rich grub. As I sat there, drumming my fingers on the steering wheel and watching the young lady speak to a fellow co-worker hastily putting together my meal, I wondered to myself whether my regular trips to the Golden Arches had gotten out of hand. I was by no means one of those typical fast food junkies who raced to the nearest Wendy's or Burger King on a daily basis, but I did seem to gravitate towards eating at McDonald's at least twice a week. My hectic schedule as a full-time college student had me bouncing between my nonprofit internship and classes daily, so McDonald's was the easy answer when I wanted a quick meal for cheap. My favorite location was en route on my way home from work, so it was extremely convenient, albeit the obvious health risks of consuming Big Macs and McNuggets regularly.


A jovial laugh brought me out of my self-reflection, and I quickly turned to the drive-thru window. I nearly jumped out of my seat when the bright, smiling face of Ronald McDonald greeted me. The popular clown mascot held out my meal in a large, slightly greasy paper bag with the signature Golden Arches logo splattered on the front, accompanied by a small drink. I quickly took them from him, giving him a warm smile, even if his cemented grin seemed to disturb me a bit.


 “Thank you very much Ronald,” I said, pondering where in the world the young lady and her co-worker went as I stared at the clown.


He gave me an animated wave, “No problem buddy. Thank you for visiting McDonald's today!”


I nodded in return and pressed on the gas, still feeling Ronald McDonald gaze at me as I drove off. As I looked in the rear view mirror, I could see that he continued to watch me as I left, still beaming. I refocused my attention to the road and shook my head. In the years upon years of going to McDonald's, even in different parts of the country, I had never seen the iconic mascot in person at any location. It just seemed so out of place to see him at this specific location, but I figured it was one of those rare appearances he made. It didn't make the encounter any less unsettling however. Weird, I thought, glancing at my food sitting on the seat next to me. Very weird.


Approaching my house, I noticed that my dad's Lexus was absent from the driveway. Realization sparked through my mind instantly as I remembered both he and my mom mentioned they would pay a visit to my grandma a few miles away, helping her with a few things around her apartment. I pulled into the driveway, turning off my headlights as I sighed. I snatched up my backpack from the backseat and picked up my meal, heading into the house.


Upon entering, I noticed that my parents had oddly left all the lights off. It was normal for them to leave a few lights on, like the main fixture in the kitchen or the decorative lamp in the living room when leaving the house, so being met by an abyss-like darkness as I came through the front door was a little scary. Carefully watching my step as I knew our inquisitive cat Spooks would be investigating the unknown person coming inside, I felt the little cat gently graze my leg and purr softly, and I gingerly stepped around the feline.


 “Hey Spooks,” I said, feeling the tabby mewl in acknowledgment, recognizing that his human friend had come home. I sidestepped his small form and found my way to the large lamp next to the couch, and quickly flicked on the switch. The living room was bathed in the warm glow of the lamp, and I plopped down on the couch, eager to dig into my food.


My father had apparently been watching the news before my parents left, because when I switched on the television it was on his favorite channel, MSNBC, and one of those run-of-the-mill pundits was sounding off on some hot button issue. I zoned out their politically charged diatribe as I opened my McDonald's bag and felt around its contents. I unwrapped my Big Mac and took a bit bite, watching the lady on TV show footage of a gray-haired congressman from Georgia she apparently hated with all of her being by the way she described his ideologies. As she spoke about the congressman's hawkish position on foreign policy, I reached into the bag for some fries when I was surprised to find something underneath the red fry carton, at the very bottom in a jumble of napkins and ketchup packets. My fingers grasped the object, thinking it was a Happy Meal toy mistakenly placed with my order, and took it out of the bag.

 
Curiously, I found that it was not a licensed toy of any kind, but a simple CD in a plastic case. I unwrapped it and turned it over in my hand. Written on it in what appeared to be black Sharpie ink were the words: McDonald's Madness. I flipped it over, trying to decipher whether it said anything else as a DVD movie would, like a copyright symbol or year or even a small McDonald's logo hidden somewhere, but there was nothing. “What the heck is this?”


Deciding that maybe somebody clearly had put it in my bag as some weak attempt at an unexpected gag at a customer's expense, I set it down without another thought. I didn't want to entertain the idea of figuring it out, but the more I ate and tried to ignore the disc, my curiosity became overwhelming, my interest piqued to the fullest extent, and the DVD player underneath the flat screen begged me to insert the mysterious disc.


 “Let's just see what you are,” I said aloud, jumping off the couch and inserting the disc. To my surprise, the screen turned blue and then a DVD-like menu was juxtaposed across my screen. I quickly sat down for a better look, and saw that McDonald's Madness was indeed a movie of some sort, the bold words displayed over an image of the classic McDonaldland character Grimace holding a hamburger. The only option on the menu was “Play Me.”


I chuckled. “Alrighty then.” I pressed on the play function, and the film began. I munched on a few fries, slurping my soda as the screen suddenly turned black. After a few moments, I could see a door materialize in the center of the screen. A door plastered with pictures drawn in crayon by children. The door slowly opened, and the camera panned to the far right corner of what looked like a hospital room. The next thing I saw caused me to stand up immediately in alarm, dread coursing through my body as I covered my mouth in horror.


 In the corner of the room was a man, bound and gagged, sitting on a stool with his hands tied behind his back. He shook with terror as he gazed with bloodshot eyes at whomever stood in front of him, his legs quivering terribly, either in shock or in a feeble attempt to break the bonds that held his ankles together. Before long, others came into view, and I realized something very disturbing was occurring before my very eyes.


In the frame strolled a demented looking Ronald McDonald, accompanied by Grimace and the Hamburglar. Ronald held a shiny meat cleaver, and pointed at the camera with it. He motioned to the camera watching them, as if making sure that the man understood that they were being filmed. He diverted his attention back to the terrified man, and hopped ridiculously close to him. He slowly pulled out the rag that had been shoved into the man's mouth, and tossed it aside as he chuckled, tapping the man on the head playfully.


The man looked upon Ronald with a mixture of fear and sorrow. “I'm...I'm sorry. I will go back! I promise! Please, just me go! For God's sake, think of my family!”


Ronald laughed and turned to Grimace. “What do you say fellas? Should we let Mr. Harris go?”


Grimace and the Hamburglar seemed to ponder the notion for a moment, weighing their decision heavily as they looked at Mr. Harris.


 “WELL!” Ronald barked.


The tone in his voice made me jump, as well as his costumed accomplices in the video, because they seemed startled as well, quickly shaking their heads. Ronald nodded hysterically, pointing his weapon at Mr. Harris. I watched as he held the meat cleaver dangerously close to the man's neck, causing Mr. Harris to quiver.


 “See? We can't just let you go! No sir! It's too late now!”


Mr. Harris, whether it was sweat or tears pouring down his bearded face, shuddered as he sat there, trying to speak through sporadic sobs and coughing fits. “Please...please...I didn't do anything wrong. I've been good to this company.”


This company? Whomever that man was, he must have worked for McDonald's in some way, and this sick, twisted treatment...this deplorable display of inhumanity...was his punishment? For what? What could this man have done to deserve this!

 
Ronald McDonald let out a hearty guffaw. “Oh, you have been good to us? Are you sure about that Mr. Harris? I wouldn't say that now, considering what you did to my company.”


Mr. Harris snarled angrily, the last of the crackling embers of fire that remained within his being exploding from his person, showing Ronald he still had fight in him. “ No! I didn't do a damn thing! It was you-” he motioned to the other McDonaldland characters- “and these freaks that did this company wrong! What you have done is inexcusable! That's why I left McDonald's! To let people know the truth!”


Ronald, almost like a King Cobra striking the air between its position and its prey, got up close to Mr. Harris's face, nose-to-nose with the man. He ran the cleaver through Mr. Harris's disheveled salt-and-pepper hair, grinning deviously. “That's enough for us to act Mr. Harris. You know that. You knew that the moment you signed up to become our corporate spin doctor. You knew you'd uncover things, well, unsavory in nature. Things better left unknown to many and kept secret by a few. Don't you agree with that Mr. Harris?”


My eyes glued to the screen, I sat there on the couch, too terrified to look away. Waiting to hear the corporate hostage's response. The man seemed to wither under the forceful presence of Ronald, the weight of his words simmering in his thoughts. After a few moments of silence, Mr. Harris looked at Ronald, his bottom lip quivering. “The employees...the food...the children.""


I almost screamed when Ronald suddenly slapped Mr. Harris up the side of his head, causing the man to bellow with pain. He continued his attack until the man's eyes rolled in his head from extreme disorientation, coughing uncontrollably from the severe beating. Ronald heaved as he stared at Mr. Harris, his crazed eyes infuriated, primal rage etched across his painted face. He was completely silent yet his face furiously contorted as if he were ready to explode.

 
I cried out in surprise as my cell phone suddenly rang in my backpack, and I retrieved it like it was C-4 ready to incinerate me had I not gotten to it sooner. My mom's smiling face greeted me on the screen, and I swiped the bar on the screen to answer the call, clearing my throat as I tried to avoid looking at the disturbing image of Ronald still frozen in place, looking at the beaten man.


 “Hey...hey Mom,” I said weakly, trying to retain my composure.

 
“Hey sweetie, just wanted to let you know we're on our way home. Grandma says she loves you and misses you. She wants you to call her tomorrow to catch up.”


I tried looking away from the screen, standing up and turning my back on the television and the disturbing show I was unfortunately witnessing. I pressed the phone to my ear. “Oh, okay Mom. I miss her and love her too. And yes, I will do that. I guess I will see you guys soon?”


 “Okay honey, see you in a bit. Love you.”


 “Love you too Mom,” I responded, anxious to see my parents' faces soon.


I heard her hang up, and I sighed. I slowly refocused my attention on the television screen, and could now see that the McDonaldland gang was gone. Mr Harris sat there, head hanging, sobbing quietly. My eyes darted back and forth, looking for any sign of the disturbed trio, yet he was alone in the hospital room. Mr. Harris slowly raised his head. 


 ""Please...you don't have to let them do this....just let me go. Let me go home to my family..."" he pleaded. 


I could hear whomever was filming clear his throat, about to speak, when Ronald suddenly popped up in front of the screen, causing me to scream aloud. Ronald giggled and skipped back over to the sobbing executive. 


 ""Oh, hush now Mr. Harris, this is almost over. We're almost done here."" 


Mr. Harris whimpered, and sighed heavily. ""Please...I'm begging you...for the love of God, don't do this..."" 


Ronald eyed the man, possibly considering the man's last plea for salvation. I watched the clown gaze at Mr. Harris for the longest time, before motioning to Grimace and the Hamburglar, and they slowly approached their manic leader. He felt their presence behind him, and smiled, grabbing the executive's chin. 


""I'm so sorry Mr. Harris...it just has to be this way.""


I gasped when I saw Ronald McDonald raise the cleaver, and deliver a sickening blow to the man's neck, blood splattering across the clown's face. Ronald McDonald giggled, and handed the bloody weapon to one of his cohorts. I watched in horror as they all stood next to a hysterical Mr. Harris, taking turns hacking the man in the neck over and over and over! Harris made sickening gurgling noises and shook uncontrollably as they knocked him off the stool and onto the hard, checkered floor. Within moments, with the Hamburglar delivering the final blow, they cut the man's head clean off, kicking it to the side as they all laughed maniacally.


Feeling bile rise in my throat, I quickly ran over to the kitchen sink and wretched, chunks of vomit splattering in the chrome basin. I panted and wiped my mouth, splashing water on my face as I held myself up. Letting the water continue to run to send my throw-up down the drain, I struggled to keep my legs from failing, shock coursing through my body. What the hell did I just watch?! That poor man was murdered by those unmerciful costumed freaks!


I slowly walked back to the living room, and on the screen I could see that all three of the McDonaldland characters stood over the decapitated executive, completely silent. Like roving cameras, they slowly swiveled their heads to face me. Unable to move by the sheer creepiness of their demeanor, I stared back at them, waiting for something to happen.


For a moment, it felt as if I looked back at mannequins-at unmoving, artificial figures frozen in time on screen. Ronald McDonald's waxy face seemed even more fake than his costumed accomplices, appearing to be made of shiny plastic like a Happy Meal toy. Grimace and the Hamburglar stood on either side of the clown, their hands at their sides like goofy sentinels. Then just like that, the disturbing image faded to black. I stood there, shaken to the core, trying to comprehend the sickening event that had just transpired. After a minute or two, I retrieved the twisted home movie from the DVD player and sat down, barely able to hold onto the evil disc.


Whatever this film was, I knew that I was not supposed to have seen it. What McDonald's Madness was was a murder caught on tape, a diabolical brutal murder encouraged by McDonald's. As I contemplated this, it became apparent that not only was  this insane, but deceptively cunning as well. Absolutely nobody would believe this horror tale of corporate-sponsored manslaughter. Yet, I did have the disc. The one piece of evidence that could validate the entire morbid story...


The distinct sound of the deadbolt being slid out of its locked position on the front door caused me to leap into the air, uttering a low cry. When I saw it was my parents juggling groceries, a wave of relief washing over me. Quickly placing the disc in the crumpled McDonald's bag, I walked over to them.


 “Hey guys,” I said weakly, trying to hide the obvious look of fear upon my pale face. 


With one look, they could both tell that something was very wrong. Concern dominating their expressions, they questioned me extensively, trying to see what was the matter. That's when I showed them the mysterious disc I had been given, and I played the gruesome film once more. Within moments of watching it, my mother pulled me aside as my father called the police.


When McDonald's Madness was viewed by the police department, they identified Mr. Harris as former McDonald's public relations executive Charles Thomas Harris, who had gone missing on a boating trip in 2007. During his trip, a large storm was said to have claimed his life and two of his comrades, capsizing their boat in the Gulf of Mexico. With this sickening film, they now knew something more sinister was behind the man's unexpected demise.


Within the next few weeks, my parents and I were questioned thoroughly not only by the local police department, but by the FBI as well. The incriminating evidence I had stumbled upon opened up a can of worms, and it all suspiciously led back to McDonald's. They raided the franchise location I had the misfortune of receiving the movie from, and launched an internal investigation against the McDonald's corporation.


I wish I could tell you that the police prevailed in finding who killed this poor man and that justice was served, however, nothing came out of their crusade against McDonald's. Nothing. I was dumbfounded when I discovered that McDonald's was found to be completely innocent, with no further action brought against the fast food giant. The federal investigation had become a futile government attempt to fault McDonald's, and was labeled as so by the media. The family of Charles Harris were most affected by the whole thing, and struggled to cope with the grisly revelation thrown in their faces years after the man's death.


The one thing that never came out of the entire investigation was what Harris was talking about in the movie. The employees and food and children. Law enforcement never found out what he was referring to, and McDonald's lawyers had no comment on the man's odd allegations against the company. In the end, McDonald's walked away clean as a whistle, like the whole thing never happened.


I can't say for sure what McDonald's really did that Harris discovered, but what I can say is what happened on that film. And my family and I saw with our own eyes a man tortured and murdered by some crazy McDonald's cult carrying out some form of twisted justice upon the supposed company traitor. That this giant corporation was somehow behind this sick plot to cover something up that this man knew.


As I think of all this today, I am thankful that the authorities kept our identities confidential, yet I have a firm belief that the damage has been done. That McDonald's is coming after my family. How do I know this? Well, I feel like we're being watched. Whether it be going about our daily lives, or right here at home, I can feel this sinister presence waiting in the wings-waiting to take action against us.


I don't know if I will truly ever feel safe after McDonald's Madness, but I do know is that I will never look at the Golden Arches the same again. And I also know that whomever recorded the movie and the person who slipped the disc into my meal, wanted the truth to get out somehow. I sometimes ponder if maybe the Ronald McDonald who gave me my meal was actually the good guy, that he was somehow behind releasing the movie. I still wonder if maybe he escaped the clutches of McDonald's, or maybe they already got to him also.


If anything it taken away from this tale, it is this: somewhere, somebody knows the entire truth behind the death of Charles Harris and what the company is hiding, and I pray that that person is alive. Alive and figuring out what move to take next against this facade of an All-American fast food company that caters to people from all walks of life, especially children. Chipping away at their colorful, kind walls of community and goodwill that McDonald's hides behind, hopefully one day showing the world, that McDonald's is much worse than we previously feared...

At first, I don't believe them. But then, around a week after she broke up with me, she calls me and tells me she is in a new relationship with someone else. 

I was pretty devastated. I didn't know anyone in the city I was in and I lived alone in an apartment ... the breakup hit me pretty bad. Over the summer, I thought I got over it. I was wrong. When I got back to school this year, I found out I have two classes with her.  I can't stop thinking about her. I can't get rid of that feeling of loneliness and anger and sadness in my gut even though I am surrounded by friends. 

I don't know what to do. I want to focus on school and my fraternity but I can't. I can't avoid her. I can't not see her and her new boyfriend every other day. I can't cut her out. I feel hopeless.

Last year they did Military as well as Testicular Cancer jerseys in support of a foundation their team manager “Part-time” Joe Vicario started.   
 
**Band:** *The Best Pep Band in the Land* is RIT’s 120+-member student band. The Band leads in various songs, chants, etc. Composition is the expected mix of woodwinds, brass, and drums, though previous years have featured keyboards, electric guitars, and basses in the mix. It should be noted that, unlike some pep bands, the Band does take requests. The Band would also like to thank their counterparts at Clarkson, for reminding them that we’re not perfect -- your visits, Golden Knights, remind us that we do in fact lack one thing: untalented musicians. ^not^even^sorry
 
**Fight Song:** Our goal song is “Eye of the Tiger”.  Most RIT fans consider the [“Hey!”](https://youtu.be/tZsSwLkoCSU) song our fight song with an RIT twist where the fans yell “Hey You Suck!” and the following verses after the second chorus “We’re gonna score so easily, shoot fast, kick their ass, R I T!”  
 
**Arena:** [Gene Polisseni Center]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Polisseni_Center#/media/File:Panoramic_View_of_the_Gene_Polisseni_Center.JPG) seats 4,300 and was completed in 2014.  Unofficial nicknames are the Polisseum or G-spot so RIT guys can say they know where to find it.

Rivals
****
 
**Niagara University** The rivalry for RIT and Niagara dates back to Niagara’s first varsity season back in the 1996-1997 season, in which they played an independent schedule that included playing DIII opponents.  From the get go, Niagara has always dominated the series against RIT, currently leading the series 12-3-9.  Last year, RIT finally broke the winless streak against Niagara during the regular season, as well as at Niagara’s Dwyer Arena. Also for some reason or another we just really hate teams that wear purple and have eagle mascots (back in DIII we were rivals with Elmira College Soaring Eagles).  They also are within an hour and half drive of RIT and they hate how many of us travel to watch the games at their school.
 
**Canisius College** Canisius has played RIT since the 1980’s when their hockey team was a member of ECAC West.  RIT has been getting the best of Canisius for most of this series.  The hatred though began to grow during the 2008 season when a [line brawl](https://youtu.be/-6mJULLbEjo) broke out, which included a [rare goalie fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwWWx8yazFs) , between the two teams at RIT.  The game ended with a total of 225 penalty minutes, which still stands as the third-highest in Division I history.  They also don’t seem to like that a lot more of our students/fans are willing to make the trip to their rink compared to their own.   
 
**Air Force Academy** Both RIT and Air Force joined the AHC around the same time.  These two programs were strongest teams in the conference and up until recently having won the most regular season and conference tourney championships.  The rivalry is a lot more of a mutual respect between the two teams since the games are often very close.  Although a lot of crap seems to happen out in Colorado Springs whenever RIT comes to town.

&amp;nbsp;

Mercyhurst at the end of the regular season. There were a lot of pretty goals here. Corner Crew got into the [goalies’ heads](https://youtu.be/7yF5VoJoQXM).  Also we secured the 3rd seed after sweeping Mercyhurst and Bentley losing all its game that same weekend.

**Season Summary**
 
Last year started off in usual RIT fashion.  We started off slow going 2-6-1 through the first 9 games.  RIT would break many of the curses that have plagued the program, such as winning against Niagara University during the regular season, as well as winning at Dwyer (D-why-are-we-here) Arena. They soon took off going 10-4-2 after December.  They ended up finishing in third place in Atlantic Hockey regular season.  The road of getting back to Blue Cross had us going against Air Force, a team we finally beat for the first time ever in the playoffs. Then we cruised through the rest of our opponents to win the AHC Championship for the second time. We made our second NCAA tournament appearance and the reputation of the underdog followed us once again, as we were the 16 seed facing the number 1 overall seed Minnesota State. RIT went out to the Midwest and pulled off another miracle beating Minnesota State (aka the San Jose Sharks of college hockey) ^sorry 2-1 in the first round of the tourney.  Unfortunately our underdog reputation wasn’t going to get us to the Frozen Four because we ran into Nebraska-Omaha’s goaltender Massa who shut us out the next day.  Overall it was a great season that was needed after how terrible RIT was the two seasons prior to last year.   
 
****
*2015-2016 Season*
**[Schedule]( http://ritathletics.com/schedule.aspx?path=mhock)**
 ****

**Drafted Players on Roster:** None : (  
 
**Key Games**
 
- **RIT vs. Bowling Green - Blue Cross Arena:** Bowling Green comes to play RIT in their annual homecoming game in downtown Rochester in front of 10,556 fans. **October 17th**
- **RIT vs. Colgate:** This a home and home series but Colgate is a good program as of recent and will be the only non-conference opponent to play in the G-spot this year. **October 23rd-24th**
- **RIT at BC:** RIT travels to Conte Forum over Thanksgiving break to play one game against BC as repayment for last year’s homecoming game. This is the strongest opponent RIT will face this year based on pre-season expectations. **November 28th**
 
**Players to Watch**
 
- **Mike Rotolo, G, Junior:** This will be the guy who takes over the #1 goaltending spot this year.  Last year he was splitting time with Jordan Ruby but went 9-6-1.  Mike had a goals against average of 2.5137 and a SV% of 0.908. He is from Rochester and therefore a fan favorite as well.
- **Brady Norrish, D, Sophomore:** As a freshman he was on the first line pairing all of last year.  He had 4 goals and 18 assists with a +/- of +18.  He is a young player that will be seen as the leader of the defensive corps in the coming years.
- **Josh Mitchell, F, Senior:** The only returning member of RIT’s MGM line.  Last year he was second highest on the team for points with 52 from 16 goals and 36 assists.  He will be the man to look to generate RIT’s offense this season especially now that Garbowsky and McGowan have graduated. He is also 15 points away from 100 career points at RIT.

*Rochester Institute of Technology’s Hockey History*
****

**Greatest Players:**
 
- **Chris Tanev, D:** Chris was signed by Vancouver after RIT’s 2010 Frozen Four run.  He is considered by their coaches and their fans as the best defensemen on the team.  He is currently the only former RIT player still active in the NHL. 
- **Steve Pinizzotto, F:** The only other former Tiger that has played at the NHL level, as a call up for Vancouver and Edmonton.  Although last year he did manage to get a Gordie Howe hat-trick for Edmonton against Vancouver (first RIT player to do that).  He has now signed with EHC München in Germany after becoming a free agent this year.
- **Matt Garbowsky, F:** One of last year’s Hobey Baker finalists and one of the top scorers in the NCAA last year.  He currently plays for the Buffalo Sabres’ AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans. 
 
**Greatest Coach:**
 
- **Wayne Wilson, 302-180-54:** 1999-Present. He has been our head coach since the end of RIT’s DIII days.  He led this team to 5 NCAA tournament appearances 3 in DIII and 2 in DI.  Wilson was also the captain for Bowling Green when they won the D1 championship in 1984. 
 
**Greatest Games:**
 
- **RIT vs. Minnesota State Mankato, March 28th 2015, 2-1(RIT):** This was RIT’s second appearance in the DI tournament.  This was the first time though the 16 seed actually beat the number 1 overall seed in the NCAA Ice Hockey Tournament.  It was the biggest upset since well… when RIT last beat a number one seed in the tournament in the first round.  
- **RIT vs. Denver, March 26th 2010, 2-1(RIT):** This was RIT’s first appearance in the DI tourney.  Denver was the number 2 overall in the tourney but number 1 in the East regional that year.  After this game RIT would go on to their first Frozen Four appearance that year. 
- **Niagara vs. RIT, December 14th 2013, 2-2(Tie):** This was the outdoor hockey game at Rochester’s baseball stadium Frontier Field.  The game was 18 degrees with a blizzard blowing through for almost all of it.  It wasn’t perfect for the game with the need to remove all the snow during the period.  It ended in a tie but it was a great experience so its on this list.  
- **Canisius vs. RIT, March 14th 2014, 3-1(RIT):** This was the last game at RIT’s former home The Frank Ritter Memorial Ice Arena.  This game was a very special occasion for RIT many alumni members of Corner Crew flew in to witness this game.  It was awesome to meet many of these individuals and watch RIT win the last ever game they would play in Frank Ritter.  Of course we also sent it out in style with our Zamboni Driver Stu doing *DONUTS* on the ice. [Here is the highlites of that game.](https://youtu.be/780Fh1r_DeI)  Here is the time stamp where our [Zamboni Driver is doing DONUTS.](https://youtu.be/780Fh1r_DeI?t=8m20s)

*Closing School and City Information*
****
 
**City Population:** 1,082,284 (this is the Rochester metropolitan area’s total population, since RIT has a Rochester mailing address but is located outside the city limits.)  
 
**School History**
 
School was started in 1829 as the Rochester Athenaem meant to promote literature, arts and sciences in Rochester NY, which was a boom town as the result of the Erie Canal.  The school became what it is today when Rochester Athenaem joined together with the Mechanics Institute in 1891.  In 1912 RIT’s co-op program was started making it a requirement for students to get work experience as part of their graduation requirements.  The name Rochester Institute of Technology was adopted in 1944.  The campus was downtown until 1968 when RIT’s current campus construction was completed out in the town of Henrietta. In 1966 the National Technical Institute for the Deaf was established and RIT was selected as the school to host it because of its technical education, focus on cooperative education, and its emphasis on career preparation.   Now the school has over 200 academic programs ranging from undergrad to masters to even Ph. D programs (Ph. D’s are relatively new).  
 
**Traditions**

Corner Crew is the infamous student/alumni section of RIT that was formed in 1983.  We always [STAND](http://uscho.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/20141108-HolyCross-RIT-Phillips/G0000Fz09h5X75uQ/I0000x.kNSSvr_fQ/C0000snWAb9tFC9w) in a corner section of the arena where RIT shoots twice to harass the opponent’s goalie. Many of the traditions associated with RIT hockey are related to this group.
 
-   At the beginning of each period around puck drop one member of corner crew usually the student with the loudest voice (currently me) screams the following; 1st period: HOOOCKEEEY!, 2nd period: MORE HOOOCKEEEY!, 3rd Period: EVEN MORE HOOOCKEEEY!
-   At the first stoppage of play in the first and third period the most famous member of corner crew Big Goon will yell “Hey Corner Crew. What’s his name?” pointing at the opposing teams goalie.  Corner responds “LOSER!” which Goon replies, “What’s his real name.”  We respond with his actual name.  He then proceeds to chirp about how terrible the goalie is and after each statement Goon makes Corner yells SIEVE.  Finally Goon ends it by saying, “You wanna know why (insert goalie’s name)?”  Corner responds “Because you suck!”
-   During the first stoppages of play in each period a member of corner crew smacks on a wooden box with a goalie stick that corner crew claps in sync with (well tries to keep in sync with)  
-   After every RIT goal Corner rings a [church bell](https://www.facebook.com/ritcornercrew/videos/vb.59336374066/10152373650404067/?type=2&amp;theater) they ring it the number of times RIT has scored and Corner counts them.  Based on the score we will yell how many goals we want.  If the score is 3-2 RIT we yell “We want Four.” Then we point at the goalie and yell “It’s all your fault!” at the goalie four times.  If we are losing 4-2 we yell, “We want five!” and yell “It’s all your fault!” five times.  This isn’t the original bell that we used in Ritter it is a new bell that Corner Crew funded itself through alumni and student contributions when we the new arena was being built.
-   [Orange Jell-o Time](https://youtu.be/mY5v68et7sk ): During a TV timeout in the 3rd period Jump Around by House of Pain is played and all of us start to jump.  Not my name for it, it’s what the hockey teams call it.
-  As the refs come out on the ice pep band starts playing the Imperial March and Corner yells “You Suck!” at each one as they pass.  In the 3rd pep band switches to the Looney Toons theme song.  
-  Another big thing we do is that we incorporate ASL (American Sign Language) into our chants that way our hard of hearing and deaf students can also participate in Corner Crew.  Also everything is typecast on the video boards in the arena and we have interpreters during the national anthems.  
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Local Dining:**
 
[MacGregor’s Grill and Taproom](http://www.macgregorsgtr.com/) is the official bar of Corner Crew.  50+ beers on tap, amazing wings, sandwiches, and other bar food.  Students, alumni, broadcasters, even players can be found here after RIT games.  It’s about 500 feet from the edge of campus on Jefferson Road.

&amp;nbsp;

[Sticky Lips](http://stickylipsbbq.com/stickylips/) is a great BBQ joint in Rochester.  Serves 50+ beers, amazing BBQ food (I personally recommend the brisket).  Food is pricy but you get a lot of it.  Usually on the weekends they have live music playing at the Juke Joint which is the location a mile down Jefferson Road from RIT.  

&amp;nbsp;

If you come to Rochester the one meal that is considered the true local staple is called a [Garbage Plate.](http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrww6gTWvu1r2qf30o1_500.jpg)  I will give you three places you can check out to try one of these.  *Nick Tahou’s* is the place where it was conceived so for that reason if you are willing to drive downtown go there and get it so you can say you got the original garbage plate.  Next is one what many say is the best plate in town which is [Dogtown Hots.](http://www.dogtownhots.com/)  It is located downtown as well.  If you don’t wish to go downtown though *Henrietta Hots* makes a plate that, I can say as person born and raised in Rochester, will suffice enough to count as a true garbage plate experience.  
 
&amp;nbsp;

Also by request if you want to try another true Rochester staple go to the [Genesee Brew House.](http://www.geneseebeer.com/brewhouse/)  Genny is cheap beer but it's our cheap beer.  They have good food and also serve some of the best craft beers that are made by local brewers.  Honestly for you true craft beer drinkers make a day of just visiting breweries in the Rochester region like Robach's, Fairport Brewing, and Naked Dove.  You get to see a lot more of the area this way and drink beer which is what matters.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Random Trivia:**
 
-RIT is one of two DIII play up schools who do not offer athletic scholarships to players; the other one is Union College.  

&amp;nbsp;

-RIT is one of the largest private institutes in the country.  

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Academics**
 
-College of Engineering (Computer, Electrical, Micro-electronic, Mechanical, Chemical, Biomedical, Industrial)  
-College of Computer and Information Sciences (Computer Science, IT, Game Design, Networking and System Administration, Software Engineering)  
-College of Applied Science and Technology (Electrical Eng. Tech, Mechanical Eng. Tech, Civil Eng. Tech, Packaging Science, Hospitality)  
-College of Business (Business Management, Finance, Accounting, Marketing, New Media Marketing)    
-College of Imaging Arts and Sciences (Photo majors, Film and Animation, 3D Digital Design, Graphic Design, Furniture Design, other art majors)    
-College of Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Applied Math, Imaging Science, Bioinformatics)  
-College of Health Sciences of Technology (Biomedical Sciences, Nutrition Management, Physician Assistant, Diagnostic Medical Sonography aka ultrasound)  
-College of Liberal Arts (Communications, Criminal Justice, International and Global Studies, Political Science, Museum Studies, other liberal arts majors)  
-National Technical Institute for the Deaf (ASL Interpreters, Accounting, Computer, Business, Science basically degrees in these fields oriented for deaf students)

&amp;nbsp;

A big requirement for most of our degrees is co-op experience which means in order to graduate you must participate in a paid internship.  Certain degrees like Engineering, Engineering Technology and Computer Science require a year of co-op so are therefore a 5 year program.  Others require only a couple of summer co-ops.

&amp;nbsp;

****
*What is and what is to come*
****
As RIT enters its 10th DI season it will remain as one of the top teams in the Atlantic Hockey Conference again.  Our defense didn’t lose anyone to graduation but we did lose a good portion of our offense.  I don’t think we will repeat as tournament champions.  I could see us making the semifinals of the AHC tourney and then losing.  There is the possibility we could make it further but that would mean some of the freshman we brought in exceed my expectations on offense.  
 
&amp;nbsp;

****
*Miscellaneous*
****
RIT also has a successful women’s program.  It’s 5th in overall attendance and is only behind perennial mid-western powerhouses.  Last year was only our 3rd season playing DI but the first year we were eligible for the NCAA tourney.  After finishing last in our conference during the regular season the team went on a magical run to repeat as conference champions and receive the CHA’s first automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.  RIT would get the 8th seed and have to play against 1st seed the University of Minnesota who ended their magical run in the first round.

&lt;-- History Archives Accessed --&gt; &lt;-- East Commonwealth Field Report New York City Recon Mission - 08/10/2256 --&gt; The city is a hopeless cause. What remains of the buildings there are are losing a fight against nature with mutated plants growing at an exponential rate and feral animals running wild in the streets.

We were able to gather some supplies and equipment from Vault 5 to the north of the city, but Vault 4, located under the ruins of Grand Central Station, is a bust. The door is sealed tight and I don't think they'll be opening it anytime soon.

While exiting the city we encountered a party of well-armed soldiers claiming to be scouting for supplies from a settlement in the Pittsburgh area. They were accompanied by several ragged looking survivors who seemed to be in some distress.

Due to their heavily armaments and well-trained appearance we disengaged and will be returning to Great Lanta shortly.

At this rate we won't have anyone willing to visit the doctor once old Peabody dies.

I told her father the girl needed to be married off by now, it's not natural for her to be unwed at her age and it only serves to encourage sin. Best course is to get rid of her ASAP, so young Peggy Carter can take her place and one day be Chief Medical Officer instead.

I'm sending Scarlett out into the city to find some fresh medical supplies, Lord knows we need them. If by some miracle she does manage to survive some good may yet come of this whole mess.

Blinking her eyes as she lifted her hand to cover them Scarlett stepped up the staircase into the largest room she'd ever seen. Across the hall the sun glared mightily thought the large windows as she peered around at the unfamiliar surroundings. Everywhere she looked there seemed to be rubble, but she was undeterred, this was the first time in generations anyone had left the Vault, and she felt honoured to have been chosen.

Slowly she began to make her way over to the window, climbing up the pile of rubble before looking out over the city. To anyone else the overgrown vista may have been depressing, but to Scarlett it was a new horizon filled with possibilities. As she looked out over the crumbling buildings only one thought passed through her mind.

'I wonder if there's anyone out there, and I wonder if they wanna get laid...'

Somehow Lee survived the radiation through a long and painful period of necrosis and mutation, transforming him into what the 'smoothskins' called a freak, a zombie, a ghoul.

Over the next two centuries Lee would remember less and less about his pre-war youth.

Appearance/Personality Lee is a very reclusive and shrouded character. He will dress in a way that covers his identity from hostile smoothskins. Lee wears a duster and boots  with a stormchaser hat, neck scarf goggles which cover his face entirely. His voice is very gravely and raspy from long term vocal chord damage, this is somewhat muffled by his scarf but those who know the sound of a ghoul are likely to notice so he tends to stick to gestures with new or unfamiliar people. Lee tends rarely leaves his dwelling without his rifle slung on his back.

Weapon of Choice - Scoped and Modified .308 Hunting Rifle Originally one of his father's rifles, Lee has managed to maintain the firearm over 200 years through constant changes and upgrades. Currently equipped with a 3.5x scope and extended 10 shot clip this bolt action rifle has been Lee's main source of survival and income.

(Lee also carries an old military combat knife)

Dwelling Lee lives in a hand built shack in the remote wasteland, built on a good vantage point for hunting and defence reasons.

Inside is one open space with a camp bed, desk and a piles upon piles of books in a somewhat organized mess.

SPECIAL: Strength: 3 - Doughy Baby Do ghouls even lift? Lee's deteriorated body will struggle to overpower tough obstacles.

Perception: 8 - Monocled Falcon Don't let the cloudy orbs for eyes confuse you, Lee is extremely alert.

Endurance: 7 - Tough as Nails Compared to a smoothskin Lee can take one heck of a beating by the elements

Charisma: 2 - Old Hermit Nods and grunts are his social forte

Intelligence: 6 - Gifted Above average intelligence, mainly through reading and self taught skills

Agility: 5 - Under Control Nothing noteworthy about his swiftness, the fact he can run away from smoothskins is a feat in itself.

Luck: 5 - Coin Flip Unless through a perk or a level of skill dictates otherwise Lee has a pretty 50/50 chance in most situations.

PERKS/TRAITS:

Comprehension (One additional skill point gained for every book read) Lee spends a lot of time reading the piles and piles of scavenged literature in his den.

Hunter (75% Critical Damage Boost against Animals) Lee is very skilled at hunting game for both consumption and trade.

Scrounger (Increased change to find ammunition) While he's an above average scavenger Lee seems to have this uncanny knack of finding ammo even when he doesn't need or even want it.

Radiation Immune (Racial Trait) Lee isn't only immune to radiation but seems to acquire healing properties from being near high radiation or drinking irradiated water.

Sharpshooter (+2 Perception during range finding) &amp; Trigger Discipline (20% accuracy, 20% reduced fire rate) Lee lays in wait, biding his time with a patience only a ghoul's lifespan can muster. Lee isn't quick to shoot but when he does it usually counts.

Outdoorsman (Increased chance of special encounters, reduced chance of bad encounters) Over the past two centuries Lee has adopted a good eye for trouble, avoiding it well while out in the wastelands.

Just curious, if anybody here if could help me or point me in the right direction for an IT internship.  Currently, finishing up at GCC with a Computer Systems &amp; Network Tech. A.A.S. 

 I've been looking for a while and am having a bit of time finding anything. Up until 2 months ago I was working one full-time and a part-time job while going to school so that kinda put a damper on my internship searching endeavors. To be honest, I'm not actually looking for one that will turn into a job...as I'm just trying to complete my degree and then join the Navy. As for the main internship details, it could paid or unpaid &amp; would last for 150 hours.

I figure it's a bit of a long shot, but if anybody wants or knows somebody that could use some free tech support / help for a couple months, I would greatly appreciate it! "

Help please.,nnquo,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/3l1m3f/reverse_copyright_help_please/,"So, I contribute to a local magazine in my home town and I have had a few problems with them in the past. Once they took nearly a month to pay me for the photos that they had already printed and ran. I was a little upset about it at the time and I stopped contributing for a while. After a month they got a new editor and asked me to try contributing again (mostly because they desperately need photographers). I decided to give it another shot, literally. 

I went to five different events and did a shoot at each one. The one in question here in an event put on by the publisher of the magazine (a relatively local credit union). They called it ""The Leader Bash"" and it was basically a few college kids getting together with free food and music. 

The problem here is that they decided to not use any of the photos that I actually took of the event and instead they used photos taken by a cell phone by their marketing interns. However, when they published the issue they put my name on the photos that other people had taken. Without asking me, or bothering to let me know that they were going to do so.

I don't know what to do or if I should even be offended. Honestly I feel a little bit cheated. I mean, sure, I got paid the little bit that they actually pay, but I didn't take the pictures that they used and plastered my name on. I am basically wondering if I should, and if I could take some sort of action against them if they decide to be dicks about it when I talk to them.

I have plenty of evidence that I did not take the pictures by the way, I feel like I should mention that.

I'm 27, single. Right now I live in SF and have a very low salary (internship), so I'm used to finding hacks (food from Chinatown and basics from Trader's joe, walking to work, coupons for the gym). My basic lifestyle is $400 on food (I eat a ton, workout hard, have to cook it like a typical gymbro), $100 on utilities phone etc, I haven't drunk alcohol in a long time by choice, I don't feel frustrated because lots of activities are outside in here. 
Nightlife sucks bad tho, 2am back home... but I believe it doesn't cost a lot when you don't spend $20 on drinks... Also I go to the restaurant like, once a week no problem.

I'll finally get a decent paycheck in NYC in 2016 getting a $50K NET. That also means that, besides not paying further state taxes my job will take care of the health insurance. I've done my research and it looks like it's the same as a standard $70k ? 75/80 maybe taking the health thing into account?

Now, I know that housing is a PIA but it's the same here in SF. Right now I'm sharing a room for $850 a month and it's absurd but deal with it - great neighborhood, super close to work downtown. 

Considering I don't have a credit score since I've been in the US for a few months only, I don't know what would be my options when it's time to move into the city for good. I'll just write down one option I imagined when using craigslist and gipsy housing on facebook:

- Rent in Hell's kitchen $1200 a room in a shared 2BR (being optimistic?)

- Gym $50 Phone $50

- Food $700 including a few restaurants

- Utilities $100 if they are shared?

- Transportation $100

- Not a shopaholic but I like getting a new thing or 2 every other week (clothes, apartment stuff whatever) and going out and enjoy the city since I'm considering myself so lucky to even get a job in this special place

===&gt; Saving $1000+ ? Is this even realistic?



Thanks for the tips!"

I just graduated this past spring with a BA in geography with a minor in science and technical writing. I took the summer off to enjoy myself and travel around the country, and am now living in NYC and trying to hit the job market hard.

My last semester in school I had a technical writing internship with a fairly large credit union as a technical writer.  I was updating internal documentation and procedures, creating content for the online employee portal, and working with different departments in the credit union when they needed a new procedure updating or a manual reorganized. Overall it was an excellent look at what a professional technical writing position looks like.
On top of this, I took several courses on technical writing in school and have preserved works from these courses in the form of a blog that is linked in my resume.  My technical skills include: Microsoft office, ArcGIS, SPSS, Adobe Illustrator, and some basic web content management. 

So my question is, what can I do to help myself score that entry-level position?  I feel that I'm about as qualified as an entry-level candidate can be, but I'm pretty naïve to what this industry looks like on the inside, and what hard skills employers are actually looking for.

I've been diagnosed with depression after my last internship in June when I completely broke down. I'm more of the silent type, and I certainly don't like bothering other people with my issues.

I generally dislike talking through my issues with most people actually, as I often find talking about it brings it back to the front of my mind, making me far more susceptible to my depression taking me over in that moment.

I usually do find 1 or 2 people to talk to, and I'm going into therapy soon (there was a waiting list.) I really think that for me, that does suffice.

However, Christmas is coming in just over 3 months. Which means seeing all my family members. A lot of them can be very inquisitive. I've also been diagnosed with autism (high functioning.) My depression has a lot to do with the problems I face because of it. I haven't had a job since early 2014, the internship was through a program to help people with disabilities to find a job. A couple of people in my family knew that I was entering the program.

Now I've had to quit it because of my depression... So when the time comes that they ask me about it, I don't know what to say. I don't want to share it with everyone. My main issue is with my step-dad, who is one of the main contributors to my depression. I just don't want him to butt in on anything. 

Which he feels is his duty, as my mom passed away and I barely see my father. Some of you might suggest not seeing him, but I do have a good relationship with his children, most of whom have kids, and I love kids. Not seeing them would be worse than seeing him I think.

And there's also my bully of an uncle who doesn't understand boundaries and can sometimes act like the Spanish inquisition.

Does anyone have some advice for me?"

3l3lsx,1,2015-09-15,Every day is a struggle,drakathaz,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3l3lsx/every_day_is_a_struggle/,"First, I just want to lead-off that I'm literally retarded with reddit. I posted this last night, but unfortunately it was pretty late so I don't think anyone saw it. I don't know how to get posts back to the top other than resubmitting. If I violated rules, I apologize, but I was looking to be heard out - hopefully.

Well, this is a somewhat'ish long story, that I'll try to keep concise. Back last September, I met the girl who I thought I would marry. I'm not the type to fall deep into love without giving it good thought, nor was the girl who I was with. It was the best relationship of my life until January. During our second date in September, girlfriend of the time had a skype interview with a NGO from Nicaragua. Little did I know she would end up accepting a 10 month internship in Nicaragua. Well, things became pretty serious between our starting to date in October and her shipping out in late November. Something changed in January though. She stopped talking about our future and became a completely different person. She understood my emotions, but it was as if she didn't care. Essentially, she turned into a complete narcissist. Any time I spoke to her about my emotions, she would flip the subject on me and make me feel like shit. My attendance in law school suffered, as did my personal life.

Finally, in March I had a trip planned to see her. I had saved up money while being in graduate school in order to visit her. Little did I know the trip would up being a mixed bag of emotions. While we dated in the US, she was a very affectionate and loving person. When I met her in Nicaragua, she was a cold, inhumane person. She kept telling me all the way from January, that ""she hadn't changed, and this is who she was."" The only thing is that everything pointed to the contrary because she was such a great girlfriend. During the trip I broke down multiple times because she refused to show my affection while she on her period. Moreover, it was just the fact that she was the first girl I related sexual experiences with love. In essence, she was withholding love from me and it destroyed me. I came home from the vacation feeling like although there were problems, that we could sort them out and make things work. After two weeks of her acting completely strange, we broke up. I was on hydrocodone at the time because of back pain caused by a car accident the year before - it was the only reason I even made it through things.

After the breakup, I tried to become friends with my ex at her insistence. I remember specifically her telling me that she loved me when we broke up. It was a ""mutual"" breakup so she would feel better about kamizakazing our relationship. I was pushed to my breaking point to break up with her. I wasn't ready for it, nor did I want it. Alas, a few days after we broke up she posted something on Facebook about it being ""National Kissing Day."" She wrote (roughly translated into English), for those of you who are married, kiss your loved one - for those of you who are dating someone and love them, give them a special kiss - for all of us searching for god's special love, you will find your special kiss. Now, this completely destroyed me because it went contrary to everything my ex spoke to me about. I confronted her about it, and the issue was completely turned against me. After this issue, I came down with mono. However, because of my depression, and the lack of a sore throat for three weeks, I took it as lymphoma. If I wasn't depressed I'm sure I would have been more rational, but frankly I couldn't deal with it at the time.

Fast forward two weeks or so. I try to ""maintain"" a friendship with my ex. She hasn't messaged me on her own since we broke up and she is completely uncooperative since we broke up. Additionally, the first message she sends to me in two weeks says ""y did u delete me on FB."" After she knew I was suffering with lymphoma like symptoms and going crazy. She didn't even give a shit enough to ask me how I was doing. At this point, and while on an anti-depressant for a week I realized what a piece of shit she was. I told her off and cut complete contact with her for six months.

In June, I had a double jaw surgery that changed my appearance quite a bit. I was already a somewhat attractive guy, but I became pretty confident in my appearance at this point. After the surgery all was going well. However, approximately three weeks later I developed what I learned would be an aneurysm in the artery in my nose.

Over the course of a week, I lost nearly half my blood during arterial nosebleeds that would last two to three hours. At this time, I begged my ""best friend"" to come visit me at my house because my parents refused to let me go out when I was pouring blood from my nose at random times. My so called ""best friend"" never came - because he was to busy with his new girlfriend. Yet, when he was in trouble I was always by his side, oh the irony.

The great part about my surgery is I was on oxycodone the entire time. That chronic back pain I felt from the car accident was gone. I was a fully functional person who could exercise and enjoy myself for the first time in two years. However, the oxycodone eventually ran out and the pain came back. I have had cortisone shots done which have fixed absolutely nothing in my back. At this point I'm at a loss for words because I don't think anything will fix my back.

Overall, I've been left with chronic back pain, lost multiple best friends because I've learned what jerk-offs they were, and lost a girl I thought I would marry. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. In May, my anti-depressants and medicine were working amazingly - I was never upset and was able to deal with my problems. In mid-August, everything stopped working and I fell into a deep depression again. Alas, I'm stills stuck in this depression and here I am. I don't know what I'm looking for, but I needed to vent.

Long time lurker, first time poster and all that. I have been following this sub since I first met reddit about 2 years ago, and have seen such genuine, honest and lifesaving advice in extremely difficult situations come from here. I would really love some advice from outside of this situation because I'm not sure what else to do. I’m sorry for the length, but you can skip to the bullet points if need be.


My SO James and I have been together more than 2 years. I come from a crappy living situation, low-income raised, small town, father passed away at 18, mother is a long time daily pot smoker and hoarder, so not really having support system besides my best friend has been hard. When I met James I had been 1 year out of a 5 year relationship with my ex who I had been with me a couple years before my father died. It was a shitty relationship in a plethora of ways. I was dead set on being single for some time until I met James. He lived in a bigger city hours away but we were compatible in so many ways and had such fun talking I decided a date couldn't hurt. Our first date lasted 8 hours. He was unlike anyone I had met before and felt much more positive about being single just knowing he existed. James is very blunt, though well spoken, so we had some talks about our particular deal breakers and despite being much different (myself shy though mature for my age, and him more social, higher class and driven), and after found out we were compatible in the important ways.


I had moved back in with my mom after my ex and I broke up because I lived in a city where I didn’t know anyone else and I wasn’t finically stable enough because of school. So when James and I got more serious after a couple months I decided to transfer to the University because I had already put in my two years in community college and he was thrilled at the idea of us being closer. Before dating he wasn't looking for a relationship either as his LTR ended not too long ago, but things felt much more right than they ever had before for both of us, so he asked me to be his girlfriend. Well, my roommate fell through a couple weeks before classes started and I couldn't afford campus housing. He suggested we move in together short term, though we were both wary because we hadn't dated very long, but we talked it out and I picked up and moved. Us living together went better than I ever expected, and I'm lucky for that. After things went well I put my plans of moving out when I found a place to rent on hold, and he asked me to stay. I was looking for a job and going to school more than I ever had, and he had a monthly income from his parents and just started Law School so I decided I would take care of all the cooking, house work and the pets while I got on my feet. It took me a little longer to find employment than I expected. Something about the city being so new to me and struggling with social anxiety for the past couple years. But, I threw myself into taking care of everything at home and he was very appreciative. I found a job and worked part-time because of full-time school and started paying my half of the rent and he took care of everything else financially. He had law-school, internships and career hobbies so I took care of all the cooking and cleaning and it worked out well. I was happy to do it, not being able to financially contribute as much as he did, and he was always appreciative.


He is ready to graduate Law School in May and move wherever he needs to, and I had to withdraw from a 2 semesters of school in the past 5 because of a miscarriage and an abortion. I'm trying so hard to graduate because I'm ready to be out of school and working but these things were very new and emotional for me and my grades were suffering because of it. Will it ever not just feel like one thing after another? Anyway, in the mean-time I decided to graduate with an associates in May and continue with my Bachelors in an online program so I can move with him if need be. I thought long and hard about that decision, but he's so different than anyone I've met and makes me happier than I ever thought possible so I decided he was worth it. He's been amazing through every bump in the road, and has been the most stable and kind person I could ask for.


Out of the blue during an argument a couple days ago he told me he wanted to go on a break. We talked about it and he said our problems lately just haven't been getting resolved and he doesn't want to put a strain on his last year of school. These are the problems we've talked about.


* In the last year we’ve been arguing more lately, and... differently. We get into a discussion, conversation whatever, where we disagree on the topic. Before, we would talk about it and reach a conclusion and either come to an agreement or agree to disagree and move on. It usually never ended in hurt feelings and things got resolved. Lately it hasn't been that way. I think maybe it because we're both so busy doing school, homework, internship, and work from the time we wake up until a couple hours before bed that the times we've happened to just be talking and ended up in a fight is because it's an inopportune time. I'm a little impatient and want to resolve it then and there, and he's already stressed because his attention is in a couple different directions, and we end up fighting when we usually wouldn't. We need to learn to table it for later, but doing it before things become heated usually doesn't happen.
* Another thing we've fought about recently is sex. I have a high libido, while he has a lower one, and I used to be initiating all the time. It worked for a while, but eventually lead to a chasing dynamic- I keep trying to initiate sex but getting rejected and feeling less wanted, he keeps turning me down and feeling pressured and wary of any contact that may initiate sex. I'm more affectionate and romantic, and didn't mind how he wasn't as much because when he was romantic it was really special and genuine. We started a sex regimen lately that we found on reddit from people in a similar situation where he's the only one initiating at least twice a week and keeps in mind to be more open to my acts of affection because it makes me feel emotionally fulfilled and he doesn't have to worry about me trying to initiate something.


* Our third thing he told me he has a problem with is our difference in ambition. He's doing law school full time, a couple days of internship, and daily work related hobbies. I'm working, going to school full time, cooking and cleaning, have maintained my long time habit of writing poetry in my spare time. We are ‘on a break’ for a couple of days while I stay with a friend back home and when we discussed what we felt was a problem and he brought this up. He said he doesn't see my passion enough and thinks I should be working/ volunteering in my field for experience, or doing something with my poetry. These things are reasonable to me, but I understand my delay because of taking care of the home, working enough to pay bills, and our 5 year age difference. We were also raised much differently. Because of his culture and his parent’s standards he was raised to be highly ambitious and constantly strive toward high income. I was raised by a mechanic and a part time hotel maid who smoked pot and drank daily who loved motor cycle rallies and Nascar. So, yeah. I decided on a major that is higher income and I will really enjoy my field although my ultimate ambition it to write, but it's taken me 2 years to dig myself out of the small country hole that is my hometown, and my back ground. I really do want to start getting related work experience soon because I have to AND because I want to. I know it probably just sounds like I'm younger than him, and we're just in different places right now and there's no fixing it. But more ready than ever to start living my 'adult' life and being responsible for everything that comes with that, and I want this person I love by my side. All my father wanted is for me to better my situation because he didn’t have an opportunity to, and I'm not hesitant that that is going to be my path at all. I'm excited for the future and I don't know how to make him see that. I know the solution requires us getting back together so I can actually show him with actions I have ambition and drive.
I've been staying with my best friend in my hometown because I was so hurt I felt like I couldn't stay or things would get worse. Being back here has been depressing to say the least, and after I've been considering whether it's worth it to make this work- I really think it is. Not because it's just a better situation for me, but because we make each other so happy in ways most people we know don't, or ways we've never felt.


We've talked twice and decided it the talks go well we can get back together. We're supposed to talk again soon, and I was hoping for some suggestions on how to manage our disagreements with a busy schedule, and some practical advice regarding our other issues so I can better explain there isn’t a conversation we can have that could immediately fix everything- our solutions are actions and we are worth giving it a try.


TL;DR- I really want to make my relationship with SO of 2 years work, but we've had a problem of little arguments popping up more frequently, and a couple of hiccups with school has made him unsure of my ambition."

3l4cop,5,2015-09-15,Makeup for business meeting?,urmidnightdream,MakeupAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3l4cop/makeup_for_business_meeting/,"Hi everyone! So tomorrow is my first meeting with a business society at my university. The purpose of it is to network with different companies and have potential jobs and internships.

Anyways, the attire is business professional. I wear makeup pretty much everyday and keep it fairly natural, but I love making my lashes super bold with mascara.

What do you guys think would be makeup appropriate for a business attire setting? I was thinking a nice foundation, some blush and highlight, maybe a subtle crease color with brown pencil eyeliner on the top lid and a natural lip. 

Would too bold of eyelashes be unprofessional? I don't know, I just don't want to make myself look like a fool. Thank you!"

**#1: The Intern**
I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom).

**#2: The Office Affair**
Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...
***
I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

3l5fs5,6,2015-09-16,Should I [25 M] tell my ex [22 F] that I got diagnosed with stress and light depression and likely had it for large duration of our relationship?,Sostressedman,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3l5fs5/should_i_25_m_tell_my_ex_22_f_that_i_got/,"So, my girlfriend and I broke up about five weeks ago. We were together for two years. We'd had a rough patch for a couple of months where things had been going downward. She didn't desire me as much and I'd grown more and more distant and needy. In the end, she told me she'd fallen out of love with me. 

Now, in march I started university again after a long internship. I hated it. I liked the internship a lot and was sad to be bad in school. I study to be a journalist and had been interning at a radio-station for one and a half years. Going back to school felt empty and meaning-less after such a long time in a full-time job.

I still did freelance-work at the radio two days a week while studying and doing volunteer work in an organization. Among this I had to put effort into our relationship.

My girlfriend supported me, of course. She knew I was busy, but every time we were together I'd think about work or school or something else. I wouldn't really be there when I was with her.

I guess I grew distant and started taking her and her support for granted. Exam-periods came and we didn't really see each other much. She'd be at the university until late in the evening and I'd work at the radio during the day and study at night.

In the end, she told me she was unhappy. I promised to do better - and I did for a while. But I just wasn't happy. It wasn't the relationship - it was my life. I felt like she didn't understand, but I also found it hard to put into words how I felt. I loved her so dearly, so I really wanted to include her.

Summer came and passed. And even though we didn't go to school, the feeling of unhappiness didn't disappear. I'd appreciate when we spent time together. I'd hold her and kiss her - both to show her I loved her, but also to comfort myself.

In the end, I guess we got so distant that she decided to break it off. She found another man and spent some time with him. I asked her why she fell in love with me back in the day - she said: ""Well, you were always happy and joking - being self-ironic. That attracted me."" That's when I realized I hadn't been like that for a long time.

I understand that she probably felt more happy with the other guy - and that's fine. I've accepted the break-up and sort of moved on. 

So, we broke up. I was sad for a while - sadder than I usually was. It's gotten better, but I decided to see a psychiatrist anyway. It was here that I realized how I'd felt for the last months in our relationship. The therapist helped me put my feelings into words and told me I was suffering from stress and a light depression - and probably had been for a while.

Now, my ex and her new guy have broken it off. But I have no desire to get back with her. We don't talk much, but sometimes we write back and forth. Our conversations are usually in good spirit and fun. We care for each other a lot. I guess in time we can find a good friendship.

Now, I've gotten better at talking about my emotions and feelings. 

But I am in a dilemma. I guess my feelings over the last months of our relationship - at least in part - played a role for how we broke up. It wasn't the only thing, probably, but I think it played a role.

Should I tell her about my diagnosis? We're good friends and I think she sort of deserves to know why I acted the way I did. If so, how should I tell her?
   
**tl;dr**: Ex and I broke up because I was distant and unhappy - which made her fall out of love with me. I now discover I had stress and a depression during that time. Should I tell her?"

**Autobiography**

I’m not your typical therapist, this is my third career. Previously, I was a DUI Defense Attorney but realized that I enjoyed counseling clients into treatment more than taking their money to get them out of trouble. My first career was 15 years in the tech field. I’ve been using the internet daily for twenty years now. I’ve watched it change the world for the better, but I’ve also watched individuals go down in flames due to ensnarement/enslavement in the medium. Addiction to gaming, porn addiction, and compulsive social networking can truly be overwhelming for some, and getting ensnared in these problems can be very similar to substance abuse, sexual addiction/compulsivity, and pathological gambling.

My unique background offers my clients multiple benefits. For example, a client once told me, “I’ve worked with other therapists before, but I like working with you because you seem to see things differently.” I ""travel between worlds"" very well. For example, due to my legal and business background, I’m comfortable working in a formal and professional environment, and I interact well with doctors, lawyers, professors, businessmen, and other professionals.


Alternately, my long and extensive tech background allows me to understand and work with the “digital natives” (millennial generation) who grew up with technology embedded in their lives. 

Additionally, my naturally casual and informal style helps me to understand and work with everyone in-between. I did my counseling internship at the county mental health and substance abuse clinic, and successfully worked with, among others, homeless and other people who lost everything due to their addictive behaviors and problems."

It's like the worst thing that can happen to anyone are all happening to me at the same time.

1) I am a senior college student in a top university with cut throat competition, studying a major I have absolutely no interest in.

2) I fell for a girl over the summer at my intern and had an on and off relationship with her. But for the past few weeks she hasn't been replying to me at all.

3) My hair is falling out for some reason which I simply cannot understand. Seeing wisps of hair around me everyday wherever I go totally freaks me out.

4) My grades over the last semester have been extremely bad; and for the first time in my life I failed a course. It is the WORST feeling in the world considering I was a top student at school.

5) Due to me failing that course my GPA has fallen a teeny whisker below the required cut off for summer internships of most companies. It pains my heart to see less worthy students getting shortlisted.

6)And now the real problem - my father died two weeks ago due to a cardiac arrest. He had a major operation prior to it, and caring for him took up most of my time. It was an extremely devastating news for me, and I still haven't fully recovered.

7) I suddenly learn that we have a huge debt remaining to be paid, and I am supposed to be the one who has to do it. Being a college senior who has little idea what to do in his life yet, it is extremely daunting for me to even think about it. 

8) My mother is insisting on selling our house and moving to a smaller place - I don't live with her anyway - along with my brother to pay off the debt. I want to stop her from doing so, but at the same time there is no realistic way of paying the debt until my graduation unless I start working part time.

8) And last but not the least, I have a stupid pain in my lower leg which means I cannot walk at all. And due to this I am stuck in my dorm room all day thinking about all this. And of course counting the hair falling out.

This is WORST period of my life. I am just 20 but I already feel much older. And I can't complain to anyone because I am the elder one and am supposed to support my mother and brother in this difficult time. Seriously fuck life.

It started as a highschool romance that developed and has grown as we've both went through things, both together and separately into something that I thought I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. There were a couple of things though that I've had problems with throughout our relationship that we've tried to work on, these things being prioritizing me sometimes and what I consider the biggest one sex(we were each others firsts).Of course there was the occasional arguments and such, but I feel that I started to see things differently after college

First thing I've had a problem with is her prioritization over me whether that be friends, family, school, job, self, whatever. Even moving back to the same city I was only seeing her at most 2 nights a week and it wasn't because i wasn't trying. The way I solved not seeing her was getting her to move in with me and out of her parents house into a downtown apartment. Living together is when I think the relationship gets hardest for most couples and for me I started getting more frustrated with the second problem of sex.

Sex has been an issue since about year 4. It's an issue that we have talked about on many occasions, communication isn't a problem for us. The problem stems from the fact that she seems to have no sex drive. After 9 years I still don't know what can turn her on(and she has no idea herself). I thought I could help improve this if I was able to see her more but I was wrong.

There was a point back near march where we had sex 3 times in about 7 weeks. And the worst part is that she put in the bare minimum effort those three times. I was going insane. Little did I know that living together and seeing her in the nude day after day would make dealing with no sex much much harder. At times she made it insane level by doing things such as giving me sexy dances and when I tried to make a move she would say ""I'm not in the mood for that I'm really needing to do X Y Z"". Needless to say I was suffering. We talked so many times and it always seemed to end with her crying thinking that there was something wrong with her for having no sex drive and not liking that I was unhappy.

Now comes the bad part.

Between my new workout regimen and new downtown friends, my physique and charisma(and testosterone) was through the roof. Going out was a blast. Of course the girlfriend was always to busy or too tired to hang out with my friends, so she was never with me. I found that I really enjoyed talking to other girls because I felt like they had a physical interest in me that I feel like the gf has never had. For the first time in my life though other people were noticing me and it felt good.

In comes the intern. We got a new intern [23 F] in our group last  year. About the time that I'm felling good about myself during the spring we start talking. We start becoming pretty good friends, but then it starts to escalate. Given what was going on at the homefront at the time, for whatever reason I thought that friends with benefits sounded like a way for me to stay sane. So being the bad person I am, I set out with my goals in mind. Low an behold, that's something she was interested in. She also knew about the gf.

SO, here we are some months down the road. Of course the friends with benefits turned into more. We are compatible on a physical/emotional level and that has made things difficult. I'm attached to her and her to me. I knew it would come eventually but it's to the point that I think she wants me to choose which is completely fair for her to want. She either wants to be all in or all out. 

I'm at a crossroads with a decision to make. Some people would think I'm crazy to even consider choosing the mistress over the gf and would think I'm a lousy POS that deserves neither and to only rot in a ditch somewhere. 

What should I do? Choose a sexless but developed relationship, or choose the new girl that sex is unlike anything I've every experienced but in the long term is a gamble?

3l8xzr,6,2015-09-16,How do you all deal with constant criticism from nparent?,andinwonderland,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3l8xzr/how_do_you_all_deal_with_constant_criticism_from/,"This is kind of more of a rant fest but I'd still appreciate any advice. 

To frame the situation: I (26F) still live part of the week with my parents, nMom and eDad, the other half of the week is spent with boyfriend in another town. I work nearly full time while balancing grad school, a weekend bridal gig on the side, and now in the process of getting this sweet internship that would also be part time on the days I don't work or have school. So, my schedule is packed and I'm stressed as hell because I'm doing everything I can to be out of the house as much as possible and get a job that would allow me to finally move out. 

The past few months of grad school have been particularly difficult and it's been really hard to live with nMom because of her lack of empathy or concern for my life. For instance, recently my brother moved out of the country so the family was talking about visiting for christmas. I can't afford to take off that much work and I expressed that to nMom but she says ""Well, your job doesn't really matter much anyway does it? You can take off to see your brother. It's christmas and we need to be together."" That is basically like shitting on my face. I've worked really hard to get to where I am and to have someone say to your face that your career doesn't matter is extremely offensive, and I expressed that to her. 

Example 2: Bought a present for my best friend's engagement and she criticizes the nice gift bag I bought and says ""Oh that must be worth your hourly wage. I would never spend my money on something like that. You can't complain to me that you don't have money when you're spending it carelessly on things like that."" What a shot. It's my freakin best friends engagement. I'm allowed to buy whatever I want. And for the record I'm incredibly cautious with my spending. 

Example 3: She'll approach me with a question/request that is very vague. When I ask for more information on what she's talking about she immediately says ""you are so difficult to talk to. Everyone else I talk to is so agreeable but you just have nothing nice to say, ever."" Not the case- I just want to know the context of the question because from past experience these things are said to frame me in some way and I've been burned. 

Example 4: I'm stressed beyond belief right now. My skin is breaking out like mad, been having other health issues that are probably stress induced. A lot is because of the stress nMom passes onto me (constant nagging, criticizing, arguing with eDad, etc) and if I express to her that I am stressed and that I'd appreciate some support, even just making dinner every now and then (usually I have to cook for myself because she's so disengaged) she'll blow up and get defensive about how there's no way I could be stressed out and that I ""don't have that much on my plate."" Or she'll say that I cause stress on myself and that I'm just a negative person. It just makes me look at her and think, ""REALLY??"" When I am with literally anyone else besides my mom I am a really positive person and super supportive of my peers. She brings out the worst in me because she is so incredibly toxic. 

Example 5: I'm really hoping to land this internship because it'll bring me some great opportunities after grad school but she just shit's on my parade about it. Stuff like ""I don't thin you need to be doing that. Don't internships not pay you? Aren't  you going to be spending a lot of money on gas? It's just not worth it."" I've been really excited when talking to my Dad about the position but for the life of her she can't support anything I do. Dad has basically checked out from standing up to her because their relationship is so bad he just limits sources of conflict at this point, but that's another story. 

So basically, there's just hundreds of little hits I deal with on a daily basis that add up over time and it's wearing me out. I realize the best thing to do is distance yourself as much as possible (in my case, move out of my parents house) but that's not monetarily possible just yet, although I am really working on getting to that point- just hard with school and all. So, how do I cope with her negative personality? What has been your experience with counseling or therapy and do you think it's worth looking into?

TL;DR nMom criticizes everything I do, how do you deal with the conflict and are there external ways of coping that you'd recommend?  "

I myself came from a computer science background but not really web based technology and I started all these seo research about 6 weeks ago (really learned a lot).

I've been assigned to conduct an audit on a website http://www.hilogic.com.my/ but after doing research, I realized that there are no precise rules for SEO.

I've gone through a lot of resources mostly from the top few seo websites like moz and stumbled onto reddit seo (by chance) and was wondering if you guys can give me some advice.

I was actually asked to do a previous audit on another client website and my supervisor said it was all good at first, I got reprimanded later for a shitty job apparently. So I would like some advice on this next one.

I've been doing contract work as a web developer through out the high school, but that was while I was living in Romania and it was all remote.

Internship, part time, gig, volunteering -- I'd love to get my chance to code for a local company. Working alone and remote makes me feel kind of a loner, I'd love to work in a team with people more experienced than I am.

So, is there anyone over here that could help? Maybe recommend a few company names?

Let me start off by saying that I'm sorry that I exploited your team's extremely polite refusal to score a touchdown late in the 4th quarter on Sunday night. You were simply being considerate guests in AT&amp;T Stadium. What I should have done was make a feigned effort like I was going to steal the game right out from under you, but instead thrown an interception that once again earned me the ridicule of a nation. My bad.

You see, I have authored quite a few 4th quarter comebacks in my career. 29 of them now, to be precise. But no matter what I do, I get labeled a choker by every casual football fan in the world, as well as some football ""experts"" who should know better. I swear, you mishandle one field goal attempt in the playoffs and you can never live it down.

So I just had to do what I did. I don't feel great about it, but I want you to understand where I'm coming from.

{related}I'm sorry, Eli Manning. I can see it's already a trying season for you, what with watching your old brother's arm falling off. I can see this only added to your grief. Hang in there, pal. Oh, and beat Philly for me. Thanks!

I'm sorry, Tom Coughlin. You're probably getting fired soon, but you've had a good run! Two rings. I'd kill for two rings. Oh, and doesn't that movie with Robert DeNiro playing an intern look interesting? I bet it has a lot of jokes about millennials and their cell phones. You love those.

I'm sorry, Ben McAdoo. You kind of look like what Kevin Smith would be if he tried to be a jock. I mean that as a compliment, though!

Anyway, I'll see what I can do to make you all look a little better in the rematch later this season.

Yours in the NFC East,

I'm a first semester transfer student, going through the recruiting process and applying for internships. My current resume only lists my cumulative GPA, and it was highly suggested today at a resume/interview info panel that I should be including my major GPA as well.

The following lower-division requirements I assume would be included:

Financial Accounting  
Managerial Accounting  
Macroeconomics  
Microeconomics  
Business Writing  
Legal Environment of Business

However, I had questions about the following:

* The Business Administration program has a lower-division requirement of Business Calculus, which I satisfied by taking Calc I. This should be included in the Major GPA, correct? I should also exclude the other math classes I have taken?

* I took Business 170 (Principles of Small Business Management) at my community college. Even though this class is not listed as a lower-division requirement, would it still count toward my Major GPA?

* Finally, I wanted to get confirmation that a ""Major GPA"" is not that same as an ""Accounting GPA"", which would only include Financial/Managerial (at least for me, so far)?

I'm probably overthinking this, but it seemed a bit subjective and I didn't want to give the impression that I was trying to inflate my GPA.

Thanks in advance.

This afternoon I got a cold call by someone working for the Australian Institute of Management who got my email from one of the number of the various online law support/law newsletter websites i've signed up to related to my uni. We had a chat and he asked if i was interested in taking one of the courses offered at the Institute of management, the thing that really got me interested was that he said that part of the course includes a guaranteed internship at a law firm or in-house legal counsel for a company (most likely a bank). Now this greatly interested me because with the current state of the market an internship is few and far between and i see this as getting my foot in the door. Furthermore this would be great on my resume and give me some professional references and contacts.

I am just curious if anyone on here has any experience with the Australian Institute of Management, whether it was worth it or have had a similar phone call. The only thing that has me a bit suspicious is the fact that the call was unsolicited and the course is not exactly cheap (though its VET-FEE HELP supported) so it is effectively a marketing call.

Any information or anecdotes would greatly be appreciated.

**Everest** (going wide 9/25)

**The Intern** - 9/25 (more comedy, but still aimed at the adult crowd)

**The Martian** - 10/2

**The Walk** - 9/30 IMAX only, 10/9 wide

**Sicario** - 10/2 wide

**99 Homes** - 10/9 wide

**Pawn Sacrifice** - 9/25 wide

I don't want to end up like some of the people on forums with 4 exams passed but because they weren't working in the industry they don't have the work experience/network/or references to get the extra push into an actuary program because no one wants to take a chance on them.

3lc2zq,2,2015-09-17,[Planning] Need General Advice with Scholarship Money (24),TheCiN,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3lc2zq/planning_need_general_advice_with_scholarship/,"I'm going to be receiving a large scholarship this upcoming school year. I don't have any student loans because of the scholarships and grants I've received in the past years, and I've been living off that. I'll have about $30k and I have a general idea of what I want to do. (Note that I won't get all 30k at once. I'll receive roughly 10k every 3 months).

Some background. This scholarship requires me to work for the federal government after I graduate and prevents me from working part-time jobs while I'm in school. This means I won't have a steady income until I graduate in June. I can keep my student assistant job, but it doesn't pay that well. I don't believe I'll have a problem getting a government job as I have interned at NASA previously and a Government Contractor currently. (I'm a compsci major, if this provides more information).

My first purchase will probably be a car. My family isn't very well off and I have many younger siblings so my current car will be handed down because they are starting college. A lot of my money will be going to my family's bills as well because they struggle to pay them.

I've heard that credit unions typically give you a really good APR for loans, and I was thinking about financing my car through one. My family is also friends with a broker, so how would that work out? Would I tell the broker what I've been approved for so they can get a better deal from the dealer? I'm not too sure...

As for credit unions... I wanted to join the NavyFCU because the company I'm interning for is a DoD contractor. I'm not sure if they'll still consider me an employee because I'm an intern, however. I'll be calling today to find out.

I want to save the money/invest/etc, but the current situation my family is in kind of requires me to take action with the money to prevent things from getting worse. All of our credit is bad, as we've been evicted a number of times. We're doing fairly well now, but they don't have an emergency fund anymore because we've gone under so many times that any time they start working on one something bad happens.

In terms of my credit... I have a credit card and I've paid it off whenever I use it. However, I'm a co-signer of one of my older sibling's student loans from a private school... I know that co-signing is a bad idea and I was really hesitant to do it, but they wouldn't have been able to finish if I didn't. They fail to make the payments as they were not able to pass the nursing board exam yet so they aren't making enough money to pay off the loans. We're getting them deferred/forebeared as much as possible, but I'm not sure how long that will last. It's an ugly stain on my previously spotless credit report. This leads me to believe my credit is very bad.

Thank you all for any advice on what I should do at this point!"

&gt; I recently had the opportunity to intern at what this sub refers to as a ""Big 4"" company in a program that specifically targets underrepresented students. I'm a good student, I've TA'd, but I'm not heavily involved in the CS community in my meh, non-target, state school. I have zero side projects, and most of my extracurricular involvement is in non-CS groups. As for other people's perceptions of me, my non-CS peers see me as a ""geek"", and my CS peers don't.
&gt;
One time the topic of internships came up and someone told me, ""You only got it because you're a girl and they're trying to increase diversity. A guy with your resume wouldn't have gotten in."" I hadn't thought of it that way, but yes, come to think of it a lot of the interns in my program were girls or guys from minority groups. But we all still had to have a certain level of talent and ability, right? Or did we actually have an advantage because we're girls?
&gt;
I'm so grateful I got the internship opportunity, but I struggle with the idea that my gender/sex gave me an advantage over other applicants. Does actively increasing diversity reduce quality? I like to think not. I guess what I'm asking, is how do I respond to that? How would you respond to that?"

I wanted some advice regarding which is the best choice for while I am learning, having a homelab or going with a cloud server service. First, I am looking to get started in certain heavy duty projects like machine learning and data analyst projects to help me develop practical skills for my resume as a data scientist, either in enterprise or as a real time security system data center, that's what I am looking into right now for the long term, as well as developing the practical hardware systems architect  and administrator, building and managing my own or my company's data centers. Short term I am looking to develop my own freelance web design career and develop anywhere between small business affordable website to dyanamic web and mobile application more towards medium business in my city, Houston or globally through online communication and business negotiations. Right now I am not attending college and working as a part time server and have some extra money I have been saving and am looking to invest a total of $400 dollars worth in a lump sum in a server. I wanted to go with a physical server to give me the more practical skills I need in building a data center and am currently searching eBay for a cheap used server. My first question is this.

Should I get a used server to begin with?

I have been looking on eBay and all the servers that they list seem to come with a lot for being used but I am new to both the software and hardware side of server administrations and have never purchased or made a server to begin with, and when I compare it to the services provided by cloud servers such as Linode(https://manager.linode.com/linodes/add) or AWS, that give rates going for 4GB of ram, 1TB XFER and 4 CPU cores it seems to have more power than most of the servers offered on eBay and a more advanced dedicated internet connection than I do, but I feel that when the money from my lump sum is used up it will be another unnecessary bill when I should be developing my knowledge with the hardware and having the most control over how the server is used, am I wrong about this? And if so why? 

Should I go with this model or is there another one you can suggest?

http://www.ebay.com/itm/Dell-PowerEdge-R900-2-5-Server-4x2-93GHz-Quad-Core-X7350-64GB-PERC6i-/161821095142?hash=item25ad49f4e6

Any suggested software you can suggest?

Software to get started with VM's and machine learning, anything that can help me develop skills in full stack web development and any software you can suggest to control and expand my server/data center 

What are the next steps you can suggest to expanding my server?

If I go the used route I will be using a portion of the more money I am making from my new internship in Janurary to fund expansion of my server. So any steps or directions in where to go next in building a small data center would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance!"

""Hello my child,"" He said in an omnipotent voice. ""Senpai Kush needs me for Mlg Mario 420 so I'll leave you with Shia. You may or may not be fucked,"" he said before dissolving into gold dust. I was really hopeless now.

The creepypastas sat laughing at me when I heard a voice. Shia was yelling his famous motivational speech through my headphones. It took me a few seconds but I eventually made the conclusion about what he meant. Do it sounds a lot like Dew it, was he really telling me this? In a single motion, I unscrewed the thousands of energy drinks on my desk. The faces of the cryptids turned from joy to dread. I asked Shia once again for assurance and he answered with a strong encouraging ""just do it!"" so powerful that I didn't even doubt for one second about what I did next.

The sounds of drinks spilling all over the desk in that quick moment was the greatest and sexiest sound I had ever heard in my life. A rainbow of red raw energy, orange acid electrolytes and yellow sun shining through green mtn dew with the nice contrast of blue and purple was formed by the fusion of these holy waters. But the best sight was the computer, the sea had completely destroyed it and caused it to go up in disco fire as it slowly burned all of evil spirits. The last thing that I heard before I began typing this up on [Trollpasta Wiki](http://trollpasta.wikia.com/wiki/XX_ProCodKid69.Xx) for interweb points was the voice of ProCodKid69 saying ""NOOOOO!"" in a cliched tone. If you made it to the end then you have a very stable heart and should read the original stories of the spaghettis mentioned in le story. Thank you 4(20) reading. "

Ben2, Sonic.cod, GO_2_ZEEP, TheEyelessOne, TheLaughingOne, Squidicide, RoadKillMickey, yekciMlliKdaoR (backwards/photonegative is so edgy), HappyPuppy666, FABULOUSMouthStrencher, SodaZombie(Send Help), FatMonsterHater, BOB THE B.O.B. and SHREK!!!!!

I WAS LITERALLY FREAKING OUT!!1!! I had dreamed of these characters since my dad went to nosleep for bedtime stories by accident or was it an actually an accident? Illuminati confirmed? Ignoring the fact that I might be killed IRL by these ghastly macaronis, I began spamming the chat with love letters and fan fiction. Here is a transcript below:

Me_irl: OMG You're real. This is the best day of my life. Which fan fiction should we reenact first, JackXJack, PN Mickey X Suicide Mouse, maybe Shrek XXX Reader?

TheLaughingOne: Now I wish I was the eyeless one. Can't unsee.

SHREK: Ogre you kidding me?

RoadKillMickey: Your puns want to make me kill myself again.

yekciMlliKdaoR: I like it.

SodaZombie: Are we really going to listen to him? When he takes his head off he has less brains than me.

HappyPuppy666: He does look good in the photos, beauty gets the fan girls.

Me_irl: Like me_irl!

Squidicide: Fuck this shit I'm out. See you guys and a few kids in hell.

FABULOUSMouthStretcher: Send me the dead kids bodies.

FatMonsterHater: Eating makes you fat.

BOB: 4chan says fuck off bitch

Ben2: You shouldn't have said that! We have kids and manchildren around.

Sonic.cod: Why don't we stop posing for the writer and kill this guy.

Sally.exe: Let's crush him.

Crystal.html: Let's burn him.

S&amp;K.exe: Let's kill him in an obscure way, almost as obscure as scourge.

Bob.exe: Let's let the inter webs decide trough BOB, the other BOB I mean.

BOB: OK who wants to direct the show going for 50$, 100$, 30 Bitcoin, 400 moneypak, 1 DOGECOIN! Sold, now let's get to directing.

Culture 048: Untie him.

Me_irl: Thank you

Culture 048: Now make him take out his Doritos.

Me_irl: WTF are you doin'

Culture 048: Now make him place all of his gangster shit inside the bag like yo bling and yo weed.

I knew what he wanted me to do next. I could feel my hand drifting toward the mtn dew bottle. If I mixed the swaggiest holders in the universe then it would form a swagularity and I would lose all of my swag in the last few moments of my existence. I had nearly given up hope when the room filled with a green glow and discounts filled every nook and cranny. Hail to the motherfucking gaben.

""Hello my child,"" He said in an omnipotent voice. ""Senpai Kush needs me for Mlg Mario 420 so I'll leave you with Shia. You may or may not be fucked,"" he said before dissolving into gold dust. I was really hopeless now.

The creepypastas sat laughing at me when I heard a voice. Shia was yelling his famous motivational speech through my headphones. It took me a few seconds but I eventually made the conclusion about what he meant. Do it sounds a lot like Dew it, was he really telling me this? In a single motion, I unscrewed the thousands of energy drinks on my desk. The faces of the cryptids turned from joy to dread. I asked Shia once again for assurance and he answered with a strong encouraging ""just do it!"" so powerful that I didn't even doubt for one second about what I did next.

The sounds of drinks spilling all over the desk in that quick moment was the greatest and sexiest sound I had ever heard in my life. A rainbow of red raw energy, orange acid electrolytes and yellow sun shining through green mtn dew with the nice contrast of blue and purple was formed by the fusion of these holy waters. But the best sight was the computer, the sea had completely destroyed it and caused it to go up in disco fire as it slowly burned all of evil spirits. The last thing that I heard before I began typing this up on [Trollpasta Wiki](http://trollpasta.wikia.com/wiki/XX_ProCodKid69.Xx) for interweb points was the voice of ProCodKid69 saying ""NOOOOO!"" in a cliched tone. If you made it to the end then you have a very stable heart and should read the original stories of the spaghettis mentioned in le story. Thank you 4(20) reading.

This is my throwaway so I'll be pretty shameless. But it's also my throwaway so I'll be pretty honest with you, no exaggerations.

Time is money. Let me save you money. Here's why you may not want to consider me:

1. I'm asian (fair-skinned, East Asian kind of dude).
2. I'm lean. Average as an asian but smaller in build compared to most Americans.
3. I have a bit of social anxiety.
4. ...which means I am not generally humorous unless I'm very comfortable with you/the setting.
5. I love computers and I take my work seriously.
6. I have been known to snore now and then.

Wow! You got over that quick. Now, let's see why you miiiight see value in me (as a friend or more, I'm not choosy or in a hurry):

1. You like food. I cook well. (Mostly asian dishes, but my American friends love them).
2. You like intelligent banter. I'm well-read and I can converse decently on most topics. Except politics. Trump sucks.
3. You have your moments. I am emotionally developed and have EQ, so I won't come across as thick or insensitive.
4. You care about how I appear when I'm out with you. I care about how I appear, with or without anyone. I am well groomed, neat, clean and won't be a sore on your eyes. I watch my weight and work out regularly. I also don't smell bad or have halitosis.
5. You don't want to live in a dump. Neither do I. My apartment is tastefully furnished, clean, neat and well-organized. You'll even feel safe eating in my bathroom.
6. You want an independent man. Guess who's Mr. DIY! I fix my own car, computer, furniture and apartment. As you can see I'm also now trying to fix my social life.
7. Related to above: you like creativity. I will manage to surprise you.
8. You want someone financially responsible. I'm in the tech field and have received employment offers from several well-known companies. I should be fine financially... after I graduate! (although I'm still living well now on the savings from my past internships)
9. You love animals. I love furry little friends! Strangely enough, the squirrels in my neighborhood park have started to recognize me by sight.

Ok, so the million dollar question now is... how do I look? No pics, but use your left brain:

1. not meek
2. not slitty eyes
3. not feminine (whew)
4. not fat
5. not skinny
6. not ""oldish-looking""
7. not bad dress sense
8. not kidding!

So e-mail me quick, because I tried to save you time earlier and you should save me precious waiting moments in return. Bonus points if you know where I stole my opening line from."

I've always been interested in getting more from my cash, but am not that informed about it. I only took a 2nd year course in financial mathematics, which isn't anything to show other then I'm not completely clueless.

I'm a Math and CS dbl major, and I'm a software developer currently on an internship making pretty good cash. It occurred to me that because I'm pretty informed in the tech space, that I could potentially leverage my knowledge to help make wise investments.

I have an outstanding debt &gt; $25,000. (I don't need to make payments for 6 months after graduation). 
I got into a few discussions with people about whether paying debt off first is the wise option or if investing my money now is if returns &gt; debt interest rate.

After some online research, it seems that I could definitely spread the debt out. I do not see myself making some sort of house down payment until 30. 

So after giving you some background, I would like some help with the following:

1. How can I get into investing? I want to make large returns, and have heard index funding can give you 10%+ returns.
2. Does my tech knowledge help me in the slightest? 
3. I have a little over 10,000 saved just chilling in a student account.  This money makes me feel safe, but I could definitely invest half of it if needed.
4. Am I being a bit delusional with expected returns? I want to make safe investments, but at the same time am not educated in this field. Would it be better to let someone handle my money for a fee?

Having a hard time handling it.,4655434B,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3le85p/i20m_tried_to_kiss_friends20m_gf20f_when_i_was/,"OK Reddit. I need your help identifying how wrong I was/am.

I go to school away from home and recently moved to a new apartment. The apartment is a two bedroom, but my roommate was home for the summer and I was unable to sublet so I was living there alone while I worked at an internship. 

I'm not one of those guys with a huge number of friends, but I do have a few really close ones. One of these is a girl[20F] I'll call K who is dating another friend[20M], who I'll call J. Over the summer, very few of my close friends were actually on campus (maybe 4), and most of those who were, were either busy with work and school or in relationships. I didn't know K too well at the beginning of the summer, but she was on of the few people in my friend group staying at school for the summer. At the time she was mainly J's girlfriend rather than one of my close friends, and J was home for the summer, giving me a chance to get to know K better.


One night, early on in the summer, my friends and I got together to do some drinking. It was K's first night back in town from visiting home and after having a few drinks, it was very apparent that her and J were having issues, as well as her having problems at home. Suffice it to say, the night was very stressful with a lot of drunken crying from her, but in the end, it was actually a real bonding experience and I started to see her as one of my close friends rather than just J's girlfriend.


Over the next few weeks, all those of us at school continued to hang out, including K. Two of my friends are dating and living together so K and I would often walk over to their place together. In this way, I got to know her better and often times, her and I were the only ones in the room not currently attached to has/her partner so we would talk a lot when hanging out.


One night we decide to hang out, drink and watch a movie. That weekend, everyone was busy with their own lives except for K and I, so it ended up being just the two of us. It was a Friday, and I was tired from work so I consumed copious amounts of alcohol. After a few hours I was out. I don't remember a thing from halfway through the movie. All I know is the next morning I wake up and I'm sleeping in her room. Confused and hungover, I left.


After that night, we didn't really talk until the next weekend. While we were walking over to my friends' place, she tells me that apparently when I was drunk, I tried to kiss her. She rejected me and nothing came of it. it was nothing rapey or anything, I was barely awake, but still- I tried to kiss one of my best friend's girlfriend. I apologized to her and felt really bad. I don't remember any of it, but obviously that is no excuse. I knew K and J were fighting and didn't want to be the cause of a breakup so I agree with her not to tell J, a decision I greatly regret looking back.


Over the next few weeks, I kept hanging out with my friends and sometimes with K alone, never drinking as much. I am a single guy, but I had no feelings for her, believe it or not. It was just fun to actually have someone to hang out with who didn't currently have their partner attached at the hip. The more we would hang out, the more J would get mad at her though. He started getting controlling of her, which got me pretty upset. He knew nothing about the slip up and while I felt guilty, I also felt betrayed because he was treating me as if I was a random guy. He constantly pressured her not to hang out with me, and she would then vent that to me. After weeks of getting lectured by J, K was overcome with guilt. The last week she was in town, she started acting strange. When making plans she would give very short replies and act awkwardly towards me. Honestly, I didn't think too much of it because we didn't even talk on a daily basis.


That weekend, the last one she was in town for the summer, she told me that she felt too guilty and had to tell J about the night where I tried to kiss her. Ok, fine. I accept responsibility. I obviously couldn't fault her for that, and it would have just been better to tell him from the start. It was completely a mistake and completely my fault. However, it was hard to feel too bad because of how he had been acting towards her and me. All I heard from her before that was how controlling he was being and it made me angry how much she let him walk all over though, even though he was/is my friend. I didn't want to sacrifice my friendship so at K's request, I messaged J apologizing for what happened. After that weekend she left the area, and I didn't talk to her for about a month and half. 


Fast forward to the fall semester. Things resumed as usual, but I never feel the same around them. The friendship dynamic I have with both of them is very different. I used to be able to hang around either of them, but I feel like I'm being treated unfairly. K doesn't really talk to me at all except in group situations and after seeing the other side of J, my friendship with him just seems so superficial. Honestly, being near them at all makes me angry. It doesn't feel like I could trust either of them which anything, and I get annoyed that after making a close friend over the summer, it feels like I've lost two friends. Am I overreacting? Am I just an asshole? There was no intent to steal anyone's girlfriend or commit adultery and it just feels like I was treated pretty poorly. I'd just really like to hear other people's opinions about the whole thing because it is not the kind of the thing I really want to talk to people in my life about.


   
**tl;dr**: Attempted to kiss friend's girlfriend when I was incredibly drunk and don't remember it. Before finding out about it, he acted like I was a threat to him and pressured his girlfriend not to talk to me. Now, both the friendships feel fucked up. Is my anger justified at all or am I just a complete ass?"

I am reeling, so I apologize if this seems rushed. 

Some backstory: I have lived in the United States with my mom, brother, and my dad since I was 5 (born here too). My sister Haley stayed in Mexico because she was already with her now husband (since age 14) Bill, and because extended family lives there. As a result, we saw each other for holidays and that was about it. It's like we communicated mainly through our mom. 


My mother got cancer, it was stage 4. I was with my ex for 4 years at that point, and he proposed and we got married 2 weeks before my mom died. At the time we were great, and mom got to see us married. It made her so happy. She had always bragged about me.to anyone who would listen. I had always excelled in school and extracurriculars, and went to university with a full ride scholarship, plus several extra scholarships to cover living expenses and books. I studied biology and had some impressive internships. I also moved out at 18 to go to school and never borrowed a cent from my parents. My mother and I talked daily and visited each other all the time. I was the closest to her. After my mother passed away, I tried to speak to Haley a few times. When I stopped reaching out first, that was it. Not once did she check to see how her younger sister was since our mothers death. 


Anyways a year after my mother died, my marriage fell apart. The end was especially traumatic (some abuse, definitely verbal abuse, a miscarriage, and was abandoned with no money on vacation in a foreign country by ex). During this drama Haley suddenly became very interested. Now my sister had a vastly different upbringing. She went to catholic school, never did any drugs or drank, virgin till marriage, the whole deal. During the divorce stuff I needed someone, so I confided in her. It got out that my ex and I had smoked weed in the past. I was also very upset at the time so I was wavering between ""fuck him I can't believe he did this to me, I will be happier without him"" to "" I miss him so much :: sob:: ""


In one year my mother died, my marriage ended and I had a miscarriage. The three worst things I could think of happened. Naturally, it was a devastating time for me. Haley took what I told her and then proceeded to tell everyone  (including the ex and his family) that I was on drugs and delusional and bipolar. I was completely sober and depressed. There were group messages on Facebook where she added anyone remotely close to me to discuss my mental state where she twisted anything I said to her or others. My best friend showed it to me. 


Anyways, that summer my brother and I decided to go to Mexico. I needed to get away from here and see my aunts and cousins. While there Haley and Bill were very nasty. I smoked cigarettes with my aunt and you would think I conjured a demon or something. They saw everything I did with repulsion. God forbid I cried near them over my divorce or very recent miscarriage, they would act like I was insane and tell people I had an episode. They were also overly concerned about my sleep. It was summer and I was going to sleep around 3 or 4 and sleeping until 1 or 2. I was sleeping. But because I wasn't going to bed with her kids she told everyone I never slept. It was very strange and horrible to be around them. Even if I listened to music they would freak out. I guess rock music meant I was on drugs? 


A lot of shit happened after that trip when they drove to my state to stay at my dads for a few days. The most notable was Bill breaking my thumb after I tried to call 911 when he was chasing me around my parents house. He caught me and broke my thumb and really bruised my other arm. I went to the police but Bill and Haley were out of the country the next day so nothing happened, they don't live here. He was chasing me because I moved some chairs when my friend was over at like 3am. Apparently having friends over late in the summer is too crazy and means I'm bipolar and on hard drugs. Before they left my sister told me I deserved Bill's attack because I was being so crazy. After this I cut them out. I went no contact for a long time. Eventually though I needed to know my niece and nephews were okay and I let them back in, bit by bit. 


Now it is years later. I have a new amazing fiancé and a baby and my life is fantastic again. Today Bill and my sister started telling me how they never thought I would come this far from how ""crazy"" I was a few years ago. Then they told me that they had been so concerned back then that they put a powerful antipsychotic/tranquilizer in my drinks. Many times. I went numb. I didn't know what to say. It's like they expected a ""THANKS!"". All I could think of to say was ""that could have interacted with my prescription meds"" and Bill said ""oh no a psychiatrist told me it was safe. He said it sounded like you needed to sleep more and that these pills could knock out a horse, so we put them in your tea. If you didn't fall asleep with 1 we would do 2"".


WHAT THE FUCK, REDDIT. First of all Bill is a fucking lab tech who thinks he's a doctor. I don't know if he stole those drugs  or if some wack job in Mexico actually condoned Bill secretly drugging someone without their consent and ALSO without having ever spoken to me. A psychiatrist here would go to jail for this. They literally could have killed me. I already had a therapist/psychiatrist in the states. Obviously I was following their orders. It's not like I was depressed and refusing treatment, I was in treatment!  Not only that, but I was grieving! 


I have since spoken to my brother. He remembers them planning it, he told them not to, but he didn't know they had gone through with it. Anyways, what do I do? Haley is about to have a baby. We WERE working on repairing our relationship. This is unforgivable though. I feel violated. I was drugged without my consent by my own family. Instead of talking to me or offering to take me to their therapist or something,  THEY DRUGGED ME. After these events I did become suicidal, shortly after all these druggings took place. I'm starting to believe I was reacting to that antipsychotic and me and my therapist had no way of knowing that was even in my system.  Reddit please help. What do I do? I took my son and left earlier after they told me but I haven't said anything to them about what they told me. I told my brother and an aunt. My sister is still trying to message me like normal. I don't want to be near them or talk to them, but should I let them know why? I feel like they will never understand that what they did is wrong and illegal. They have such a warped worldview. Warped by their religion and culture. If I do tell them, what should I say?


*TL;DR* After a divorce and miscarriage, my sister and her husband put a powerful antipsychotic /tranquilizer in my drinks because they thought I needed to sleep more to get over it.


*EDIT 1*

Clearly I will be cutting them out. I think I also want to go back to my therapist just to process this. Before I cut them out I want to try to get them to admit this over text in case they later try to deny it. They are in the states for another 2 weeks. I am unsure whether to unleash the shit storm now or when they leave. Some of you have me worried that they will try to show up or call CPS or something to get me back. So that makes me want to wait until they are far away. Thoughts?

**EDIT 2**
I got her to admit in text. 

Me: Hey I have a question. I remember the pills in the room where me and baby sleep but I forgot to check. What was the name of the pills Bill put in my tea? I just want to know for peace of mind

Haley: I will ask Bill when he's out of the bathroom. But they weren't bad, eh. Just to sleep and relax.

Then they called a bunch so I picked up and she tried to say it was melatonin. Bullshit. I was like I had the package, I remember it was not melatonin. She said oh you were just reading the commercial name for it...
I said ok and hung up. 

I remember the label said antipsychotic. I have seen it and googled it and it was a powerful drug/tranquilizer that seemed to be used for bipolar and schizophrenia. It was in Spanish so I don't remember exactly. I think it may have been Olanzaprina or something like that. Anyways she said she threw it out. And it's all bullshit. They know it was wrong so are trying to say  it was melatonin. I am a biology student I know what melatonin is and that is not what that package said and not what Google said. At the time i had a bad feeling but googled wondering if it was something my dad was taking."

FL;LE, scrolla ner till rubriken ""UPPLÄGG"". Där finns konkreta instruktioner.

**INTRO**

Jag har i min ägo en årgång av 1800 tals-tidningen ""Ny Illustrerad Tidning"", och har länge funderat på att lägga upp någon form av kuriosa från denna; men inte hittat ett passande upplägg.  
När jag tittade i den för ett tag sen, i synnerhet ""förströelse-sidan"" slog det mig dock att de hade ett återkommande inslag som skulle passa på Sweddit som hand i handske: REBUSAR!  
En rebus är ju i grunden inte mer än en förklädd ordvits, och det är ju som bekant det livsblod som pumpar i Sweddits hjärta.

**UPPLÄGG**

Så till saken: De närmsta 11 veckorna tänkte jag mig att vi skulle kunna roa oss med att gissa svaret till skitgamla obskyra rebusar, och sedan titta på det rätta svaret och se om vi kan *förstå* det (Jag sitter på facit, och är ändå inte helt säker på ett par stycken).  
Vissa av de här rebusarna kräver kunskap om ""popkultur"" och företeelser från 1800-talet, vissa är så barnsligt enkla och enfaldiga att det blir svårt att gissa på grund av det.

Jag tänker mig upplägget såhär: Idag får ni en rebus. Förslag till lösningar ges i den här tråden. Nästa fredag kommer ett nytt inlägg som kommer innehålla den/de som ""vann"" (om någon gjorde det), det rätta svaret, samt en ny rebus.  
I det inlägget diskuterar vi också det rätta svaret, om det är något konstigt (vilket det i regel är), och sedan fortsätter detta tills jag inte har fler rebusar.

Skulle det vara så att det här tilltaget inte blir populärt så uppdaterar jag det här inlägget med det rätta svaret, och sedan pratar vi inte mer om detta.

**LÅT SPELET BÖRJA!**

Jag börjar med den (i min mening) enklaste och ""dummaste"" rebusen. Efter att den här publicerades i tidningen återkom inte rebusen som inslag förrän fem nummer senare, så jag tänker gärna att den följdes av en intern kris på redaktionen.

Quick question. I don't have a lot of time to decide, and need your help if I should switch or not.

Wife and I. Both 26, no kids, no investments, newlyweds, renting.
Combined pre tax, pre insurance income around 56k/year (me 32k her 24k, but she has the great insurance we are both on, PEIA). Total debt, mostly student loans, 27.5k. We would like to have kids and a house in the coming years, and want to kill debt, but if I take a pay cut... 

My job (5 minutes from home, tops), people worry about security with a buyout and recent layoffs. My position is probably fine. They've hired new people for it. But still.
New position (15-20 minutes from home, so gas) opens up at 22-23k/year (and they said since I have a bachelor's [that I'm not using, mass communications, it could help showing ive dealt with the public with my internship as well as this job deals with the public] but it could be more pay due to my degree.

Also I have a connection to there, a guy i work with, his wife works there and he put in a great word. Basically said if I applied I would be hired, but we'll see). *They need someone instantly.* They have great insurance just like my wife, a ""retirement package"" (not 401k, my buddy has a 457?) and vacation. I have none of these where I am. However I have SOME OT where I am, like some coming up here shortly.
Haven't had luck moving up here as a contracted employee or getting onto the company. This new job would be a foot in the door as it's a federal+state job.

But that pay cut! Even if I can negotiate (which I don't know how well)

Another thing is my other friend has a shift work job (alternate days/nights) where someone is retiring by the new year. Starts 34k/year + overtime, you have to go through a temp agency first. And then do well and get onboard. 

I also have been fired twice; once for oversight in escalated a couple customer tickets, and another for tardiness/not meeting sales goals. I've thought to say (as the app asks! Agh!! And I should mention both?!)

""That was from 2012 and 2013. When I was newly out of college (December 2010), unmarried, and learning about the real world. I've since married and grown a lot in responsibility and as a person""

Apple Music on desktop feels like something one intern could come up with if he/she played around for a couple of hours in old messy iTunes code. I know there was put more work into it than that, but that what it feels like. And it shouldn't. And it can't feel like a beta version of a music software from 2001.

I can't see how gradual updates could fix this. Apple Music has to be a complete separate program, just like they dropped iPhoto for Photos.

I love the radio service blah blah blah, but the design is absolutely horrendous, and I don't get how it hasn't been fixed and people have been fired. What is happening, I am confused!"

32, f, US. I was sexually abused from ages 1-2. I was diagnosed with PTSD last April, after the flashbacks and nightmares started again. 

Since April, I have little motivation to do anything. This isn't like me at all. I started vocational school and a part-time job at age 17. After I graduated, I was employed full-time for the next decade. At 27, I decided to attend university full-time, while I took care of my ailing grandmother. 

I've always been an excellent student. I do the work, and to the best of my ability.

But since April, I just stopped functioning... I had to ask all my professors for grades of Incomplete and terminate my internship. Didn't take summer classes because I felt like I couldn't handle it. When fall semester started, I was signed up for a full course load and had decided to file as a LLC. Quickly landed my first client.

We're a month in to the day, and I've dropped a class already. I'm anticipating dropping all of my classes, because I don't see how I can pass at this point. I'm planning to refund my client his money and tell him that I am currently unable to do the work, due to poor health.

I feel like such an @$$. I'm afraid dropping all my classes will negatively impact my funding for college... I only have 4 classes and an internship to complete before I graduate. 

But it seems like... All I do is sleep a lot, think until I panic, hang out with family and friends, and try to lose myself in various hobbies. Anything else feels above my ability. I'm disappointed and frustrated with myself.

I've been on Zoloft, Trazadone, Clonazepam, and Lexapro. I was going to counseling, but lost motivation with that as well. (The truth is that I don't connect with my counselor. My case is too far outside her area of expertise.) 

I need to move forward, but don't know how. If you've had, or have, PTSD and you've experienced this, please tell me how you got through this.

Tldr: I used to be motivated at school and work. Since I've been diagnosed with PTSD, acting like a productive adult seems impossible. Help."
3lgoz1,5,2015-09-18,Me [19 F] with my boyfriend [18 M] of 2 years who is having a battle of decisions at the expense of our relationship,throwawayacc343,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lgoz1/me_19_f_with_my_boyfriend_18_m_of_2_years_who_is/,"**I'm so sorry if this is long, but I wanted you all to know the full story before commenting.**

To start off, I am a lurker and frequent reddit, but I have recently been reading a lot of posts through this subreddit, whether to just be for advice applicable to my situation or to take my mind off of everything. But I have decided to post so that any advice I receive will be in the right context. 


I am 18 F, and turning 19 soon. My boyfriend is 17 M and is turning 18 around the same time. Accidentally put the new ages instead of current ones in title. I know this a bit young in comparison with most of this subreddit, but please take this as seriously as you can and know any genuine concern is appreciated.


Background: We have been together for around 2 years. We have had some bumps and breaks in our relationship. We've been forced to break up once by his parents, but at the point we were only together for 2 months, and got back together about a month or 2 later. He originally did not tell me it was his parents that forced us to break up, because he didn't want me to think they hated me. Him and his parents have a bad relationship, and decided to just cut off his new relationship with me. My boyfriend instead told me he just didn't think it would work between us, so maybe I could more easily move on. He told me the truth a month or 2 later because he saw how upset I still was, and we decided to try again.


We stayed together for well over a year and had a happy relationship. Then, his closest friend was diagnosed with cancer and was told she was terminal. It is an understate to say they have been through a lot together, but I won't get into all of that. He broke down and closed himself off, but he was right to. We stayed together after the news but it was difficult to be ourselves. I tried to help him and be there for him as best I could, and for a couple months, I was.


Then, he dropped something unexpected on me, saying he didn't love me anymore. I was heartbroken. I didn't know if he really just didn't love me, or if his best friend's condition prevented him from caring about anything else (I can't blame him for that). I wanted to help him get through this, and I thought that no matter what happened, we could stick together, but he told me he didn't want to be with me. So I believed it was my fault, even though he tried to reassure me I was still an amazing girl. 


A couple months later, we were still in contact, and on the day her surgery was supposed to happen, I asked him what had happened. He said she didn't make it. I told him to talk to me whenever he needed if he needed to, and I felt so incredibly bad. She was too young to pass away, and he had to go through another death of someone close to him... and I couldn't help him.


About 2 more months pass, and we were in slight contact. He needed someone to just talk to, and I wouldn't turn that down. I was in college, and after having 4 months after the break up, I was finally ready to try moving on. I talked to a few classmates, and even went on a date with one. But something was up with my (at this point ex-) boyfriend. He wanted to sit down and talk about something serious. He told me he couldn't be friends anymore, because it hurt too much. I was very confused. He told me he really did love me, and that he lied about the reason he broke up with me in order to protect me. He broke up with me because he could not handle the imminent passing of his closest friend. He was a mess, and he didn't want to put me through that. He knew what it was like to go through this already, and didn't want to hurt me. I appreciate him wanting to protect me, but lying about not loving me seems worse than letting me go because of a serious circumstance... I don't know. Regardless, he told me he loved me and couldn't just be my friend. At the time, his biological father (whom he does not live with, but he has a good relationship with) was fixing to move away. My (ex-) boyfriend wanted to take advantage of this since his life was really shitty at the time. But, if he could be with me, he'd be happy and stay here in a heartbeat. He begged me to take him back, because I was one of the only things that made him happy in his shitty life. I was adamant on whether I should get back together with him, or try to move on here in college, so I was extremely stressed for a while. I was adamant because I was scared of getting my heart broken again (but then again, you never really know if you will) and because he really needed me, and I did still have feelings for him. I decided to try it out with him for a little while, and if I was comfortable, we could start seriously being a couple again. He was ok with that. In that time, I realized I really do still love him, and I didn't want to be with anyone else. We have been together since then (almost another year).


Now, my boyfriend's mother has pushed him to get an education in marine biology and one day become a marine biologist. But, a few months ago, he told me he has had thoughts about wanting to do something else in life, something understandable for us who are young. He wanted to be a worship pastor, helping others and teaching kids about God. He is religious and does go to church twice a week, so it wasn't too out of the blue, but we don't really have many religious talks, so it was kind of a shock to me how much it meant to him. I am also agnostic, so while I don't really believe in what he believes, I am supportive and was willing to compromise in the future. I've offered to go and have been to his church, and was going to take a Bible as Literature class at my college to get a better understanding. Everything seemed fine, until he told me any religious leader has to follow most or all guidelines in order to even be considered for a position... one of those guidelines being your significant other must share your beliefs and values. I was very upset when I heard this, until he told me he would give up this career for me. I thought this was the most selfless thing and I really appreciated it. 


NOW, onto what has most recently happened. He needed to seriously talk. He told me of an opportunity he was offered by his church, one he has been at for many years and the leaders know him well. He was offered a free ride to a religious college, far away but in our state, an internship for a worship pastor, and an almost guaranteed job afterwards. But, those who offered said he could not still be with me if he wants to accept it. He was conflicted on what to do... he was offered this almost 4 months ago and only has a couple weeks left to give an answer. He had multiple anxiety attacks and was even hospitalized because of how stressful this decision is. It involves either staying with me and forgetting about this opportunity, or leaving me and taking it. He doesn't want to leave me, and I don't want to leave him. He then told me something very important regarding this decision... he had promised his dying best friend he would one day become a pastor, as they both knew it was something he really wanted to do in life. He told me he needs to keep this promise... but he also promised me a few things.


When we got back together a year ago, he promised me he loved me and promised me he would stay with me. I take an immense value in promises and I can't believe he would break them. He wants to uphold her promise. I understand she is no longer here and that is so tragic and maybe he has a right to keep that promise... but I feel so betrayed and that my promises are just ok to be broken. I am heartbroken beyond belief. Our anniversary was last month and I was so happy. We talked about marriage, and where we'd live, and kids... he was the only person I imagined myself with. I know we are young reddit, but there are high school sweethearts out there who have stayed together. I haven't ever just dated around, and I was really serious about him and he was with me, too. Maybe this is just all bad timing, or maybe I'm a sack of shit.

We have almost a month left before he must make his decision and I don't know what to do. When he told me he had to keep her promise I felt like he already had his mind set to leave me. I completely broke down. I wanted to die, and maybe I still do. I don't want to do anything. I need someone's help, and I don't have any close friends I want to say all this to. I want this all anonymous. Please help, reddit, before I am lost.


**EDIT** I wanted to add some more to my story, since I was so upset I realized I forgot some things. Earlier in the relationship (about 1.5 years ago) I kissed another guy.. It was the worst mistake of my life. Reddit says a cheater is always a cheater but I don't believe so. I would never do something like that again and I feel like it wasn't even me. He forgave me in spite of my actions and I was so appreciative that he could forgive me. I always tried to make sure he was loved and the only one for me, and I believe he is.
Another thing is that he also has health issues. He is scared that one day his health issues will take him early and that he may not get to fulfill his dreams. I understand that. But what is confusing to me is that he told me I was one of his dreams, not just being a pastor. 
My point of this edit is that we've been through so much (unfortunate breakups and both of us making mistakes) yet we worked through everything and stayed together. So why should this be any different? 
   
**tl;dr: Have had bumps with my boyfriend of 2 years, we love each other, after an unfortunate breakup he begged to be with me and promised he loved me and promised to stay with me, has been offered an opportunity in which he would have to leave me, doesn't want to leave but promised his dying closest friend, he has a month to decide, help.**"

I could hear his soothing, bass voice drawl over the name. Am-nes-tee.

“I started last Monday.”

“How do you like it?”

“I was nervous at first because I thought I had to dress up and be formal. But the atmosphere is really relaxed. The staff doesn't treat the interns like they're beneath them. The people are really interesting and the work is too. And the best thing is the casual dress code. I hate dressing formally.”

Troy studied the untamed scruff on my face. “I can tell.” He paused before asking, “And what about you, Pranavi? How is school?”

“I went to prom!” my sister eagerly replied.

Troy chuckled. “That's right, you did. Gautam, what's this I hear about Pranavi going to prom when she's just a freshman and you not going at all?”

I shrugged. 

“How are your dance moves?”

“He's a pretty bad dancer,” Pranavi chimed in. 

“Is that so?” He laughed, his eyes shining. “Maybe I can help you. My friend and I, we invented this move. What was it called? I can't remember. But one night, we went to a club and we started doing this.” He raised his arms in the air and rhythmically bobbed his head between them. “And what you've got to do, you've got to time it with the music, and then do this . . .” He bobbed his head to one side. “Then this . . .” And he bobbed his head to the other side. “After that, you've got to loosen up your shoulders and move like this!” He continued to bob his head while holding up his palms and waving his arms.

Pranavi giggled as I tried to imitate him.

I sighed. “I can't do it.” 

Troy laughed. “When my friend I went to this dance party, we were the only ones doing this move. But we came back to the club a week later and everybody was doing it!” He smiled and performed the dance once more. 

I was about to try again when movement beyond the metal grille behind Troy interrupted us. 

“See that guy over there?” Troy looked over at a man behind the grille. The man sported tinted glasses and a large afro.
 
“He looks sort of like Elvis,” my mother commented. 
He noticed us watching him and walked over until he stood directly behind Troy and smiled. “What's up Troy?”

“Just hanging out with my friends, Carlton. This is Kavita, Pranavi, and Gautam.”

“You're Gautam? The one who wrote a book on chess? And the poems?”

“Yeah,” I replied weakly. 

“Troy keeps talking about you guys all the time!” I smiled weakly, and he continued, “Well you folks have a nice day.” 

As he walked off, Troy leaned closer and said, “You've seen him here before. Back in the day he was known as the Columbus Strangler. In the seventies, they say he raped and killed a bunch of old white women in Columbus. Probably some of the most brutal murders committed by anyone in here.  He was abandoned when he was young, by his father. Bounced around for a while as a teenager before all of this started happening. If you look around, a lot of these guys have similar stories. Lotta guys who were abandoned or abused as kids. They're poor and they get into drugs and then robbing people, and they head down that path until they end up here.”

We tried to process the haphazard shattering of a life encapsulated in a few sentences with words flowing so unquestioningly after each other that the path from victimized child to brutal killer seemed inevitable, even natural.

“Our society assumes they're beyond repair. And trust me, many of them are. But eighty or ninety percent of the people here could be rehabilitated. Our society believes we can solve our problems by locking people away or killing them. But they don't realize how much human potential is wasted and destroyed by our system, how much these people can actually contribute to society if they were given the chance. And instead of real leaders who are willing to take a stand and say things are wrong, we just get corrupt politicians who want to stay in power."" Troy looked at me. “That's why we need young people to change things—because there is so much that is wrong.” He looked away, staring thoughtfully into the distance. “When you're behind bars, you get a clear view of society crumbling.”

The guards gave us a meaningful look through the other side of the bars. Time was up. Troy hugged each of us, and we walked toward the door. A female guard in her early forties unlocked the door and let us out. We walked out, and two guards quickly entered the visitation cell and surrounded Troy. As they began handcuffing him, Troy called out, “Gautam . . . remember, the only person who can stop you from doing something is you.”

I'm starting an internship for my Masters in Social Work program and I need some help! Most of my wardrobe is rather drab and plain (yay for being broke!) so I've been doing some shopping to help me look more professional.

I bought [this skirt](http://www.lanebryant.com/apparel/plus-size-skirts/ponte-circle-skirt/21288c59p224774/index.pro) in the yellow, red, and navy. I also have a similar one in black.

I have a few questions about how to wear these. I'm a size 26/28/30.

First, would these look ok with turtleneck sweaters? I bought one in black and one in a cream color.

Also, what kind of shoes would you pair the with? All I can seem to find are suede shoes/boots, but I live in Western New York and it rains and snows a lot here in the fall/winter, so I need something that can withstand the weather. I also don't want to wear flats all the time and I can't do large heels. I have very large calves so anything taller than an ankle boot is most likely a no-go. I also don't know where I will be from day to day, so ideally I would prefer something that I don't have to change in to when I get to my destination.

Finally, would it be ok to pair these with tights? I tend to go without any kind of panty hose or tights, but again, I may be out in the cold so I would rather not completely freeze.

Also, regarding turtleneck sweaters, I love scarves. Can I pair a scarf with such a sweater?

Thanks!!"

I graduated in may, and I'm currently an intern. There is a position available that I think I will receive. I'm working in a snowy mountainous climate, and my current truck does not have 4x4. 

As it stands, I feel that a $30,000 tag on a car with &lt;50,000 miles (and the features I want/need for my climate) is acceptable.

    Income/output
    *in:~$3100/mo
    *out:~$888/mo
    *$250 rent&amp;utilities (family vacation home)
    *$200 food
    *$~100 possible pet expenses
    *$238 student loans
    *$100 gas, average when figuring for weeks when I don't travel, etc.


I currently have no car payment, and my only debt is about ~$25k in student loans (which I will begin paying in a few months). I will likely also take over my own phone plan (+$60/mo) as well as car insurance, when I buy my own vehicle. I live about ~600 miles from home, so I travel fairly frequently. 

If I do not decide to purchase a new vehicle, I will need to invest $~1500 into getting my 4 wheel drive fixed, as well as an unknown amount to fix my heating/AC in the car (due to the climate I'm in, it was an unnecessary expense to have it fixed sooner). 

I have around $5000 saved from this summer, and my income will more than double if I am offered this salary position. 

I do not intend to stay in this location for more than 5 years, but for right now I enjoy the work and couldn't find cheaper living arrangements (without room-mates) anywhere else.

Am I reaching too far with this $30,000 price tag, or do you agree that a good, reliable truck/suv is a good investment for my future?"

And In the span of 2 months we broke up and she moved on and found someone else. I fucking know it's this guy who she tweeted and stuff. 


I gave my everything to help her. She grew up being oppressed by her mother, and she had issues about her self image. I have always supported her in every way possible. 


But then again, that's how I've always lived, always endlessly doing things for others and not expecting anything in return. 


My family was broken, at 12 my father went to jail for hitting my mom, I had to bite his arm to make him let go when he was strangling her. I grew up taking care of my brother and sister and I never thought I'll be loved other than the obligatory love from my family. 


I went into her life, I made her feel so much better about herself, her mom gave her the freedom to do whatever she wanted because her mom trusted me. I guess I was stupid, I thought just by giving her my all she would do the same. 


This year has been so shit for me, I haven't been doing well at all for my internship, my grandma passed away, my dad owed his previous company 10k for fraud, which I fucking paid 1k a month out of the 1.4k I get, when I had my own school fees to deal with. All the stress piled on me and she left me when it wasn't tolerable... I wonder if she was already talking to this guy when we were having issues. 


But... Saying all that, at the end of it, I know she loved me as much as I loved her, I could never hate her. She gave me her all and was willing to die for me. But at the end of it... The time wasn't right, I wasn't right... But I learnt that in time all wounds would heal. 


Thank you for giving me your all babe. I have learnt so much about myself. And I'll grow to be much more amazing and awesome, and I know you'll be happy about it too."

I prefer to role play on google docs and use a messenger to chat and set things up, messengers such as K Messenger, yahoo msger, skype and google chat/ docs.

&lt;-- History Archives Accessed --&gt; &lt;-- East Commonwealth Field Report New York City Recon Mission - 08/10/2256 --&gt; The city is a hopeless cause. What remains of the buildings there are are losing a fight against nature with mutated plants growing at an exponential rate and feral animals running wild in the streets.

We were able to gather some supplies and equipment from Vault 5 to the north of the city, but Vault 4, located under the ruins of Grand Central Station, is a bust. The door is sealed tight and I don't think they'll be opening it anytime soon.

While exiting the city we encountered a party of well-armed soldiers claiming to be scouting for supplies from a settlement in the Pittsburgh area. They were accompanied by several ragged looking survivors who seemed to be in some distress.

Due to their heavily armaments and well-trained appearance we disengaged and will be returning to Great Lanta shortly.

Overseer Notes - Father Armstrong, Carter Amendment - 03/23/2161-01 Damn fool child has really gone too far this time. Young Emily Harris was down in MedBay this morning for her annual medical and reported being molested sexually by the girl. At this rate we won't have anyone willing to visit the doctor once old Peabody dies.

I told her father the girl needed to be married off by now, it's not natural for her to be unwed at her age and it only serves to encourage sin. Best course is to get rid of her ASAP, so young Peggy Carter can take her place and one day be Chief Medical Officer instead.

I'm sending Scarlett out into the city to find some fresh medical supplies, Lord knows we need them. If by some miracle she does manage to survive some good may yet come of this whole mess.

Blinking her eyes as she lifted her hand to cover them Scarlett stepped up the staircase into the largest room she'd ever seen. Across the hall the sun glared mightily thought the large windows as she peered around at the unfamiliar surroundings. Everywhere she looked there seemed to be rubble, but she was undeterred, this was the first time in generations anyone had left the Vault, and she felt honoured to have been chosen.

Slowly she began to make her way over to the window, climbing up the pile of rubble before looking out over the city. To anyone else the overgrown vista may have been depressing, but to Scarlett it was a new horizon filled with possibilities. As she looked out over the crumbling buildings only one thought passed through her mind.

'I wonder if there's anyone out there, and I wonder if they wanna get laid...'


------------------------------------

Charlie 'Lee' Stuart originates from southern Texas, following his mother's untimely death in 2071 Lee spent his teenage years living on a cattle ranch in America with his biological father. Culture formed his opinions and skill set towards hunting and a dislike for 'city slicking' tourists as his hick father would spatter.

Then in 2077 during the Great War, the bombs fell decimating the globe.

Somehow Lee survived the radiation through a long and painful period of necrosis and mutation, transforming him into what the 'smoothskins' called a freak, a zombie, a ghoul.

Over the next two centuries Lee would remember less and less about his pre-war youth.

Appearance/Personality Lee is a very reclusive and shrouded character. He will dress in a way that covers his identity from hostile smoothskins. Lee wears a duster and boots with a stormchaser hat, neck scarf goggles which cover his face entirely. His voice is very gravely and raspy from long term vocal chord damage, this is somewhat muffled by his scarf but those who know the sound of a ghoul are likely to notice so he tends to stick to gestures with new or unfamiliar people. Lee tends rarely leaves his dwelling without his rifle slung on his back.

Weapon of Choice - Scoped and Modified .308 Hunting Rifle Originally one of his father's rifles, Lee has managed to maintain the firearm over 200 years through constant changes and upgrades. Currently equipped with a 3.5x scope and extended 10 shot clip this bolt action rifle has been Lee's main source of survival and income.

(Lee also carries an old military combat knife)

Dwelling Lee lives in a hand built shack in the remote wasteland, built on a good vantage point for hunting and defence reasons.

Inside is one open space with a camp bed, desk and a piles upon piles of books in a somewhat organized mess.

SPECIAL: Strength: 3 - Doughy Baby Do ghouls even lift? Lee's deteriorated body will struggle to overpower tough obstacles.

Perception: 8 - Monocled Falcon Don't let the cloudy orbs for eyes confuse you, Lee is extremely alert.

Endurance: 7 - Tough as Nails Compared to a smoothskin Lee can take one heck of a beating by the elements

Charisma: 2 - Old Hermit Nods and grunts are his social forte

Intelligence: 6 - Gifted Above average intelligence, mainly through reading and self taught skills

Agility: 5 - Under Control Nothing noteworthy about his swiftness, the fact he can run away from smoothskins is a feat in itself.

Luck: 5 - Coin Flip Unless through a perk or a level of skill dictates otherwise Lee has a pretty 50/50 chance in most situations.

PERKS/TRAITS:

Comprehension (One additional skill point gained for every book read) Lee spends a lot of time reading the piles and piles of scavenged literature in his den.

Hunter (75% Critical Damage Boost against Animals) Lee is very skilled at hunting game for both consumption and trade.

Scrounger (Increased change to find ammunition) While he's an above average scavenger Lee seems to have this uncanny knack of finding ammo even when he doesn't need or even want it.

Radiation Immune (Racial Trait) Lee isn't only immune to radiation but seems to acquire healing properties from being near high radiation or drinking irradiated water.

Sharpshooter (+2 Perception during range finding) &amp; Trigger Discipline (20% accuracy, 20% reduced fire rate) Lee lays in wait, biding his time with a patience only a ghoul's lifespan can muster. Lee isn't quick to shoot but when he does it usually counts.

Outdoorsman (Increased chance of special encounters, reduced chance of bad encounters) Over the past two centuries Lee has adopted a good eye for trouble, avoiding it well while out in the wastelands.

I'm starting an internship for my Masters in Social Work program and I need some help! Most of my wardrobe is rather drab and plain (yay for being broke!) so I've been doing some shopping to help me look more professional.

I bought [this skirt](http://www.lanebryant.com/apparel/plus-size-skirts/ponte-circle-skirt/21288c59p224774/index.pro) in the yellow, red, and navy. I also have a similar one in black.

I have a few questions about how to wear these. I'm a size 26/28/30.

First, would these look ok with turtleneck sweaters? I bought one in black and one in a cream color.

Also, what kind of shoes would you pair the with? All I can seem to find are suede shoes/boots, but I live in Western New York and it rains and snows a lot here in the fall/winter, so I need something that can withstand the weather. I also don't want to wear flats all the time and I can't do large heels. I have very large calves so anything taller than an ankle boot is most likely a no-go. I also don't know where I will be from day to day, so ideally I would prefer something that I don't have to change in to when I get to my destination.

Finally, would it be ok to pair these with tights? I tend to go without any kind of panty hose or tights, but again, I may be out in the cold so I would rather not completely freeze.

Also, regarding turtleneck sweaters, I love scarves. Can I pair a scarf with such a sweater?

Thanks!!"

I've passed P and am currently studying for FM and sitting for it in October. I'm brushing up on technical skills with an online course, but what else can I do to stand out? What level of knowledge should I have about the health insurance industry? Anything in particular you guys think I should research? I've sent over 100 applications and this is the one I got a call back for. Most internships I feel I'm not getting because I've already graduated and they want current students, and entry-level positions want previous internship experience, so I feel like this is my one shot. Any advice would be awesome, even if it's to tell me to chill out and calm down because I really am freaking out. "
3lj3s6,2,2015-09-19,[BUSINESS] Networking to find networking,maxis2k,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/3lj3s6/business_networking_to_find_networking/,"So I have been spending a lot of time searching, both on this subreddit and elsewhere, about what to do to actually find connections in the industry.

But I keep running into dead ends at pretty much every avenue.  Some sources tell people to find an internship or work as a writing assistant.  But are careful to emphasize that it is hard to find these jobs without already knowing someone in the business.  Still others say that you should seek out a manager or agent.  But once again, they emphasize that most managers or agents prefer someone who is already established.  Still others say you should go to local writer meet ups.  But I have yet to actually find any of those from searching on google.  Probably for good reason as you would most likely have several thousand people randomly showing up to your event even if you just posted a vague hint about it on facebook.

So I'm pretty much stumped.  What are some proven ways to meet people in the industry to form those early connections?  Short of getting lucky and winning a writing contest or getting a reply on a query letter, I really have no clue where to even start.  I know there must be some low key events where fledgling writers meet established industry professionals and other writers.  But where does someone look to find these events?

For the record, I live in between San Diego and Los Angeles.  So I'm pretty open to going to any event in the Southern California area.  Thank you for anyone who is able to point me in the right direction."

I met this coworker girl and our relationship began and it seems we like both each other, however, being co-workers there are some issues and I might have crosses the line a few times in the work place.

Right now she is kind of scared to continue the relationship due to my father's position, although not being her direct boss, still holds a lot on influence on the company. She fears she might face problems on her job if trouble arises on our relationship (I've told her I would take responsibility for anything that happened, but my word can't guarantee anything)

Moreover, over the last days I've tried to push myself into her life and even asking her out and other stuff about her personal life at the office (although it was after work hours, but still there were other co-workers around)

Now our relationship is in trouble because she tells me I've crossed the line and she values her professional life too much to risk it like this 

I've talked to her about having to settle rules and boundaries in our relationship, and trying very much to avoid bringing my father into play

I really care for this girl and even if I can't get into an intimate relationship, I would be fine with being a close friend to her as she is important to me.

I want to become his friend, hangout after work, do stuff on weekends, but so far it's like I can't get into her out-of-work life, we both like each other very much.

What would be a good approach to talking to her about setting the boundaries and rules for our relationship?

And also, what should I do if I want to be more important to her, like someone she wants to hangout with after work? I feel like there is love but no friendship in our relation. 


Tl;dr

Me (21/m) and coworker (23/f) have feelings for each other but it seems I can't get into get personal life outside of work and I crossed the line trying to do so. She is cautious because my father is her indirect boss at the company, what do I do to get closer to her as a friend so we can hangout after work and on weekends?"

I get introduced to this guy on the first day and he's the one that assigns my work so we spend a little bit of time together everyday.


This was two weeks ago, and I've fallen. Hard. When I look at him my heart drops and I can't stop looking into his eyes. Ticks every box in my opinion in what I'd look for in a guy. 


We always exchange extended glances and I see him looking at me from his desk while I look at my computer. When we talk he really looks into my eyes in an intense way that he doesn't do with other people. This is so mushy! I apologise. He invites me to sit in on meetings and sits super close to me whenever we talk: our legs are centimetres away from each others... 


I leave next week and I don't know what to do. Maybe it's a crush, but it feels like more.

What do I do? Does it sound like he likes me?

3lk69g,2,2015-09-19,I [M22] may have made a mistake with my [F21] ex last night.,thrizzleawizzel,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lk69g/i_m22_may_have_made_a_mistake_with_my_f21_ex_last/,"My ex and I broke up last Sunday. We broke up for a myriad of reasons, but mostly because we are in different places in our lives.

She's graduating this semester and has tons of cool internships and stuff, I on the other hand have been struggling with depression and dependence on weed for the past year. My lack of motivation this past year really was a problem and lead to our eventual break up. I did alright in school to where no one on the outside really noticed anything was wrong but in reality I was using weed as my social crutch to avoid having to meet people in college.

Now in that sense, I'm happy we broke up. Regardless of our relationship, I couldn't continue the way I was and be able to get to where I want to in life. In the time that we've broken up I've gotten 2 internships, one doing marketing for a design build company, the other running social media for a marketing company and I'm being considered for a financial advisor training program. (I also have a business I'm trying to start but that's under wraps).
Most importantly I gave away all my weed stuff and I've started to meet with a therapist, I had my first meeting yesterday and I'm going to start biweekly meetings. Depression is something I've suffered throughout my life and something i finally need to tackle myself.

So my ex and I decided to meet up for dinner last night to talk and debrief, our break up wasn't bad so I wasn't really worried. We talked all throughout dinner and didn't really eat and were friendly. We go back to my place and keep talking, eventually I bring up the possibility of getting back together eventually. She makes a lot of good points about how the relationship is too fresh and we wouldn't be thinking clearly, we should take some time to be single, date around and get our lives in check before we could ever think about starting to date again (years probably).

I start getting anxious and ask her if it's okay if she leaves and she's totally okay with the idea. We get up to say goodbye and just start kissing frantically, falling on the bed. We keep making out and stuff until she says ""I want this physically, but I know it would hurt both of us too much."" I agree and we get up and I walk her out, on the way out she says ""I'll see you later.""

Should I apologize for what happened? I've felt so guilty/anxious since it happened. I want to get over her but also keep the door open for the future. I'm just having a rough time and want some objective perspective. What do you guys think I should do?

I was thinking about learning SharePoint. I have previous experience from internship I attended during holidays, but I only got some basic experience (creating libraries, lists, inserting HTML, CSS and scripts, basics of workflow and so on). I wanted to learn more, but I have no access to SP, and I cant set up my own installation, since I dont have required HW. I saw Microsoft offers SP online for 5$/month and I was thinking about getting it. 

My question is, does SP online offer all / most of the functions, that on-premise version has? Would I be able to practise developing intranet, customize it, develop workflows, manage access rights (in case there were more users) and so on? Is it even possible to buy SP online for only 1 user?

* Height: ~1,82 M
* Weight: ~55 KG
* Duration of complaint: 3 Months
* Syndroms: ADHD-C, Gilles de la tourette, Bipolar, Sleep deprevation (which is going way better now)

**Story:**

I have a history with drugs usage (No abusing). When I was 16 I used to smoke joints every week, sometimes 5 days in the week and sometimes 1 or 2. I used to notice when I couldn't think straight and had trouble in school because of it. So at these times I quit, most times 3 months, sometimes a little less.

Today the day I smoke way less weed, Last year I smoked 1 to 3 joints on a friday but nothing more. As of late I have quit fully to let my brain repair it self from any possible damages.

**The Issue**

I am having a weird pressure inside my skull on top of my brain, I feel it from time to time but mostly everyday. sometimes it goes away but that is mostly when I am focussed on other stuff. 

I am having trouble recalling memories from last week, yesterday and don't even ask me about my childhood. I am forgetting a lot of stuff. 

When I am at my intern I can't keep track of everything and mostly see myself forgetting what I was supposed to do when I am busy with other things I needed to do. (I had this before, but never this badly)

When I am speaking I forget what I wanted to say (rarely but it happens on multiple occasions a day), or I can't recall a word that I needed to say. It is like my mother language is fading.

I went to a doctor and told him about my drug use and he told me that that couldn't have hurt my brain, as long as I let it rest for now. But I forgot to tell him about this problem and want to know if I should call them again and say that I have this issue.

either way, Does anyone know what this could be or is?

Thanks a lot.

Let me introduce myself: I'm currently in my third year computer science student at a university. My study is mainly focused at making games.

I’m currently working at a quick pased action 2D MOBA game. I already have programmed the basic game structure and I’ve made a game design document. The main goal of making the game is for my (and ofcourse your) portfolio, but we can also publish it online, for free probably.

3lkwjd,0,2015-09-19,"Me [25F] with my parents [54 M/ 48F], can't stand living with them, and can't find a job anywhere.",myriadel,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lkwjd/me_25f_with_my_parents_54_m_48f_cant_stand_living/,"Hi there reddit. Sorry if I may sound spoiled. I know that I am a bit, or ungrateful... it is just that I just hear this from them, and don't know what to think of me.

Also, I have trouble communicating. I'm working with my psychologist about this, to gather courage to speak and be assertive, but it is a bit impossible when the other side don't want to hear anything they don't agree with. 

So. The context is this: I live in Brazil, and right now, the economy is bad. I just graduated in Architecture, and my university is in my hometown, so I'm living with my parents. My family does not believe in the daughters living in another house in the same city, so the years I lived without them was when I did my exchange years (2). I don't have any debt since the education was free, and my family has a good ecomical situation, but we have to hold out the expenses, what I understand and trying to do. 

The money problem is this: my mother is a compulsive buyer. She likes to spend with clothes, shoes, and everything. She does not work, and my father has to control her, which causes a lot of fighting since she thinks that no one gives her the value she thinks she deserve. She also have a dream of a perfect family, and I don't share a lot of her values. So, last month I graduated, and since the beggining, I did not want a graduation party (something common around here), but agreed to do something to celebrated, specially because my family thinks this is important. I also made clear that I did not want a big party, because what I really wanted to do was travel, and it was agreed that this was going to be a graduation gift. 

So yeah, my mother completely ignored this after dreaming with the perfect party. She decided to spend a LOT, I mean, a LOT for something that I was clear that I did not wanted/ though it was useless. Now, this is always used against me, since there was a lot of money there, and they say that I am not grateful for it since I told her it was her party, not mine (it was nice, but I do not think it was worth to spend that much), and my trip (that I am saving my own money to help with) won't happen at all. 

They are also super controlling. I am 25 y.o., but they treat me like a little child, the same with my sister. We need to have permissions (?!) to do stuff, etc. And oh boy... when we disagree. They just dismiss everything we say. 

Even my psychologist gets surprised with the way they treat us, since she can't understand how they don't see us for what we are and act. 

So yeah, I know that to end this I must leave my house. I am in an internship in a local office, and... well, I get like 150$ a month working part time. I know that there is a opportunity for a full time job that will pay me 400$ a month for 6 months, since it is a temporary one, but it is where I live, so the money would be good but I would still live here, since this does not pay for rent and expenses if I was to live by myself. 

(Yeah, as you can see, the situation is bad)

So Im looking for jobs offers in other cities, asking for friends if they know of opportunities, etc, since they work mostly by indications. I'm going to do a test in São Paulo the end of the month (GRE, I'm trying to get a scholarship for my master in 2016 so I can live the country), and I will probably print my resumé and knock the doors of offices and try for something, since e-mails and calls do not work. I have friends there, as well cousins, so I would be able do share rent, since they also don't pay well for someone in my position. 

So the thing is. I can't stand fighting anymore. I can't stand being dismissed, as well as my opinions and thoughts, everytime. And although I am trying to leave this situation, it seems that there is no hope. 

As I told you guys, my mother don't know how to hold expenses. So this was passed to me and my sister. But I'm trying to change this, we never had a financial education, but I am reading topics of financial advice, I am trying to cut my expenses, and learn how to budget. They just think that I'm being cute and that I should not worry with this / it is not my place to say things about money / etc(?!)

I know that I am complaining a lot about my parents, but they are nice people in the end. It is just that the situation reached an unsustainable point.

So... what can I do that it is my power? I really don't know. I am trying everything and I really can't stand this anymore. 

Sorry if my writing is confuse, we just had a big fight right know and all the feelings are flowing inside me. I am also trying to write letter for them to say everything on my mind without fighting, but I really believe that they will just dismiss what I am saying and think that I am even more childish.

As an intern or resident, you are not exactly clearing expenses. In fact, you average less than minimum wage.  Vet school for me cost over 45,000 a year. We are all swimming in loans. Interns and residents work obscene hours. Right now I average 75 hours a week. Some weeks I’m pushing 100 hours. Sleeping more than 6 hours has become a delicious luxury.

Prior to this specialty training, I spent 4 years in veterinary school, took a 7 hour long national boards exam, and spent 4.5 years getting my bachelors degree and doing all of the pre-requisite classes for vet school. 

When I was in vet school (the first three years) my life consisted of lectures, labs, and studying (with heavy binge drinking on the occasional weekend night thrown in for good measure). Just for perspective – in college 12 credits per semester is considered a full time student. In vet school you take 21-23 credits per semester. The final year was my clinical year, where I worked playing doctor under supervising clinicians for one year in a teaching hospital. That year I was happier because I could get my hands dirty and not just sit on my butt in a classroom all day. However, that year I also worked 36 hours straight more than once. I would go home for an hour to shower and refresh my food supplies after 24, then come back for another 12. 

I have not had a life outside of my chosen career in 5 years. 
Five years where I have been unable to pursue hobbies that interest me. 
Five years in which I have poured my heart, soul, body, and mind into learning how to practice medicine. 
Five years in which my personal life has been on hold, because frankly I do not have enough time or emotional energy to sustain a healthy relationship 

It’s not a surprise to me that veterinarians are three times more likely to consider suicide than the general populace (Source: https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/150401d.aspx). I am not complaining about this training so much as trying to explain, although I’m sure it sounds like a complaint. There is this curious one-upsmanship that happens when you have a really shitty job… where you try to outdo one another with how badly you’ve had it. I am not trying to say “woe is me”, I chose this path with open eyes. I know that rigorous training helps mold us into what we need to be. My patients deserve to have the absolute best care I can provide, and all of this training will allow me to do just that. But I want to give you an idea of the time commitment involved in becoming a veterinarian and a veterinary specialist before I start getting these things off my chest. 

With that prelude, let me just rant.

I don’t know how I am going to sustain this lifestyle or put up with this bullshit long enough to become a specialist. Or even remain in this career.

 Don’t get me wrong, I love helping animals and their people. I love being able to make a difference in someone’s life. I love how challenging the field can be, how I’m always being pushed to use my brain and balance so many different things at once. I even don’t mind euthanizing animals, ones that are very ill or are suffering – I feel that it is a gift to be able to peacefully end their life, give them at least somewhat of a dignified death. I care for my patients, all of them. Even the ones that are shitting all over me, the ones that are covered in fleas, the ones that are just waiting for the chance to take my hand off. 

However, I am so fucking sick and tired of everything right now. Maybe it’s just the geographic location I currently work in, but it’s constant insanity. I’m not even sure how to explain it to someone who has not been on this side of the stethoscope (so to speak), but I’ll try. I see the worst side of people every day. There’s this combination of ignorance, anger, and despair that permeates most of them. I see emergency cases as half of my internship, which I’m sure makes me more prone to seeing the bad aspects of humanity. I take the brunt of these emotions. It is not my fault your dog got hit by a car, but I am the first person who can provide an outlet for your fear, your pain, your anger, your despair. I am so deeply sorry for you and your poor dog, and I want to help so badly. But I can’t do that if you keep getting in the way and don’t try to understand what I’m saying or start accusing me of being a money-grubbing monster who doesn’t care about your pet. Medicine isn’t a magic wand that I can wave over them and make everything instantly better. There are things that are not fixable no matter how hard we try or how much is put into them. It is my job to tell you what I know and what science tells us we should recommend, and it is your job to listen to what is being said to you and process it as a thinking, rational person. Yesterday, I was part of CPR on a dog for 35 minutes because the owner would not accept that their dog was dead (due in large part to their decision to not treat the dog’s previously diagnosed endocrine disorder due to fear of medication). We probably broke ribs, the dog had bloody fluid coming out of her nose and endotracheal tube, bile pouring out of her mouth, I’m pretty sure the defibrillation burned her skin, and she defecated and urinated on herself. The owner then spent four hours in an exam room with the dog, kissing its body (we cleaned her up as best we could, but still) and sobbing hysterically.

Death is not pretty, and it’s even uglier when it’s denied. 

I want to help your pet. I want you to know what is going on. I want you to be able to make the most informed decisions you can, and I want you to know that I am not judging you for making decisions based on finances. I want to minimize the cost for you (believe me I do, I am not getting kickbacks from anything… I live off $3 frozen meals and Clif Bars for fucks sake, so when I recommend something it’s because it’s what science has shown is best for your pet), but it is going to cost money because we don’t get our equipment or technicians for free. I have to recommend the absolute best level of care, I cannot tell just by looking at you what you are going to want or are able to afford. From there, we can decide what is the best we can do within your budget together. Insurance has made people believe their healthcare is inexpensive, so they are shocked when a week-long hospital stay for their dog ends up costing several thousand dollars. Compare the price of a total hip replacement in a human versus in a dog for example, $31,000 for people versus $5,000 for a dog. I recently had an owner tell me she felt it was morally wrong to be spending as much money on a dog as she had on hers and that she would not be back in two weeks for the recommended recheck. I did not recommend that recheck based on finances, or the desire to see her (this is a client that makes me want to impale myself after conversations with her), but on the fact that her dog has an immune-disorder which was very recently diagnosed and we are trying to decrease her immune-suppressive medication to a manageable level without her having a relapse. Argh.

There are bad veterinarians out there, those that practice bad medicine or recommend shady things to drive up the bill. Unfortunately, no amount of testing and interviews will completely eliminate them from the profession. These people make me want to commit murder, because they destroy so much trust and just generally ruin everything for all of us in the profession that want to do the right thing. Mostly though, veterinarians are people who want to help you and your pet. If you’re not comfortable with yours, please try others until you find someone you like. Also keep in mind that if your dog has an advanced or complicated disease, it would be best to go to a specialist – that is the only thing they deal with after all. Please do not wait until your pet is on death’s doorstep, bring it in to an emergency clinic, and get mad when they’re not Jesus. If you think something is wrong with your pet, GO TO THE VET. And if they don’t give you a satisfactory answer, go to another one or a specialist. Your dog vomiting every 3 days is not normal, even if they’ve been doing that their whole life.  

With that said, I love you guys and your furry companions. I would give you all big hugs but it would probably freak you out. "

My brother and I have an excellent relationship, really close bff's etc.
He has an AWESOME girlfriend that he's been dating for over a year.  They've been doing long distance for about 6 months now while she works at an internship and he finishes grad school.

Anyway, my brother and I don't have cars ( I don't need one, he has REALLY bad anxiety behind the wheel after a bad crash that he's been taking meds for).  So his girlfriend travels to him 3 hours every weekend to spend time with him.

She's been doing this for roughly 3 months, (the other 3 months she was abroad) and I'm worried that she may get tired of having to drive every single weekend to him.  My brother says there isn't a bus he can take, but I don't think he's looked because I know my brother and he's kind of lazy af.  

My question is: should I kind of meddle in his business and look for buses to her location so that maybe he can visit her sometime? The other thing is she's living with her parents, so maybe that's why he doesn't visit.  Should I look up bus fare and uber, or should I just mind my own business and let them figure it out when it comes up?
I really like her and he loves her a lot, and I don't want their relationship to be strained because she's traveling to him all the time. I tend to overthink things and worry about things so I don't know if I should just stop thinking about it and let them figure it out.  Thanks for any input you have in advance.



   
**tl;dr**: My brother and his girlfriend are doing long distance (it's been maybe 6 months) and she comes to visit every weekend, driving almost 3 hours there and back.  My brother doesn't have a car so he never visits, but I'm worried that this will put a strain in the relationship since it's only her that's traveling.  Should I suggest he pay for a bus ticket once in a while, or maybe treat her to nice dinner everytime she comes, or should I stay out of it"

I'm a recent graduate from the US looking to get a MS in biomed engineering. I'm very intrigued by rwth aachen and have some questions about both the school and the biomed program.

as an international, should I live in the dorms? Since there's limited space, how difficult is it to get into the dorms? Also, what are the dorms like?  

I haven't learned much German yet, and I plan on learning more, but how much of the surrounding area speaks english?  

For those in the biomed engineering program, what are the classes like? Where do people normally go for the 4 week internship? What are some examples of the final thesis?  

How selective is the school? What should I aim to get on the GRE?  

lastly, what are some things you like about the school/area and what are some things you dislike?

3lmv2h,3,2015-09-19,"Might get into a good PsyD program, but it will end up being ~$250,000 in loans and it terrifies me",LordP123,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3lmv2h/might_get_into_a_good_psyd_program_but_it_will/,"I know it's what I want to do. Originally I thought my application wouldn't be strong enough, but everyone is telling me differently. Even if I don't get in, I'll probably get into a Masters program (which is still super expensive for Clinical Psychology/most programs, btw) and then switch to PsyD.

PsyD programs (for those who do not know) are basically PhD programs for psychology but they have less of a research focus and more of a clinical experience focus (though typically most programs do require you to do some kind of dissertation). As a result, there is usually not much funding given to PsyD students.

So typically PsyD students have to take out loans in tuition + cost of living for each semester. This will add up to be anywhere from $150k - $250k for 5 years of schooling depending on where you go. Roughly $200k -$250k for me.

I want to do it, but it's daunting. People have told me ways of cutting that debt down (such as trying to find paid clinical positions while in school for internships, working in places that the government wants you to work to cut down an extra $50k over 2 years, etc) but it's still super daunting.

That is a huge financial responsibility. And I know after 5 years I'll be well trained and can consider it to be an investment in my future, but it scares me.

I mean, my mind is made up so I'm not looking for reasons not to do it :P I just needed to get this off my chest.

3lnny9,2,2015-09-20,How would I use 3D Blocking animations in a showreel/portfolio?,GreatWhiteShork,animationcareer,https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/3lnny9/how_would_i_use_3d_blocking_animations_in_a/,"**Context**

Right now, I'm doing work which involves rigging and animating 15 simple 3D characters. The process is: I do the main key poses and some inbetween frames to dictate the animation and timing, and then I send it off to interns to finish the animations. 

So when I'm all done, all I have to show are blocking animations. 

**Question**

Now I'm happy with a lot of my animations, but I'm just wondering how I would use them in a showreel or portfolio. I haven't really seen any examples of them in a portfolio (I've seen a few examples where they are linearly interpolated, but I personally find that hideous. My blocking is all stepped). Would it be best if I spent time fully animating some of my favourite cycles? Or is there a way to use the stepped animations?

For the most part, my concern is that in a portfolio of smooth animations, some blocking animations will be jarring and annoying-to-read. So I'm kind of tossing around in my head ""What's a good way to implement it?""

So, how would I use 3D blocking animations in a showreel or portfolio?"

Subscribed user here for a while now.

I'm actually unsure of posting this, since, for 4 or so months now I've been feeling well about myself, although, as we all know, depression is a thing that doesn't really ""just go away"".

I just wanted to tell you guys what the title says : People can sometimes be inconsiderate and/or hasty on their opinions on others. It can be bad for regular people, but even more so when you're already depressed. So I don't know, I guess that I just wanted to tell you guys this to try and at least mitigate the damage.

Why do I do this? Well, let's just say that lately, I've been doing well and all, but still pretty much a new person (intern) in the job. Even though the journey has been awesome, I've had moments (and will continue to have moments) where people engrain self-doubt in me.

Now, I know, self-doubt can be a great thing, but the thing is, some people just spout hasty judgments like that. It's always easy to say ""Hey, do the good thing, and don't do the bad thing"" and people do this A LOT. Even the nicest ones.

I guess what I'm trying to say here is that, you, yes YOU (reading this) are ""fine"" (this isn't a typical moralizing speech, I KNOW what depression is and what it does to people). What I'm saying is, we already have a lot on our plate by being depressed, and I encourage you to just sweep off what people ""think"" they know about you (yes, even the closest people in our lives can have the most WRONG impressions of us and make quick judgments).

TL;DR - I know it's easier said than done and that to self-doubt and to receive criticism is good, BUT we know ourselves better than most people, and I think it's good for us to sweep off hasty/wrong judgments made about us by people (even the closest ones)"
3loltb,47,2015-09-20,Japan Quest Day 2 - Kojima Jeans St,Glyptyc,rawdenim,https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/3loltb/japan_quest_day_2_kojima_jeans_st/,"Photo smackdown: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dogson/albums/72157658803160141/page1





In Kojima, there is a piece of rock strata showing indigo layers in the crust, as though to say, this color is embedded in the very guts of this place. Brothers, I have been to the holy land, and it is very good. 


I arrived 2 days ago, and rolled into Jeans St. an hour before their closing time (6PM). It was all but deserted. I was able to slide into Kamikaze Attack and a few other random ones. In one store, the owner called out an intern from the back, a girl from Holland who was interning in a different shop every week. She spoke fluent english, and I tried to gather intel about Kojima. When I said, ""so most of the stores are pretty much all in this area,"" she responded, ""That's not necessarily the case..."" and alluded to a few secret, out of the way shops. Alas, she couldn't explain to me where they were, and even telling me their names seemed to be a problem. But this lit a fire in me even more to find the sick shit. More on that later.



The sun fell into the ocean, and suddenly everything was closed. On my way out of Jean Street, I found what looked like an abandoned bank building turned into some artists loft. Huge 20-foot chunks of driftwood were leaned up against the exterior. Chickenwire mesh lined the inside of the windows. An eerie pale light emanated from within, and I saw the outline of a Roman bust in the window. Was this some twisted vaporwave BDSM dungeon? I would find out tomorrow. 




Past the bank, I found an extremely dapper older gentleman smoking a cigarette on the sidewalk. He was clearly the owner of the shop opposite him. I nodded hopefully inside. He threw his butt down and ushered me inside.


 

Ill-crypto white denim, white linen, indigo x indigo jogging pants, scarves - all of it too small. I was so pressed over the white denim I asked for a size too small ""just in case."" He cracked up and oblidged me. Not even close. 




Somewhat despondent, back out into the Kojima darkness I went. Damn it, I though to myself. I was really down to spend some money today. 




Then - like a shining beacon in the darkness - completely lit up - inhabited - unlocked - OPEN - THE MOMOTARO FLAGSHIP STORE. 




Gentlemen, this is the real shiznit. Every pair on offer lined up against the back wall like a fucking lululemon dealership; a porcelain statuette of the Peach Boy himself, complete with black eyes and black nipples, standing guard over the entrance; and yes, just like PBJ Harajuku, the huge store was staffed solely by one smart, very cute, english-speaking japanese girl. 

I spent some fucking money. 
The most gorgeous handmade shirts, faded teal with light grey pinstripes. Others, inked in deep indigo. Pink battle-stripe pants. Solid-color basic tshirts with battle stripes on the breast pocket. I'd been corresponding with denimio over one in particular (listed as out of stock on denimio's website), a jade green Momotaro tshirt. After checking my size ( wanted XXL due to shrinking) and a 3-course volley back and forth, denimio wrote and told me the shirts were out of production. No more existed. Lo and behold, there in the Momotaro flagship store, the last 2 jade green Momo t-shirts, size XXL. So, the law of attraction exists or I'm just insanely lucky. 

They also have ""Momo Drops"", some kind of custom lemon heads I wasn't brave enough to buy. I tried on everything, a kid in a candy store. The changing room advertised custom battle stripe painting, whatever you want - pink, green, purple, blue. I picked up a couple awesome shirts. The girl was so nice, she siced me hard with a big sheet of various Momotaro stickers!!!

Victorious, and glowing, I went down the street and hit a canned peach nectar to celebrate. Then it was back to the hotel for sake, onsen, and weird as f*** japanese TV. 




Next day: rolled up to Okayama in the morning to peep Kōraku-en, one of the top 3 japanese gardens. I'd been gathering intel at very shop, and I learned that Kojima is so tiny, if you're there any longer than a day, it's good to hit day trips into Okayama, which is about 24 minutes  by JR.


So, more shops. Kojima Genes by far has the most experimental shit in the game - (or so I thought) - gold or pink shiny lamé butt pocket jeans, cross-stitched pockets, two texture pant legs, weird zig-zagging cross stitches. Just balls out. 

Strike Gold (next to PBJ, which, again, is only open Saturday and Sunday) has gorgeous deep red weft. They also had a gold lamé weft, which, if I hadn't already copped 3 pairs in the past week, I would've thrown down hard on. They were absolutely posh, beautiful, crazy, and those gold fades would turn heads forever. I would wear those golden slut till well in my 80s. 



IndiGorilla sold weird little items, all made of denim, including the most awkward earrings ever -a 4"" rectangle of denim with three buttons on it, on a hook. ?????? Why not. 



Next day. Yeah, now it's on. 

I took an enormous amount of pictures. I hit every shop. Having already copped Momotaros in Taipei and PBJ deep indigo in Harajuku, I wasn't out to buy any more jeans. But I still wanted to see everything available and explore, just learn what's out there. Most of the owners were pretty psyched to see a foreigner, some were totally inscrutable or distant, tho. The Kamikaze attack guy was working on some pairs inside out, and seemed distant. Probably just meditating on his jeans. 


Around noon, I found a tiny little hobbit-hole of a coffeeshop right in the middle of jeans street. I hit an espresso and a chocolate sundae. The super adorable old lady running the place lodged two sticks of pocky in the ice cream. I got nice and turnt up, then went back on the hunt.


Store after store, it all began to blur together, until I happened upon this random store called Pallets. Right away I felt a spiritual vibe - old school hip hop playing, oversized puffy coats coated in ridiculously awesome, shiny red, gold, and plum glaze; super high quality denim, cool little store. The owner, Yoshi, had just opened his store and moved in his merch from the warehouse. We talked for a long time - he's spent years traveling and has lived in Brooklyn, LA, New Orleans, many other places. Super international dude. After about an hour, I felt my coffee buzz waning and wanted to keep exploring. I asked him about these ""secret"" other stores, and he gave me directions to one. I jumped on his wifi, punched in directions and set off on my way.


10 seconds later he came running up beside me and offered to drive me there. He pulls his car around - space grey Mini S - and we roll to secret location 1 blasting 2Pac.

Turns out he took me to Kapital's headquarters - a HUGE complex that looks like a byzantine ziggurat. After exchanging instagrams, we made plans to hang out after his store closed. 


Kapital. Holy fack. Imagine Dali, Matisse and Picasso opened a denim shop. The whole south wall is just coated 20 feet high with demented constructs - overalls and japanese flight suits next to gold lamé tabi, white painter pants with brown suede patches, 30-foot long pant legs, denim leggings with built-in socks. I can't even describe the enormity of the madness happening in this place, except to say that when I decided to go for the painter's paints, one of the awesome staff said he'd have them hemmed in 15 minutes. 


These services, I noticed, varied wildly by shop. PBJ Harajuku said they could hem my pants, but it would take 7-8 business days. Hinoya could do it in an hour. Now Kapital, proving themselves not only the most fierce designers in the game, but also the most elite customer service ever. My head was spinning, and just when I thought it couldn't get any better, they showed me into their ART AND DESIGN LIBRARY while I waited for my pants. 


I fell into it for an hour. Every book in there, hyper-curated. John Cage's poems next to the notebooks of Rudolf Steiner. Vintage alchemical texts next to photo journals of Joshua Tree and Salton Sea desert landscapes. Astronomical texts I'll never understand, laden with equations and star maps, the most epic collision of art and science possible. 


I bought so much stuff, I had to immediately get a taxi to the post office and fire the swag home - no way this would fit in my luggage. 


Later that night, Yoshi took me to a conveyer belt sushi spot, we rapped about Japanese vs. American culture, various designers; he told me about his wife and his business. He showed me invoices from his clients - Balenciaga and Tom Ford among them. Then he introduced me to his friends, the owner of a local coffee shop and various DJs. Best night ever. 


If you guys are ever in town, definitely hit up Yoshi... he's good people and loves foreigners. 


And so ends my Kojima epic. I wish I could fade these pants faster - there are so many masterpieces I couldn't avail myself of, including the Oni at Hinoya. But at the end of the day, having sampled almost everything, my favorite is still the Momotaros I got in Taipei...they just feel *finished* and they fit so impeccably, I don't have to fight them into submission. Having said that, there is a brand and a cut out there for everyone. I've seen enough to know that. I'm super grateful for this community and everyone that helped inform my decision to hunt this stuff down. Peace!

3loqse,16,2015-09-20,Clouded Awareness,purple_crow,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3loqse/clouded_awareness/,"I found this subreddit after thinking deeply for the past few weeks about my weed use. I started smoking in 2008 when I graduated high school and entered my college years. My boyfriend at the time became a dealer so it was around frequently. I dabbled in a few other drugs,  but even the more addictive ones like benzos or cocaine didn't do much for me. But weed. Weed was another story. I loved how I could live the college dream. Go to class high, hang out with like minded individuals and get high, study high, and still do well....while high. It helped me with my anxiety and seemed to be the answer to everything. After things went south with my drug dealer boyfriend (which is a whole another topic but will leave it out), I moved back home with parents where I continued to go to college and do well. I got super into yoga and had a great routine of going to class, going to yoga, studying and hanging out with friends. I'd get high occasionally but not as frequently as I used to, maybe a couple of times a week. In about 2011, I started dating a new guy who happened to have a kid, was in the same department for our majors and was an overall great guy. 

Throughout the next few years I lived at home with my parents, continued to go to school, had this awesome boyfriend but began to smoke more heavily. Which was funny, because he was older and hadn't smoked in YEARS. It was mainly me smoking while I was alone. I went back to my old ways but this time just seemed different. I  graduated college in 2012, took an internship somewhere and had a full time job by the beginning of 2013. I still lived at home with my parents but started to find ways to get high at home. I started to get ballsier and would smoke before family dinner after my nightly yoga session. I started to smoke before I would run errands with my dad. I got to the point where I was comfortable at my new job and tried smoking a bit before work. It felt like the college days all over again, like I was being sneaky and had this trick for life that no one else seemed to know: I could get high AND be an adult. How cool is that?  But things started to get worse. I wasn't going to yoga as much and found excuses like I was too tired after work or would go another day. I wanted a change of pace, wasn't happy that I was living at home in my hometown. I wanted to go out and explore the world and live in another city but instead I turned inward and just began smoking more. I started gaining weight and to this day still have the same 20 pounds I swore I would lose 2 years ago. I kept making bets with myself that I'd lose the weight but nothing was working and I continued to smoke regularly and continue to function.

Exactly a year ago I moved in with my wonderful boyfriend and his kid who is here 50% of the time. Now that I moved out, there weren't those obstacles in place anymore for smoking. I was 25, starting my second job after college with more money, and I could smoke all day on a Saturday and no one would stop me. Life seemed pretty perfect. I was finally in control of everything and didn't have to live with my high-tension parents (which again, is a whole another story). When we first moved in, I was trying really hard to be susy homemaker. Making sure the apartment was picked up, planning out meals and cleaning up afterward. But then I started getting complacent again and found ways to smoke all the time. Came home from work, smoked. Just made an awesome meal that you know will taste delicious, better smoke before. Going to the grocery store? Better smoke. Have to go over to parents house? I'll smoke just a little before. I eventually got to the point where smoking before work was okay again, I could totally do it and get away with it. But my motivation has started to slip and I no longer feel like the high-functioning citizen like I used to in college. I hate getting up in the morning. Even after a full 8 hours, I dread going to work. While I'm at work, it's a countdown until it's over. I no longer care about what my hair looks like or that I haven't taken the time to fix it in weeks. I'm content with eating crappier food when I used to always be concerned about my diet and health. I find myself feening when I run out and doing things like scraping the bowl for resin. My appetite is shot now without weed and I no longer have a desire to eat unless I'm high. Nothing excites me or entertains me anymore and I feel like the fun has been sucked out of life.

I know this is a lot of rambling but I needed a place to start spilling out all of this nonsense. I know there is so much more in my head but this is where I started. I'd just like to hear any other similar stories, words of advice, ANYTHING. Life just feels so blah right now. "

&gt;be The Sausage Bouquet, 18-21 (or at least the people there - minus Puck and Clay). My friend group.

&gt;still don't be Trenchcoat Guy, 24. Thankfully minus trenchcoat. Was cut off long ago.

---

I thought that it was over. I thought I could live my life in California, free from the stresses of the Neckbeard Mafia, medical card by my side, and hanging out with my friends down there. In the four months I could afford to fly back, I could work on my internship, throw some parties with my friends from my town, and have fun. Of course, that was way too much to expect, and the results drove me back to you guys around July.

Every month or so, my friend Lilly drives down to see me. I've never mentioned Lilly in passing, but she's a friend from college who lives in Milwaukee. She's also very well-connected in my friend group, and she's pretty great. Lilly is very blunt – she's even less afraid than I am to say what's on her mind, and she's one of the few people who can hold her own with me in a matter of how dark we are. Essentially, imagine a female, more socially awkward version of me, and you have Lilly.

So this Tuesday, she got off of work and drove down to see me because she told Hulk and Mrs. Hulk that she wanted to go to their wedding. Since the entire Sausage Bouquet got off of work, and we needed to pre-game a bit before the big party, we all decided to have one last wings night before we went on the road. Eight people decided to show up to this event – me, Tony, Phil, Kaner, Ffej, Bigsby, Lexi, and Lilly. Since my house is closest in the group and wings were on sale, we met up there, smoked, and drove on our way.

The group had some time to kill, so we decided to browse the mall and grab a few extra entertainment needs. Our first stop was FYE – the same FYE where the cockblocking incident happened – because Bigsby was too broke to buy an auxiliary adapter for his car and he wanted some CDs. Lilly was off on her own in the rock section, because she (and some of the rest of the group) is fairly grungy, and I was off browsing the hip-hop section with Bigsby, Tony and Lexi. I saw an album I liked, showed the group, and had plans to buy it once they approved. Everything was fine... until the distinctive drawl of the employee on shift caught my ear.

&gt;”YOU GUYS FINDING EVERYTHING OKAY?”

*No.* It couldn't be him. I scared him off, and Ma Dukes burned what was left of the bridge between us before I could. He couldn't be talking to us, and he surely would have backed off if I was there. Right? *Right?*

Then, I looked up. If his monotone didn't confirm my fears, the mediocre goatee did. Some sadistic, vengeful god had re-introduced Trenchcoat Guy into my life. He was a bit character now, but regardless, he was back, and apparently undeterred from talking to me and my friends. Last time he upgraded from a bit role, he essentially forced his way from background extra into one of the creepier antagonists of my life. I was justifiably pretty anxious about him actually recognizing me, so I turned around. Bigsby sensed something was wrong and wound up bailing me out.

&gt;”Yeah, I think we're fine.”

&gt;”HOW ABOUT YOU?”

This time, he was talking to Lilly, very clearly staring at her chest. This would be the point where I'd step in and take the bullet for my friend, but she handled herself well when it came to creeps. Instead of faking having a boyfriend or being disinterested in a relationship, she'd just tell guys who were coming onto her too hard to back off. Considering his off-putting nature, I knew she'd rip this kid apart, and that he'd be an emotionally destroyed man at the end.

&gt;”I'm good.”

&gt;”WELL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST LET ME KNOW AND I'LL BE THERE,” he said with a wink.

&gt;”I'm not into you, dude. Fuck off.”

His face was a mixture of “How did she know I liked her” and “Well, fuck”. After being rejected, he just trudged over to his perch behind the register and stood there, waiting for people to come by. I texted Bigsby to pick up the album for me and that I'd pay him back, left FYE with Lilly, and we hid in the GameStop across the mall until he left. By some ungodly miracle, even though I was wearing the same Toews jersey that I wore in the previous stories, he never noticed me walk out, and my friends texted me when I left.

She had heard my stories about Trenchcoat Guy, but she never thought she'd have to deal with him firsthand. I'm not worried about her – he deleted me off of his Facebook, and he doesn't have any mutual friends in my group, so they have no pathway to find each other. Unless we stop there when she's visiting, she won't ever have to deal with the kid again. Either way, she didn't seem shaken up by it, but was more surprised that one of the main villains of my life story had his eye on her.

I'm guessing he approached us because he recognized some of the group from Anyville High, but he didn't seem to notice me between the throwback Nuggets hat (that I switched to the back when he was looking away to disguise myself) and the Toews jersey (although I've worn it pretty frequently for so long that I was wearing it during Episode 3, it's one of the least distinguishable articles of clothing anyone in Illinois could wear). 

I have no clue if he recognized me but just didn't want to say hi, or wanted to stay professional, or just straight up didn't realize I was part of that group now, and I don't care to find out firsthand. Feel free to post your own thoughts about if he recognized me here. I never saw him after that, and I won't be back in town until Thanksgiving, so I'm hoping for the best.

Until then, if a guy working at an FYE in central Illinois starts talking to you and you get creepy vibes... pay no attention to the man behind the trenchcoat."

I’ve done some job searches on indeed, jobsdb etc.. and there doesn’t seem to be many tech companies like the US. Does anyone have experience with what the job prospects are like in Hong Kong? Are there any industries that are good for software, particularly startups?


Also, what are the working hours and culture like in Hong Kong? I have heard that people are very competitive here and work long hours.

3lq78f,6,2015-09-20,My AP is getting married on Saturday. I'm the mistress. Please help.,pleasedontgetmarried,adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/3lq78f/my_ap_is_getting_married_on_saturday_im_the/,"I guess I'm posting this here because you guys would be the only ones to understand. And I'm posting from the other side of the situation. I'm the mistress... and the woman I love is getting married to another woman on Saturday and I feel like I'm dying. I guess I hope you guys can give me some perspective. I'm single, which is obviously a huge red flag for why this is so terrible.

She initiated the whole thing. We met at work, I was an intern. She and I became friends, honestly best friends. I felt so comfortable with her. I didn't have a lot of friends and I really needed her in my life. I knew she was getting married, and in my mind she was off limits. I had only ever been with one person before her. I am not a very sexual person. I hung out with her and her family, and her and her SO. I finally felt included in something.

She flirted with me one day, and I jokingly flirted back. She said maybe in another life something would come off it. But we both kept doing it, and it escalated. I said that we should stop a few times, because of her SO. I felt bad. I knew she was getting married soon. But I couldn't help myself, and we started it back up again... and it kept escalating, and finally we slept together. It was amazing. I felt myself falling in love with her. We talked every day, all day.  Her SO saw a facebook message from me telling her how beautiful she is after she sent a picture. It was rather innocent, for us. She was suspicious but she told her that we were just friends. We kept going.

We fucked more. Eventually she left her email logged in and her SO used her computer. She saw an email between the two of us, talking about ""last night"" and how sometimes you need it soft and sometimes you just need to get fucked. She cried, asked her if we fucked a thousand times. She told her no, that we just kissed and that was it. That's all that they have talked about it. She still denies that anything more than kissing happened. That was about three months ago.

We've gotten more careful. No more texts, calls, and she had to block me on facebook. Her SO saw me on her phone bill. She emails me all day from a secret email. Her SO asked for all her passwords. We don't go to her house to fuck anymore, it's either in  our cars or my house if I can.

I had to move away for a job. It's really hard but I can't really see her often anyway because her SO is so suspicious. We have plans for multiple dates after her wedding. I don't know if I can last until then. I feel like I'm dying.

We've been saying that we love each other for a very long time. I know that she loves me, and I know that she loves her fiancee. She says that she feels like she needs to 'try' with her because she has had her life planned out for so long. I know they were going to try to have kids later this year, but her SO said they should wait because of what happened. She took it hard and keeps saying that she ruined her life. She says things like she'll never be happy, she can't have everything that she wants, she's a bad person for doing this to me. 

I just feel so helpless. I don't know what to do. Honestly, part of me wants to tell her SO but I really can't do that. Number one it's totally shitty and number two I want to be with her and that would never happen if I told her. I just really don't think she should get married, and I don't think this is the way to start a marriage. And I feel like if she gets married she isn't going to get divorced. It's the end. But when you cheat for the first time in 11 years a few months before your wedding something isn't right... and she pursued me.

I feel so incredibly helpless. This isn't right. I really feel like she shouldn't be getting married but there's nothing for me to say or do. I love her more than anything. I know that we should stop, and we both say it every day, but we can't. We keep torturing ourselves. I want to be with her so badly and I know we would be happy. I just feel like she is so comfortable and so scared to hurt her family and her fiancee. I understand, but it's excruciating. Please help. I can't shake the feeling like I need to do something but there isn't anything to do other than beg her. If she won't leave her now she won't leave her later. But I know this isn't right."

The most I could think of would be as a repair tech at Staples, which the closest one is a half hour away. Office Max doesn't seem to want me, and Geek Squad ""Needs"" more experience/education. I'm sure there are things out there that I'm not thinking of."
3lqqdn,33,2015-09-20,My [24F] boyfriend [26M] has sort of...pre-broken-up with me. I have no idea how to take this.,prebreakupthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lqqdn/my_24f_boyfriend_26m_has_sort_ofprebrokenup_with/,"We've been together for about a year and a half, he moved in with me 2 months ago. Overall I'd say we've had a pretty good relationship. We have some rough areas in our relationship - I'm more open/communicative than he is, he's more ""vanilla"" sexually than I am - but we're a pretty good team and do well together. Or, at least, I thought.

Let's back up to about 6 months ago, when we started discussing moving in together. He and I are both in graduate school; however, he's graduating this fall, and I'm graduating next fall. He was going to be gone for an internship over the summer, and brought up that he'd like to move in with me when he got back in September, since he'd have to leave again in 6 months and would have a hard time finding a lease for that amount of time. He'd basically been living with me by then anyway, so I said I thought that was a great idea. 

Before he left for the summer, he kinda made a throwaway comment about how moving in ""probably didn't mean to him what it means to other people"", but wouldn't really explain it further. I took that to mean that he didn't consider it a move toward marriage or anything - which was great, because I'm not looking to get married anytime soon either. Didn't think much of it other than that.

Well, over the summer he got a great offer for a job that would start in February, two months after he was set to graduate. I was super happy for him, and after he'd had a few days to sit with the idea, I asked him how he thought our relationship would factor into the equation, since the job is two states away from where we're living currently, but in a city that I was very interested in eventually moving to as well. He said he wanted to discuss that in person (which I found frustrating, because he tends to just put off difficult conversations indefinitely), but I said that was okay. Things like that are never fun to discuss over Skype, I get it.

He comes back in early August, moves in, talks a ton about how much he missed me, everything seems hunky-dory. However, it's at this point been almost 3 months since that initial conversation, and I'm getting antsy that it hasn't been resolved. 

So, a little over a week ago, I finally sat him down and said that we *needed* to have that conversation. Not that I needed to have a solid, ""yes, I want to stay together and have you eventually move to ____ city with me"" or, ""no, I definitely don't want to do that"" answer this far ahead of time, but that I needed to have at least some idea where he was at with all this.

His immediate response was that he definitely does not think we should stay together after he leaves. He wouldn't tell me why, but he did seem really upset, to the point where I spent about an hour trying to comfort him (he almost never cries, so I knew this was a big deal). I told him I was glad he was honest with me, and that's true. However, I've just felt so conflicted ever since, I have no idea what to do or how to feel about this.

It really bothers me that he won't even give me a reason why he doesn't want to stay together, but I really don't fault him for that. Like, it's frustrating, but I get it - he doesn't ""owe"" me a reason or anything. I think what upsets me more, though, is the three months that elapsed between those two conversations (and it probably would have been a lot longer if I hadn't pried it out of him). That's three months that he apparently knew he wanted to break up with me when he leaves grad school, yet somehow didn't think that was something we should discuss *before* he moved in with me. I guess I'm more hurt by that than I'd care to admit.

I have no idea what to do. Has anyone here been in a similar situation, who could shed some light on this?

3ls8ce,20,2015-09-21,I'm (25M) in a long distance relationship and I have a hard time comforting my girlfriend (21F) when she's sad or stressed out,relationships112233,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ls8ce/im_25m_in_a_long_distance_relationship_and_i_have/,"I started dating my girlfriend about 1.75 years ago. We became ""official"" about a year ago. This is the first serious relationship for both of us and I haven't even really dated anyone before her.

She went to school about 300 miles away so the relationship has been long distance except for a couple months last summer. She got an internship right after she graduated (in May this year) in the same area as her school so we didn't get to spend the summer together like we did last summer. I went into this relationship with the idea that the long distance was temporary until she graduated but she was offered a really good internship and I wanted to support her and encouraged her to take it.

The relationship has been up and down since we became official. When we started dating, we used to talk until like 3 or 4 in the morning and she used to get upset that I was too tired to do that as I work full time. It made her feel like we were slowly losing what we had. She'd get sad and feel rejected if I wanted to go to sleep because she felt like I didn't want to talk to her so I often felt obligated to stay on the phone longer with her even though I would have work in the morning. She also felt sad if I didn't have full on text conversations with her throughout the day, every day.

I think once she started working full time at her internship she started to understand how hard it is to work and then have the energy to talk on the phone until 3 in the morning. But now she's always stressed out. She works 10-12 hours a day and she says she feels alone because all her friends graduated so all she's doing is working. Her parents also have health issues and financial problems and it's like all she does is worry and stress out and focus on all the negative stuff in her life.

Lately all she talks about is how she's stressed out and she's not feeling well and she's having anxiety and panic attacks and she's so overwhelmed and she doesn't know what to do. I try telling her its going to be ok and she'll be fine but it feels really hollow and meaningless over the phone sometimes. Sometimes I don't know what to say and she gets upset that I don't know how to comfort her. One time she said one day she might find someone that will be able to comfort her.

I admit I'm not exactly the best verbal communicator and it's easier for me to comfort someone physically. I try to see her every 2-3 weeks and spend the weekend with her but I'm usually the one that makes the 5+ hour drive. I usually go on Friday night and leave on Sunday night and try to spend as much time with her as I can because she gets sad when I leave. Sometimes I'll leave at 11 or 12 and get back at 4 or 5 and have work at 8.

I'm starting to feel like she's completely dependent on me to make her happy and solve all her problems and it makes me feel bad because I don't always have all the answers. I also feel like it's not fair to me because I'm trying my best to be there for her as much as I can. She gets upset because she thinks I don't understand how she feels. I try to be supportive and understand but sometimes I feel like she just worries too much and only focuses on the negative things.

I love her and care about her a lot and it breaks my heart when she's sad but sometimes I just feel powerless and unable to do anything from so far away. When we're together and happy it's like the best feeling in the world. But when we're apart it's like she's sad or stressed out about something 80% of the time and I feel like I can't always help her. I'm at a loss for how to continue handling this.

**TL;DR;** ; In a long distance relationship with girlfriend who is constantly stressed out and I have a hard time comforting her over the phone. She gets more upset and stressed when I can't.

Advice?,marselusweiland,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lsa1j/me_24_m_with_my_girlfriend_of_22_f_2_years_broke/,"Early P.S. I've been on reddit for 2 years but this is my first time posting please forgive me for any errors.

My girlfriend of 2 years (which I was 101% faithful to) broke up with me on new years eve because we always fight and fight but still love each other despite all of that I still tried to take her back for months. So summer came and I had my internship and my workout that took my attention from her. I then heard the news that she had a new boyfriend whom she met online only and no physical interaction whatsoever. This made me persevere more in moving on and it was really effective. 

Then this June, she tried coming back because after she realized she still loves me still and ended with the guy she met online. Anyway, at first I did not want to entertain her not a bit because she completely broke my heart and I was doing excellent progress moving on. After 2 weeks of her constantly trying to win me back I gave in because I thought she was sincere with her intentions.

The problem is, a month in she broke up with me again because I was jealous with someone and she said that was the deal breaker. I'm doing this because I wanted to really know if she is really sincere and all. Something bad happened and I stormed her place while drunk to confront her because she wasn't talking to me again. I know I'm wrong in doing that and I'm not the kind of person who does that really.

We are still in contact 3 months and I still love her but she said that what she can only give me is her friendship. 

My question is, should I still go after her OR should I move on again? Any advice? Thanks!

3lsi22,2,2015-09-21,"Me [24 F] with my parents [50s M/F] and sister [26f], how do I get over my resentment over them giving her a great job she didn't deserve?",Wayathroq,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lsi22/me_24_f_with_my_parents_50s_mf_and_sister_26f_how/,"My sister and I have always been very different but very close. She was more outgoing when we were growing up and I was a bit of a nerd, but we still hung out lots and got on very well. We also have an older brother, no issues with him, he's kinda weird but also kinda great.


We both did well in our school exams and got into good college courses, but she started going out loads and partying really hard. She ended up doing terribly all throughout college. She failed classes, got terrible grades in the ones she passed, and eventually had to repeat a year. I have to stress that she is really smart, and this was definitely all because of lack of effort, rather than anything else. She was just having too much fun to study.

I also went to college, l, got good grades, did internships, studied abroad, worked a couple of different part time time, and generally made an ok job of everything.


By the time my sister finally graduated college a year late, she had never had a job, except for a few weeks waitressing when she was 16. She actually asked me, her two years younger sister, if she could see my CV so she could model hers off it. She had literally no work experience, no internships, really terrible grades in everything, basically she had fucked everything up and barely scraped over the finishing line in college.


My mum managed to get her a job working in a cafe near our house, and she worked there for a few months after graduating. She didn't try to get herself a job in the field she studied, she didn't apply for any courses or anything. She just worked this cafe job.


All of a sudden, my dad gave her a job. My dad runs a pretty big firm in the area she studied. He didn't tell her to apply, or get her an interview or anything like that. He just came home one day and told her she had a job. This job was exactly in her field of study. I will state categorically that I believe she did not deserve this job, and that any other candidate with her CV would have been laughed out of the place.


This was never discussed in the family at all. No one ever mentioned that my sister had totally messed up in college through her excessive partying, and that Dad giving her a job completely changed her life.


It is now two years down the line, and she is working a different, well-paid job in her area. She would not have gotten this job without the first one my Dad gave her. She has never mentioned to me that she got lucky by our Dad giving her a job, and doesn't seem to have learnt anything from the whole process. She still goes out TONS, spends all her money on drink and drugs, and at this stage I'm beginning to think that she will never grow up.


I am currently job-hunting after finishing an MA. Job-hunting sucks, bad. It's completely emotionally draining to keep putting your all into application after application, and know that you'll never hear back from almost all of them. We were all recently on a family trip, and I mentioned to my parents that it sucked knowing that my sister had never even gone through the process of job-hunting and still had an awesome career because Dad gave her a job. They freaked out completely. My Dad said he never knew I could be so heartless and that it changed how he thought about me completely. My Mum said that I had always been jealous of my sister and that was why I felt resentful over the job. I was basically told I was never allowed speak about it again. I tried to bring it up with my sister and she (literally) told me she would punch me in the face if I ever brought it up again. My mum asked me to apologise to my sister the next day. I said no.

My Mum has since phoned me to try and sort it all out, but the bottom line is that as I sit here, submitting dozens of applications and scrambling so hard to find any job, I can't help thinking of my druggie sister, and the fact that she got an amazing opportunity despite never submitting one job application. I also hate the fact that we as a family never discussed any of this. It's all in the past now, and it can't be changed, so I guess the only way out is for me to just get over it.

How do I stop feeling so much resentment over this?
   
TL;DR My Dad gave my college-failing, hard-partying sister a killer job that she didn't deserve. I feel super resentful about it. How do I get over it?"

3lsmyq,0,2015-09-21,"(GER) - I, M/21, will soon finish my bachelor degree. Need advice on employment and the start of my ""serious"" worklife.",Efrafari,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3lsmyq/ger_i_m21_will_soon_finish_my_bachelor_degree/,"I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while now. Reading about mistakes which have consequences into the far future made me want to ask you, the experienced, for advice.


**My person:**

I'm currently studying technical management in a small city in Germany. If things run according to my plan, I'll be rewarded with a bachelor of science in about 12 months. The main focus of this study is the leading of companies, management of projects and general business studies. I specialised on riskmanagement (financial mathematics, which I always had a favor for). Also there has been a ""practical semester"" where i have been working for a big company for 6 months. So I've been in a internship which led to a (pretty) good job reference. I'm honestly a bit fed up with university and crave for work, a own flat, a daily routine. So starting a master is no possibility for me.


**My plans:**

I fell in love with the city Hamburg (1.8 million residents) while working there the past half year. Therefore moving there is one of my highest priorities during my search for a job. I've planned to send out dozens applications which will hopefully lead me to 5, 6 job interviews. I will aply for everything I could imagine being fitting for me, since I, to be honest, have not yet found my real ""vocation"". 


**My questions:**

I've been very sloppy during the first months at university which will lead to an extra semester and a lot of hard work to catch up on failed exams. 
* When do I start to apply? I thought about waiting one more semester, since only if I manage to pass every exam I planned in this current semester I have a realistic chance on finishing in one year (scared to get employed and then can't hold parameters for not finishing university in the time expected).


* What kind of employment is the ""right"" one for me? An internship? Trainee position? ""Normal"" job?

* How is the payment going to be handled? The field in which I'll start will probably be payed pretty high, ranging from good 5 digits up to the south end of 6 digits. But since this will not be my salary as a fresh from university 21 year old ""kid"" what can i expect? What to mind?

* Also want to have insight in a few different fields/jobs. Is hopping to a different job going to benefit/handicap my chances on the work market? Also, will this have influence on salarays terms?

* Any other information you'd loved to have while standing at my point at life? 

Thanks in advance! I'll stay active to answer questions/read through answers."
3lt3b2,55,2015-09-21,Update: Hospital Kitchen fiasco,Bongfu,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/3lt3b2/update_hospital_kitchen_fiasco/,"So some of you saw and commented on my entry into a hospital kitchen. Let me clarify that a bit before moving on. 

I was working as chef de cuisine of, what I thought was, a profitable bakery. They wanted to expand into the catering market and even offer lunch at their store front. I designed the menu, did all the costing, talking to vendors, the whole enchilada. 

Flash forward six months and the owner literally blindsides my crew and I with a layoff. No warning, just signs of the normal slow down during summers. Any Texan cooks here know summers can be brutal for certain kinds of restaurants. 

So I was jobless, the girlfriend was jobless, and our savings were dwindling to null. I had to do something. So I took a job through a temp agency ad. It said ""cook needed for hospital -$15/hr"". I thought well that would be a cakewalk. 

I worked as a banquet chef before in a very busy hotels and did some internships at a hospital during culinary school. That hospital was fantastic. They made everything fresh, from scratch, and had very strict health guidelines that they followed. If it was not USDA approved as healthy, it was not served. Even then the nutritionist over the kitchen wrote all the menus with the help of the executive chef. A whole different animal from the nightmare I walked into. 

So here I am today nursing a burned hand and taking a break from my lengthy write up to the health department. I thought I should share the horror and excitement of the last two days. 

That's right, two days. Shortest job I ever had. 

Here is a TL;DR version of some of the things I saw. Keep in mind this is a hospital.

* Head cook not changing gloves after touching raw chicken and grabbing produce from the walk in

* Head cook did not know or understand that he was using a butchers knife as a chef's knife. He thought it just looked cool (which I admit they do, but still)

* Lead cook told me to grab some red bell peppers from the walk in. After trudging through excruciatingly unorganized walkin, I found the box. It was literally mold. Not just the peppers, but the box was turning into mold.  The lead cook wanted me to try and salvage what I could. I threw it all away. 

* Found the aubergines had melted away into brown sludge. Two whole cases sitting on the top shelf of the produce. All the other produce was covered in decaying aubergine juices. 

* I would say 40% of the equipment was either broken or needed to be fixed in some way. I burned my hand on the steamer because they failed to tell me that the ""handle leaks"" with you pull it open. I grabbed the handle to open it for potatoes and it cinged all the hair from my hand through two pairs of gloves. My fingers of my left hand are raw. 

* That place lacked any kind of professional discipline. No one had a ""station"" it was very laissez faire. So where the prep list. Even though I apparently had my own list, people were doing stuff from it? The worst part was they did not write it down so I had to go ask everyone what they did. Instead of taking three seconds to initial next to the item on the list they wasted thirty minutes of my time trying to figure out what needed to be done still. 

* Final nail in the coffin was when the food manager told me the temps work their 90 day contract for just that. 90 days. No days off, no reduced hours, just 90 day 10 hour days. Yeah, no thanks. 



So the good news. No sooner did I say adios to them I get a call from a resume I sent out a few days prior. It is a sous position and the chef there seems very excited to interview me. I will admit I have held the title of ""chef"" before this, but never in a place like this. It was always some small hole in the wall mom and pop shop. I love those places, but it never felt earned. 

If I get this and I rock it, I will join those honoured ranks. Who knows, I might even be a real chef someday. 

Stay classy, KC. "

after a week of inpatient and three weeks of partial hospitalization i felt so much better. went home for the summer and am back at school taking minimal classes now. i dropped nursing and am in the process of becoming an art student (what i really wanted to do but was too scared to). i have a great studio apartment right by campus, i have great friends, an interview at a great art school this week, etc. and i was feeling on top of the world until this last friday.
now i can barely get out of bed. i'm constantly exhausted and can't get myself to go to any social functions, or to finish any of my paintings. i'm totally down on myself and am not contemplating suicide, but find myself thinking of being in the hospital and thinking about what it would be like if i didn't have to deal with life anymore.
anybody been through a relapse like this? i feel like i've been hit by a train - it came out of nowhere and i've just been floored by all of these awful feelings. what the fuck do i do? i don't want to bother anybody else with my problems; i'm in therapy once a week and it helps but i'm still feeling like absolute shit
another question - does anybody use any home remedies (herbs, teas) that help?
thanks guys"

3lvjo3,9,2015-09-21,eric getting dumber,lilsting10,boymeetsworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/boymeetsworld/comments/3lvjo3/eric_getting_dumber/,"I recently read a reddit theory that Eric suffered brain damage when he hit his head in the snow storm with Lonnie. It's a nice idea, but in re-watching BMW (upto s6 so far) it doesn't hold up.

After being the cool big brother to Corey in S1-3, and having grown-up story archs like dating the single mum, not getting into college the first time, the weatherman internship; he hits his head during the snow storm with Lonnie. But after that he is still acting like ""Smart Eric"" throughout S4 and S5 when he studies and gets into college, and even departs wisdom to Cory, Feeny and Jack.

I've no idea what made the writers take a nose dive into lake stupid with Eric's character somewhere in the later seasons, but I always find it to be a big shame whenever I go and re-watch the series.


----




... Having recently finished the end of BMW... I think maybe that Eric getting dumb is blown out of proportion. Even really late-on in the series Eric has great grown-up storylines where he acts smart/mature like adopting Tommy. There was also the one where he and Cory are supposed to clear out the garage of their childhood toys, and Eric is hurt Cory chooses Shawn/Topanga to do it instead of him (a nice reversal of Cory going off the deep end feeling like he's losing his brother when Eric leaves home to look at colleges at the end of season 4 I think it was). What I think happened was that in Seasons 5-7, 3 main things all happened to magnify Eric's stupidity.


1. Repeating Plot Lines:
Cory and Topanga broke-up twice (Lauren, and then Topanga's parents got a divorce and she realizes she doesn't believe in love). Shawn and Angela broke-up twice (joining college, and then because Topanga's parents got a divorce and Angela realizes she doesn't believe in love either), Shawn goes off the rails twice (drinking, and then after Chet dies). Whilst the show was trying to be 'serious' with the repeating plot lines, we needed 'B-storylines' to add some fun to the episodes. So Eric and Jack became the funny guy and the straight man pairing.


2. There was a lot more corporate meddling, and pop culture influences that were just glommed-onto BMW's formula with no regard for BMW's well-being, making changes to character's personalities, or ignoring past established information. I'm sure everyone remembers the Sabrina The Teenage Witch episode where everyone get's transported back to the war by Salem The Cat. Or the stupid epidose where Jack dates a witch who hates Eric. Or the FRIENDS-esque war girls vs guys over the apartment.


3. The show startd slipping, forgetting previously established plot details.
One example of ignoring past details was making a big deal about Eric cutting his hair short with the big reveal in the student union by taking off the wig... when he'd cut it short already for the entirity of season 5 when he, Jack and Shawn first shared the apartment, it having always being short in the very early seasons anyway. Or having Alan constantly thinking Eric was dumb, or couldn't fend for himself in the real world, when in earlier seasons Feeny had said Eric was smart but lazy, and Eric proved this by re-studying for the SATs and did get into college. Alan had no reason to believe Eric was stupid. In fact, upon re-watching, Corey was the one who started to get goofy storylines during the college years, even more than Eric at times (''Underpants!'', Dreams of killing his friends, ''Honey-Moooo-hoooon!'').


I think overall you remember the funny guy/straight man Eric and Jack routine from later seasons, but it isn't as bad as you might remember. I actually think the show could have continued-on instead of ending. For as much as I wasn't a fan of most of the Corey-Topanga/Shawn-Angela stuff in S5-S7, I feel like they'd just started to hit a nice stride after C+T's marriage, and with Eric/Jack/Rachael."

3lvnbd,2,2015-09-21,27M here with a 30F girlfriend of 7 months showing signs of depression.,Vjt2001,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lvnbd/27m_here_with_a_30f_girlfriend_of_7_months/,"Throw away...

7 months ago I hooked up with an intern at the company I work for at a mixer for our company and another. She wasn't supposed to be invited but somehow ended up there.

She was finishing up her Masters degree in the entertainment business and working under another supervisor in an unrelated department and after hitting off swimmingly, she came back to my apartment that night and we haven't looked back since.

We kept things on the DL during the rest of her term and made it through that time by separating our professional and our budding personal lives.

Some of the first things she told be about herself in past relationships was that she always had a hard time vocalizing deeper feelings, especially when they were around uncomfortable issues with the relationship and since I'd been the same way in my past, it hadn't scared me but excited me since we were already off to a great start regarding communication. It felt like we understood this about each other and were able to put it aside because of that.

At first things were really intense, as it always is, but this felt different. It was intoxicatingly  mature and promising. 

Lots of eye contact in a way I've never held before. She made the first move on me, was asking me to hang even if I wasn't feeling well, asked for my number, and instigated small affectionate behavior like hand holding. I even had to tell her to mind that while we were near the office coming from my apartment from the night before. 

In general, there was something both balanced and cosmic about her. She challenged me and offered intellectual conversation. All the while, an open heart. I was smitten. It was worth dealing with that taboo of our professional roles.

Fast forward a few months, and she started to feel distant and I noticed the frequency of her communication attempts was lowering and she was overall less affectionate.

There were several accounts where I spoke up for myself, letting her know I was upset by how she was behaving and wondering why it was the case, that I needed more and that I couldn't be around if this was how we were going to coexist.

She was always receptive to this feedback and acknowledged her head being in other places.

It all came to a head this weekend when she was more closed off that I've ever seen her, causing her to miss my finish of my first half marathon after promising to be there and then falling asleep on our weekend road trip travel day and remaining very quiet and distant as we went about the adventure.

During a picnic I asked her why she was feeling so tired and it came out that she is feeling really anxious and depressed about not having a job at all and not even sure she wants to pursue the career path she set out for.

As I've reflected the last 24 hours, it's all starting to add up. She's not been eating much and lost several pounds and was already very thin and in shape.  She didn't train for the half marathon with me even though she said she would run it with me when I first mentioned it. She hasn't been affectionate towards me, with both small things like eye contact and hand holding/cuddling and with bigger things like instigating sex.

She's been short in convo with me, doesn't reach out first in the morning or at the end of the evening to say good morning and good night. She has not been engaging in small talk with me when we spend time together.

Overall she seems absent and I don't feel connected to her as I first did. It's only been 7 months and I don't know what to make of this.

On one hand I get where she's coming from as far as feeling depressed goes...30, a degree in biopsychology (she's super intelligent) and a masters in entertainment business (and just wanted a career change from something she no longer felt passionate about) and she doesn't have a job (she is hunting - but maybe isn't as aggressive as she could be), but on the other, is this really the way to handle other areas of your life, especially a relatively new and great relationship at 30? It doesn't add up. Either she's fallen out of like/love with me or she has some issues with depression that are just
Coming out now. I really care about her and see a bright future, but I don't know if this is something that I will be able to help her out with, even if I wanted to. Is it situational depression or is this inherently her?

If anyone can relate or offer some insight, I could really use it right now...

TLDR: Girlfriend is showing less affection and I'm not sure if it's disinterest in me or depression.

3lvy8i,1,2015-09-21,Crazy awesome FNaF dream,SwiftFeet13,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/3lvy8i/crazy_awesome_fnaf_dream/,"First of all, I want to start off saying that this is the best dream I've had in my life so far. It's incredibly detailed far beyond any dreams I've had or ever heard of, and I'm really surprised I can remember this much. So I apologize if it's way longer than I intended.

The dream begins with me becoming an intern, for the night shift, at the New and Improved Freddy's Pizzeria, (Obviously the night shift) and one of the day-shift employees is giving me a tour. The first actual scene that I can remember is me being backstage. Toy Chica was powered down as Toy Freddy and Toy Bonnie was playing one last song for the night without her. Then, I walked into the security guard's office, which looked NOTHING like the office from the second game. As my mom hugged me goodbye, not expecting anything, I gave her the longest hug I could muster, because I knew I wouldn't be returning home. After my mom left, the employee said she forgot to give my mom something before she left, and handed me the worst looking fruit cake I've ever seen, and said it was from the manager. When I asked who the manager was, she told me his name was Mr. Parker. (I have no idea where that came from) The employee then left.

This is when I wake up, but don't stop reading yet. When I woke up, I was really upset that I didn't get to finish my dream, but I fell back to sleep a minute later and astonishley continued my dream. (What luck, right?)

Back in the dream, I turned around, found a door behind the desk, and went through it. I soon found that the door I went through led to the ACTUAL office from the second game.

Now, there are a lot of things in this dream that go on behind my back, and I will try to assess them the best I can.

One of the animatronics must have seen me and ran back to tell everyone else, except for the Marionette. (I'll explain that later)From then on, all of the animatronics acted solemn, remorse, and depressed. They really didn't want to stuff a kid in a suit. They were fine with doing it to older men, who had already lived at least half of their life. But a kid didn't deserve to go through what they went through; they were too innocent.
So, they tried their best to let me survive, but they couldn't sit around and do nothing either, to make sure the Marionette didn't get suspicious.
Finally, unfortunately, Old Chica was able to slip inside the office. (She's the scariest looking in my opinion) I tried to go back into the other office, but they had me cornered. Old Chica picked me up with what little arms she had. We locked eyes. I said with a cracked and scared voice, ""Please don't hurt me."" She looked at me with more pity and sadness than I've ever seen in my life. If robots could cry, she would have.

They told me to hang around a bit until they decided what to do. I imagine the conversation with the Marionette went something like this:
Marionette:  Hey, guys! Who do we have tonight?
Animatronics: Shhh! Don't go in there! There's something we need to tell you!
Marionette: What... Is there something you're hiding from me? I thought I could trust you guys...
Animatronics: You can, but-
The animatronics didn't want to argue with him/her, so the Marionette stepped quietly through the door while I wasn't looking. After seeing me, he/she must have silently broken down (with sadness) outside. After he/she regained himself/herself, the Marionette said:

""I did this once before, but I'm not doing it again.""

That's why I didn't see the Marionette at all in my dream.

From then on, the animatronics acted...weird. They had a positive attitude to hide their sadness. At one point, I could see that Old Freddy was working on something at a table. When I asked him who would be...doing it, he said he would. I didn't realize it then, but now when I look back on that moment, Freddy was working on my suit blueprints. He would build me my own custom suit.
I went back to the other office and thought long and hard about my life. I wouldn't be able to get married, have kids, or have a dream job. Heck, I hadn't even had my first kiss yet. Just then, Old Freddy walked in the room, pushing a table with tools on it, accompanied by the other animatronics.

Since they didn't want me to go through any pain, Freddy found a nerve point on the bridge of my nose (not a real nerve point) and pressed it until I went numb and unconscious.


When I woke up, I could LITERALLY feel the suit on me. Everyone looked in awe of what an amazing job Freddy had done. They helped me up and to a mirror. When I saw myself...I was shocked. Freddy had turned me into......... A frog. A Toy Frog. (As in the toy animatronics) I had a white belly, a red bow tie, and an almost creepy frog face. And I was set to play as a drummer in the band for kids everyday, forevermore.


                                                                                                                         The End
 Welp, this was my dream. And although the conversations are what I've made up myself, the rest of the dream is really what happened. It's a really good exercise for your brain to continue your dreams or make up parts, after you've waken up, until you have a great story that makes sense and fits together well. Again, I'm sorry for the length, and feel free to interpret my dream (any of my dreams, for that matter) in the comments!

So if you'll excuse me, I've got some dreaming to do. Sleep and dream well, redditors! 😉😴"
3lw7ox,9,2015-09-21,What do you do about homeless people living in their cars?,Treestumper12,AskLE,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLE/comments/3lw7ox/what_do_you_do_about_homeless_people_living_in/,"I'm currently trying to get into Law Enforcement, I finished my degree last year, and am currently about to do my 3rd Internship (first not with the school) while I wait my turn for the academy.

One thing that has troubled me is the way the Police treat the homeless people in their cars. Most of the homeless living in their cars have jobs or are going to school. They are living in their cars as a transition phase. Either they were on the streets and they are trying to get themselves off, or they are on the way down and are hanging on by a thread.

It is illegal to sleep in your car, I don't why, but it is.

In school they taught us about community policing and to serve and protect. My professor said something very profound to us before graduation. I really took it to heart. It was something along the lines of:

""If you take one thing from my classes with you to law enforcement, let it be this: Don't uphold the law if it goes against serving and protecting the community. You are a human being with a soul, not a robot. This is why police officers are essential and irreplaceable. See the grey and use your soul. The day you start seeing in black and white is the day you've lost your soul..and there is nothing more dangerous than a badge without a soul.""

They recently had a meeting, where I took notes at. One of the things they stressed was to ticket and tow every person they caught sleeping in their car. They didn't give a reason why. They just said, ""Make sure you are ticketing and towing every homeless you find sleeping in their cars, regardless of whatever story they give you."" It was just said blatantly stated like a fact. Then the Captain went on to the next thing. 

Why do that? I doubt most of the police officers will do it. But why even say it. The whole notion goes against everything a police officer stands for.

My question is, what do you do when you encounter some poor guy living in his car? "
3lwdod,0,2015-09-22,Chances of getting into BA/BS+MD Programs,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/3lwdod/chances_of_getting_into_babsmd_programs/,"Hi Premeddit! Sorry for posting a ""What are my chances"" in a separate thread, but given I am a high school senior and my situation is different, I didn't want to mix myself among the other posts. I am applying for several different BA/BS+MD programs, and was wondering what my chances for these would be. Please find below all my information:

**Year in school:** Class of 2016 Senior

**Country/state of residence:** Virginia

**Schools to which I am applying:** VCU Guaranteed Medical Program, Brown PLME, George Washington University 7-year BA/MD, University of Alabama at Birmingham Early Medical School Acceptance Program, University of Pittsburgh Guaranteed Medical Program, Washington University Medical Scholars Program, Rensslaer Polytechnic Institute Physician-Scientist 7-year program, Drexel University BA/BS/MD Accelerated Degree, and the Case Western Reserve University Pre-Professional Scholars Program in Medicine

**Weighted GPA:** 4.17

**Unweighted GPA:** 3.64 (I understand my GPA appears quite low, but my high school ranks in the top 10 in the nation, and our curriculum is MUCH more rigorous than a base school's - in addition, our school counselors have acknowledged that colleges treat us much differently in terms of GPA, i.e., schools that normally are considered competitive for admissions are considered safeties for students at my school)

**Research:** Summer internship at a reputed university, continuing for the first semester of school as part of my high school's research mentorship program. I have been put in as a co-author in one of their abstracts submitted to the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) national conference, and I will be presenting a poster on this abstract upcoming in a month or so. As part of my mentorship project, I am doing my own original work, so I will most likely submit to the Intel ISEF and will be making my own poster as part of my school's research symposium at the end of the semester.

**Volunteering (clinical):** I have been an active volunteer at my local fire department for the past 2 years, and have 180+ hours in EMT training and 40+ hours in actual ambulance riding time. I am a hospital year-long volunteer at the same university I am performing research at, and only began this year. I am volunteering in an in-patient Orthopedic Surgery facility as well as an Oncology Infusion center.

** Physician shadowing:** I have shadowed for 40+ hours with a neurologist at their private office, observed an Anesthesiologist specializing in Neurosurgery in the Operating Room for three neurosurgeries, as well as an ER physician. (The 40 hours is all of them collectively, not 40+ hours each)

**Non-clinical volunteering:** I am a mentor for a program at my school to help economically disadvantaged middle school students with potential to gain admission to my high school (as it is an admission-based magnet school)

**Other extracurriculars:** I am an active member of my school's Technology Student Association (TSA) club, and have won multiple awards (1 at a regional level and 2 at a state level). I am also the secretary of a counseling club at my school that offers help to struggling underclassmen.

**Employment history** Worked at a STEM enrichment camp as an assistant instructor for several weeks two summers ago - last summer did the volunteer research internship as mentioned above. Once I receive my NREMT license when I turn 18 I am interested in working part-time as an ER tech at a local hospital.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Sorry! I forgot to include my SAT score: I got 2280 combined, and 1530 CR+M. I just took the ACT a few weeks back, so I will be finding out results soon. I will also be taking the SAT one more time to break that 2300 barrier, but I'll have to see."

For the past year i've been a daily coffee drinker and it made me feel so good everytime i had it, it makes me feel ready for the day. 

But recently i got on an internship program at a factory, i noticed that many of the workers drinked a coffee cup every 2-3 hours with a lot of sugar just so they could keep working normally. I wondered if they were addicted to it.

I've made the experiment of dropping it for a few days, and i got those typical caffeine withdrawal symptoms, minor headaches and having a bad mood. But on the other hand i started sleeping alot better.

This experience felt alot like nofap and i have been wondering what do you guys think about coffee in general.

As for price, I'll be staying in a hostel, and can afford to travel to any city in Germany if you guys say it is worth it.

3lxv8x,86,2015-09-22,Me [35 M] with my father [68 M] thinks I'm a loser because I'm in college and don't work,warmglowlilyhammer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lxv8x/me_35_m_with_my_father_68_m_thinks_im_a_loser/,"My parents come from a well to do family and are the ""screw ups"" of the family. They both had college paid for, dropped out, had good jobs that they lost because of how they acted, always struggle with money, etc. I dropped out of high school at 15 and worked low paying retail jobs until I was 32.

I married someone from a highly educated family and she thought I should fulfill my dream of becoming an engineer. I had what amounted to a 5th grade education when it came to math before I started school (didn't even know what a square root was...). I had to take remedial math and pretty much remedial everything that was offered and am now taking Calculus 2 and other courses and have a good GPA. My wife has a decent job so she can support both of us while I study and pay for tuition. We have a baby on the way. 

I feel guilty that she has to work while I'm in school. My parents came over last weekend and my father told me he thought it was ridiculous that I didn't have a job and that I should get it together and I feel very bad about it. He wants me to drop out of college to get a job (I've never made more than 20K a year). My wife insists that it would be silly for me to get a job when we can afford school and I'm doing what I love. She also pointed out that we make about 4 times more than my parents do and my mother doesn't work, so why should I if I am still in school. 

I feel very guilty about her working while pregnant while I'm in school but she insists that she enjoys her job and doesn't mind it. 

Should I listen to my parents and get a job? This feeling of guilt really sucks and I hate that they are embarrassed by me. On the other hand, I resent the fact that they just said ""do as you please"" when I decided to drop out of high school at 15, meanwhile all my friends' parents forced them to keep going. My wife is pissed off at them for suggesting I drop out of school.

My wife's parents are supportive of school and think I have good potential and should keep going without working in anything other than internships until I am finished. With the baby, I will take a bit longer to graduate because we will be taking turns taking care of him. I am also a bit scared of graduating at 40, but I do really want to be an engineer and was miserable working in retail.

Should I listen to my parents or my wife? Thanks.

He seem to really care and love me (I'm skeptical) and I feel the same way, just not as much (yet).


I'm in college and he's freelancing, we only have an hour and a half time difference but lately I'm getting busier, I just started interning and becoming very active in college. Before I started my internship, I had a lot of free time and would arrive at home around 2 pm, but now I'll arrive around 9 pm (after all the college thing is done). I don't know how to give him time because he said he feels lonely ever since my new term started and this internship, we usually talk everyday for 4-6 hours, and now for the last 2 weeks it's around 1-2 hours, seems drastic but I'm really trying to put time for us.


I'm confused on what to do because I feel he's demanding so much time from me and honestly I don't have that much, as talking to him actually costs my sleep and I also need to study. I told him I don't mind if he wants to back out, as he really stresses that he doesn't want to waste his time with anyone, but he doesn't want to end this.


I've never done this before, nor long distance relationships. I've been in a few relationships before but he's never been with anyone, we've never met and he plans on coming next year.


I would appreciate any advice right now, thank you."
3lyo73,3,2015-09-22,I suck at the job I choose for my future,IlParnassoConfuso,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3lyo73/i_suck_at_the_job_i_choose_for_my_future/,"I don't think I will, but if everything worked out right I should graduate from college next year. I most definitely won't have nearly enough extracurricular hours to graduate, because I'm so pathetic I just got an internship now. I so wish I had looked for internships on the very first year, but there's nothing I can do about it now.

I'm starting to panic about being so close to finishing college because I didn't really used my opportunities there to the max. I haven't read a book about my course ever since I started, I don't feel that I improved a lot since the first semester, my work is shit, specially compared to the three top people in my class. But then I notice these students who are so much better than me actually read books on our course, they are independent and have been working for years (and we're the same age) and actually try their best on most projects.

I'm in a bad place emotionally, and I don't like to say this because it sounds like an excuse, but I think my depression stops me from doing so much. I just have this feeling of having no purpose that is taking over my life. Sometimes I postpone things until there's no other option than doing it, and when asked ""why haven't you done this?"" or ""why wait until now?"" I don't really have an answer. I look back and I, myself, don't know why. An then, after this moment of self realization, I go back and do it again and again.

I'm getting scared of turning 20, being as worthless and useless as I am now. I feel like a child still, things haven't changed much since I started high school (except for my world views maybe). I wish I was more independent and normal like everyone else.

All of this makes me worry of my future, of the kind of jobs I'll have having such shitty skills in my profession. I look at the big famous international design offices and sigh, thinking to myself I'm never going to work somewhere like that, because I missed my chance of improving myself in college. So many people in earlier semesters join my college's exchange program, and I didn't because if I can't even socialize and speak in my own language, how would I do it in a different country? Besides, being a closeted transgender who hates they own body, how would I even enjoy myself??

I think I'll either end up completely dependent on my parents well into my 40s like some people I know, or I'll get a shitty apartment and equally shitty unsatisfying job because that's all my skills can reach. I often think about suicide, and I think I'd rather die as a ""young 19 year old with all their life ahead' than as my future-me, a pathetic middle aged loner and the expense of every joke.

And I have a job. So every day I have class, homework, and practicing. Then on the weekends I have 7-8 hours of work (since I don't have time to work during the week), then homework and practicing.

BF, on the other hand, has 1 internship and 1 class. This is because for the last year his depression has been very bad (he is in treatment, and it finally looks like it might maybe be starting to work, but who knows). The internship is 10-12 hours a week and the class meets once a week with (as far as I can tell) virtually no homework.


What this means is that I have more hours of work every single day than he does all fucking week.


then, friday evening, he stands me up (this was a very frequent problem last winter and spring when his depression was exceptionally bad, so I'm sensitive to it). He's supposed to come over at 8. At 9 I text him and ask what's up. at TEN THIRTY he responds and says that he's having a bad night and probably won't make it over. Which, you know, I'd kinda figured out. After all, I had 2 hours to think about it. And I know his bad nights are really bad, but at the same time I don't think it's that hard to at least let me know that he's not going to make it. I could've gone over to a friends house or something, at least I would've had the option of not just sitting in bed waiting around.


Some relevant info for this bit is that I am asexual, and he has a low but present libido. Usually we are able to compromise.


Then saturday night rolls around and he has the nerve to ask what we can do together to make it so that we have sex more often. I feel like I'm not out of line by being a bit frustrated with him. I know he'd like it more often, but I feel like he's not getting that I'm exhausted all the time and when he stands me up one night and then comes over the next really wanted sex then I feel like that's all he wants and he didn't bother coming over the night before b/c he thought it wouldn't happen.

Am I out of line? Should I be looking more at myself for a solution? I really don't want to be this frustrated all the time."

There are so many wonderful things about him but he is also incredibly frustrating. Our physical relationship is great and we seriously love spending time together. We always go out and try new things. We love food, travelling and doing pretty much anything together. Although we probably have been spending too much time together, we still get so happy every time one of us comes home from work/school and sees each other. It's seriously like a scene from a movie where both the husband and wife greet each other, smiling and talking about their day when the other comes home. I don't know if this has anything to do with it but we have both been changing cities basically since we've met so it's hard to also meet friends and hang out with other people but we've managed and we've personally never felt like we spend too much time together. We enjoy talking with each other a lot, although our opinions are different at times and I get bored and inattentive easily when he talks about technical stuff and he gets bored and unresponsive when I talk about politics or fitness.

So that brings me to the problem; I know we have a HUGE problem in our communication. We fight almost constantly. When we aren't fighting we are getting along fantastic. It's always one extreme or the other. We are now at our wits end, considering breaking up for the third or fourth time now. I, myself am not the easiest person to get along with and I can readily admit my faults. I am stubborn myself (although not as much as he is - seriously!). I sometimes say too much, with little tact and I can also be very pessimistic at times. He is the most stubborn and defensive person I know. I feel like I can't say anything to him because he takes it as a personal attack. Every concern of mine he just finds a way to deflect it or he tells me not to be concerned. He changes topics a lot when I try to bring up issues. I recently read an article about how to tell if people are being defensive in arguments; he seriously did everything on the list with perfection! It's at the point now where when I want to have a nice talk with him about our relationship, he sees that as an attack too. At this point, we seriously can't talk about anything beyond small talk without him getting mad and defensive. I feel completely ignored and misunderstood. He thinks I'm starting these fights by talking about the relationship and I think he's the one starting them by not being cooperative and missing the point. I've tried to explain to him that we are both on the same team here.

I don't know if culture has anything to do with this as well - I'm Canadian and he's straight out of Italy. He's also a bit younger than I am. I am 25 and he is 23. He also has an issue with his mom; I guess she was/is super controlling and he worries that I will try to control him. I don't think I have but I'm open to the idea that I might have been controlling at times and I know that I definitely don't want to be so if I am at times then I will work on that.

He also got a great job recently, his first real job after getting his masters degree. I'm starting to think that it might also somehow be related because he is kind of acting like a ""big shot"" now. It feels like he thinks I'm not as good as he is because I'm just starting my first year of my undergrad and everyone in my classes is 18. He made a remark about this the other day when we were fighting. He said I wasn't as ""ambitious"" as him and that I'm holding him back in his career. This is absolutely not true and I have always supported him 100% in everything he wanted to do. I was even the one who convinced him to go anyways when there was a snow day on the day of his interview. I have been working and on my own since I was 16. Unfortunately my family was not as stable and supportive as his so I wasn't able to be as successful as other people who can go to university right out of high school. That alone is stressful enough and now I don't even know if I can focus enough to be successful with this going on. I just feel terrible after he said that. Three years ago I was studying engineering in Germany and I had to leave the school because I couldn't manage to pass one of the exams and it was an extremely hard time for me because I also went though a breakup with my ex at the time and I was depressed and developed ADD. It did a number on my self esteem, which also wasn't that great in the first place (I never had any friends growing up and was made fun of a lot). It has been a tough and confusing time getting back into school since then and now I'm studying Psychology (my second choice) because I couldn't get back into engineering with my bad transcript from Germany. When we met, I had just come back to Canada and I was upgrading my high school courses and he was finishing his masters degree. He also watched me work a really shitty job while I was waiting to get back into university. I don't know if all this gave him a bad impression of me but ambition was never a question to us. He used to say it didn't matter to him whether I was a scientist or a waitress as long as I was happy and doing something. I think this mainly started when he got this job because it's for a big company and they are sending him around the world for conferences a couple of times per year. The last time he went, he was gone for two weeks. The first week was basically just social events. He was incredibly engaged in everything and couldn't give me half of his full attention when we talked on the phone. I felt more like a friend than a girlfriend. Then in the second week, it was just men and it was more technical training and he finally said he missed me. He skipped some seminars and admittedly slept through a few but he always went to the dinners and social events late at night. He tried to say that I've never worked for a big company so I don't understand; social events and parties are very important to make connections, etc. but I'm not an idiot. I'm pretty sure that those seminars were much more important for his actual job than the late night hotel room parties and dinners with his coworkers a.k.a ""friends."" How can I take him seriously now? By the way I have worked for a company before which held conferences and social events. I'm well aware that the social events are encouraged but aren't mandatory and certainly the informal parties aren't. I think another reason why this bothers me so much is because he is very extroverted and needy of approval from others and I can't stand the thought of him being at one of these informal parties and seeking all of that approval from the young girls he's working with. Anyways I never told him not to go. I mostly was angry because he tried to tell me that I don't understand how things are and he was being inattentive and kind of a jerk during our phone conversations. There was one night where I asked him to stay home as a test and he completely disrespected my request and bluntly said no. He thinks it was absurd that I asked but it was honestly just a one time thing to see if he respected my feelings. I would never tell him to stop going to the social events (or anything really) unless there was a good reason.

Respect is another thing I don't feel from him when he goes away. When he went home for Easter, for example, he said he would call me every night. I told him not to promise because things might come up and I didn't want to be expecting a call and waiting for nothing if that happened. He promised anyway and he ended up calling me 3 nights on his own during the entire two weeks. The other nights he tried texting instead or he forgot OR I called him first because it was late and I was wondering what his plans on calling me were because I wanted to go to bed soon. The thing is, I wouldn't ask of him to call me every night; as long as we kept in touch and he was fully present when we talked to the best of his ability given the situation. I'm mad about this not because of him not calling me but because of him breaking his promise and being so uncaring! But with this and many other situations, he thinks that I am mad about what happened. I don't care if he didn't call me for a couple of days because he was busy! Just don't tell me you're going to call and then not call! He doesn't get it though. I tried comparing it to missing a conference call at work that he committed to (his work ethic is great). He still didn't think it was a respect issue for some reason.

He also told me that I'm starting to sound like my mom which I really hope isn't true because she is the most dramatic, needy and insecure person I know. She is the last person I want to turn into but I'm afraid that he's right and I see a lot of similarities between us. I want to break the cycle and if you have any suggestions to avoid turning out like your parents please tell me!

Another big problem is that I've asked him to be more romantic, because he has a hard time expressing his feelings. It took him about a year to buy me flowers for the first time. He says since we've been fighting so much it makes it harder for him to feel those feelings and especially to express them. He also thinks I haven't been appreciating him because I keep asking for more from him in terms of romance. He does do a lot of really incredibly nice things for me and I try to praise him like crazy when he does. But the issue is when I try to explain to him that I feel more loved from hearing it expressed in words, he still substitutes something else i.e buying me flowers or taking me out to dinner; things which are super nice and I totally appreciate but aren't what I need and asked for. So I feel unfulfilled while he feels unappreciated. It's not fair to both of us because he is a great guy and I want to make him feel appreciated but I also want to feel like he's truly in love with me.

He was the one who initiated us moving in together. He was the one who asked me out on the first date. He was the one who said ""I love you"" first. Eight months ago HE brought up marriage and kids. We had a clear understanding that our goals were to eventually get married and that it would be sooner rather than later. It seems though that he's starting to feel like that less and less now. Every time we talk about it seems like he wants to wait longer and longer. I've asked him to show me in some way that he does still have the same goals and he says he does but seems incredibly scared. We don't talk about it anymore unless I bring it up and then he just gets defensive. We talked about him getting me a promise ring but I don't know if that's just a stupid thing and a cheap workaround for the real thing. I was thinking maybe it could be appropriate for us in this situation but idk. Another idea was to get a puppy... Any thing that would move us forward instead of backward would be more helpful in my opinion. I am 25 now and I'm don't think that's too young to get married! Neither is 23. He's so scared though and thinks maybe we need  a break or to take a step back instead (which involves me moving out on my own  in the huge new city where I know absolutely no one and I just started a new university career until HE decides whether or not I should move back in or we should break up). I told him that's totally unfair and it's not happening. He agreed reluctantly and currently I am staying in the guest suite of our apartment for a few days as an alternative. I don't care when we get married though. I just want to know that his goals are still the same and that I won't be waiting forever.

Our absolute BIGGEST problem is a trust/honesty one. He lies a lot. He has always said that lying is useful in a relationship and that he just tells little white lies. Well I'm starting to think that he thinks these white lies are about everything except cheating. Just two days ago he lied to me three times in one argument. One for example was when I asked him what his parents suggested to him when he asked what he should do in this situation. He didn't want to answer me so I asked him ""did they tell you we should break up?"" And he said ""no"" and then I was worried what it could have been since he insisted so much on not telling me so I insisted that he tell me and he admitted that they did say we should break up. He said he lied to protect me and them but I would have much rather known the truth. I don't even care that they said that. Any parent would. This started all the way back when we first started dating and he did some weird stuff like one time we were holding hands at a table at a bar and he tossed my hand aside when the waitress walked by and said ""sorry I didn't want the hot waitress to see."" And a few times he made jokes about cheating on me with ""hot Swedish girls"" when he went to Europe for his internship and he thought he was being funny. I was patient with these remarks until the incident at the bar when I was outraged and walked out when he said that. He caught up to me and explained to me that he was sorry and he's not experienced in relationships and he thought that I would like him more if he made me jealous. I corrected him. He agreed not to do those things anymore and he never did so we're good now on that. That's how it started though. And not much later I found a group picture on Facebook of a party during the internship and he was sitting there with a proud look on his face and some girl sitting on his lap. I got mad at him for this and explained to him that slutty behaviour is not cool with me. I don't want to be with someone who is so flirty with other girls when he goes away. I want to trust him on vacation. He hasn't done anything like that since then either so I do trust that he now has better boundaries. The reason I have a problem trusting him now is with lies but he thinks that the reason is because of those events with those girls and the jokes. I've honestly forgiven and forgotten about those. I honestly don't think he would cheat on me. He is a good guy with a good head on his shoulders. I just don't want to be with a flirt and I want him to not lie to me about things. He lies mostly for the sake of arguing. Sometimes it feels like he wants to argue just for his ego. I just can't seem to make him understand that if he wants me to trust him more, he needs to stop lying. His biggest issue with me is that I'm inquisitive, judgemental and doubting of him all the time but how can I not be?? He insists that lying is essential and even helpful in a relationship to avoid arguments and have things run more smoothly. I agree. If I spent a lot of time and money on my appearance for a night out and I thought I looked great but all he could think about is that he hates the colour of my eyeshadow, then it would probably be best for him to just lie and say he thinks I look perfect. (Although if he did say something I wouldn't mind; I'm just giving an example of what I believe a white lie to be). His lies have become to be mainly for keeping the argument in his favour though. The lies that I have caught him in were always mediocre lies that he said to keep the peace and if he would have just told me then I wouldn't have cared. There is almost nothing he has lied about where when he finally told me the truth, I wasn't okay with it. If he could just tell me the truth, it would save us so much time and stress because I was never mad about the things he lied about; I was mad at the fact that he lied. He is also a terrible liar so I often know when he is doing it. So if he would just tell the truth then there would never be any argument because there would be no lie to argue about! I wish we could just openly communicate so badly! I don't know if he is just afraid that the truth will disappoint me or what but he seriously thinks that I should just trust him because ""trust is an essential foundation in a relationship"" and he completely disregards honesty.

The thing with his parents really bothers me too. I asked him to leave our parents out of our problems and ask other people for advice when he needs it because parents can't really be objective and they will say whatever they need to say to protect their babies. I specifically told him that if he talks to his parents about this then they will just tell us to break up and sure enough, they did. Am I right about this?

How can we resolve this trust/honesty issue? Am I not right that he needs to show me he is working on being completely open and honest before I can trust him?  Can you see any faults of mine here? Am I asking too much by trying to get him to be more romantic? Is there anything I can do to help him open up? To what extent could a lot of these problems be a result of just spending too much time together? What is the secret to just living a normal, good life with your partner? How can I avoid turning out like my parents? Please don't respond saying we should just breakup."

I'm a very mediocre student looking for some advice. I've applied very broadly to general surgery residencies all over the US (I will be a US grad), but I'm considering switching to family medicine.

Really, over the past 2mo of surgery rotations, I have had some bad experiences. I love the OR and the procedures, working with my hands, and especially the rounds and care, but the people and lifestyle have really gotten to me.

Even as only an M4, I already feel like I'm invading some cliche and not welcome, caught basically being an M3.5. It's really frustrating. I mostly don't exist even though I constantly try to help and take initiative. I feel like I haven't really clicked with the people either. I'd definitely say I'm easy-going, easy to get along with, follow directions well, and many other qualities, but that the people on my service just don't care and are rude, critical, and just have no interest in students.

This scares me as a potential intern because I don't think I could take that for 5 years.

And then the lifestyle.. 

Fuck guys, I don't know. "

(Season 1, Episode 21) (Warning: SPOILERS)",otusasio451,FlashTV,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashTV/comments/3m0vd1/for_the_comicsnaive_grodd_lives_season_1_episode/,"Greetings, fellow Flash fanatics! This time…you know what, I’m too excited! So let’s get started!
________________________________

* **Our goldfaced burglar** is, of course, Wade Eiling, who we previously discussed in [this recap](). But, a lot of people (me included) had originally assumed he was the DCTV universe’s version of another character: Goldface. In the comics, Goldface is Keith Kenyon, a scientist (naturally) who turns to crime (naturally) by drinking a golden serum that gives him super-strength, invulnerability, and a healthy golden glow (naturally). Either that, or he was a college undergraduate who found sunken gold contaminated by toxic waste (NATurally). Because of this particular color-based theme, you may not be surprised to find out that he was originally a Green Lantern villain. Since he debuted during the Silver Age, he gave Hal a run for his money. That’s because of the now outdated weakness of the Green Lantern ring: the inability to affect anything yellow. But, Hal found a way to defeat him despite this weakness, and Kenyon was fought and defeated time and again. Eventually, Kenyon changed up his gimmick by donning golden armor and using a gun that…fired liquid gold. Huh. That sounds…[very familiar](). Maybe…hmm. Anyway, he began building a crime empire in Coast City, until that too was taken down by Green Lanterns. Over time, his skin also begins to change into a form of organic metal (which, no, isn’t technically a thing. Unless you’re talking about organometallic compunds, but that’s a whole different back of cats.), turning him into an actual goldface. With the heat on him from Green Lantern in Coast City, he relocated to, you guessed it, Central City, and became a villain of the Flash (Barry Allen). And then, *Crisis on Infinite Earths* happened, and the universe was rebooted. Now, Keith was a retired criminal living in Keystone City (the sister city to Central and home of Wally West) who became the commissioner of a worker’s union. He once again entered the Flash’s world as his *ally*, rather than his enemy. This is at the point where the villain Blacksmith and her Rogues took over Central City. Kenyon offered his help to Wally, and helped him take back the city. Why, you ask? Because Blacksmith was his ex-wife. He even convinced the union to help the Flash during this period. And…yeah, that’s it. No, there’s no evidence that Goldface was directly referenced in the show, but…come on! He had a gold face! They knew EXACTLY what they were doing. And who’s to say that Kenyon won’t appear in the series. I actually have a theory *coughfanficheadcanonunlessitturnsouttobetruecough*. Let’s say that Lisa gets caught and incarcerated, with her gun put either into evidence or to STAR Labs for analysis. Then, let’s say that Eiling’s mask is in the same location (we’ll go with the whole police incarceration idea). What if Kenyon is a student intern in need of some money, and steals both the mask and the gun? Boom. DCTV version of Goldface. Right? RIGHT? …Moving on.

* Hey, Caitlin’s name stuck! Remember, Cisco named Roy G. Bivolo Prism, and Caitlin gave him the name **Rainbow Raider**, which is his name in the comics. That’s a nice, subtle little touch that’s highly appreciated! If you want to learn more about Rainbow Raider, check out [this recap]() for more! In the meantime, I think it’s finally time.

* Actually, before that, let’s talk about **Iris’ speech to Joe.** This is more of a comment on a *very* common theme in comic books and related media (and ALL media that involves secrets of this nature). Iris makes the point that Joe could have protected her by informing her of the situation and allowing her the ability to prepare. And…yeah, that’s absolutely correct. This is one of the biggest problems with this trope, known as being [Locked Out of the Loop](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop). The idea is that an individual is protected from a secret, even though most other members of the main cast are fully aware of that secret. In comic book media, it’s usually done to protect the secret from the individual who’s locked out. But this often backfires, leading to the [Rage Against the Mentor](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheMentor) or the [What the Hell, Hero?](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero) speech. I won’t go into those here, but Iris gives both Barry and Joe the “What the Hell, Hero” speech in this episode. And for good reason! Iris is right in saying that bringing her in into the loop probably would have helped her and other people. To be fair, Iris hasn’t been the most resourceful person in the series thus far, but she proves her worth in this episode. That said…yeah, outside of this episode there aren’t a whole lot of reasons to believe that she could help. But, the trope is still repeated far too much, and it’s nice to see it addressed in this episode. And that’s the end of our trope discussion (which I do so often that I’m considering calling it **TropeTalk**). Moving on!

* THE TIME HAS COME!!! Let’s finally, FINALLY, ***FINALLY*** talk about…**GRODD**. Guys…you have no idea how much I’ve been waiting to talk about the glory that is Grodd, especially because this show does SUCH a good job at adapting what is, to be fair, one of the most ridiculous-yet-awesome characters from the comics. Ever since hint in the premiere, DC readers everywhere have been wondering when and how he’d show up, and how he’d be handled. And, lo and behold, the series does a great job! That said, though…let’s talk about the comic-book incarnation. Hang on, it’s about to get…interesting.

* To talk about **the comic-book incarnation of Grodd**, we need to start by talking about Gorilla City. Yeaaaaaaah, this is gonna get kinda weird. See, it all started in the 1860s, in the middle of the African rainforest (I’m assuming the Congo or somewhere near the Great Rift Valley, but it’s never actually said). An alien spaceship (told ya it’d get weird) crashes down in the middle of the jungle, and is found by a band of gorillas (band being the collective noun for gorillas, not a musical band; it’s already weird enough). Inside, they find a small, baby-like alien and a mysterious crystal. As one gorilla takes care of the helpless alien, the others examine the stone. In a struggle for it, it exudes a bright light that affects all of the gorillas in the band. Fast forward to 1873, when a group of British explorers stumbled upon a golden, futuristic city in the middle of the rainforest. Most surprising to them was the fact that the architects and inhabitants appeared to be gorillas. In the years since the alien had landed there, the crystal had given the gorillas super-intelligence, and the little telepathic alien had become a sacred figure to them. Although, to be honest, it was somewhat against its will, since the gorillas smashed his ship to prevent him from leaving them. Additionally, the crystal (called an “identity caster” by the alien) hit two gorillas right in the brain, and gave them new will and personality. One gorilla was Solovar, leader of Gorilla City and its wisest inhabitant. But the identity of the other gorilla was a mystery. The beam that hit Solovar bestowed a pure and kind personality onto him. But the other gorilla was hit but a dark, warped (eeeeeeeeevillllll) beam. And BOTH were given telepathy by the beams. The little alien asked the explorers to help him escape, before the dark gorilla tried to destroy him. Through the alien’s telepathy, all of the gorillas of the city learned English, the language spoken by the explorers. In meeting with Solovar, the gorillas told the explorers that they planned to reveal their hidden city to the human world. However, things went wrong pretty quickly. As the explorers helped the alien escape the city, one of them was suddenly taken over by a mysterious force, which caused the explorer to shoot and kill the alien. One explorer escaped (but went kinda crazy afterwards), whilst the other was caught by the gorillas and killed. And because of that, the gorillas learned to distrust humans, and hid their fantastic city and technology from the world. And at this point, you’ve probably guessed who that other telepathic gorilla was. And if you haven’t…well, it’s Grodd. Which tells us four things: Grodd is the only other telepathic gorilla outside of Solovar; he has a dark and greedy soul, with a deep seated lust for power (that’s why he had the guy kill the alien); he’s brilliant; and, most understated in his origins, he’s OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD. Somehow, nobody ever remembers that.

* **Eventually**, Grodd became tired of Solovar on the throne, in a place that he thought to be rightfully his. But none of the gorillas of the city would follow him. It’s at this point that Solovar was captured by humans whilst outside of the city, and brought to Central City. Grodd could not come into power after this, but he was now the only telepathic gorilla in the city. However, his power was not strong enough to bring any of the other gorillas under his influence, and he went to Central City to steal Solovar’s power (the Silver Age played loose and fast with the limits of telepathy). He succeeded, and Solovar freed himself to alert the Flash, who he knew to be a good man. The Flash then ran across the ocean to Gorilla City, where Grodd had already started to build his gorilla army to take over the world[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W7c8QghPxk) To take him down, Flash *literally* ran circles around Grodd, spinning him around. Doing so disoriented him enough to lose his power (again, fast and loose), and Grodd was imprisoned within Gorilla City. He’d return to exact his revenge of Flash, who thwarted his plans regularly. After a few different encounters (including one where a machine turned Grodd into a human), Grodd engineered the formation of the Rogues to take Flash down once and for all. Obviously, that didn’t work either. Over time, his motives changed from world domination to destroying humans so that apes could rule. At least 18 times, he’d tried to destroy all of humankind, and once used time-travel to do so. Didn’t work, but it’s the effort that counts. In a separate instance, he attempted to turn all humans into feral beasts. Again, it didn’t work, but the effort! Time and time again, Grodd was defeated by the Flash and various other heroes. But then…then something changed. Again. 

* **Grodd got darker.** WAY darker. Like…[eating people darker](). See, in 1999, he lost his intelligence in a fight with the Martian Manhunter. And when he came back, he came back with a vengeance. His powers increased significantly, and he was able to control powerhouses like Solomon Grundy and Mongul. And then, sometime later it was stated that Grodd could absorb intelligence by eating the brains of humans. That, combined with his already-established hatred for humans, turned Grodd into a very scary character. Whilst incarcerated in Iron Heights, he managed to control the minds of several gorillas from Gorilla City, and they broke him (and all the metahumans in the prison) out. And that kicked off the story known as *Run Riot*. Instead of escaping, Grodd returned to take down Flash. He [killed former Rogues leader Blacksmith](), and turned [to face his eternal foe.]() And…yeah, [Flash is in]() [a LOT of trouble](). Amidst his psychic powers and physical prowess, Flash barely escapes alive. He only lives due to the help of [another prisoner, Fallout](). But then, during his escape, Grodd encountered Hunter Zolomon, whom he knew to be a friend of the Flash. Out of rage, [he grabbed Zolomon and…well…](http://www.4thletter.net/random/top_15/13/snap.jpg)he didn’t kill him, but he did something worse. Yeah, Grodd inadvertently created Zoom. Whoops. Grodd escapes and, as usual, he goes to take down Gorilla City, and to build his army. It should be noted that Solovar was killed by a car bomb (yeah, that’s a whole other story), and his son had taken his place as ruler of Gorilla City. And he was…less accommodating to Flash, and to humans in general. Flash DID manage to defeat Grodd, but Grodd was kept in Gorilla City this time. He was later freed (OF COURSE) by Abra Kadabra, and made a deal with the Rogues to help in their *Rogue War* (check out [this recap]() for more on that awesome story). But he didn’t have a lot more significant appearances like *Run Riot*. In *Salvation Run* (a not-great story where all of the supervillains are sent to a desolate planet), he kills rival gorilla-villain (…gorrilain?) Monsieur Mallah, and his master (and boyfriend…comics are WEIRD) the Brain. He was then healed by a magic gorilla baby (just…don’t ask) back on Earth, and once again defeated by the Flash. He somehow ends up in Gorilla City once again, and actually gains a loyal following of subjects that believe in his power. He also gets his very own collection of brains to eat. Yeah. A LOT darker. In this appearance, he faces off against Lex Luthor, who’s traversing the jungles of Uganda. Grodd then goes to face him, [wielding his best combat spoon]()…OK, a little darker. But still a little silly. And speaking of silly, that issue ends with Luthor REALLY outclassing Grodd in the intellect department. I mean…seriously, read *Action Comics* #893. It’s…it’s kind of amazing.

* Grodd, in my opinion, is something that **the New 52** did very well. They turned Grodd into a much more savage character, which the comics had been doing anyway. Flash happens upon the city by accident, travelling through the Speed Force and winding up in Gorilla City. Here, he encounters the new king, Grodd. Granted, he gained that title by killing his own father and eating his brain to gain his knowledge, but still. Grodd is the bonafide king of the gorillas, here. He shouldn’t want anything. But during his battle with the Flash (which has to do with Flash being a prophesied messenger and destroying Grodd’s legitimacy, or some such), they wind up in the Speed Force. And alongside his traditional psychic abilities, [he ALSO gets super-speed](http://geek-prime.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/flash-new-52-14-grodd-jpg.jpg). Yeah. They found a way to make Grodd SCARIER. Awesome. To be fair, though, he eventually loses that power, and decided to try taking over Central City with a gorilla army. Because that’s just what Grodd does. He’s stopped not by Flash, but by the Central City Rogues (although he takes Trickster’s arm down with him). And…that’s it. For now. I should also probably note that I personally love [Grodd’s redesign](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101416/3291225-grodd.png). It really ups his barbarian nature, and makes him even more savage and terrifying. And, yeah, Grodd always had pride in his superior intellect and technology, but this works too! And speaking of adaptations (OK, so that’s [not a great segue](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/09/article-1168771-0442785A000005DC-932_468x306.jpg), but follow me on this)…

* Grodd’s always been one of Flash’s more charismatic villains, so he’s had many *adaptations in comic-book media**. He first appeared [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3PF4ZnwIzY) [Challenge of the Superfriends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hZ-il7Ey9I) and its 1980s sequel series, where he first gained some prowess. In this adaptation, we also see Grodd’s telepathy helmet briefly. But then, Grodd, disappeared for a number of years. And then, the DCAU series *Justice League* came along, and brought an awesome Grodd with it. This would become the iconic version of Grodd for a generation (me included). Voiced by Powers Boothe, Grodd first appeared in the episode *The Brave and the Bold*, and attempted to take over Central City (naturally). He did this using his trademark helmet to enslave those that he needed (Flash included), and then the city. And then, of course, he attempted to destroy Gorilla City (again, naturally), until being defeated by the Flash fiddling with his helmet. While that did debilitate Grodd for a little while, it also gave him permanent mental powers. He then sought revenge on the Flash and the Justice League by organizing a team to greak them down. This was the Secret Society, and Grodd used (and his mental powers) to break the Justice League down. But it didn’t work, and that culminated in a final battle between the League and the Society. This ended in one of my favorite moments in the series: [Grodd vs. Superman.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOFrGqDMPd8) I’ll let you watch that for yourself. In the sequel series *Justice League Unlimited*, Grodd would return with a new organization: the Legion of Doom. He would recruit Lex Luthor into this group. And just like in their comic book encounter, that also wouldn’t end very well for one of them. Luthor and Grodd turned on each other, and their rivalry ended in the first part of the series finale. [Here’s their final encounter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqNksmIXUUg), but it’s extremely spoilery. All I’ll say is this: the winner’s last line is awesome. Grodd was also a fairly regular villain in *Batman: The Brave and the Bold*, and was voiced by John DiMaggio. And, yeah, he was sillier in that series (which was based on the Silver Age, to be fair), but still a fairly menacing villain. And then…

* OK, let’s wrap this up. Here’s why **the show’s adaptation of Grodd** is fantastic. You may have noticed that Grodd’s origins in the show are COMPLETELY WRONG when compared to the comics. And yet, every comic book fan who watches this show LOVED him. Why? BECAUSE THEY MADE A TELEPATHIC GORILLA WORK. Seriously. Gorilla Grodd, despite his awesomeness, is by far one of the silliest villains (conceptually) in DC Comics. He. Is. A. Psychic. Gorilla. This should not be able to work in a serious show. And yet, Grodd was made into one of the show’s most terrifying and threatening villains. I mean…DAMN. You saw that episode! IT WAS AMAZING. Yeah, Grodd’s a captive gorilla made into a metagorilla by the particle explosion. Yeah, there’s no Gorilla City. Yeah, there’s no Solovar (which, I’ll admit, makes me a little sad; Solovar’s pretty awesome). But, guys…THEY PULLED IT OFF. If this show can bring in a telepathic gorilla and make him into a credible threat that’s also not a laughingstock…yeah, this show knows what it’s doing. Just...oh my Grodd, guys. Oh my Grodd.

* …OK, one more thing. Just because **DC’s got a thing with non-human primates**. I mean, they’ve got heroes like Detective Chimp, Congorilla, Beppo the Super-Monkey, and Sam Simeon (not making those up), and villains like Ultra Humanite, Monsieur Mallah, Titano, and Gorilla Boss (a mob boss whose brain is in the body of a gorilla; NOT making that up), AND an alternate universe where everyone’s been hit by a ray that turns all humans into apes (look up *JLApe: Gorilla Warfare*; **NOT** making that up). So, yeah, DC likes its apes. OK, tangent over. Back on track!

* In another excellent example of repurposing villain devices from the comic books (see Cisco’s “Wizard’s Wand” for another example of this), **Cisco’s telepathy-blocking helmet** is also in the comics. The difference is that the helmet is used *by* Grodd, rather than against him. In the comics, Grodd uses the helmet to boost his telepathic abilities. It didn’t appear much, and eventually disappeared altogether. However, it’s an element that’s been seen in nearly every out-of-comics incarnation of Grodd. It was probably made most famous by the 2000s series *Justice League* and *Justice League Unlimited*, and was adapted to every incarnation after that. Despite its little use in the comics, it’s nice to see that the show’s decided to continue that legacy.

* This is not the first time a Flash has used **the super-sonic punch against Grodd**. Wally West notably used it to punch Grodd, and ended up launching him over a distance of several miles in the process. Awesome. I really hope we see that in the show. Somehow.

3m0wvb,32,2015-09-22,You can't have your cake and eat it too,NoChildrenForMe,truechildfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/truechildfree/comments/3m0wvb/you_cant_have_your_cake_and_eat_it_too/,"Throwaway because I don't want this traced back to my main account, but oh well. Now that I've typed this all out I realize that it's more of an ""off-my-chest"" post and a bit of a personal vent to get some of these feelings out and I'll probably x-post to there too. I'm pretty sure that plenty of you guys have experienced this as well and this is another story to add to that stack, but I've just been wanting to vent a bit about this.

So I'm a 20 year old college student. I always knew in the back of my mind that I didn't want kids. However, I'm the youngest daughter of eight kids, was home schooled until high school, and my parents are highly traditional Southern Baptists. Even though I always knew that I never wanted children, up until entering college it hadn't ever really occurred to me that I didn't have to have kids. There was never any other option presented to me, it was always just the assumed path that I would maybe go to college, then get married and start having kids. My parents now know that I don't want kids, but they think that I'm just young and will change my mind. Luckily they're rather gentle about that opinion and don't harp on me about it, they just figure they're playing the waiting game. I also don't think that it's quite as much a big deal to them as it would be to other traditional families simply because I have so many other siblings that it's not like it's any true loss to their dreams of grandchildren.

I'm now in college, paying all of my own bills, own my own car, work two jobs while being a full time student, one of those jobs being interning part time with a Fortune 100 company an hour away that I commute to 3 times a week, and an officer of several student organizations on campus. Safe to say, I've decided that I like my time, energy, health, my money (what little of it I've managed to save from bills and tuition), and that I will never want children. I'm also not the greatest with relationships. I'm an extremely high energy person, and sometimes rather awkward when it comes to relationships; as in the longest relationship I've been in was 3 months, and I don't have the time to devote to a relationship that I would really want to give to my SO. Because I'm only 20 that doesn't really bother me, but sometimes it would be nice to have someone that I could count on to be there for me and vice versa.

But anyways, this summer I landed my 1st internship with a rather high profile company (Fortune 100, non-disclosure agreements about everything I do for them, etc.). I've transitioned to working for them part time during the academic year until I hit their hour-cap for the year and would no longer be considered an intern. While it's not my third internship while in college, this is my first one for a truly career company. There were about 150 interns for this one plant location, and because the company is mostly an engineering company, there were only about 30 of us that would try to get together with the others and have social lives outside of work while we were there for the summer. I happened to meet this really great, awesome guy who was also interning there for the summer, who happened to be an engineering grad student at my college. His name is G. I'm a double business undergrad, and we were in completely different departments and functions so it wasn't like there was any problem with the two of us dating.

Everything was great... And I mean it. G and I clicked extremely well, had a few differences but were able to easily talk them through, had great sexual chemistry as well. Except for one day, when we got to talking about kids in general, I don't remember how at this point how the topic was brought up. But of course, I'm up front with the fact that I don't ever want children; it's a fact that all of my friends know from when the subject came up in conversation. Well, he wants kids. Very much so. G's 26, ex-military, and wants to start a family while he's still young and would be able to have the energy to keep up with them. It was a deal-breaker for both of us. G confided in me that I am exactly what he wants in a wife, but the fact that I don't want children is something that he would never be able to get over.

So we broke up. I wasn't.... heartbroken... more disappointed at the loss of a potential relationship with someone that I could really tell that I really clicked with at no fault of our own, just our differing aspirations in life. I'm glad it came up when it did: we had been together just long enough to become close friends, but not so long and so emotionally attached that either of us would be devastated by the loss of the relationship. We remained good friends and our social circles both share several mutual friends who know what all happened.
However, shortly after we broke up he began dating another woman, and from what I can tell, they seem happy. I'm honestly not surprised that it didn't take him long to find someone as he's very attractive, values his health, and is a very intelligent man. But because it was so short a time between our dating and his new relationship, I've kept my distance out of respect for them. I haven't met her yet, but I know that if I were to start dating someone and knew that the girl he had dated previously was still in the picture, even as a friend, I would have serious doubts and concerns even if I kept them private, and I really wouldn't be so trusting. So out of respect for her, I've kept my distance besides the occasional text or two.

Despite the stereotypes of engineers and their social ineptitudes, G is very perceptive, and I think he finally noticed the way that I kind of withdrew from him (I still hang out quite a bit with our mutual friends, one of which is his roommate) and started making an effort to spend some degree of time with me. Mostly working out at the gym together, or studying with him and his roommate.

The other night though, while the three of us—G, his roommate, and myself—were studying, G's roommate went to bed early leaving the two of us alone. After a bit, when I was having some trouble with some homework and G had already finished with his, he sat next to me to help, and while it was mostly so that he could see what I was doing, once I was done with the problems that were giving me trouble, he didn't leave. He stayed there next to me, and we ended up sort of cuddled up on the couch while I worked on homework and he read a book and it was more—intimate—than not. Honestly, this is where I messed up, because I should have made an excuse to move, or reminded him of his girlfriend. I didn't and looking back on it, I think it was because I was still feeling a bit lonely. That doesn't excuse the lack of action on my part though. We ended up kissing, and at that point I stopped things. Honestly his actions that night and toward me in general make it look —from my perspective at least—as if he regretted breaking things off. However, I'm probably not the most reliable narrator in this.

I'm going to go back to politely keeping my distance so that something like that doesn't happen again. I have no pity for cheaters, and I loathe myself for my actions. I would also hate for my actions to be the reason that someone wouldn't have an otherwise healthy and fulfilling relationship. I just don't understand why, after he was the one to break up with me, would still be acting as if he was having regrets and still harbored feelings. Before he began dating this other girl, we had stayed friends with benefits for a short time before he told me that he couldn't separate the sex and the emotions, but that happened well before he started dating this other girl. I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too, is the moral of all this.

I guess that I'm just afraid that my future relationships are going to be like this: where everything is going well and then this deal-breaker comes up and it's a struggle to find someone who is also childfree. I'm sure there are those people out there who also meet my criteria for relationships, it just seams like I'm never going to find them.

TL;DR Broke up with guy over not wanting kids; he's starting to act like he regrets making that decision."

Like the title implies, I'm gonna graduate this year as a double major in Math and Computer Science, and so far, I've been applying to software engineering roles for after graduation.

The thing is, I'm not entirely sure if I'd like it or not, so I'm thinking of expanding my search towards stats/analytics jobs. I was wondering what my chances were of getting positions like that, with no relevant internship experience or not. The only stats related things I've done is taken courses in Mathematical Probability and Statistics, and I can program. 

So, be brutal. I know a Masters helps a lot, but I can wait a few years for that, right now I'm looking at the short term. Do I have a shot? If yes:

-How should I prepare? Take a random data set, do some regression model on it, write a report, and slap it on my resume?

-What would interviews be like?

-Where can I find places to apply to? If it helps, I'd prefer a city area, like New York/Boston.

-What salary would be acceptable for a fresh out of college grad?

Any help/advice at all would be appreciated. Feel free to ask questions about my background as well, as I'm not entirely sure what is/isn't relevant. Thanks!

3m13tk,4,2015-09-23,Me [20/F] Manager making me uncomfortable and getting physical[35 M] 1yer,donotdeliver,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3m13tk/me_20f_manager_making_me_uncomfortable_and/,"Hello, sorry to post under a new account/throwaway but this will be explained in the story.

I have been having issues with a manager at work in the last 3 months  making me uncomfortable and it has now backed me into a corner. I work at a local fast food chain, which has no HR  department nor anyone who seems available to help.

I have a manager who seems to have developed a bit of a crush on me but has taken thing a bit too far. In the last few months things start going from barely noticeable to full on aggressive.

I have chosen a throwaway because my manager has started to follow me on most of my social media. He will make comments about how I am beautiful, will favorite pictures and bring up these things at work. I have since deleted them and made sure not to post any personal information.

I do not really know where to begin so I can only list the things that have been happening:

* He will buy chocolates, snacks and gifts and offer them to me and although I decline, or that I do not eat chocolate  or say I am on a diet it still persists.

* He has taken to slipping marijuana and other drugs as ""gifts"" into my  purse, or lunch bag although I do not partake and our job is a drug free workplace. ( This makes me extremely uncomfortable as that can easily get me fired or jail time if eh decides to blame me)

* While by the oven he pulled out a hot pizza screen and through it and it landed against my arm. I was hurt but, it was an accident and I jokingly said ""Haha watch out or I can sue for workers comp"" To which he replied  "" Not if they find drugs on you.""  ( I DO NOT DO DRUGS OF ANY KIND. i cried once because I thought a drug dog at my school would get me in trouble because I had halls cough drops in my backpack"")

* He often asks me to speak with him alone, or in the freezer and will  produce gifts or complain that he is sick and ask for hugs, and will often find me at restaurants next to our job when I am on break and try to join.

* He has started to approach me from behind and hug me, or will wipe things from my face or stroke my hair. He begs for hugs saying his stomach hurts and its the only thing that makes him feel better. Or will try to hug me and kiss my hair or neck. ( I have told him this is extremely inappropriate)

* He has started to ask if he can visit my home, sleep over, etc. After giving him excuses or outright refusing he will beg until I say that I am not going home.

* I have clearly informed him that I have a boyfriend, but when I am going home with said boyfriend he will bully or insult him to his face, he's lately changed to being nice and friendly.

* I have informed him I am not interested in him and that resulted in my hours being changed/cut, scheduled to only work with him at night etc.  I have been promoted to assistant manager by our owner and I am now in charge of my own scheduling which has made things a bit better, but he is still able to  edit my time after I have worked.

* I have called and had a chance to speak with the general manager of our store who I guess ended up telling him the details of our conversation. Last week my manager pulled me outside and asked me why I hate him and he's in love with me and has been trying to make things better for me etc, and has continued to bring gifts to the store. I know longer carry a purse and was upset that my general manager seemed to have broken the confidence I placed in him.

* I've recently planned a weekend off with a female coworker and our boyfriends to go out of town, and on our breaks he will often sit and join or insert himself into the conversation. We were discussing our weekend trip and she mentioned the info and he promptly went on his phone and purchased a ticket to the event saying he wants to go with us. We respectfully declined but as he said "" If I'm not getting off, no one is""

I've worked at this job for a year and a half now and have started to look for other jobs as it seems it is my only option. Although it sounds a bit whiny, I do not feel it is fair I have leave a job I enjoy.My job is extremely easygoing and surprisingly decent money and  I'd really like to keep my job as I'm going through a certification program right now and an internship that won't provide me any money. The following on social media and saving pictures and bringing them to work has made me uncomfortable but I realize that is my fault for putting anything online that anyone can access, although non of it was inappropriate. I just do not feel comfortable with someone 15 plus years my age and in a position of power over me butting into my social life despite efforts of saying no.


Sorry for being long winded, but if anyone has advice on what I should do or how I can stop encouraging unwanted attention without being bullied out of my job I would greatly appreciate it. I have screen caps of his comments on My media, and messages he has sent on facebook.  Leaving seems to be my only option but I do not want to accept that yet.


**TL;DR**  Manager sexually harassing me at work and setting up evidence for false blackmail.


UPDATE: Sincerely thank all of you for the advice, there was a lot of thins I really needed to hear. o appreciate everything everyone has said. Although the managers above me haven't been of much help. I have notified my female friend who is also very helpful with calling out the behavior. I did stand up for myself today which ended up with the harasser sneaking out of work and leaving another present in my purse. Tomorrow I have the day off and will be contacting the owner of the chain as a whole, I've already sent him an email will screenshots, etc.. Hopefully this goes down okay."
3m15bq,2,2015-09-23,Can alcohol and weed fry your brain at an early age?,GIMMEMYPANCAKEMIX,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3m15bq/can_alcohol_and_weed_fry_your_brain_at_an_early/,"Okay so i'm seventeen, started drinking and smoking at 14. I progressively started to get into that lifestyle and smoked weed regularly, drank on the weekends. I started off small, blazing it on the weekends, I didn't really drink until fifteen. I've always gotten good grades and been a great student, I'm in the top ten percent of my graduating class. I've binge drank quite a few times and blacked out and feel like I've really damaged my brain to the point of no return. 

July 14th this year was the last time I've smoked, since my parents put me in this program to stay away from drugs, which hasn't exactly worked out since I still drink and do coke occasionally (since it doesn't come out on drug tests after 3 to 4 days). I've done coke for the past couple of months now, but it's really not all that, it's a waste of money. The one time I really felt it was when I shelled out $70 and racked it all up one night. It's not worth it. I've done adderall occasionally since my sophomore year and it's much more productive than anything else I've done tbh. 

I don't really smoke anymore but in my soberness I've realized that it hasn't helped my mental aptitude much. I've realized that because when I drank I smoked, that the neuroprotective effects of THC would counteract the alcohol's damaging effect on the brain. I now intern at a prestigious office of a politician and feel some form of psychomotor retardation. I feel like the tedious tasks take me way longer than they should. My calculus homework takes longer than it should. I feel fried to say the least. Everything takes way longer than it should. I don't really feel much joy from life and everything is pretty passive. I'm a senior in highschool as of now and feel an immense pressure to go to college, but don't really know what I want to do or where to go. 

I guess you could say it's stressful but the stressful part is knowing I've messed up my brain for good. I don't know if there's any way to reverse the damage or a way to stimulate production of brain cells, but I do know I have this minor headache that lingers on me throughout the day, because of my history with drugs. Is that my brain telling me it's fried? Or am I just delusional? I can't seem to remember little things and my short term memory is just terrible. I can't process information in school anymore and seem to forget what we were supposed to learn that day. I feel like now I've messed up my chances of even being able to pass college or make it through life sane and sober because of how much I've fucked myself over. Any advice or suggestions?"
3m16oe,2,2015-09-23,My (22m) feelings remain for my close friend (27f) after all this time.,Slurpegad,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3m16oe/my_22m_feelings_remain_for_my_close_friend_27f/,"As the title says, I'm 22m (but I'm also pre everything mtf transgender; she knows and is 100% okay with it) and have strong feelings for my close friend ""Lindsey"" (as we'll call her, 27f). I've known Lindsey for 3.5 years, I met her during my freshman year of college.

I fell for her pretty quickly. We were able to talk so easily. She's super sweet and overly polite (starting phone calls to businesses with ""Sorry to bother you, I have a question...etc). She's a hippie type minus the pot aspect. She has 3 kids right now ages 8, 3, and 1. They have different dads that Lindsey has minimal contact with. I am able to accept it and she's the only person with kids that I would date at this point in my life.

A few months after I started hanging out with her, I got into my first serious relationship. In those few months I dated this other girl, I falsely went back into denial of being trans. After I broke up with this girlfriend, Lindsey told me she saw through my bullshit. A month or so after dumping my ex, I admitted my feelings to Lindsey. She actually let me down gently by saying that she needed to get her life in order before dating anyone, but it didn't make things awkward.

We gradually started hanging out less and less in 2013 due to life's business. I didn't talk to her in 2014 until like September or October when I found out she was a client at the agency where I was completing my internship. 

She had been depressed because CPS removed her kids because her mom and her apartment manager illegally entered her apartment and it was a mess. Lindsey went through a depression and rarely talked to anyone during that time. She was raped by one of her neighbors' son's friends and that's how the one year old came along.

We began talking more and began hanging out a couple times a week for the last 6 months. Somewhere in that time, my feelings came back stronger than ever for her. We would hang out and she'd give me signals: she hugged me a lot tighter than before, she had talked about getting out of her apartment and suggested we get a place together, she even said that she'd tell her doctor (who's also my doctor) that she was having hormonal issues to try and get estrogen that she'd give to me (we both knew it's the wrong way to go about it, but it was sweet of her to be so considerate.)

My therapist didn't think it was a good idea to move in with her because of the responsibilities that come with 3 kids. I also didn't want to fight with her over child rearing and I don't know how living with her would have gone. I told her again that my feelings for her were back and she didn't exactly turn me down this time. It felt good. However, as I thought more and more about it, things would not work well in a relationship for us. I told her that I didn't think it'd be good to date and why risk a 3 year friendship?

Bu then in June, she went camping at the lakes in our town. Some male friend of hers was there too. One of my friends and I went there to hang out with everyone. The other dude was all over her, he had his arm around her and hung on her for most of the night. I watched him kiss her and she told him she loved him. It broke my heart. We goofed around in the lake for a bit and hung out, which was nice, but after my fried and I left, he had to take over driving because I broke down crying because it hurt to see her kiss someone else.

I thought that night killed all romantic feelings for her. She had told me she wanted a platonic lover to go on adventures with and that she didn't like kissing much because of the spit and she would oblige to sex if she and the partner wanted a child and then she lets that guy hang on and kiss her. 

I still talked to her and hung out on occasions, but that extra feeling of warmth was gone. I had been talking to this other girl ""Jena"" who seemed sweet. She and I both worked retail and she was also okay with me being trans. In July I asked her out and she said yes. Only to dump me 2 days later over because she ""was caught up in the moment"" after I kissed her. I tried hanging out with her, but it wasn't the same and she go to be pretty flaky.

Lindsey was there for me the night I got dumped. We've continued to hang out and are still super close. The main things that keep drawing me in to her are: 1. Even though I still live as a guy for the most part, she still genders me correctly (using feminine pronouns and my female name) 2. She and I  seem to click personality wise, we're both sensitive, I find her really easy to talk to, and we ave so much in common starting with political views and the ability to hold meaningful intellectual conversations; and 3. Her ""flirtiness"". As soon as she was comfortable calling me a close friend (about a month or two of knowing eachother) she would always tell me she loved me (and continues to do so each day). She hugs me tighter recently than she used to, she says things like ""I adore you, I'm madly in love with you,"" etc. She even told me once after we hugged: "" oh, you're so warm. Can you be my blanket?"" I feel that we get one another.

The incident at the lakes has been almost 3 months ago now, and my feelings remained platonic for 2.5 of those months. She apologized for ""stomping on my heart"" as drunk me told her the day before my birthday. Her excuse was that she let him kiss her so she could get away to hang with me (which I find to be bullshit, but whatever). But to keep myself in check when I've hing with her, I bring the mental image of those two kissing to hold back my returning feelings.

So I guess the point is what do I do? I know I'm setting myself up for heartbreak if I try to pursue anything more than friendship with her. She returned to the school where we met this semester, so she's probably too busy for romance. I love her kids, but I don't know how I'd be able to handle them I don't want to stop hanging out with her though because she's one of few good things that came out of my rough college experience (the others being my bachelor's degree and the courage to come out to tons more people). Thoughts on this would be much appreciated.

TL;DR Amazing girl I've known for years continues sending me mixed signals and my feelings remain strong after shitty situations."
3m16xv,1,2015-09-23,My life is 4 month chunks on loop,CyclicalProbability,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3m16xv/my_life_is_4_month_chunks_on_loop/,"I have regularly slotted internships as part of my college program. Every 4 months I switch between school and ""work"".

It's been pretty cyclic:
1) Do poorly in school, blame it on getting stuck and never leaving the house on weekends [I think the worst it got was not leaving my room for over 3 days besides going to the bathroom and drinking from the sink]
2) Somehow manage to snag a good internship
3) Start new internship promising myself that this term will be different, that I'll finally start focusing on intellectual pursuits and life will just fall into place
4) Instead, coast through internship with limited interaction and hiding in my room all weekend like every other internship and school term
5) Go back to school, rinse, repeat

The system has worked okay thus far.  The artificial high of a perceived clean slate every 4 months is a welcome reprieve, but normally only lasts a week or two.

The problem now is my internships have slowly taken me farther away from my family and (limited) friends, geographically speaking. First to the neighbouring province, then across the country, and now to another country. I figured that such risks would pay off, I'd experience new things. Instead its mainly managed to amplify the feeling of isolation.

Moving every 4 months, I'm less inclined to make a change in my behaviour. Why join a social group if I'm only ever going to be in one place for 4 months? Why try dating? Why try [insert other beneficial routine activity]?

I'll be graduating soon, so something has to change. No idea where to start though. Perhaps I'm hoping a post like this will allow me to trick myself into assessing my problems as an outsider (it's always feels like its easier to solve someone else's problems huh?)

Thanks for your time :)"

Was working an internship in a distant city and was told to come a hospital 2.5 hours away because my brother wasn't feeling well.

Heart and mind racing I sped to the hospital and was brought back to a room. With parents and a doctor sitting and waiting, i was told my brother was dead.  I will never forget any of it.

Ran to my brother's hospital room and have never felt lower in life than when I saw his lifeless body on the table.  I cried and screamed and wanted to take my own life then and there.

Life moves on but you never fully forget what happened. 

To all those surviving suicide, I want to give you all a hug.  Stay strong and live for your lost loved ones as they would have wanted you to.

Much love,"
3m1xbg,1,2015-09-23,[update] i told her fiancee.,pleasedontgetmarried,adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/3m1xbg/update_i_told_her_fiancee/,"I am updating [this thread.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/3lq78f/my_ap_is_getting_married_on_saturday_im_the/)

I know how unpopular of a thing this is in your world, I am sure you will hate me. please do. I hate myself.

I do not have anywhere else to write this, which is why I am writing it here. I need to get it out. I do not have anyone to talk to about this. I had a breakdown at my new job and in a moment of weakness I told my boss. What an awful first impression of me she now has. She was incredibly kind to me, kinder than I deserve. I lost my best friend of 10 years over this. When I first tried to talk to her when it started, I was terribly confused and I turned to her for advice. She told me I was a horrible person and she never wanted to speak to me again. She hasn't. She is right.

I did not set out yesterday to tell her fiancee. I would have never thought it would happen. I actually look back, and I was looking at sex toys for me to buy for the next time I see her, looking forward to the things I would do with her. I didn't think it would happen. I am not exactly sure why it did... maybe it was something she said, maybe it was something inside myself.

I tried to make a boundary for myself. This sounds incredibly ridiculous as I type it. I met her after her wedding was planned... I feel as if to ask her to call it off would be too much. She made it clear she wanted both of us, she ""couldn't have everything she wanted."" The boundary that I created for myself was to tell her that I cannot expect her to leave now, but if she has kids with her, then she is more willingly choosing her fiancee over me than she is now. And that was my line. If she had kids she didn't want me. She would be completely committed to her in my eyes. There's no going back from that.

She reacted like a hurt child. She was offended I would leave. I could feel the hurt from her words. I told her she had no right to be upset if I left because of that, because she isn't choosing me and I need a boundary for myself. I told her I would always stay. It is killing me. I needed something to tell myself, something to survive. Her reaction was not something I had anticipated. It gave me pause.

I had been emailing her all day as usual, fighting as usual. I was listening to a lecture at work, ruminating about this entire situation. It kind of just came to me that I should just tell her fiancee. And it wasn't the panicked thoughts of what do I do, just thinking... it was the calm feeling of certainty. I know for certain I would never be able to stop seeing her. She would not be able to stop seeing me. All we do anymore is fight and still we exchange hundreds of emails a day. I cannot take the ""maybes"" and the ""what ifs,"" the ""someday,"" and the ""I don't know what the future holds."" I do not blame her for them, they make sense... but it became clear to me that I was a safety net. 

Part of me is so angry at her for doing this to her fiancee. I long for what she claimed she had with her. To love someone enough to want to be with them even though things aren't great. She said she wanted to be with her, and still she couldn't help but to see me. I long for one person, she had two. It makes me angry.

I felt like I needed to tell her, in my gut. I first analyzed my reasons for doing so. Were they for me, were they to hurt, were they to win her? The answer that I came up with, in the quietest parts of myself, was that I knew I would never be able to stop. it is literally destroying me. She said she would never speak to me again if I told her fiancee. I never want to stop seeing her, but it is the only way I felt capable of doing something, anything to stop this hurt that doesn't seem to have an ending. I also felt like her fiancee needed to know. I hung out with them before, she is a nice person. The last thing she ever said to me was that she knew we were meant to be friends, because we got the same kind of ice cream at a festival. And I slept with her fiancee. 

She made it clear to me she knew her fiancee would not approve, that it was not okay. She told her we stopped talking, she told her all we did was ""kiss"" that one day. But she was still seeing me, still had plans to see me after the wedding. I just felt like she needed to know. The guilt that I felt was so far down under everything else that I felt, but it was there. I think that is the only part of myself that feels any relief right now. I feel as if I only have 99,999 pounds of pressure on my chest instead of 100,000.

I still wonder if I did it to hurt, or to win her. It is a hard thing to know. I don't know if the thought occurs to me because it is true, or because I know logically it is possible. The answer that I come up with is that I do not want to hurt her or ruin her life, that I did this to free myself. And I did not expect her to pick me or want me after this. How could she want me.

I told her fiancee over facebook. I essentially said: I thought that you should know. She has been lying to you. We've been seeing each other the whole time, we didn't just kiss. We have plans for after the wedding. I don't want to go into detail because I don't want to be cruel, but if you ask I will tell. You should hear it from her. I can't keep going this way, it's killing me. I'm sorry.

All she responded was I hate you.

I felt like telling her I fucked her in their bed, in my bed, in our cars, in our office. I made her squirt, she made me cum. She told me she loved me, that she thought about being with me, that she wanted to be with me. That she started it, while I was an intern. All of the hundreds of pictures and recordings, the thousands of emails. I thought sending that proof was unnecessarily cruel. I told her she could ask if she wanted to know. I am almost positive she still doesn't know even the half of it. She would have never told her anything. She was keeping that secret to the grave. She only told her what she had to, I am sure. I don't know if that matters to me.

Only my guilt is somewhat alleviated, everything else is the same or worse. I never thought I would ever love anyone the way that I loved her. As messed up as this situation was, in those moments with her.. I never thought I could feel that. I never knew I could. And I feel almost certain I never will again.

Knowing that, knowing that I ""should"" try to find it again... makes me feel like I am dead. The thought of never seeing her again, touching her, kissing her, just being with her, just knowing what she's thinking, feeling, doing... makes me feel like I am gasping for air, and I'm waiting for the relief but it never comes. I am dead. 

She emailed me on our secret email last night to say to never contact her again. I said that I was sorry. She said fucking bullshit, you are not. Don't talk to me. Go rot. She completely deleted that email. I was the only person she emailed, she deleted the things she saved from me, the kind words I said to her... she deleted me.

I still don't know what happened. I know that I don't deserve to know, but I want to. I hope that I didn't ruin her life and I hope that it brings them closer together. I do wish her happiness. Everything I ever said and felt is still 100% there. I wish I could communicate that with her now but I do not think that she cares. I do not matter anymore, and I hardly ever did. Part of me wants to take one of her old fake emails and use it as a diary, I don't know why. Just knowing that I have just sent her an email was always comforting to me. 

I will miss her more than I can possibly describe. I am dead."
3m2izi,1,2015-09-23,Night and day differences on and off Lexapro,addpi3456,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3m2izi/night_and_day_differences_on_and_off_lexapro/,"Just wanted some input or people who have been on Lexapro to comment. I'm an ADHD law student that has suffered from pretty severe anxiety and depression throughout law school, while I've been on Adderall 20 to 25 mg daily for the past two to three years to help me with my school work and internships. When I first started Lexapro 10 mg at the end of my second year, it felt like weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders. I was no longer taking my Adderall in excess and was just going through my day. I was able to hold a job but started to lose my motivation and was irritable at times through the day. I started combining the two medications and ended up getting through my internship.

I don't think I was as professional as I should have been or made many friends (because my current gf relocated with me for the job and she has issues of her own), but I got through. When I returned home my famiy said I was extremely different and they felt completely disconnected from me. I stayed on Lexapro 10 mg throughout my entire third year of law school and it was at graduation in May, I noticed I wasn't feeling a thing. I killed myself to get to this point and there wasn't even little bit of happiness. I tried to come off the Lexapro 10 mg following graduation and started brawling with my girlfriend and all this anger started building up.

I am certain I will have to retake the bar exam and my anxiety has also returned when I try to go to my school to study and I'm not sure if Lexapro is helping or hurting me anymore. She also tries to come with me wherever I go and I'm not sure if she is the source of anxiety all this time, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't more anxious being by myself at school too. Lexapro allows me to be a better person in my circumstances, but also sedates my personality and motivation. I am losing my mind and just wanted some input on shared experiences. Thanks!

3m2sdg,3,2015-09-23,"[Guidance] 23M Midwest, help me with my budget.",Yitbos92,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3m2sdg/guidance_23m_midwest_help_me_with_my_budget/,"Hello r/PersonalFinance,

I was hoping to get some feedback and advice on both my budget and situation. I am a 23 year old male who graduated college about a year and a half ago. I graduated from a large Midwestern state school with a B.A. in Communication (I know, I know). Looking back, this probably was not a wise choice. I have always been extremely business minded and graduated with the hope I could break into an advertising or public relations agency. I did graduate with zero debt, which is the bright spot. The not so bright spot is the fact I only had one relevant internship and they did not have the financial capacity to hire me upon graduation. I maybe had $500 to my name after graduating and was terrified. The market is bad enough for STEM degrees, let alone someone in the humanities. 

I immediately started my job search and began pounding the pavement, hard. I sent probably 200 resumes out over the course of a month. Moving home was not something I was willing to do (my college was two hours away) and I wanted to start making money. So as many fresh college grads do, I took the first decent opportunity given to me.

I was lucky enough to find a job working at the college I graduated from about a month after beginning my job search. Wasn’t in my projected career path at all, but hey, it beats going home and doing nothing. I work in basically low level administration. The pay isn’t great and I can’t say I am passionate about what I am doing. However, I am a state-worker, so I get pretty good benefits. I’ve been there for a year and a half now.

A little about me: I have a roommate to cut costs, I drive a used Toyota which is paid off, 

My budget is below, based off a salary of $31,548

Pre-tax pay: $2629.11
10% into OPERS account: 262.91 
After tax take home pay: $1,759.21 monthly

Rent + Utilities: $550.00
Internet and cable: $30.00
Gas (average): $80.00
Groceries: $180.00

That leaves roughly $919 left in my budget. Lately I’ve been depositing $400 into a general savings account, which now has $7000 in it. The other $500 I spend discretionally throughout the month on coffee, snacks, clothes etc. I should keep better track of that spending and am working on a spreadsheet to better track it. 

Since I only get paid once per month, I have found that Mint isn’t useful for me. Is YNAB any better for employees just getting one check per month?
My main question is: should I invest in a Roth IRA if I can’t hit the maximum? At work it takes 5 years to be fully vested in the funds the employer matches (14%). I currently am 20% vested in their retirement funds which equates to about $843. I have $3700 dollars in that account that I have contributed. I have no real interest in staying here for five years. I would like to leverage the skills I am getting in this job to jump to a higher paying career. I have no room for growth unless I get a master’s degree, which would require me to work for 4 more years making 31k – not sure it’s worth it to me when I may be able to get  a job paying 45k tomorrow. 

To my name I have about $7000 liquid cash in a savings account generating no interest. No debt, I pay off my credit card each month. One Southwest Airlines card I’m using to get free flights to travel.

Would anyone mind recommending a good IRA or how to start funding one? Additionally, any good career advice for someone with a generic B.A. on careers or jobs to increase my income? Specifically, ones with low barrier to entry with pretty good ROI. Or what I can be doing now to strengthen myself for a career in PR or advertising. I realize I am young and low on the totem pole, but living on 31k in a city is pretty tough. I can’t imagine I’ll ever be able to afford a car or house or kids on that salary. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

My home PC was running Ubuntu for over a year until I needed to switch back to Windows for an internship I was doing. 

Recently I've found myself using Windows specific products less and less, and with the recently sketchy practices of Microsoft, I've found myself hearing the call of the penguin once again.

I'm already running elementary OS on my laptop, and I'm probably going to put the same on my desktop. But I'm just wondering if anyone here who has made the complete switch, or still has one foot on either side of the fence might be able to weigh in on my decision."

3m3k4a,14,2015-09-23,[F4M] The Laboratory [Steampunk],akerendova,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3m3k4a/f4m_the_laboratory_steampunk/,"It was the first day of his internship. He had been thrilled the renowned Dr. Kratzen had first interviewed him and now, as he stood in the empty laboratory, that same thrill was almost palpable. He moved around the lab, assured by Helmich, the butler, that the doctor would be down shortly and their work day would begin. He had lifted a small fleam from the counter, running his finger along the sharp edge before a cat jumped onto the counter beside him with a loud mew. 

The metal instrument fell to the floor and bounced under the counter. He swore under his breath at the cat, who began to twirl in a small circle around the medical equipment before plopping down to take a surveying look over the lab. He went down to his knees, searching under the counter with his hand for the tool. Just as his fingers brushed against the metal object, he noticed a soft, deep yellow glow coming from under a sheet in the corner of the room. 

He rose, placing the fleam on the counter before brushing the dust from his trousers. He looked to the corner of the room, seeing only a heavy cloth draped over a large, cylindrical object of some sort. He moved closer, feeling drawn to the object. As he came around the edge of the counter, he realized that the glow was coming from beneath the heavy drop cloth where it had lifted slightly from whatever it was covering. 

He looked around the room quickly, searching for any indication that Dr. Kratzen would be entering before his hand reached out to the heavy cloth, trembling a bit from unknown nerves. A small could of dust rolled from the fabric as he pulled it toward him, displaying a huge glass tub of the lightest pale fluid. He sucked in his breathe in surprise as he realized there was a body in the fluid. 

His mind immediately dismissed the body as a corpse. All doctors practiced on cadavers. There was no better way to learn about the human anatomy than to dissect and actual body. He was a bit surprised that the doctor could afford such a luxury, as cadavers were exceptionally expensive, but it did explain why he tried to preserve it in a solution. 

He took a hesitant step forward as he looked over the body, realizing that there were tubes sewn into the spinal column, almost as if they were growing from the back of the cadaver. Why would the doctor have such things connected to a corpse? He moved around the tub, surveying the pumps, vacuum tubes, and few bulbs that were attached and trying to determine why such a huge expense was spent on preserving a corpse. Sure, they were expensive, but the cost of all this equipment seemed to dwarf the cost of two, even three additional bodies. What was so special about this one? 

When he came around to the other side of the glass, he saw a beautiful, peaceful face of a woman curled in on herself so her spine with the variety of tubes was exposed to the other side of the tank. Could this be the doctor’s dead wife? Daughter? Was he trying to reverse the effects of death? Why would he have a dead woman attached to so much equipment in his laboratory. 

He took a step closer, looking over the woman’s naked, but hidden form through the pale, almost clear, yellow fluid. It was almost like looking at an insect preserved in amber. He was lost in the serene face of the woman, wondering about the details of her life and what had led her here. Her eyes opened and seemed to look through him, into his mind. He let out a cry of surprise as he jumped back from the tank. 

Alive. She was alive. He shook his head. Surely it was a trick of the liquid that held her. No one could be alive with those tubes running out of her back, connected to God knows what, submerged in tank half the size of a normal human. He took another step forward, seeing that her eyes were indeed open, watching him. He felt an undeniable pressure in his mind and he swore he heard her whisper “Help me.” 

Her mouth had not moved, her body had remained perfectly still, yet there was something about her that called to him, that begged for him to free her. Who would keep a woman trapped in a tank, alive and conscious? What had he gotten himself into when he came looking for an internship? 

He stepped back from the tank, reaching for the cloth, ready to cover her back up and flee when the booming voice of his new mentor echoed around the lab. “I see you have met Elizabeth.”

Also they may record Yoglabs together tomorrow if Simon is up for it.
* Lewis said he doesn’t want to pressure Simon in making videos. He is supposed to only come in when he really wants to play something. Lewis thinks that maybe podcasts would be good for that. He asked Simon and said he’d be up for it.
* They were planning on moving offices and had already found a space, however the owner decided against selling it after all. Now they don’t know if they will stay in the current Yogtowers or move.
* Lewis doesn’t care about subscriber numbers on Youtube, as long as the company keeps afloat, everything's okay. He also says he gets uncomfortable with brand deals, even though it helps the company grow a lot.
* They tried to get bigger companies/games, like DotA, on board for the charity livestreams but those big companies are hard to talk to.
* Lewis was really hurt (emotionally) when a kid got injured at the first event they went to (Minecon 2011) and got really careful after that. Since then they worked out a system for conventions. Friends (like Trott's gf and the intern and his gf) now help out at cons. However “just because it’s a family thing doesnt mean we’re not supposed to be professional”.
* Lewis would be interested in making science videos. He thinks he’d be good at making people interested in science.
* He wants to support mental health charities this december because he thinks it's an issue that affects Youtubers and fans alike. He also wants to support an international charity because their audience is global.
* He also talked a lot about how being a Youtuber can be stressful and isolating and how they try to work against that with having an office, where people can have normal hours.
* The Yogscast book is going to be on sale at EGX this weekend and inspired by “weird” books that Lewis liked as a kid. It’s “fun, nothing serious, chill, christmas-y, familar, nothing epic”. ""You could cut out pages and frame on your wall.""  Lewis wrote a few pages about Datlof for fun. He is very pleased with it. Hannah, Kim and Duncan also have their own pages about their series.
* There's a lot of dads in the office now and ""they're all zombies"".
* ""I love what we have here. This very tight-knit group of people that really love each other. ...In a gay way.""

* The whole thing with TB was nowhere near as dramatic as it seemed, it is just viewers loving drama. He would welcome TB on the christmas streams if he wanted to be there. ^thanks ^/u/signet6
* Lewis said he'd like to include more non-Yogs people on the streams this year but is content with the format of the streams in general.
* There will be a new round of Civ. 
* Lewis also said that he would like to play a solo gameplay playthrough of Fallout 4.  ^thanks ^/u/timbjorkman
* He also mentioned how he'll try to get Yogsquest out before or around Christmas. ^thanks ^/u/Scaeduria

Pretty much all Yogscast memebers were in the chat at some point. Sjin even subscribed. Lewis will stream more, maybe tomorrow.  

It was really an enlightening talk and I want to thank Lewis for his honesty and the insight he gave us into the ""mind of the Yogscast."" He talked about many things and I am sure I missed something, feel free to add that in the comments, I guess?

The TL;DR of that is that the two coworkers I worked with who I shared my workload with were both fired yesterday and just before that happened I was told I could no longer listen to music at my desk through headphones because it is unprofessional--even though I had their okay with that when I first started. I used this method to help me focus on my work and get done what I need to get done because my ADHD brain needs something to latch on to so I don't get easily distracted. Good news is after a talking with them today and explaining why it was a big deal they agreed that it was okay for me to listen to music at my desk as long as I only do it through the computer speakers and keep the volume very low. It isn't as good as with headphones, but better than not having it at all.**

*For full story of why I had a panic attack read further:*

There was a major shitstorm of drama yesterday at work that culminated into my WTF moment for this week. I'm not even 100% sure what all happened but I'll include what I do know. 

First I need to explain how things kind of work here: My official title at work is ""administrative assistant intern"", but basically what I am is an assistant to the administrative assistants. The administrative assistants are assistants to the planning department. So, my duties are heavily about doing a lot of things that the assistants just don't have the time to do, in addition to doing any other projects asked of me and to help out the other departments if I have time and they need extra help. Including me, there were three of us ""interns"" sharing all the work we are expected to do, (I'll call the others M and J). This is actually the job I'm doing for my internship class in school, but it is a paid internship so the position is a lot more formal and business like in comparison to other internships other classmates are doing. I work full-time. 

Now, the WTF moment: All three of us ""interns"" are in school. I was the only one who was working full time though. The M and J were each only doing max 35 hours. Now, M just started working on a second degree, this one was in IT networking and apparently it was a lot tougher than she was expecting. She started missing quite a bit of scheduled time once school started because of this. I guess eventually she actually went to the higher ups to ask if it was okay to change her schedule to have less hours. Now, I don't know exactly what happened but I'm sure she was talked to about all the missed work she was doing. Whatever all happened she decided to resign her position. First, apparently she was going to work until October 22nd and then, apparently some time yesterday after she gave this original notice she decided the way she was being treated by the higher ups and went in and said she was only going to be working until October 6th. More drama apparently happened.

Now, M and J are really good friends. M had been working here for over 2 years and J just started in August after the company was desparate to hire another person in this position because it was just me and M and we needed the extra help and since J was looking for a job M told him to apply to see if they would hire him here. And they decided to. So, because of their good friendship, when all this drama was happening with M he up and marched into the higher up's office and said that he was resigning also in support of M. 

So all this shit was happening yesterday and apparently there was a lot of unprofessional things being said on M's part and all this drama and so the higher ups decided to fire both M and J and they were escorted out yesterday about 330-4. 

I wasn't aware of everything that was going down all day before they were both flat out fired--all I knew is I got an email from M at 245 saying she was resigning and how she was sorry to go and she loved it here but she needed to concentrate on school and she was glad for the experiences. And then I went to her with a question about something at about 330 and she told me I had to ask someone else because she no longer worked here as she and J were fired and she was sorry they were leaving me with everything. 

So, needless to say, before I learned what all happened I had a massive panic attack yesterday.

My thought process yesterday was:

Here I was sitting all of a sudden the only one at my level left and realizing that work that had been previously split between three people would now be all on me and panicing because how the hell was I going to get everything done especially since we are getting ready to go into our crazy busy time at work. And then at the same time yesterday I was told I couldn't listen to music through my headphones at my desk anymore because there are outside people that sometimes end up wandering around lost when they are here doing webcasts and it looks unprofessional. And listening to music at my desk was the only way I can really focus on all I need to do because there are often a lot of distractions going around in my area and this is a cubicle setting and my ADHD makes it hard for me to concentrate when there are things like phone calls and other conversations going on around me. So that added to it. 

So, yeah, I was a mess at the end of work yesterday and didn't sleep well and couldn't believe what was all happening and I was confused as to what was even happening in the first place. 

Luckily I had a sit down with my supervisors within an hour of arriving at work today because obviously things are in disarray and they needed to touch base with me and I needed to touch base with them. They assured me that I'm not going to be expected to do everything but that things could be hectic for a while because they need to figure out a plan with all this. They started the process to find at least one person to be hired at the same level as me, though that is a long process in and of itself not only because of the hiring process but also the training process--I mean it took me nearly three months to be fully trained on everything that I do. I was able to discuss frankly and openly with them about all my worries and all that. 

And so, I'm not feeling as panicky as I was--in fact I feel like I will be able to handle what I need to handle, though I imagine it will still be pretty stressful at times because I am also a student. But as an added bonus, while I can't listen to music anymore with headphones, once I explained why it was such a big deal for me that they changed their minds about the headphone deal (when I started I was told it was 100% okay)--that I use it to help me focus and be more productive--they were very understanding. They decided that while I still can't listen to music at my desk with headphones, since I don't ever have to deal with phones like the assistants do, it is acceptable for me to listen to music through the computer speakers as long as I keep the volume very low so it doesn't disrupt anyone else. So, that took that worry away also. 

It was a bad day yesterday and I still can't believe those other two. It was totally unexpected the way they did things and all the drama they stirred up--I mean it was pretty out of character, which I guess is why in the end they were fired nearly immediately because this company has these standards of professionalism and they don't accept the kinds of shit they pulled yesterday.

My question is regarding the cheapest time/method getting to Ecuador and then back to the US. From which country/city would it be in my best interest to return from? and when do you think the best time to catch a flight back would be after September 2016? 

In order of personal preference I would like to do the Inca Trail in Peru, travel to Patagonia for another hike (I'm unsure as to which one yet), visit Santiago/Valparaiso in Chile, and finally see Lake Titicaca in Bolivia. 

I'm completely flexible at this point in terms of what countries I visit and how long I'm there, so I'm curious what others' thoughts are about the best options for this trip.

3m4kpl,3,2015-09-23,"Me [22 M] has been with girl of my dreams[20 F] for a year, but I'm confused over my feelings for my best friend [21M]",1738throwaway23809,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3m4kpl/me_22_m_has_been_with_girl_of_my_dreams20_f_for_a/,"So the easy part of the situation is with my girlfriend. We met last summer. It's our first serious relationship for the both of us. We hit it off. It is currently a long distance relationship. But I am nearing graduation and planning to move closer to where she is going to school. We are both very open about how we want to get married one day. I could elaborate on all of the reasons that have led to that, but that is not really related to the problem.

The problem is my feelings for my best friend. We met at school about a year and a half ago. But before I get into that, let me give some back story. 

In high school, I had a very troubled 4 years emotionally. I had no confidence to talk to girls and do anything with them. Which is fine, not everyone does I guess. But I am also a very sensitive overthinker. I convinced myself that I was gay because I did not have the confidence to ask a girl out. The few times I was forced to take a girl to homecoming, I did not have to confidence to make a move like most normal highschoolers.

Thus, this confused me. I thought this meant I was gay. I told myself that I would just not be the person to get married. I was confused. It was very difficult deep down. I had friends, but none of which were ever close enough to me to share something like that. Especially given the cultural/social views of my hometown.

The dumb part is that there were girls I liked, I just had no confidence. If I had just kissed a girl in high school, I wouldn't be typing this now. 

Fast forward to college. I still have no confidence. Im seeking out guy friends since I basically had no friends at the school I chose to go to. I still battled the same confusion of what exactly is my sexuality if Im more concerned about finding a close guy friend than a girlfriend. 

Anyhow, I cross paths with my best friend playing pickup sports. I interact with him enough to know that he could be that close friend I've always wanted (Im a very perceptive in this situation, its kinda weird). But we didn't really meet or anything. Just kinda interacted on the field and went our separate ways. I would see him occasionally, but constantly obsess over him. I'm not going to try and defend myself there, because I know it sounds gay.

Next semester, I had played enough pickup with him and his friends to kinda work my way into their friend group. Thus, I get to know this guy better and we really click. Very similar childhoods, families, upbringing. We can relate very well to the other. We become very close. Like the tell each other literally anything type of close. 

Emotionally, it was very fulfilling for me. I had pretty much kept everything bottled up the first 20 years of my life. I am close with my parents but didn't approach them on the super deep stuff for fear of being misunderstood.

Then we finally get to the good stuff: girls. He was exactly the friend I needed in that regard. He was experienced/comfortable with girls, but was still a virgin. Very important for me in terms of relatability. He was the perfect mentor. At this point, he was dating someone he claimed he was 100% sure he would marry. I wanted that. 

The problem is that as we became this close and comfortable with each other, I began to fall in love with him as a friend. He was everything I wanted. Good looking, confident, smart. Everything seemed easy for him. I was jealous, but we were so close. He was a great friend.

I am just an okay student, and wasnt confident enough to do what I needed to do to land an internship (I have struggled with confidence across the board). He helped me get a summer job with him, to which I was very grateful. I became even more grateful when I met my current girlfriend there. Everything seemed so storybook. Work with my best friend and meet the girl of my dreams.

Then he broke up with his girlfriend. I was devastated for him. Perhaps it wasnt my place, but I was. But instead of take some time to move on, he hooked up with someone else 3 days later and then was in denial about being a rebound. Thus he proceeded to date this girl for the rest of the summer and the upcoming school year. 

It was devastating for me because it was so clear that this relationship was flawed, yet he was so stubborn. It killed me that after he had been such a good friend to me, he turned to another girl instead of me as a friend. 

My emotional instability caused our friendship to deteriorate as I became a burden to him because of my misunderstood emotions for him. I loved him as a friend, and I wanted him to love me back instead of chase a relationship that was not to be. 

You may be wondering where my girlfriend was during all of this. She goes to a different school half way across the country. So its like I was a part of 2 relationships simultaneously but independent from one another.

That school year we were also roommates so I couldn't clear my head emotionally since we were always in the same apartment.

He got burned out of me being needy, to which I cannot blame him. I tried hard to assume most all responsibility for our broken relationship. I also tried hard to force us being just casual friends. It's made the problem not necessarily worse, just more burdensome for both of us.

Last night I realized I had a problem. He went to go study with a girl who has a crush on him. I couldn't sleep because I knew that as the night went on it would develop into more. I could not go to sleep because I could not stop thinking about my best friend who simply ended a night of studying with a make out session.

I am confused for 2 reasons:
1. (more on this later but) while i know I am not textbook gay, I do question my sexuality. Seeing him with girls triggers some weird jealousy related to that.
2. For so long all I heard was him talking about how great it was to be in a sound long term relationship with a girl. Now I am in that situation, but miserable (NOT because of the girl). And he is casually fulfilling his basic needs while he waits for the next ""one"". He is so content. And Ive put so much effort into this girl, following his lead, and I just wish we could be in a similar place with our current relationship situations. But we arent and Im not handling it well since hes just not the same person he was a year ago when it comes to relationships and girls.

But why should I care? He is content. A little confused cause he's never been intimate with a girl in a ""no strings attached"" setting. But content, and happy that he can just be casual and not force a relationship that ends in heartbreak. I should be happy for him, but I cant.

I waited for him to come back to our apartment and confessed to him all of my confusion, both in terms of sexuality and in terms of whether or not I messed up in following so closely in his footsteps. Previously I had told him that I was just confused in high school. He was appreciative that I told him that and very understanding. I told him that I love him emotionally but have no attraction for him physically.

What is really happening is that I think am bi-curious, but only with him. I have a hard time accepting myself as bisexual because I am not interested in other guys. It's just this super close relationship that I have with my best friend that confuses me regarding what exactly I want.

I feel like it is a lose lose because I either have to bottle up my bi-curious feelings, or explore them. Its a lose lose because my girlfriend will not understand either situation. If I were to explore my bi-curiousness (not an option with said best friend), I am afraid I might like it, which I really dont want for the sake of my relationship with my girlfriend.

The thing I want most is to be happy. My confusion has plagued me for almost 10 years now and I am an extremely sad and bitter person as a result. I wrongly lash out at friends when I bottle things up and cant take it any more. I am tired of subjecting myself to this, as I am also very hard on myself. I cant let this jeopardize my relationship with my girlfriend, short term or long term. And I have way too much going for me to be as down on myself as I am.

In a perfect world, I would be able to find a solution and my best friend and I could get along better. I want to suppress the confusion, get back to our good friend ways, graduate, keep in touch as close friends. The problems to that are:
1. I dont know what the solution is. I want to suppress my emotions for my friend but i just cant seem to do that.
2. While I can already tell that my friend is much more understanding and receptive to talking about this, I dont know if he can move past it either. To be honest its probably quite a turn off to someone who has no doubts about their sexuality. And the thought of us kinda dissolving into the real world after we graduate really bothers me because of just how much he means to me as a friend beyond all the emotions.

In the past I thought I might just be a really stressed out college kid who misappropriates his emotions but recently its gotten so unbearable that I know I need to address it somehow. 

I just dont know how.  
   
TL;DR In a commited long distance relationship with my future fiancee, but also have strong emotional connection for my best friend who is responsible for me even having the girl to begin with. Battle feelings of bi-curiosity just with him and dont know what to do."
3m4l7b,3,2015-09-23,Any leads on IT Internships/Apprenticeships in/around Detroit or Ann Arbor?,mattimeoo,Detroit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/3m4l7b/any_leads_on_it_internshipsapprenticeships/,"/r/DetroitJobs is pretty bleak and seems rather dead. I'd try there but feel as though my time would be better spent here in /r/Detroit where things are a little faster paced and the audience is a little larger! 

Anyways, I am looking for an IT centered internship or apprenticeship in or around Detroit or Ann Arbor. Preferably Detroit since it's where I live, but would be willing to make a commute to Ann Arbor. The ideal position would be focused around software/web development. Front or back end. I don't discriminate as long as it will require me to be in environment where I can be challenged and be forced to learn at a rapid pace.

The internship or apprenticeship can be paid or unpaid. I'd be willing to go at it unpaid to convey my sincerity about the position. I've saved up a good chunk of money to float me financially while I dig my heels in. 

I've been considering a coding boot camp but they're pretty insanely priced and I'd much rather try my hand at landing an internship first as I feel that would be a better fit for me.

Does anyone know of any internships or apprenticeships needing a role filled with an extremely ambitious and capable person? Anyone got any resources to root these opportunities up in our area? I'd even be down to hang around your work space off the record and help as long as I could use you as a reference in the future.

**TL;DR:** Looking for an internship or apprenticeship focused on nearly anything IT. Paid or unpaid. Detroit or Ann Arbor area with Detroit being the preferred of the two. Anyone know of any openings or resources to find what I'm looking for? 

Thanks for reading!!!"
3m4m4b,2,2015-09-23,(x-post from /r/solotravel) Question about travel to and from South America,undecidedadventure,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3m4m4b/xpost_from_rsolotravel_question_about_travel_to/,"I'm heading down to Ecuador from the North West USA (either Seattle or Portland depending on cheapest options) sometime between late January and early February for an internship that will last until August 2016. After completing the internship I will have 1-2 months of free time to backpack around various other parts of the continent.

My question is regarding the cheapest time/method getting to Ecuador and then back to the US. From which country/city would it be in my best interest to return from? and when do you think the best time to catch a flight back would be after September 2016?
In order of personal preference I would like to do the Inca Trail in Peru, travel to Patagonia for another hike (I'm unsure as to which one yet), visit Santiago/Valparaiso in Chile, and finally see Lake Titicaca in Bolivia.

I'm completely flexible at this point in terms of what countries I visit and how long I'm there, so I'm curious what others' thoughts are about the best options for this trip.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions and advice!"
3m51hs,8,2015-09-23,Seeking hints and tips about pediatric ED / hospital work,zzzzyyyyzzzz,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/3m51hs/seeking_hints_and_tips_about_pediatric_ed/,"Hi!

A pediatric hospital extended a job offer to me today, it's working in their trauma center. I'm really excited about it; one of my internships was in an emergency department/ trauma center (all ages) and I thrived in that position.  
That being said, I'm intimidated too. Since graduating I've been in outpatient mental health for several years (LICSW now) and I feel out of practice going back to medical. I'm worried because as an intern I had such a safety net... Now I won't! I just feel like in this kind of job a lot is at stake and I just really want to do well. 

I'm posting to ask for any tips or advice, or maybe just a pep talk. Given my internship experience I feel at least somewhat ready to handle the injuries, tragedy, and adrenaline that occur in this type of work, but I have some questions: 

How will children's work differ? I realize that this presents unique challenges. 

I feel like everyone has their ""gross"" thing. I did fine with the (intense) injuries I saw in the ED, but I'm unsure what to do if/when I see something really, really troubling in this job? 

How can I best educate myself? Frankly my work thus far has mostly been with adults. I feel like there's a gap in my clinical knowledge. 

I'm nervous about making the wrong call: not knowing how to navigate the system here (trained in another state), not knowing discharge procedures, being the only social worker on the floor. I suspect these are common worries, maybe someone with experience can reassure me?

Are there certain hospital norms I should be aware of that I may have missed as a intern?

Thanks for reading."
3m5bcd,6,2015-09-23,Certifications for college internship,dirtyunclechris,netsecstudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/3m5bcd/certifications_for_college_internship/,"College student here. Currently I am a sophomore in a Computer Security BS program with a concentration in digital forensics. 

I'm looking for internships for the Summer of 2016, and while I know that it's early, I've already started to apply and have had some bites (one interview so far). 

While I already have a relativity strong resume, I would really like to be as competitive as possible. I've used the search tool and it seems like the general consensus of this subreddit is to skip over A+ certifications and go right to Security+/Network+.

Now, I could most likely pass the A+ certification with little/no studying, but I'd need to spend a good amount of time going over Security+/Network+. 

As a sophomore, I don't need an internship that is directly involved in my major/concentration (especially since I don't have the experience/courses that juniors competing do), and I'd be fine with any general technology internship (ie, helpdesk, repair tech, etc). 

At last: does /r/netsecstudents believe that I should go for my A+, or Security+/Network+, all three, or none at this point in time (too early?). Thank you!

TL;DR - College sophomore student wants summer internship, not sure about which/any COMPTIA certifications to chase in order to become more competitive. 


**EDIT:** I appreciate all of your feedback and will consider it when making my decision. Luckily I'm still young and can go different routes with my career, so all constructive criticism is greatly appreciated."

3m5fjp,2,2015-09-23,External HDD drives no longer work after upgrade! (x-post from r/techsupport),JWoelle,Windows10TechSupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10TechSupport/comments/3m5fjp/external_hdd_drives_no_longer_work_after_upgrade/,"I was advised to copy my question here

I've been using Mac-formatted external hard drives on my PC for my multimedia work. This is possible because I have a program called HFS+ from Paragon that gives PCs the ability to read and write Mac-formatted drives. The mac-drives worked perfectly fine until I upgraded to Windows 10. Now, even though my PC recognizes them, they do not appear in Windows Explorer. I checked HFS+, and it was functioning normally. I then went into Device Manager and tried updating the drivers and was told that they were up to date. I looked under Universal Serial Bus Controllers and found that ""Microsoft USB 2.0 Host Controller Simulator"" had an exclamation mark next to it. I looked at the device properties to see what's wrong and it said that the device was not working (code 10). I updated it and it said it was up to date. I then clicked troubleshoot and Windows said it couldn't find the problem. I did find under ""events"" that Windows uninstalled that driver and attempted to reinstall it several times before giving up. I searched all over the internet and found a couple people with the same problem, but no responses to their questions. Without any options, I decided to uninstall Microsoft USB 2.0 Host Controller Simulator. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any place to reinstall it (there were a ton of sites where you could download it from, but I don't trust them). I even checked Asus Support (my motherboard's manufacturer) and found nothing. I uninstalled one of the drives (#2) in Device Manager and restarted my computer hoping the proper drivers would reinstall, but this did not happen. Now, my computer won't even recognize it, calling it an ""unknown device.""

Being able to work from these external drives at home is crucial for school and my internship, so this is very urgent. I sincerely appreciate your input!

I'm using a custom PC built by an acquaintance. He used it for gaming, but I bought it from him for video editing and other multimedia work.  The HDDs were lent to me and I am not in a position to reformat them.

System specs: Windows 10 Professional (64-bit) - formerly Windows 7 Professional 
Intel 3930k Processor 
Asus P9x79 Iga 2011 Motherboard 
24 GB RAM 
MSA Nvidia 660ti Graphics Card

The Drives:
1: WD My Passport 2tb for Mac

2: Toshiba Canvio Basics 3.0 1 TB Portable Hard Drive - This is the one I uninstalled in Device Manager.



Thank you!
PS: I feel like upgrading to Windows 10 was a mistake as my PC no longer runs as smoothly as it used to. Would reverting to Windows 7 help, or make things worse?

EDIT: I need to reinstall Microsoft USB 2.0 Host Controller Simulator. How would I do this? I can't find it on either Asus's or Microsoft's websites."

I have an interview (2hr long, software engineering internship) with Riot member(s) coming up next week and was wondering if anyone had any tips. I'm actually really nervous considering that this is only my 4th interview ever. 

Does anyone with prior experience know the style of questions they ask? I'd like to think that I'm very familiar with the game (not necessarily how things are implemented), but I plan on researching that over the weekend.

Oct. 24, so it's not interfering with Stokem and the Bomb.**

**First round of sponsors is also out.  Big thanks to [Longboard365](http://longboard365.com/), [Thuro Skate &amp; Snow](http://thuroshop.com/), [Landyachtz](http://www.landyachtz.com), [Island Surf &amp; Sport](http://www.islandsports.com/), [Absolut Smoke Shop](https://www.facebook.com/absolutsmokeshop), [Gansett Juice](http://narragansettsurfandskate.com/) also known as Narragansett Surf and Skate, The URI LBC, MTI@URI (The charity behind this) and a surprise sponsor [THANE STORE](http://www.thanestore.com/).**  


Ever wish you could win at an event, but never could because you don't do DH, or are too slow, or the pro's are too fast?  Wish no more, because the Poker Run Push Race is now here. 

To give you the rundown, here's the writeup from Nathan, who came up with the idea and is hosting it:
&gt;The URI Mentor Tutor Internship has been connecting college students interested in giving back to their community to at risk public school students who are falling behind in the k-12 system. Whether it be academic, or the kids just need someone to talk to, our program has made a difference in hundreds upon hundreds of students across Rhode Island. Last year through fundraising efforts we were able to raise $1,600 to buy summer reading books for the Asa Messer Elementary school in Providence. These students are some of the cities most impoverished and most of them didn't have a single book at home. This year, I'm aiming to blast last years collection by putting on URI's first every POKER RUN PUSH RACE!!

&gt;What is a poker run, you ask? Well, we want to give everyone the opportunity to win this event. Novices and pros alike have the same chance of snagging some gear and prizes with this type of race. Heats of four racers will push off a start line and race to 5-6 check points where they will grab a playing card from a poker deck. The rider with the best hand wins. It's entirely based on luck, you don't have to worry about the dude who shows up on a 2 inch dropped deck and kegels, or worry about your push game. This event is for the needy kids in Rhode Island who desperately need help getting the resources they need to succeed in school. Entry will be 5-10$ (TBD) and will be held on the campus of URI. We're in the process of securing sponsorships so hold tight! There's some rad shit coming my way that will be up for grabs!

~~Gossip says the potential sponsorship's are pretty radical, and the entire event is for a great cause.~~ Plus, you'll get to skate with me and possibly some of your favorite North East pros.  The event isn't only open to longboarders, we want street skaters and everyone who rides wood with wheels to come to this, and if it goes well possibly make it an annual event.

The URI campus is about 2 hours from Boston, and 3 from NYC with good traffic.  There's plenty, and I mean plenty, of skating here for the race and more.   I'll be keeping you all up to date with info on sponsorships, entry donations, rules and other neat stuff about it in the coming weeks.   I'f you have any questions shoot me a quick PM.  Hope to see you all there.

3m5tl2,3,2015-09-24,Is it normal for me [32M] to feel shitty being left out of a bad group? How do you get over this feeling?,Jetlogs,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3m5tl2/is_it_normal_for_me_32m_to_feel_shitty_being_left/,"quick history:

I have been friends with a few co-workers. We have been close for around 3 years and usually hang out after work over a few beers.

However, the problem started over a year ago when we hired new people became part of our group. Let's call them Rick and Bob. At first, these 2 guys seemed pretty normal, but after some time, their true colors emerged.

Rick is a very charismatic person, and socially outgoing. However, behind the scenes, we found out that he wasn't able to perform his tasks correctly, and I usually had to redo most of his work. He also either doesn't come to work, or comes to work late.

Bob is a different beast. Aside from being unable to perform his duties at work, he tends to hit on all the young women in the workplace (single and married, doesn't matter) to the point of borderline harassment. He event tried hitting on our under-aged intern which became a huge issue

I tried to warn the rest of the group about these two people, however, since the rest of the group has no visibility on their actual performance, they didn't believe me. After that incident, I didn't hang out with the group again.

Cue 3 months later, Rick and Bob were fired from the company for under-performing among other things. However, this left a bad taste for the rest of the group as they believed that I was the cause of why these 2 were fired.

Now recently, I see that the group had a reunion with these two guys, and I still can't help the feeling of being shitty for these guys still hanging out with these types of people.

How do I get over this feeling?

**tl;dr warned friends over bad eggs, but they chose their side. now seeing these friends and still feeling shitty about it**"
3m5ug4,4,2015-09-24,"Me [27M], Her[28F], 4 year relationship. Unsure about career path, want to study Medicine.",jstanotheridiot,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3m5ug4/me_27m_her28f_4_year_relationship_unsure_about/,"**TL;DR**: I am seriously considering studying Medicine, but not sure if I should put my partner through that, or if I'm too old.


Hey guys, I'll try to make this as short as possible. First time reader + poster on this sub. Throwaway because I have friends who know my normal account.


I'm 27, I fucked up my high school education in my final year because I turned into a complete moron (always relied on 'natural'? intelligence instead of hard work), got a shitty job and got sick of it, decided to go to university through adult entry, and am currently in the middle of my Physiotherapy degree at university (Australia). To be honest I didn't even think I'd get into this program because it was highly competitive and I just didn't think I was capable enough, but I got in, am enjoying it very much (apart from some filler subjects..!), am trying very hard, and so far have kept up a very high GPA. 


I very much regret not doing better in High School and getting into Medical School, but you know I can't change my past. However, I can change my future and I'm really interested in doing post graduate Medicine. 


Just to be clear, my motivation for studying Medicine isn't financially based... although Physiotherapists don't earn as much on average, they earn enough to be quite comfortable/there is potential for more in private practice etc. I mean the financial benefits are always there, but I have a lot of interest in the subject matter in general, practising as one... and I feel like I sort of owe it to myself/want to challenge myself/feel like it's something that I should have done and now I may have the opportunity.


I'm also in a 4 year relationship with my wonderful girlfriend who had encouraged me to go back to study, and has been amazingly supportive, and patient in general. I love her very much for everything she has done for me, and how she treats me etc. My parents love her and are pressuring me to marry her, which I want to do anyway.


I currently work a part time job, and have a small scholarship. That combined with my savings covers my rent, uni stuff, food, bills etc. with some left over to take my girlfriend out/buy her something nice on special occasions etc. On the other hand my girlfriend works full time in something not health related, and makes quite a lot, and will continue to make quite a lot if she continues to progress, at the very least she will be on par if not more with the average salary of Medicine until maybe much later on (specialist training). She knows I don't have much money, and has been amazing about it, telling me not to worry about paying for dates, not to worry about buying her things (she can buy whatever she wants really anyway), buys me stuff I want (not need) but can't afford, and has straight up told me that I can just use her money right now if I want anything and just pay her back later. I feel really fucking pathetic in general and especially for even thinking about considering the latter (which I haven't done btw) and I just feel like... a dependent/child. I mean she already has investment properties, whereas I have nothing of value to note.


To be honest I don't even know why she is with me at all, I feel like nothing more than an anchor holding her back in her career and life progress. Some people have told me she's thinking long term but I don't think that makes sense considering that she can just date somebody else already working at a decent job/comparable to hers and in the long run they will probably make more over their career lifespan compared to me, since it's already so late. I mean, she could just as easily date a doctor now instead of waiting x years for me.


So yeah, she has been incredibly supportive on the financial side of things, as well as incredibly patient of me going back to school. Occasionally she does complain/gets upset about not spending enough time together because I'm always studying and even though she gets over it, I feel terrible because I'm always studying and she only gets attention a few hours on the weekend. During exam period I pretty much don't talk to her apart from a few minutes to say good night. She has also gotten upset about this but understands.


Another limitation/issue is holidays, I save as much as I can to go on holidays with her because she loves travelling (have been on a few together now), but obviously I'm on a tight budget whereas she has a lot more disposable income. She doesn't mind paying for me/making up what I can't afford, but I don't like her doing this like I mentioned previously. She also doesn't mind not staying at expensive places/taking budget flights/accommodation either but then I just feel like I'm making her do things she shouldn't have to. I could just choose to not go, but then that would be hurting her too because she wants me to travel with her. I just feel like no matter what I do it's going to suck. For example, for our next holiday coming up I have saved enough for tickets and accommodation for myself, but couldn't really afford some extra things needed before the trip, which she just went to buy for me anyway :|


I think time spent apart and travelling are probably the two biggest issues. 


So now I want to go study Medicine. Well I'm 27, when I finish my current degree I'll be 29. Considering I get in first try, Medical school is 4 years, with a 1 year internship when I graduate. So by the time I start my residency I'll be fucking 34. That's a 5 year delay to when I start making money (as opposed to 2)... I have spoken to my girlfriend about this and she is supportive and says she will wait and has told me that if I want to study Medicine I should... but I can't help but feel like I'm putting her through another 5 years of shit, waiting, being a shitty non contributor to the relationship. I feel like she is just ...waiting... for me to start our future together and will be waiting another 5 years. On top of that Residency is 2-3 years and specialist training several years too. I feel like by the time I'm actually a qualified specialist in my desired area I'll be 40+!!!!!!!!! An old man who has wasted his entire life studying.


And apart from that, even if I was single, I'm not sure if I should forgo 5 years of earning money as a physio to continue studying. I feel like I'm too old to be studying Medicine... I mean there are Residents who are younger than me at the hospital I'm currently on placement at... how embarassing....


I guess I'm asking for advice on whether it's worth it to study Medicine or not, considering my situation with my girlfriend, my age, and my finances.


Well that wasn't very short so I apologise, just typed whatever I thought may be relevant. If you need me to clarify anything just say so! Thanks for your time"

I read a comic last night and I would love to play it out with one or more of you lovely ladies! So here is my idea. 
    
  This will be a CYOA style story, with you playing as who you want to be. (like a ship captain on a scientific exploration, a school girl at her science internship, or a big wig corporate CEO or whoever) I only ask that they fit somewhere in the midst of this plot. So without further ado here is what I was thinking.
     
  You are either on a spaceship or a secret research facility, and someone has uncovered a strange alien artifact. Like a alien skeleton but a strange vibrant gem was pushed into it's skull. As time goes on and everyone is trying to figure what it is. Days to weeks and weeks to months, but soon the annual Halloween Party was in full swing. Although there was that one busy be still hard at work(you) but something was calling you to the gem. When you get close to it and just as you touch it... everything goes white.
      
  When you wake up something has changed. The once booming party, has soon dulled out and is now silent. When you stand up, something has changed, you're taller, tighter, your bust has grown, your lips filled out. The flash of light comes from the door, as a large giant man runs in towards you. ""Are you alright, What's happened?"" He stands taller than you, and massive bear of a man. His muscled body stands before you but the largest part of him has been waving between his legs. ""I was taking a shower after I left the party and now look at me! I'm a giant and it feels like a heavy weight is tied to my hips..."" His eyes pause and look over you. ""You either changed or you're new here..."" 
     
  So here is your plot! Figure out what happened to everyone and can you fix it? Or do you just live on with how things have changed? Each turn might be exciting or terrifying after all it was during a Halloween party.
     
  Kinks for this will be pretty wide. Only big limits are going to scat, gore, futa, extreme violence and anything you might have. But please be okay with monsters,  and other supernatural otherworldly stuff!

3m68nw,4,2015-09-24,Does anyone have experience in the IT side of accounting?,janew0lf,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3m68nw/does_anyone_have_experience_in_the_it_side_of/,"So I've been working in accounting for almost 4 years now. Over the years I have found that I enjoy the job the most when I'm figuring out new ways to organize data.  I love when my boss gives me a bunch of raw data and files that are kind of all over the place and needs me to solve errors and find new ways to better manage info in the future.  I tend to write a good bit of Excel formulas and have recently gotten into learning visual basic and using macros. 

I'm currently thinking about going into the IT side of accounting and think it would be something I could excel at and enjoy.  Does anyone know what getting into this would entail?  I'm taking an Intro to Programming Course at my city college and will probably take an intermediate course next semester, but I'm not sure if I can afford getting my masters at the moment and honestly would rather teach myself and/or learn hands on through a paid internship or something.  Is this possible?"
3m6jrr,80,2015-09-24,You ever wonder how things would be different if something in your past was changed?,Bcadren,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/3m6jrr/you_ever_wonder_how_things_would_be_different_if/,"The current post on GeoHot made me look at his wikipedia page and from that, I saw an immediate connection to something in my own past.

It stated that he was an alumnus of the John's Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. I, remember qualifying with a high enough SAT score to be admitted, but without parents that could afford it. [Public schools select 'gifted and talented youths' to take the SAT test at age 12-13 (8th grade). Passing scores qualify, very high ones can get scholarships. I was ~1280/1600. Probably could have done better if I actually studied, but I was a 12-year-old kid and didn't really get the gravity of it. *shrug*  [If you aren't familiar basically the program is GED immediately (as a pre-teen) and get a Bachelor's as a Teenager; in a short list of core programs they organize specifically for teens (Mathematics, Biology; core STEM stuff).] In a small class size of just the teens kept away from the adult students most the time. [This is how you have (the real world equivalent of) Sheldon Coopers and Doogie Housers who have their doctorates at 21-22; get into that program, get bachelors at 16-17, etc.]

Wonder where I'd be now if I'd either worked enough then to get a scholarship or my parents could afford it. Hah. Probably would have met GeoHot, since we were born less than 2 years apart. You know I've been through crap and haven't really been up to my potential; but I didn't stop being a brilliant kid, just because I've had a bad hand since. I just need to find my way and know I'll get there; I think.

Sorry; this kinda is about my depression issues and regrets; but it's a lot more hopeful tone than the stories I usually tell from that perspective; so I think it fits here.

If you're wondering I got my bachelors in game development (high level programming and 3D art degree, primarily) at 22 and am unemployed at 24, currently. I think I now realize that a lot of why I haven't found anything in field (or at all) is...in High School I was an A student without trying. In college, I was a B student, while spending most my energy on... ""extracurricular activities"" at no point in that did I need the discipline to actual work at something to get what I wanted immediately. Also, for another realism point. I move back with my parents at 22...and never really sent out portfolios and resumes because (judging myself); what I had wasn't good enough for me and I therefore assumed no one else would like it either. Yet, I know people that weren't ""as good as"" me when we were in college are already Internship -&gt; 60K+ annual permanent position by now. So it's stupid to think I can't at least do that.

Sometimes though; I still have that childlike ""meant for greater"" thought. Well, I'm getting it more and more now that I'm getting myself to work on better portfolio stuff. Finally fighting and winning against ~5 years of depression (yes some of those were in college; yes I kinda used ""partying"" as a way to hide my pain like f***ing Charlie Sheen at like 20...so what?)

Sorry. Feel free to answer the original question or respond to the story."
3m6stq,3,2015-09-24,unemployed,aneffortinhappiness,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3m6stq/unemployed/,"I have been unemployed for a very long time now. My last job was as part time volunteer coordinator, but I was only paid for 4 months. I continued working for 6 months after that because I thought it would be good experience, and I didn't have any work experience before that. I left in Jan 2015 because I thought I would look for paid work.

I got that job because I was volunteering with the organization and it was offered to me.

I struggle with so much anxiety and subsequently depression that it makes it very painful for me to even think about  applying. I don't trust myself to be motivated, to have good work ethic or to be diligent. 

The postings talk about ""high volume"" and ""fast paced"", very often. Can I really handle that? What is their definition of those? Will I have the concentration and confidence to handle these things?

I told my therapist that I understand that my horrible resume and work history is something that I will have to overcome, but the thought of it scares the shit out of me. I am so unemployable.

What have I been doing in the interim? I volunteer once a week, I attent Toastmasters, I have an internship type gig, and I am on a committee that meets once a month and works a few hours the rest of the month independently.

I look at some minimum wage jobs and they are all sales or fast food. The thought of working those makes me feel even more depressed, because I know I won't make much and I see myself feeling trapped and apathetic to the work.

I'm also 29 and it is absolutely embarrassing to be in my position."

3m7cr5,5,2015-09-24,What is the best way to leave a very small and intimate law office?,HereComesThePope,LawFirm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/3m7cr5/what_is_the_best_way_to_leave_a_very_small_and/,"Hello /r/lawfirm, I hoping to get some advice, likely from more seasoned attorneys who have some experience in these kinds of matters. I've never had an account until I realized I needed one to submit a post.

I went to a law school far from my hometown (Phildadelphia). After taking the bar, I was applying like a mad man and had multiple interviews with many firms, in both the area of my school and my hometown. I wanted to come back home eventually, and made the decision that if I get a reasonably good offer in my hometown, I would take that over a job around my school that was marginally better. 

As the summer ended it seemed that many of the firms ultimately went with the candidate with more time under his/her belt. So when I received my current job offer for a Philadelphia firm, I jumped on it.

It really is a great learning experience, partly because I'm one of two attorneys. The firm seemed to be much larger at a time, but that was well before my time. We do have a rock solid client base, so I easily bill at least around 40 hours/week, and basically have autonomy on many matters, projects, and even cases. The problem is that when it comes down to it, the clients really prefer my boss (the ""managing partner"") to handle the arbs, deps, mediation, and real in-court matters. Although I've prepped my boss for them and attended them, I cannot really say I have much court experience as a lawyer outside of the case management conferences. (As an intern in college and law school, I was in court at least twice a week doing criminal and family law work). I feel like this is hindering my growth as an attorney.

Fast forward to today, more than a year later. I'm looking to leave, and although nothing's in stone, I am trying to figure out an exit strategy, because one day (hopefully very soon) there will come a time where I will need one. Given the small size of the firm, I'm not confident simply giving two weeks would lend itself to an amicable separation. One thing my boss indicted in an interview over a year ago is that he hates to be left hanging, and wants me to commit. 

Since the school year is underway, I feel like it wouldn't take too much effort to find at least an intern to replace me. I'm not sure how long that process would take, and I want to avoid giving any prospective employer the impression that I can't leave my current job before finding a replacement. I also do not want to bring any question to my prospective start date.

Again, I know my concerns are premature to say the least, but it certainly will be a concern. How would you suggest I handle it beyond giving my two weeks explaining the fact that the move will better my career?"
3m7pu5,3,2015-09-24,"Complicated issue, not sure where to go from here.",_likethewaves_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3m7pu5/complicated_issue_not_sure_where_to_go_from_here/,"So this is gonna require some backstory. My apologies in advance for the wall of text, but I don't know how else to explain my current situation.

I'm 31 years old, female, and a photographer. A few years ago I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia (an autoimmune/widespread chronic pain disorder -- although I have since been told it could possibly be something else and have been working with doctors on figuring that out). I *used* to work as a cook as my day job, and between that and photography I did okay financially. However, working as a cook is a very physical job with long hours, and once my chronic pain worsened a few years ago, I realized I was no longer capable of handling the job and had to leave. Photography I can still do because even if I'm on my feet for a day, I have time after to recover (most of my work is editing anyway). I eventually wound up homeless for several months, then moved in with my mother. I tried applying for disability 3 times (over the span of a couple years [it's a long process], even used an advocacy agency the last time), but was denied each time. I was told that while I was no longer capable of doing the job I had been trained for for so long, that I was capable of seeking other work (sit-down jobs). I conceded and, although I have very little experience in such positions, began looking for secretarial/administrative work, in addition to photography jobs. I spent months sending out resumes and applications in Delaware, to no avail. 

Eventually, I figured I would try my luck at living in a big city with more opportunities for someone like me. It was a huge risk, but I needed to do something or nothing would ever change. So, I sold my car and used the money to move to NYC on August 1st. I've been staying with a friend, her fiance and her 7 year-old, but it hasn't worked out at *all*. I have exhaustively sent out resumes (which I've had analyzed and spruced up as much as possible) and filled out applications day and night since I got here, and have not received any acceptable offers whatsoever. All I've gotten was a freelance gig I couldn't take because it didn't pay anywhere close to enough, one photographer who lied about wanting an unpaid intern, and a bunch of denial e-mails from other places I'd applied. This whole experiment has failed on multiple levels, and I've run out of money to stay any longer, so a friend is coming to get me to take me back to Delaware on October 1st. 

I'll be living with my mother again (as well as my younger, autistic half brother and his father), only this time I won't have a car. I'll be able to share hers with her, and she is retired/doesn't work, so it will be available fairly frequently which is good(ish). 

So my dilemma is this:
Knowing that there really aren't very many jobs available in Delaware (and I've already applied for what I thought I was qualified for -- mostly hotel front desk as that's all I have experience with -- and never heard back), what do I do? Are there other types of sit-down jobs I should be looking into? Will they even hire me with little to no experience (I've only worked seasonally for 2 hotels)? I will of course be calling local photographers to see if anyone is looking for a 2nd shooter as well, but now that wedding season is pretty much over, there likely won't be much, if anything at all. Delaware is not generally known for its availability of art jobs.

TL;DR: I feel pretty screwed at the moment. No car of my own anymore, not enough business available to support myself solely as a photographer (unless I work with/under someone else, which is VERY hard to find), can't physically do the only other job I've actually been trained for (or any other standing/physical job) anymore due to disability, and it seems as though I don't have enough experience to get hired for anything else. I just don't know how anyone in this situation is ever supposed to gain financial independence again. 

Any help/advice would be much appreciated."

3m8oxz,2,2015-09-24,The real story of Frute Brute,epfourteen,80s,https://www.reddit.com/r/80s/comments/3m8oxz/the_real_story_of_frute_brute/,"A little about me. :

I began doing fashion modeling in the early 1970s where I was soon noticed by a marketing intern working for General Mills. They were looking to expand their monster cereal line and asked if I would be interested. 

I flew to Minnesota for a photo shoot and was soon offered a contract for my own brand. In 1974, my cereal FRUTE BRUTE debuted to rave reviews. I was soon leading the company in sales which was good for them except for one thing. It did not sit well with their veteran spokesman Count Chocula. Things had been getting testy for some time so I rarely hung around other then to do the promos and go home. The jealousy being displayed by Chocula was beginning to be a problem and I debated a career change. But the $$ was just too good. For awhile in the late 70s I debated trying my hand in the music industry. I dabbled in songwriting and helped my good buddy Warren write a pretty big hit but went uncredited due to my contract with General Mills.

I began hitting some pretty big parties with the movie star types and soon found myself as a regular at the Playboy Mansion sometime around 1982. Hue hooked me up with one of his bunnies and things couldn't be better. Until 1984 that is. 

This is when it all started to unravel. Hue was having a big Halloween party at the mansion and had been bugging me for months to invite all my monster buddies over. He thought it would be a huge hit with the women. So begrudgingly , I gave Boo and Frankie a call and told them about the party. They seemed very excited but wanted to bring Count. I agreed and sent the invites to their agents. The party started off great. We were drinking , doing a few lines laughing it up and having a good time actually. Even ole Chocula who had brought his "" friend "" The Count from Sesame Street was being decent. That was until my girlfriend disappeared. 

I searched all over the place until I found her in the pool house. Problem was she decided to have herself a little party with Chocula and Mr. Numbers. I erupted and immediately grabbed Chocula by the throat and drug him out by the pool. We began fighting and soon ended up out on the patio. I debated grabbing one of the stakes from the croquet set and ending it all right there. I opted for tossing him into the water. 

Right before he hit the water he changed himself into a bat like he always did when showing off. Problem was he was too messed up to fly and didn't clear the deep end. Frankie had to reach in and save him but the water burns had already taken its toll. His face was nearly unrecognizable. I panicked     I hopped in my corvette and didn't turn back. Didn't even wait for my girl. This would be the last time I saw those guys for almost 20 years.Count had to spend months in treatment and underwent nearly 15 surgeries to get his face right. Needless to say General Mills had enough and I was out. 

I bounced around Hollywood for most of the 80s. I consulted on some B movies; Teen Wolf Too, My Mothers A Werewolf. It was a living but barely. I got a break in 94 when a mutual friend got me in touch with Tarantino. He was looking for some retro themes for his movie Pulp Fiction. The movie blew up and I was able to milk the royalty checks for most of the 90s. With the money coming in I was back on top and up to my old ways again. By the 2000s the pulp fiction money had dried up and I was starving for work. I couldn't catch a break.  

I was nearly broke when I ended up running into Boo at an after party for the Daytime Emmy Awards. He had started a production company who was nominated for some work he had done. We met at a table of a mutual friend we had. One thing lead to another and as I was leaving he brought up the idea of reaching out to General Mills for a reunion. I thought nothing of it until one day in early 2014 I got a call from the executive VP of marketing asking how I would like to come back to the cereal business. My lawyers and agents met with the GM reps and were able to negotiate a 1 year contract and a percentage of the profits from sales. Apparently my checkered past made GM apprehensive about signing a long term contract. Things seemed like they were turning around for me until I showed up for my first photo shoot. 

Who do I see?  Some asshole who goes by Yummy Mummy. See, when I got canned back in the 80s , this nobody weaseled his way into my spot because his uncle was some huge star back in the 30s. The guy literally had zero credentials but stole my job because of who he knew. When I got to the shoot , the execs wanted us to share a box cover. I refused. They kept telling me about how the kids would love it and how we were both huge stars in the 80s. I wasn't hearing it. I did my shoot , walked out and went straight to the bar. GM finally decided the 5 of us would get our own boxes and gave us a limited time release in the fall of 2014. But it was too late for me. The old demons had crept back into my head and soon I was out of work. GM declined the option on my contract and soon I found myself on the streets. 

For the last year I have been roaming the streets of London trying to find work. But it's been tough. The drinking hasn't helped and my age is working against me. I'm hoping for another break to get back to work. "

First, throwaway, although my boyfriend and I both love this subreddit, so.... Hi, boyfriend! I'm trying to be fair and honest (but i'm sure i'm biased so please don't be too angry &lt;3) I left a lot of specifics out in the interest of keeping this to one post.


Second - this turned out long!! I'm trying to not leave out any details but there's a lot involved. Even if no one gets through it, it helped collect my thoughts.


Anyway!


**My boyfriend:** He's an introvert, a bit quiet, serious, and very much more mature than me. He's in his third (of five, engineering major) year of college, but already is planning for retirement and got waaay too excited to open his first investment account. We met in college three years ago and he asked me out. Things were really really good for two years! We both lived on campus and could walk to see each other, and spent way too much time together. I'm a lot more outgoing, impulsive and emotional than he is, so when things are good we compliment each other perfectly. When it's just the two of us, things are wonderful and perfect and we get along better than I've ever felt with anyone else. He's helped me with a lot of my outstanding mental issues and general lifey stuff and I don't want to lose him. If you need a name, let's call him Eric.


**My roommates/friends:** I met them a bit more than a year ago. We just renewed our year-long lease for a second year! (I am, however, not trapped here - if I need to, I can find a replacement and sublet them into my space.)
One of the roommates (24, M) isn't an issue, and everyone likes him (Call him John). If we need a neutral party, he's it. The other two, who I'm going to call Jasmine (28 F) and Belle (26F) are. We're all part of a larger circle of about eight friends  (24-32, mostly male), who are my main friends now. This circle, but especially Jasmine and Belle, are incredibly outgoing, always going out and if they're not out then they're all drinking at our house.


Jasmine is perhaps the most controversial and I'm closest to her. She missed out on a normal high school life and so I feel like she's burning both ends now? She's usually pushing everyone to go out, two, three times a week. She drinks, does hard drugs occasionally, and I have seen her empty her bank account to buy cigarettes. I'm not sure how her finances work because she's a student, but she has a network of people (mostly older men) who support her when things go bad. Without them, I'm sure she would have wrecked her life a bunch of times. She doesn't plan for the future at all. She doesn't even have her driver's licence.


But she's also very supportive of her friends. We have A LOT in common. She's helped me grow as a person and encouraged me to come out of my shell, as it were. (I'm still recovering from being depressed for most of my life and am slowly blooming into a real extrovert). When boyfriend and I were fighting, she helped smooth things back together with us. I also really don't want to lose her, especially since I'm not the best at making friends.


**The situation:** My boyfriend hates my roommates/friends, is scared of me becoming more like them, and is losing respect for me because of my association with them. They're actually pretty fond of him, until recently - I feel like there's no going back after recent events.


A year ago, I graduated and took a job, and got a house about an hour from campus. We saw each other a lot less, and it was pretty rough, but we pulled through. This summer I convinced him to apply for an internship with my company. He got it, and I offered to have him come live with me in my room. He paid rent worth about half my room, but instead of going all to me we split his rent four ways among the roommates because I felt like we'd be occupying shared spaces and I didn't want anyone resenting his presence.


Until he moved in, boyfriend didn't really know my roommates personally. He mostly heard about them secondhand, such as when I was bitching about them or boggling over Jasmine's finances... which probably wasn't the best first impression. Still, he was happy to see me with friends after my college friends scattered. There were some issues where he and I make plans in advance, and then Jasmine would come up with some awesome new thing last minute. I'd usually want to go, so I'd either try to convince boyfriend (which usually was bad) or bail on him (but even bringing something else up when we had a plan was enough to upset him?) Looking back, I was taking him for granted and I feel bad about my own behavior here, both for bailing and being a gossip, which started his dislike of them. Still, he thought he could deal when he moved in.


About the house: it's a four bed, two bath, but one bathroom is tied to the master so it's only used by one person (they pay extra rent for this privilige). It's perfectly sized for four people, but it rarely only has four. This last month has been especially trying, as we had seven people more days than not (Me, boyfriend, John, Belle, Jasmine, Jasmine's boyfriend, and another friend who recenly lost his job, so he's crashing on the couch till the end of the month, but he's cool and liked by everyone involved.) This is all on top of all of the other people who come to visit and hang.


So this summer's been stressful, and we've had a lot of fights.


For example, Jasmine smokes. I'll keep her company outside and share a cigarette sometimes. I started smoking occasionally, but quit at boyfriend's behest. Boyfriend sees me outside with her and we fight about me sharing a smoke. We fight about Jasmine, and eventually I promise not to smoke with her. Repeat for secondhand smoke - I shouldn't hang with her while smoking. Repeat with the hookah she brought out (which was more ""we already had this fight, you agreed to not smoke, how could you lie to me"" than anything else).


Over the course of all these fights, it's revealed that for the past year, he's been worried about my friends. He disapproves of their irresponsibility, their lifestyles, and is worried I'm going to become like them. He says he has been loosing respect for me as long as I've let them into my life, and barely respects me anymore. This came to a head where, on a trip to Vegas, he had to take me to the ER for alcohol poisioning.


The couple of weeks after we were fighting constantly, arguing and then resolving it and arguing and resolving it sometimes two or three times a day. These usually took the format of, boyfriend is unhappy with something I did - he gets upset - i get upset he's upset - we fight - he convinces me it's my fault (and it usually is, since I'm also pretty irresponsible and we had a lot of bad blood from the summer to work tthrough) - I apologize and say it's something I'll work on.


At this point, I've resolved to stop lying, stop smoking, stop hanging with them while they smoke, never cancel plans with him to go do things with them, not turn into Jasmine... But the root cause is really, he doesn't like my friends or me spending time with them. And all the things he hates,  are really hard to disagree with. I'm not even really sure why I like them any more? But I do, they're really accepting and fun to be around.


So the most recent thing started about a week ago. We have a week left together before he moves back to school. (for reference, this is a week ago - his school started today, Thursday.) This last week, we do some really fun special dates, but i'm also going a little crazy cuz we've had extra people in the house (and my computer is in the living room since I gave boyfriend my desk. So I really don't have any space that's really ""mine""). All through this, Jasmine and him dislike each other but are really civil, with the occasional fight because she woke him up having really loud 3am sex.


Last night, he spends the night - it's his last night with me.  People are over with my roommates, (as usual) and being loud. It gets to be midnight, we've been in bed trying to sleep for an hour, and he can't sleep. I go out to ask them to quiet down, and they do for a bit. But it's loud even when they're quiet, and they go back to being loud. He gets up, says he's going to sleep at school tonight (he's mostly moved in and it's an hour drive). While he's leavine, Jasmine asks him if everything's okay, and he insults her and leaves.


**the questions**


Short term: boyfriend says he doesn't think he can spend the night at my place anymore. Jasmine says she's been plenty accomidating, and seeing as it's not enough and he's no longer paying rent, doesn't want to restrain herself and her friends when he's over. Is there any way to resolve this so he can come over in the future and everyone wakes up still happy?


Long term: Boyfriend hasn't given me an ultimatum or asked me to choose between him and them, but i feel like each day i keep being friends with Jasmine he loses a little more respect for me. I know if I keep her in my life, it'll be more fights. But I like her as a person, even if she has her flaws. I don't want to have to move, and I don't want to lose my entire circle of friends. But I don't want to lose boyfriend, either. I feel like everyone's fighting over me, and I don't want to have to pick. Is there any advice?


tl;dr: my boyfriend hates my close friend/roommate and the rest of my circle of friends. He doesn't think he can spend any more nights over at my place, and I can't see both of these relationships lasting in their current state."
3mapfd,15,2015-09-25,21 F4M - Why do I let you make me do these things?,Jess_dpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3mapfd/21_f4m_why_do_i_let_you_make_me_do_these_things/,"Maybe I’m an intern who works at your company. Or your secretary. But all I know is that we’ve  taken things far beyond what should be professional behavior. There’s something about you that is so powerful, desirable, and intoxicating. I tremble thinking about you. And you know that you have that control over me and you exploit it. Sometimes I go home and just crumple inward in shame at what I’ve done for you but there’s a piece of me that loves it and wants it...wants more.

Do you remember the business trip we took? I dressed up so nicely for you before we went to dinner our first night there. I waited for you in the lobby and I followed your instructions that I shouldn’t wear panties. When you arrived you took my hand and walked me into a hallway and kissed me so strongly and deeply. Your tongue teased mine and I was shocked and shamed when your strong, rough hand slipped between my legs and you ran your fingers against me down there, your fingers rubbing circles in just the right way.

Your other hand tightened around my hair and you tilted my head back so your lips could brush along my neck. My whole body trembled and I felt my pussy betray me, leaking my juices against your beckoning fingers and you took that as an invitation to slip two fingers into my sensitive little slit. I couldn’t control myself and I gasped, squirming against your hand as your thumb rubbed my clit and your fingers plunged in and out of my pussy.

I wanted to die. People walked past...anyone could have seen what you were doing. The things you whispered in my ear made me blush, made my legs quake and weaken. I felt so dirty, so wrong. You let go of my hair and captured my lips with yours, kissing me deeply and passionately and you traced the plunging neckline of my dress until you reached my cleavage.  You ever so boldly slipped your fingers under my dress and you grasped my breast. That rough, strong hand squeezing it as you drove your other fingers deeper into my pussy. You pinched my nipple and made me writhe against you.

Do you remember the other things you made me do that night? Do you remember how you made me feel? Maybe you continued to finger me at dinner, not caring who watched as I came in the restaurant. Did you show me off to your coworkers? Or maybe they were a potential client and you used me to help seal the deal.

Do you remember the filthy names you called me when you took me that night? Do you remember what a fierce, uncontrolled animal you were? Were you the only one I fucked that night or were there more? How much cum did I take? Where did I take it?

Why do I do these things?

Even now I’m rubbing myself. I’m wet. I want it. I’m so horny and I want you again. I want to please you. I want to do the naughty, filthy things you want me to do for you. I’m spreading my legs open. My hands are down there, parting my folds, opening myself up. I’m ready. I want it."
3mcgiq,1,2015-09-25,I (21F) told my boyfriend (22M) about my irrational jealousy toward his female friend and now I feel like that was a terrible idea.,Dontwantobejealousno,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3mcgiq/i_21f_told_my_boyfriend_22m_about_my_irrational/,"Backstory - My ex left me for another woman he became good friends with about a year and a half into our relationship. We had had a very hectic and bad relationship as it was, and he started to spend alot of time with this other girl. Soon he was blowing off our plans to hang out with her, confessed to having a crush on her, and ultimately left me to date her. They dated about half a year.

Currently - I'm in a wonderful relationship with ""Mike"" (fake name) for a year and a half. Recently he started grad school and an internship in a hospital and his only colleague at the internship is a girl. I can't explain why I immediately got a weird feeling. This girl doesn't seem to be being flirty and he isn't either. They're literally just friends, but do text a fair amount about work and school related things (he's told me). I, irrationally, feel really jealous of the fact that this girl gets to see different raw sides of him through being in this high stress internship, and on top of that, she gets to see him more during the week than i do, although we do spend alot of nights together.

I guess the other part that's worrisome, besides their physical proximity and what happened with my ex, is uncertainty about me and Mike's future. We were going to get an apartment together this year, but due to financial issues on both of our parts, ultimately couldn't. Now that he's in school, his money is allocated there, so living together is most likely years away now. I work fulltime and his hours this year are going to be devoted to studying and interning. I'm worried about him being stressed from school and the multitude of other pressures he faces, and turning to her for advice instead of me, since she's in the same situation.

For about a week or two, everytime he's brought her up, I've gotten a bit snippy or secluded. I didn't want to cause a rift between us or treat him that way because he isn't doing anything wrong at all. Last night, I decided to tell my boyfriend my feelings, and the conversation went like this.

Me: ""I'm jealous of Kelly. I know it's stupid because it's irrational. It's not that I don't trust you. It's that I had a similar situation happen with my ex."" (Note - I didn't elaborate as he already knew the story about my ex and I.)

He was quiet for a bit and then asked ""Why are you jealous? I would never date Kelly, just so you know.""

I answered something like ""It's complicated, and to give you the full reason why, I'd have to essentially name what I feel her advantages are over me, and I don't feel comfortable doing that.""

Him: ""Okay. I think that you're insecure and a bit traumatized about what happened before. I haven't done anything to indicate that I like anyone but you, and our friendship is platonic.""

Me: ""I know that, and that's why this feels stupid. Because I know this jealousy is ultimately unfounded. I trust you and know you wouldn't do anything. And what I'm actually jealous of is that she gets to spend alot of time with you, and is in situations with you where you're both dealing with stress at the internship, so it's almost like she's seeing a very raw side of you that I don't see.""

Him: ""Okay. But I'll have lots of female coworkers in the future.""

Me: ""I guess it's because this is the first girl friend you've really made since we started dating. Which is fine, I have plenty of guy friends, but it's the amount of time and the environment you're in that makes it feel different to me.""

Him: ""Okay. Kelly is the first person I've met in awhile who's mature enough to realize that guys and girls can be friends without romantic feelings. I respect that maturity.""

Me: ""Yeah, and I'd never tell you you can't be her friend or anything like that.""

Him: ""Good, because I wouldn't listen, just as you're allowed to have your friends, I can have mine."" [[NOTE: In the past, he was okay with me having a close guy friend who was actually someone he personally didn't like, and never once told me that I had to end the friendship. He expressed that he was uncomfortable, but respected my autonomy and my decisions.]]

Me: ""I probably shouldn't have told you. I feel so stupid.""

Him: ""Hey, I had a feeling you felt this way and I'm glad that you were honest with me about it. Just so you know, I barely see her. We only see each other at lunch; at the actual internship, we work on different teams. Why do you say what you're feeling is stupid?""

Me: ""Because again I know I have nothing to be jealous of. I know logically that you would never do anything, so I'm frustrated at myself for feeling jealous, but still, I do feel jealous.""

Him: ""You should reflect and ask yourself why. I love you and only want you.""

The conversation itself went pretty well, all things considered, but now I'm actually more paranoid, like maybe I shouldn't have told him. I'm afraid that now he'll think that I'm insecure and needy. I didn't really elaborate on why I was jealous besides that he spends time with her. Something I didn't mention to him in that conversation but which he knows is that I don't feel like I'm attractive, so he probably knows that I think she's prettier than I am. I'm worried that pointing out all the advantages she has over me is going to make him more likely to consider her as a potential partner. Conversely I'm worried I came off as totally irrational and controlling. I want him to feel comfortable talking to me, and the reason I brought it up in the first place was because I was starting to act rudely standoffish when he'd bring this girl up, and that's not fair to him. I want him to have friends including this girl, and I don't want to antagonize him. I don't want him to feel that he can't talk to me about this girl, but at the same time I'm afraid that bringing my feelings out into the open like I did is more likely to make him not share things with me about her, like if they get closer. Idk. I know he loves me now, and that I can't control the future, but I'm horrified that I just created a self-fulfilling prophecy and that by telling him, I pushed him further away, despite what he said to the contrary. I also worry that now that he knows this is going to be a process for me to get over, he's going to be very exasperated and stressed.

tl;dr - Relationship with my ex ended when he left me for another woman. Current boyfriend has become friends with a girl, and I felt jealous and was slightly rude about it. Told him about my jealousy, that I'm not trying to antagonize him and that I will work through it. He reassured me everything is fine and he's glad I told him, but now I'm worried that telling him was the wrong idea for two reasons. What if he finds me controlling and this makes him hesitant to disclose more in the future? What if, contrarily, he starts thinking about what a good potential partner this girl could be, because of what I pointed out? And what if, now that he realizes that this insecurity will take me a bit to get over, he decides it's just not worth it? Should I not have told him?"

I'm focusing on trying to find a mid sized local, regional or national firm so I've applied at some that sounded good. 

First I had an interview with a company that I thought was going well (even though the interviewer made 3 mistakes regarding my resume) until 15 minutes into the interview she casual drops that I would be expected to move 250 miles away from the major hub I'm in to a different city. Is that normal? I mean we had been emailing back and forth so my expectation would have been that she might have included in one of those emails ""Hey I'd like to interview you for an opening in X city, would you be interested?""

Then today I had an interview with a firm that wanted to talk to me about an internship opportunity (sure, I don't mind) and started immediately talking about how interns are expected to network 8 times a month and bring in new business clients and oh I should be prepared to buy out a partner in about 10-15 years because they have partners wanting to be bought out. 

Is this normal or am I just having bad luck? Would interns normally be expected to recruit clients? Are partners wanting out normally mentioned in the initial interview? My grades are good, I have audit internship experience. I mean I was specifically trying to avoid places that focus their sales pitch on your 'exit opportunities' but I'm not sure I'll ever be ready to be a partner. Right now I'm looking for a place to finish up getting my experience for my license and getting a wide variety of exposure. I'd be ok with a company mentioning that they're looking for someone to work for them for the next decade or so but asking for a financial investment? I have another interview with a recruiter next week. Hopefully that goes better.

I’M SO LUCKY! I was opening a door when I remembered the strange advice I had gotten from the great purple masked god. 

“OPEN THE DOOR, GET ON THE FLOOR AND EVERYBODY WALK THE DINOSAUR!”

 I heard a loud thud and I saw that I had kicked the legs out from under a guard (like there are any of those near doors in a FREAKING MILITARY BASE) in my intense disco session. He started getting up to my horror when I heard a relieving [removed:8bit] xtra pixely pixelated robotic pixel voice say:

“ERROR: Fulton malfunction.”

The iconic Fulton balloon burst out of his backpack as he struggled and kicked to get free but it was too late. His time was up and he shot up into a cloud of migrating Fulton Goats. He was never seen again and to this day his fulton still broken and are sore. The lesson kids is:

I am enlightened. This is the most moving, life changing, predictably cliched horror movie ever. They strapped me down to a skeleton chair and it started with an endless loop of Comcast lounge footage but everybody had blood red eyes which were plagiarized from smile.dog. Then Rebecca Black’s car burst threw spraying hyper distorted music everywhere. She was as always riding unsafely on the back of the car with Justin Bieber and a few of Taylor’s gagged and bound boyfriends. Then the Skin Taker came to grind Rebecca’s skin but a strange old man yelled “You can’t just kill her, she’s a beast version of the VEVO mascot.” The Skin Taker ignored him until he saw Rebecca Black in her full glory and yelled “OMG SHE’S SO UGLY I’M NOT WEARING THAT AHHHHHHH.” Then everybody started screaming and a clapboard saying “Candle Cove.avi - ep 13: Goodbye Candle Cove (the screamer-ing)” was raised and roll credits. The weird thing is that it stated that “Purgatory” was the location and “9/11” was the date but Candle Cove was pre-9/11. The final frame that I caught in a 24th of a second was scary foreign text. This made me go Ultra Patriot, break out of the skeleton chair before it could pop out at me and fly threw the base on a nuclear powered bald eagle murdering everyone. I will never watch “Duck and Cover” again or eat my killer vegetables.

MLP CANADA DRY RAGING OPTIC ELITE THE KILLER.EXE BLUUD PINKAMENA

Post 13 - 13:37 69/0/666 DA ENDING ORCHESTRA OF SPOOPYNESS LATER

pinkamena. The only creepypasta character I could never ship because it was so girly and it had cooties. I used to have nightmares that pinkamena would drag me to an optic death cult where I would become a noob. It was time to settle this, it was time to write some shitty meta fanfiction.

We both pulled out our rifles and began loading them with bullets (ones that kill people). I chose an AWP Intervention 420 custom build while Pinkamena was using a shitty autosniper with a n00btube attached. With a tip of our fedoras, we turned around and fired like cowboys. The bullets collided sending a shockwave out so powerful that it killed Kenny and created an earthquake that sucked the space needle into development hell (where this Trollpasta has been). The space needle struck the bottom and deepest layer with a loud teke teke sound. Pinkamena ran at super sonic.exe flying speeds behind some cover so I surveyed the area with high accuracy. The scan showed that we were in nickelodeon studios and that Pinkamena was posing as an intern in the pre-TV airing lost episode nazi extermination test. I couldn't tell which one so I just killed them all. Besides, interns are basically slave laborers. Pinkamena was hit and started to break apart into blind pony spirits. At first, there were 1 or 2 (ooo), then there were 3 or 4 (ooOO), then the IRL HUD was full of them (OOOO!). Suddenly, all the ghosts turned into a liquid shout that poured over me. The intensity [intensifies] of the shout caused me to collapse to the ground when I noticed that the screams were forming a beat. I instinctively yelled “Song Name?” causing The Protomen to appear playing Darude - Sandstorm. Powered by the l33t b33ts m8, the space needle shot into the sky taking us with it. 

We resumed fighting once Pinkamena reformed like Majin Buu. The Optic Elite threw a bloody gory torture-y knife at me, it did nothing because it sounded like it had no reason except it completely ripped my waist off. So I just ran on my elbows at high speeds. I was just about to stuff some fish and chips down the throat of Pinkamena when the noob stuck a satanic iPod in my hands which I started to dissolve my hands using gauntlets of depravity but before it could do its thing, I threw it away because apple products are overpriced turds #PCMR. Before we could attack each other any longer, the needle hit some turbulence causing me to be thrown into a xbox peasantry system with GTA San Andreas in it, most likely haunted. It seemed to be connected to the space needle’s engine and we were flying at the white house. I used the ultimate multipurpose solution of throwing the console off the space needle like a raging animal to avert a national crisis. This caused the space needle to go completely out of control and crash into Jeff the Killer's house. 

The death count was unbelievable, Jeff, Jane, Charlie, Neko, that stupid detective from Sonic.exe/Round 2 that was currently investigating a strange looking ant as a possible lead, a few smile dogs, Luigi in a banana costume, a few haunted floppies, etc. There was so much death that all the BLOOD and BLOOD on the BLOOD caused me to get BLOODerflies in my stomach. Pinkamena was in tears, ""LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE, ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DeAd YoU mOnStEr!"" Before I could react some Jeff the Killer OC went full edgy goth emo and said ""We're all going to die..."" right before offing himself off on the spot using a recorder/flute/whistle. This caused Pinkamena's psyche to break and unlocked the hidden cheat code at life that allowed her to summon her ultimate attack. ""Time for a TENSE SWAP!"" She yelled as she began charging an epic kamehameha. I couldn't let this happen, too much was at stake (like my ego) so I began a powerful speech. ""No puppet man, that's illegal. You are just feeding the lord Michael Jackson, you cannot escape the 9GAG legion."" Then she fired her ultimate attack and such words became nothingness as the universe was consumed by a grammatical error of massive proportions. ""See you in 666 Pentahell Satan Lair of Debauchery."" Then Pinkamena began hacking and flew upwards only to get the crap beaten out of her/him by an British English teacher riding a tardis.

*Then the curse broke and the universe went back to normal. They all lived happily ever after and life is such in Mother Russia.*"

My ex, every University I applied to and now every internship in the field I love...
Everything I love has rejected me.

I don't know how to get back up from this.

I've been seeing my psychiatrist every week but I really don't know where to go from here. I've gotten jobs here and there working things that are fun but not in my career which I love and would do anything to go far in it but every option has fallen through and I can't see any happiness in sight.

Does it actually get better?
I've been waiting for years for my life to turn around and I've tried the whole positive thinking and being optimistic but every time it seems to there is a catch...

I'm only in my 20s but at this point I feel like this is all life is going to be because it's all life has been.

Is it possible to make it out of this?"
3me3rb,4,2015-09-25,Looking for input on a letter to my father...,independenceplease,helicopterparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/helicopterparents/comments/3me3rb/looking_for_input_on_a_letter_to_my_father/,"Background: Only child. Studious upbringing. I went to college 1,100 miles away to learn to adult. My phone doesn't work out here, so I rarely call my folks. More adulting opportunities, or so I thought. My dad wants me to succeed in school, so he pays my way. Its his #1 priority. Its gotten a little over the top. In the past he's even threatened to cut me off for asking to get a job. When I slip up, he calls and emails me about the thing until I do it. Its driving me crazy.
 
So I moved away, and I still feel trapped. I really don't want it to escalate to the point of being cut off, but its affecting me more than I like to admit. I wrote this long email and was wondering if any of you sympathetic helicoptered children would read and let me know what you think, because I've never stood up to him like this before. 


Dad,
I’m sorry if I disappoint you. I’m not trying to make you mad, I’m just trying to feel like an adult. I had to make changes to my internship paper that I only found out about in August, and then spent until now getting it done while balancing other school things and ending my relationship with Logan. I’m fine, it just wasn’t working out for either of us. My advisor was fine with me taking my time on the paper, other students with internships were also working on theirs at the same time. I turned it in today, so hopefully he’ll be satisfied with the material and the whole thing will be over with. 
I understand why you worry, because you care and pay for my education, but I don’t feel like I can be honest about how it makes me feel. I’d get an earful every day until I got the paper written, and I don’t like feeling like that. I don’t feel like you hear it when I tell you everything is OK and not worth worrying about, because when you worry more it makes things worse because I wonder why you worry. I want to worry on my own. I want you to have your own life and not be so caught up about mine, because I’m not just your daughter, I’m a woman. 

You see, I feel that by age 21 I can reserve the right to make boundaries. Whether or not I am financially independent, I’m still 18+. The next time something goes wrong with my house, if I mention it please do not call my landlords. After telling you everything was under control with the fleas as many times as I did, I felt betrayed when you called them. I mean one of my roommates was working with them for 4 weeks before that, and their parents were not involved. If I’m not able to deal with fleas and school at the same time I wouldn’t be mentally able to be in school period. I know you just wanted to help, and I get that, but if I don’t learn to deal with issues on my own now I never will. 

When you tell me to do things like I’m 12 it just makes me mad, and like you don’t respect me or feel confident in my ability to do things. When you said “my job to worry, your job to do” the other day, that made me feel terrible. Because I’m an adult and I have been for 3 years (or 9 if you go by the bat mitzvah), it's my job to worry about me. If I fail, I’ll pay the consequences. If I can’t do 18 or 21 hours I’ll drop a course, no problem. I just need the space to make those choices. Our college experiences are different, totally different. This is the last year of my life I can pick from a list of topics and take a class, and I after 3 years I’m ready to decide what I can handle.

If it doesn’t work out I learn a lesson. For example the next time I go backpacking I’ll bring dehydration pills, in case I get sick again. Problem solved! Getting sick was terrible, but I got through all by myself and learned a lesson. You see? When you feel like you have to help at every step I can’t help but feel childish, and that’s really not what I’m going for at this point. I want to feel prepared for graduation and real life, and that can only come from my confidence in myself. I am grateful that you pay my way, but the next time my card gets below $100 please let it be. I’m trying to teach myself to budget. I’m the only person I know at school without a job, and I’m trying very hard to feel overall independent. It’s not something I’m mad at you about, I’m just trying to grow up. I will find a way to call you if you want to talk about it more, but please know I’m trying here.

I’M SO LUCKY! I was opening a door when I remembered the strange advice I had gotten from the great purple masked god. 

“OPEN THE DOOR, GET ON THE FLOOR AND EVERYBODY WALK THE DINOSAUR!”

 I heard a loud thud and I saw that I had kicked the legs out from under a guard (like there are any of those near doors in a FREAKING MILITARY BASE) in my intense disco session. He started getting up to my horror when I heard a relieving [removed:8bit] xtra pixely pixelated robotic pixel voice say:

“ERROR: Fulton malfunction.”

The iconic Fulton balloon burst out of his backpack as he struggled and kicked to get free but it was too late. His time was up and he shot up into a cloud of migrating Fulton Goats. He was never seen again and to this day his fulton still broken and are sore. The lesson kids is:

fulton is love, fulton is life

Hello derpy trolls of the internet. I need your help unlocking my stupidity. See everyday at exactly 4:20 OH KLOK the guards go full-out MML and write MarioXXXXXXXXXTREMESonic fanfics such as “Sonic.exe/Round 3”, “MAriO” and “It Will Git Even Worse”. My parody side keeps seeping through at points like we when staged Jeff Teh Kira VS Son Is Exe and I came out in a Hyper-British Brit costume.

SHIT. Turns out memes count as parody and not MML. Now all the guards are trying to zombify me with their high-as-fuck gory furry fan fiction. I just threw up my mexican food lunch, I think I’m going to pass out. OH GOD NO! There all weegees now, staring into my very soul. This must be how they found me. This must be how the planes came from the outside if 9/11 was an inside job. It all makes sense! LUIGI HAS HELPED THEM ALL ALONG!!!

#Post ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ﾉ[10] by Jontron - OO/OO/oo/oo *a ton of references later*
I am enlightened. This is the most moving, life changing, predictably cliched horror movie ever. They strapped me down to a skeleton chair and it started with an endless loop of Comcast lounge footage but everybody had blood red eyes which were plagiarized from smile.dog. Then Rebecca Black’s car burst threw spraying hyper distorted music everywhere. She was as always riding unsafely on the back of the car with Justin Bieber and a few of Taylor’s gagged and bound boyfriends. Then the Skin Taker came to grind Rebecca’s skin but a strange old man yelled “You can’t just kill her, she’s a beast version of the VEVO mascot.” The Skin Taker ignored him until he saw Rebecca Black in her full glory and yelled “OMG SHE’S SO UGLY I’M NOT WEARING THAT AHHHHHHH.” Then everybody started screaming and a clapboard saying “Candle Cove.avi - ep 13: Goodbye Candle Cove (the screamer-ing)” was raised and roll credits. The weird thing is that it stated that “Purgatory” was the location and “9/11” was the date but Candle Cove was pre-9/11. The final frame that I caught in a 24th of a second was scary foreign text. This made me go Ultra Patriot, break out of the skeleton chair before it could pop out at me and fly threw the base on a nuclear powered bald eagle murdering everyone. I will never watch “Duck and Cover” again or eat my killer vegetables.

I will be participating in a case competition with another big 4 firm this semester and if I am eligible, they may consider me for an internship position (winter or summer). So i was thinking I want to make some extra money during the winter before starting FT, is it possible to intern for another big 4 if they know I will be starting FT at deloitte eventually? I also would like to intern in either advisory or tax to see how different it is from audit. 

How should I approach the situation? Would it be easier to not mention my previous big 4 internship with deloitte that led to my FT offer or will they find out through a background check? or is it not suggested to do that between different big 4 firms?

For entering big 4, I heard that I should have internship to get an offer from big 4. What I think right now is that I do masters program for a year after I graduate my college, and while I do masters program, I try to get summer internship offers after I graduate the masters program.

I've had a lot of fun with several of these prompts in the past, but there are a few newer ones I'd love to try out as well. I'm game for pretty much anything as long as it doesn't go into my ""dislikes,"" which can be found at the bottom of the page. I'm around most of the night and would love to play any of these out!

1) It's your standard party scene. You pick the venue (night club, pool party, strip club, etc.), but regardless of the location, it's hopping, with booze flowing and scantily-clad women (and maybe men, too) running around looking absolutely perfect. Whether you're a partygoer, a bartender, a stripper/hooker, or any other role you can imagine, you're out tonight for one reason: To get fucked hard.

2) You're an intern at the office I work in. We don't deal with each other much, other than idle chit-chat. However, in my side job editing video for some shady clients, I notice a familiar face working a stripper pole and giving lap dances. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to confront you with the evidence.

3) I've married an older woman and have entered into an open relationship. My new wife has a daughter younger than me, and you're her best friend. We've been thinking of you as a bad influence, but lately, my eyes have been more drawn to a body that's absolutely built for sex. You and my step-daughter come home late one night, and my wife isn't around.

4) I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. Every time I go, you're there, strutting your stuff in an ill-fitting sports bra and short shorts that barely constrain your juicy ass. You turn heads and you know it, and one day I work up the courage to introduce myself.

5) Anything else you can think of that doesn't fit my dislikes!

My kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, bimbos/bimbofication, dirty talk (the raunchier the better), oral sex (giving and receiving), group sex, multiple orgasms/cumplay, bad girls (partying/drinking/smoking all encouraged).

My no-go's: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, heavy BDSM, incest, noncon.

Hope to hear from you!"

So first off, let me say that I'm very lucky to be where I am as it is. 
I'm have a salary of ~135k at a medium sized tech company in San Francisco.

I started this job (although it's not my first job, even if you exclude internships) out of college about a year ago, and since then I've easily proven my worth, and have gotten two raises and a promotion by the time I was 6 months in. 

That being said, the person who led the team I was on left a bit after my promotion, and since then I'd taken all the work he was doing and more. I end up in a lot of meetings with people getting paid well above me for architecture and design discussions. I've been hosting talks and training. Two people have joined my team since, who also get paid well above what I do, yet I still lead the team technically, and I've basically been on-boarding them for the past two months.

I've gotten nothing but great feedback from everyone I've worked with. There's been a trend of people leaving the company recently, and people have voiced that they cannot lose me.

I'm very happy to have what I have, but I also know for a fact that they would not refuse a significant raise, should I ask for one.

What would you do in my situation?"

She acts like I am a failure because it's been 4 months of searching, but I feel confident that I will soon find a job that is a good fit for me. I don't want to apply to jobs that I know I won't enjoy. I have a degree in clinical social work and I want to work with the aging population or at a non-profit. I DO NOT want to be a counselor at all but she wants me to apply for counseling positions anyway just to ""get my foot in the door.""  
  
In the past few weeks, she has gone from nagging about being lazy to actually ignoring me. She told me that I should have never even gone to college if I was going to waste my life as a waitress. She calls me lazy and tells me that I ""have no motivation or passion anymore."" My mom is a manager at her work place and she told me she won't hire someone who has taken too long of a break after college because it shows they aren't motivated, but how the hell are people supposed to support themselves while they look for a job in their field?! Things are not the same as they were when she was my age. Jobs are hard to find for so many of us. I just wish she would understand this. It hasn't been that long since I got out of school.  
  
Anyway, she hasn't talked to me in weeks and she won't answer my texts. It hurts to be treated like a failure when I don't see myself as one. Getting an advanced degree was a big life accomplishment for me. I guess I will never meet up to her expectations. Maybe she's right and I should look for jobs even if they don't fall under my interests. I don't even know anymore.    
  
It feels good to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading."

what I mean by this question is that given the world has people of various standard, ranging from those who are well-versed only in the basic stuffs they were trained in(D grader) to those who can do it all and conquer every problem type(A or Distinction grader), why do the boss expect that everyone who are hired are the can do it all type(or at least know everything the school teaches you) when this is totally unrealistic expectation, given that majority of people are not that kind of person(else the conditions that only people who have A or Distinction grades can graduate would be said already)??"

I come here for advice and opinion on my situation.
I am a computer science student in Switzerland, I have always lived in Switzerland. Last week a company approached us for possible internships in Saint Petersburg (company : https://www.jetbrains.com/).

The project is appealing, the people seem nice and the salary seems right.

My problem is the following : while being fluent in English and french (native language) I do not speak any word of Russian (and would not have the time to learn because it would be in February and I have exams and stuff in between).

In general the question would be : how possible and nice is it for a foreigner who does not speak English to adapt and live in Saint Petersburg. Are the people usually ""foreigner-friendly"" ? Will I have the chance to entertain myself (movies, meet people etc...) in English ? How many people speak English in Saint Petersburg ?

Also : will I be able to understand basic things (like signs on the road, names of streets, is this a store ?) ?

P.S. : Everything work related and moving related should be sorted out with the help of the company."

[](/IND) Indianapolis Colts (0-2) @ Tennessee Titans (1-1) [](/TEN)|
:-
After two weeks on the road, the Tennessee Titans finally open the doors of newly renamed Nissan Stadium to the people of Nashville for a home game against the division rival Colts. Fans from across the Nashville metro-area will flock to the stadium for the first matchup between Marcus Mariota and Andrew Luck in what is likely to be a rivalry to span the next decade. While looking nearly flawless in week 1, Mariota was pummeled last week in a loss to Cleveland where his line gave him no respite and pressure arrived fast and often.He looks to rebound against a Colts team that has yet to find a win, dropping games to the upstart Bills in week one and a solid Jets team last week on Monday Night Football. A gut-punch from Mariota could leave the AFC Championship Finalists reeling.|

The Titans and Colts Rivalry|
|:-|
This week’s game will mark the 42nd all-time contest between the Titans and Colts. The Colts lead the series 27-14.|
The Colts currently own a seven-game winning streak over the Titans, including sweeps in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The last time the Titans won was Oct. 30, 2011. The seven-game losing streak is the Titans’ longest current winless skid against any NFL team.|
In the first meeting of 2014, played on Sept. 28 at Lucas Oil Field, the Colts overpowered the Titans by a final score of 41-17. Andrew Luck passed for 393 yards and four touchdowns, while the Colts defense forced three turnovers.|
The last time the teams met at Nissan Stadium was the 2014 season finale, when Luck and Matt Hasselbeck combined to pass for 315 yards and three touchdowns in a 27-10 Colts victory.|
The Titans and Colts have met only once in the postseason, a 19-16 Titans victory in a Divisional Playoff game in the RCA Dome on Jan. 16, 1999. Eddie George rushed for 162 yards, including a 68-yard touchdown run to help lead Tennessee during its run to Super Bowl XXXIV.|
The teams first clashed in 1970 following the AFL-NFL merger. The then-Baltimore Colts defeated the then-Houston Oilers 24-20 during the Colts’ run to a Super Bowl V Championship.|

3mh0nh,41,2015-09-26,Step 1 Survey Analysis Complete! Link Inside,hamm3rhand,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/3mh0nh/step_1_survey_analysis_complete_link_inside/,"Hello everyone, thanks for waiting so long for me to get this worked out. I'm sorry it took me so long to get this sorted, but with Step 2, my acting internship, ERAS stuff, and my computer dying I had quite a time getting to work on it! But here it is finally! 

I thought this year's results were very interesting. I thought about trying to add in some of the data from last year or maybe do some other analysis points but I thought that once I had finally been able to accomplish the ones that I originally planned on doing then I should not delay it any more. 

I will be making on for Step 2 as well, and it should go much faster. I will hopefully have that up tomorrow if not later today, but I'm not sure what all resources I need to include on that (idk what other people used) so I have to look up to see what is out there. 

In the meantime, Enjoy! Please let me know if there is any issues with viewing the file. (PS: I have no idea why it decided to not put the gridlines on some of the tables but it did on others.)

3mhyc5,1,2015-09-26,"Post &amp; Core, post-root canal",greasypete9,dentaltechnicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/dentaltechnicians/comments/3mhyc5/post_core_postroot_canal/,"I'll give as much detail as possible because I don't know what's important and what's not... I recently had to have a root canal on one of my upper eye teeth due to an abscess. My dentist told me that me getting this particular abscess was about a 1 in 10,000 chance because there was no cavity, no ""trauma,"" and I have decent oral health (i.e., brush twice daily, floss 6-7 times a week). This particular tooth is dead and has been dead for many years, but I've never had any issues with it before Labor Day weekend, when I started having tooth pain. I went into the dentist the Tuesday after Labor Day and got a root canal with a temporary filling. I then took amoxicillin to remove the infection and went back to the dentist on the 24th. He completed the root canal (I guess with a more permanent filling) and the next x-ray he took showed that there is still some infection in the gums, so I am now on clindamycin.

Now, the problem is money. I'm a 24 year old college student, paying my way through college almost exclusively by myself while working and this root canal set me back a bit financially. My dentist had me set up another appointment for a ""post and core"" for October and I was wondering how important this appointment is. Can it be delayed until January, when I'll be starting a higher paying internship and I'll have some extra money? Or is it more important for me to get it done now and just really stretch my dollars over the next few months? I know I should probably talk to my dentist personally about this, since he knows the situation completely, but I thought I'd try asking this here to see if I could at least get an idea of whether or not delaying the appointment is a good idea. Thanks!"
3mi1lo,0,2015-09-26,I Graduated College But I'm Still A Loser,ruinedmylife93,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3mi1lo/i_graduated_college_but_im_still_a_loser/,"Getting a Bachelor's degree from an expensive private school has given me expectations that I cannot fill. After many failed interviews for jobs in my field, most of which I ended up doing free work for them, I accepted the only job offer I got. A job offer that pays less than my peers got even as interns. I can't afford to move out of my boyfriend's parent's house but winter is coming and when it does I won't be able to get to work from where I live now. My coworker says ""get a roommate if you can't afford the rent around here"". I have a DEGREE I shouldn't have to deal with roommates anymore; I did that the last four years and shouldn't have to do it anymore. I'm preparing to live in poverty. If I can't pay the bills, food is going to be the first thing to go. I'm going to have to ask my dad to pay my bills, PLUS the car insurance, PLUS the student loan payments. I really don't want to ask him to pay my bills just to break even. Whether he can afford to or not, I really don't want to ask him as he shouldn't have to do this for me. I should be paid a living wage. I feel disrespected and degraded, almost dehumanized. I was given a wage lower from what was discussed in the interview, realized my real wage a week into the job. I bust my ass at this job, but the wage is non-negotiable because I can be easily replaced. I took a job that doesn't require a degree because it was the only job I could get. Nowadays you need a degree to get a job that doesn't require one.

I go on Facebook and see how much better my peers are doing than I. My friends have committed boyfriends that actually want to live with them and get married someday. Most of the students I graduated with found jobs in their field either during college or within two months after graduation. They're probably wondering what I'm doing with my life. I'm too embarrassed to talk to them.

I have a boyfriend, and we have been going out for about eight months. I live with him and his parents, but he wants to move out and go live with his best friend so he can save money on rent. Meanwhile he knows I will not survive on my wages alone. He always talks about moving in with his friend, but when it came to me moving in with him and his parents, he said ""you can crash here for a little while"". We were looking at a couch on sale one weekend and I said ""we just got a new couch this week though"" and he responds ""No, *I* got a new couch"". The word choice tells me what he wants out of this relationship, or lack thereof. People tell me ""Oh you don't find your soulmate in high school, that's what college is for!"" Well, I've graduated, still no soulmate. Now what? I love my boyfriend, but it seems we don't want the same things. He wants to be ""forever 18"" and party with his friends every weekend. The thing is, I already let him do what he wants, because I do not have perfect habits either. He seems to be searching for more freedom, but what other kind of freedom could he possibly be looking for?

He says ""when do I get to see you if you go live near your job?"" but he keeps talking about moving in with his friend.
He had to take a job that is located 1 hour drive from my job. I don't blame him for that because he needed to pick the highest paying job, and I had to pick the only job I can get. He makes more money than me and he doesn't have a degree. Why don't we just find a place in-between our jobs so we only have to drive 30 minutes each way for our jobs? He works 70 hours a week; there's no time for us to drive out to each other. I won't be able to afford gas, so it would have to be him coming to me. Does he realize I won't be able to live on my own? I'll have to find a stranger to share a shitty one bedroom with. He seems worried about saving his money, says he can split the rent with his friend. Maybe you should split the rent with ME, because I NEED you to? In each of my relationships, men make their own options and it's up to me to decide if I want to either deal with the man's decisions or leave. I am not saying all men are like this, but every man I had an official relationship with. Every guy I dated has kept one or more boyfriend behaviors completely out of the equation, whether it be love, sex, or commitment. There's a hole in every one of my relationships. They are all different guys, but I am the same girl. Something must be wrong with me. My friend tells me to move somewhere else and start over. How is that going to stop me from being the problem? I can move anywhere in the USA and people will treat me the same. I'm going to be the same sad person who always meant well but never quite made it in life, no matter where I decide to put myself. I can't tell myself to stop being sad, and to magically be prettier and more fun. This is who I am. You know how hard it is for an awkward woman with bad skin to meet someone they actually click with? You meet a lot of jerks, get hurt a lot, get stood up, get told they're suddenly not looking for a relationship. I'm not giving up on my boyfriend.

The whole point of college was for me to be able to afford to take care of myself, PLUS some extra money to do things I want. I'm sick of feeling regret whenever I buy something, like I'll go buy a two dollar box of tea then feel guilty for it. There are things in my life that I am grateful for, but not compared to my peers. I feel like I'm working towards nothing in life and that there is nothing in this world for me. I want to be with my boyfriend. I have been in so many terrible relationships and this one makes me feel the most loved. I need to have a talk with my boyfriend, and see what we can do. If we don't reach a compromise, I might just quit my job, go back home and live with my parents, and wait for a miracle. Thank you for reading.

TLDR: I graduated college but don't measure up to my peers, and I'm spiraling into deep depression.

He stood in front of our class of 400 and challenged all of us to push ourselves beyond what we thought possible.

What did I decide to do? The same shit I was doing; which was nothing. I made sure to never, ever, ever push myself out of my comfort zone.

**This was one of the greatest mistakes I have ever made.**

Essentially, I wasted four years of my life taking the safe route. It skewed my thinking. Instead of telling myself “I can” I found every reason to justify why I can’t. This is no way to live.

It wasn’t until recently that I learned the priceless value of escaping the familiar, in the most unlikely of places; my public speaking course.

I volunteered to do the first impromptu speech of the year. Sauntering up to the container of topics, at random I chose “what would you do to change the word?” Mother of pearl... Why couldn’t it be something easy like “do you believe in god” or “what is your favorite color and why?” But, I had to do what I could with the hand I was dealt. Old Teddy Roosevelt did say, “do what you can, with what you have, where you are.” OK Teddy, I thought, I can do this.

With unending grace (kidding) I waddled into the hallway to prepare my speech. What was I going to talk about? I don’t even know how I plan to change the world, let alone how to give a proper speech. Should I talk about my aspirations? No… that’s too cliché… Maybe about great historical figures that influenced people over millennia? No… too pastiche…

I decided to talk about my values and how having a moral compass will not only lead you to being a happier individual, a more well rounded person, and leave you with a friendlier disposition, but also how it can influence the world around you too. I wanted to discuss how good people captivate their peers by galvanizing and motivating them to transcend traditional and selfish ideas. How sometimes you should rise to the occasion and be the person the world needs you to be, rather than the person you want to be (e.g. sedentary tuber; i.e. couch potato; those were the days).

I was called back into the classroom and mounted the podium. Ready to deliver my tear jerking, groundbreaking, St. Crispin’s Day-quality, speech I had concocted in five minutes time, I looked at my audience, addressed them and began.

Something caught my eye though.

One girl was swiveling around in her chair feeding her side of the room with a bag of chex-mix like they were a herd of hungry cattle. The crumpling of the bag filled the air as another female on the other side of the room dropped her head to the desk. People began clicking their pens, scribbling on their paper, and the audience’s voices crescendoed to an intolerable level.

Having struggled with silent block (a type of stutter where the language is completely halted; one of the reasons why I was taking public speaking) my words flopped around like a dead fish and became cluttered with verbal fillers such as “um” and “uh”. Eventually, I fell silent and couldn’t speak. I lost my train of thought, I had no idea what to talk about or what I had said, I didn’t even remember what my prompt was. I looked pleadingly at the teacher, who then yawned. I do believe I looked like an absolute fool at this moment, but then, the entire class burst out into laughter.

I was mortified. “What did I do that was so funny? I was just trying to give my speech… I’m going to fail this assignment… I am a failure,” these thoughts raced through my mind.

Then, the professor interjected, “this was all intentional,” she smiled. My jaw literally dropped. She went on to say how she was conveying the importance of audience in a speech, and she did a damn good job.

But there was something else; something that hit me like a brick wall. That was how I didn’t dare conceive of the possibility that I would have to take charge of my audience, how I didn’t feel comfortable asking them to quiet down, how I didn’t even make an effort to push myself to finish my speech despite the challenges presented to me.

**This was my realization.**

At this moment, I knew she had opened my mind to something bigger; the idea that if you do not escape the usual, you will forever be doomed to fail.

The reason I was OK with calling myself a failure is, in fact, because I was one. What had I done to escape the circular repetitiveness of my life? Nothing. What had I done to extrapolate on my natural talents and interests? Nothing. What had I done to make difference in the world? Nothing. In the past, I was absolutely OK with doing nothing, but no more.

I decided it was time to take the first step. So what did I do? I made a plan. I started to dedicate more and more time to my novel. I started to blog on Medium rather than just admire the work of others. I started to email other writers to diversify my perspective and learn more about my peers. I started to apply for internships and freelancing jobs I normally would have brushed aside. I decided to make the transition to vegan. I decided to change.

Today, I think back on my time as a freshman with great regret, but also, incredible gratitude. Perhaps if I hadn’t been so unmotivated in the past, I wouldn’t be doing the things I’m doing today. Sometimes our greatest failures become our greatest strengths.

Get out of your comfort zone. Not tomorrow, not next week, today. Learn from my mistakes. Make a change for the better, even if it scares you.

The most frightening changes are often the greatest ones we ever make.

We started dating right before going off to different colleges three hours away from each other.  I love him and our relationship so much, he is my absolute best friend.  It has always been hard being long distance even though we get to see each other almost every weekend, but we have managed pretty well until now.  The hardest thing is not being able to just relax with him after a hard day and not being able to be under the same roof with him yet doing our own things.

I graduate in April and plan on getting a teaching job in his area and moving in with him.  We talk about our future all the time and are on the same page.  

I have been able to cope with the long distance so far by finding happiness in my day to day life and looking forward to the future with him.

My problem is that lately, I am finding it so hard to be happy.  My everyday life without him is just getting so stressful and I feel so alone all the time.  I live with my dad who is gone a lot on business and the only friends I really have are the ones that I go to school with.  We are all so busy with school work and internships that I literally have no time for anything after school/internship except sleep.  

I used to be so happy all the time and now I find that the only time I can really be happy is when I come to visit him for the weekend.  My stress and unhappiness during the week is seeping into my happiness when I am with him and even though he is not doing anything to make me upset, I always feel sad in anticipation of when I will miss him during the week.

What do I do?  We have really great communication and I am usually always able to talk to him about how I am feeling but with this I just feel so lost and can't even find words to express to him how I feel.

   
**tl;dr**: Weekdays are getting so stressful when he is not around that I am not able to enjoy the little time I do get to spend with him.  I feel so lost. "
3miziw,1,2015-09-26,"I'm scared of school and my future, but I don't have anyone to tell anymore.",throwawaygrads,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3miziw/im_scared_of_school_and_my_future_but_i_dont_have/,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I'm not really sure how to preface this. I guess I'll start with the fact that I am a senior in college right now, and I am preparing to go to graduate school. Well, kind of.


Graduate school is daunting, but due to the circumstances surrounding my education, graduate school is the path I have to take. There's really not another option. At least it doesn't feel like it. I don't feel qualified, I don't feel ready, and most of all, I don't feel like I can compete with everyone else. It's scary. I can logically admit that I am an okay student at best. 3.6 GPA on a 4.0 scale, one internship, but nothing else. Applying for a STEM-based PhD seems near-impossible compared to the stuff that I read about all the other applicants. Plus I'm not even going into a field I am graduating with my undergraduate degree in, meaning everyone else who applies to the programs I will will have a background that I am lacking.


It isn't just graduate school either. I'm scared of my future. When I was in high school in the process of applying to college, I could barely function because of anxiety. I put on the ultimate facade around my friends, pretending like I was going to be okay, but in reality I was scared shitless. I didn't eat proper meals for days at a time because there was too much stress and anxiety, and I felt overwhelmed. Now the stakes are even higher. Applications cost a lot more. There are more standardized tests to take that I've paid out of pocket for. There's so much riding on this process because if I don't make it, there is no Plan B. There isn't something I can fall back on. It's make or break. And it's always been like that for me; I've never been not scared of my future because I honestly can't imagine myself in 5-10 years. I can't imagine being successful and happy with the decisions I've made. I can only imagine myself being dead.

People always tell me that I will succeed and things will work out, but due to the wonderful construct that is overthinking, I can't force myself to believe that anymore. School is stressful; I spend 40+ hours working weekly on various assignments, and it's only been a month. It feels like I haven't slept even remotely okay in ages. The pressure is crashing down on me and it feels like I can't take a break; there's no reprieve because I have to push myself to succeed and in order to succeed I can't weaken for even a second.

What hurts more than all of this, though, is that I can't tell anyone. I can't tell anyone because despite all the friends I've treasured, my one best friend, the one I fell in love with, disappeared from my life, and she was the only one I trusted with all my secrets.

I guess that's the second part of my story; I lost the chance to be with the love of my life, and I hate myself every second for it. 

She was amazing; I met her during the freshman year of high school, while she was one year younger than me. We clicked instantly. We talked daily, for hours on end, and before I knew it, I was head over heels in love. But during high school, I was socially inept; I had friends, but communicating feelings and being intimate were things I had literally 0 experience. I was too scared of failure and rejection to push my emotions and tell her straight up. We flirted so much and looking back, I should've pulled the trigger there because whether or not we were going to be successful, I wanted to at least see if we could've been something. 

Roll around to college. Due to varying circumstances involving other parties, we didn't speak to each other almost the entirety of my freshman year of college. She was still in high school, so I didn't see her at all, which, in retrospect, was good for the sake of not talking to each other. But despite not talking to her and trying to find other people to be interested in, I always fell back to her. Eventually, we started talking again, and although we had a lot of issues talking because of other people trying to hold us back from each other, we got back to what seemed like normal. It was refreshing. I had my best friend back, someone I could talk to daily about everything and anything, who would comfort me when I fell, and who I would comfort when she felt down. 

Eventually, this refreshed friendship really pushed the boundaries of what we could call friendship. After one alcohol-involved night and many days of flirting and a few dates, we ended up making out in front of my house (This was my first kiss as well; in retrospect this was probably both really good in the sense that I finally got to kiss the love of my life, but really bad because you'll find out later.) This really grayed up our friendship, because she was just coming out of an emotionally manipulative relationship that haunted her for a year after she left the relationship, and wasn't ready for another relationship. Eventually we agreed that we had to stop where we were because pushing the boundaries further was something that would involve both parties' consent and she just wasn't ready.

And now we're coming close to the present. After talking to her as if everything was okay, she disappeared in the middle of summer, no messages, nothing. I was out of state so I couldn't see her, but one day out of the blue, she just ignored me and it went on like that for about a month. I messaged her once, but not wanting to bother her/look clingy, I gave her her space. Eventually she returned and everything seemed normal, but I still wasn't sure what happened and I didn't want to push her in case it was something bad. 

And now we're in the present. It's been almost a month since the last time I got to talk to her, and the same situation occurred. She disappeared without a trace and I'm left wondering if I did anything wrong. In reality, I think it's for the better because I'm so swamped with work and prepping for grad school that I barely talk to anyone now. But it still hurts, losing 7-8 years of the best friend I've ever had, and the only person I've ever felt really in love with. And that's a lot of time; more than 33% of my life.

tl;dr: Stressed about pressure from grad school and need to succeed, no one to talk to because best friend I fell in love with disappeared and hasn't spoken to me recently.

3mizvu,1,2015-09-26,I'm looking to volunteer any where in the world for free.,sendmetobrazil,volunteer,https://www.reddit.com/r/volunteer/comments/3mizvu/im_looking_to_volunteer_any_where_in_the_world/,"I graduated a little over a year ago with a degree focusing on International Relations and Ethnic conflict with straight A's ( with the exception of a C in Math and B in French). I know some broken French, but otherwise have struggled to learn any additional languages.  I haven't been able to find a full-time job at all, let alone a job related to what I studied, which I truly am passionate about. I've been living pay-check to pay-check and am working two part-time jobs, and haven't been able to really volunteer on my off time.I had also worked throughout college and could not afford to do internships because I was working multiple jobs. I'd really like to go abroad and volunteer to gain some experience to put on my resume. I also am extremely interested in the world and would love to travel, but I'm not able to afford to save up for even the cheapest of programs. I'd also love to learn a language, and have heard from countless people that the best way to do so is to live in a foreign country. If anyone knows of any opportunities, then please let me know. I'm pretty open to most countries with the exception of Iraq ( the Kurdistan region I'd go to), Syria, or Afghanistan. I tried raising money to go abroad to Brazil, but had only been able to raise about 400,but am truly open to going ALMOST anywhere at this point. "
3mj1xm,10,2015-09-26,[rant/vent] My mother is slandering me to the whole family,papiepie,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3mj1xm/rantvent_my_mother_is_slandering_me_to_the_whole/,"I might be posting this in the wrong place, and if I am, I apologize. I don't think my mum is strictly a narcissist, and my experiences are definitely not as bad as most of yours. 

But I relate to a lot of the things that are discussed here, and I need to get this off my chest and hopefully get some advice. 

My mother is ruining me. I'm 24, I've moved out years ago and I live my own life. My sister is a pretty classic GC who can do no wrong in my mums eyes, even though she's constantly borrowing (read demanding) money from our parents and doesn't appreciate them at all. 

But it doesn't seem to matter how well I do, it's never good enough. Lately things have spun out of control though. I've been having a rough few months, I postponed my final project and uni until this christmas (was supposed to finish in the summer) which was very difficult for me to do as an overachiever. 

Then the other day I was fired from my job. It wasn't a very big thing, it was just an unfortunate incident based on a misunderstanding. I wish it hadn't happened but it's not the end of the world. 

However, my mom took this as some sort of ammunition and has been blowing up ever since. She told me that it's my fault for getting fired and that it's because I've always been so difficult and arrogant and impossible to talk to (I'm really very diplomatic, classic middle-child). She says all sorts of terrible things and that I'm obviously involved in some terrible things because why else would I not have finished my degree on time. And when I get upset at her reaction she tells me that I'm being mean to her and that I'm blaming her for me getting fired. Which doesn't make any sense, I just said that I wanted her to be a bit more supportive. She then went on to say that she constantly felt scared when she was talking to me because I always get upset at her, and that she's only saying those things because I need to hear them. 



The worst part is that ever since, she's been telling the whole family terrible things about me. She's calling everyone and telling them that I'm having a life-crisis, that I am being mean to her and that she's worried about me. She's even said that I'm ruining the family with my drama and that I'm taking money from her (which couldn't be further from the truth. I am very careful not to accept money from my parents because I'm scared she'd use it against me). 


I just, I don't know where to turn. My whole family now thinks that I'm having a crisis or that I'm involved in drugs or something. My dad is coming over tomorrow to have an ""intervention"" where he wants me to come clean and tell him what's really going on.


I'm at the end of my rope. This hasn't been the best period of time for me, but it really isn't so bad. I obviously wish I had finished my project on time, but setting it back a few months will not affect my future at all. I'm doing an internship now and I'll find another job in no time. But I'm just getting so tired of having to justify myself to everyone, and being treated like a mental case. 

Has anyone had a similar situation? Again, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post. I know my mum probably isn't a narcissist, she's just... difficult. But I don't know where else to turn. I feel so alone.

3mj3lq,0,2015-09-26,How much should I borrow for grad school?,Dijett,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3mj3lq/how_much_should_i_borrow_for_grad_school/,"So I am going to graduate in March 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I attend Cal Poly Pomona, in Southern California and live locally. My parents have always stressed how important it is to try and stay debt free and so far I have managed to get through school by using some money from my grandparents that they saved for me as well as internship money I earned during the summer. The cost of school has been relatively low because I go to a CSU and I am local. However I have found the quality of the education to be so abysmally bad, I have regretted for years going to the school I chose vs applying to better more expensive schools like UCLA, UCI, or even USC. I attend a lot of events at USC and I sit in on some classes every now and then and honestly, the kids at that school get such a better education! Well anyway, I am thinking about going to grad school and so far I have no debt. I would love to attend USC to get my M.S. in Computer Science, but I do not have nearly enough left to pay for it. If I don't get any fellowships (which I am going to apply for) or scholarships, is it a good idea to borrow the money for tuition? It would be roughly 43k per year which I know is a lot of money. How long would it take me to pay that back assuming I get a job after school making 100k+? Is it worth it to borrow that much money? I am also going to apply to some UC's which would be much cheaper, but I have dreamed of attending USC and would be so happy to get the chance to attend. "

#My Spanish journey before now

I’ll keep this bit brief because I’ve told *casi cada hombre y su perro* this story over the past 3 weeks. Back in my final year of university 6 years ago, party in thanks to a Spanish girlfriend, I took a few semesters of beginner Spanish. Did quite well, but at the same time as I finished university, we broke up, so Spanish got chucked in the bin. Early last year I downloaded Duolingo and used that and [Coffee Break Spanish](http://www.radiolingua.com) to get to a decent level. Add in some [*intercambios*](http://www.conversationexchange.com) and ~30 weeks of Spanish lessons every Monday night, I was at a fairly good level. Up to the week before I came to Spain, I’d just finished the A2 course through [a school in London](http://spanishhouselondon.com) and was on episode 30-something of Coffee Break Spanish season 3. I would’ve put myself at a B1 level at this point.

#The school

Initially, I’d booked a course with a school called [Babylon Idiomas](http://www.babylonidiomas.com). You’ll notice that link doesn’t work and that’s because they decided to up and go bankrupt without letting any students know. I’m not sure if there’s a specific word for people who do that in many other languages, but in English they’re called “cunts”. However, after a frantic google search, a phone call to my credit card company (thanks Section 75 protection) and an afternoon with a nervously puckered bumhole, I had a course booked through AIP Languages. Phew.

The school itself is reasonably central, close to the metro stop Benimaclet and near the universities. Clean, modern (save for the WiFi not working in all of the classrooms) with very helpful staff, I made a good choice. On the negative side, quite a few people I know chose to do internships afterwards and they didn’t seem to like them very much. Partly how they were organised, partly the companies, partly the nature of the work itself. I don’t know exactly what the issues were, but I can’t in good faith recommend the internships through AIP.

The school organised some good events - the highlight for me was the day trip to Peñíscola - but there was Tapas, boat trips, language exchanges and, of course, big nights out on the Friday. They usually post the weekly list on their Facebook page.

#The course

Like I said, coming to the school, I’d have placed myself around the B1 level. The pre-joining online test and introductory Spanish chat on the first day put me in the B1+ class. (Edit: forgot to add, after the first week I was bumped up to B2) Total class size: 3 in the first week (B1+), 6 in the second (B2) and 5 in the third (B2). Excellent. Two of us had also chosen the “intensivo” option, which meant an extra 1 hour a day **however** in the T&amp;amp;C’s it said that if there were less than 3 people in the class, the extra classes would only happen Tuesdays and Thursdays. Given the maximum class size was 10, I think that’s a fair trade-off. Even better, the final week it was only me so I had 2 lessons of private tutoring.

The normal course was 3 classes in the morning - a comprehension class, a grammar class and finally a speaking class. The order worked for me; if the speaking class was first my brain wouldn’t be up to speed with Spanish enough by 9am to give my views on whether or not I think there should be a tax on all inter-bank financial transactions, y’know? Yeah, thought so.

#The city

I am 100% sold on Valencia. I’m from London, so it was a step down in terms of size, but it’s definitely not too small. One of the girls in my class was from a small village in Belgium and she thought it was great without being too big. The weather is fantastic, the nightlife is great, [Valenbisi](http://valenbisi.com) is a godsend and the *Jardín del Turia* through the centre of the city is beautiful, even if you probably shouldn’t go there at night. Valencia is strange in the sense that it’s on the coast and it has beaches, but it’s more like a city that just so happens to have a beach rather than a city built around it.

There’s also a few football teams and I managed to get to [a Valencia game](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/16/valencia-zenit-st-petersburg-champions-league-match-report) fairly cheap, although the stadium wasn’t exactly full and as far as atmosphere went, it wasn’t the liveliest. Good game, though.

On the down side, there is a fair bit of dog shit in the streets (payoff of everyone having a dog) and the metro shuts down around 11pm - considering people don’t even think start pre-drinking until around midnight and getting to a club before 3am is crazy talk, that’s still strange. Taxis, however, are cheap and plentiful. No uber yet, but that’s just the Spanish government for you.

#Accommodation

I chose to stay in an AirBnB (~£300 for the 3 weeks) instead of in an apartment with other students or with a host family - main reasons being:

* If I lived with other students, I’d be speaking English as soon as I left the classroom. Sure, I hung around with them a lot, but only speaking Spanish at “home” definitely helped. Talking to the other students, pretty much all they spoke at “home” was English. Score 1 for AirBnB

* I haven’t lived with my family for…quite a while. Living with another mother would’ve driven me crazy. If I come home drunk at 7am, the last thing I need is an angry Spanish woman telling me off. My hangovers are bad enough. I didn’t hear great things from the other students about the leniency of the host parents. 2-0 to AirBnB

* Quality of accommodation. AirBnB hosts had a lot on the line, the host families or the school-provided accommodation probably aren’t as worried about a 3- or 4-star review. AirBnB hat-trick

* Location. This is where some of the school-provided accommodation won out, some of them were a 5-minute walk from the school. Mine was 20 minutes by bike but I initially chose it to be close to the school I originally booked. If I knew I’d be changing last minute, I would’ve booked one closer. 4-1

* Food. The school-provided accommodation gave you 3 meals a day so that’s 5 minutes saved every night making a sandwich for the next day, *but* the food provided didn’t get rave reviews. If you don’t like white bread and nutella, you’re going hungry. On the other hand, if you can’t cook then I imagine you’ll deal with it. 5-2 

* Cost. Pretty much the same but the school-provided accommodation has food included in the price. 5-3. AirBnB wins

#Next steps

I’m going to re-start my Spanish evening classes here, of course at a much higher level! I’m also going to be hiring an iTalki tutor once a week and meeting up with Spaniards whenever I can. Would I do another course? Absolutely. I’m toying with the idea of taking a few months off work (i.e. between jobs) next year to take a course for a few months, this time potentially in South America. 

So, there you go. If there's anything I missed, if you have any other questions or just want me to expand on certain points, let me know (in Spanish or English)"
3mklg7,4,2015-09-27,How to deal with my psychopathic brother ?,Guardian02,sociopath,https://www.reddit.com/r/sociopath/comments/3mklg7/how_to_deal_with_my_psychopathic_brother/,"Hi guys,

In 1 month my younger brother is going to live with me for a while, he's doing an internship program or something like that, no details, conveniently located around my area so he asked me if he could stay at my place. I live with my GF, at first I wanted to refuse but I would have taken too much crap from everybody, including my GF (he's completely normal as far as she knows) so I gave in.

He's not diagnosed, at least not to my knowledge, but I'm 100% sure after a whole childhood and some more spent with him that he's positive for ASPD/psychopathy or something of the sort, full-blown case. Me, my parents and my other sibling have some stories about him that could chill most people to the bones. 

There's no excuses really, we had a fairly normal childhood, no traumatic events behind all of this. Yet after everything, my family       (especially me) is still in good terms with him. Most of us know that something is wrong with him, or some are deluding themselves about it, but it's kind of a taboo subject and we just deal with it. Maybe we're a little bit scared of him too I guess but when you know the guy it's understandable. He's not as destructive towards us compared to others in his life I think, he was a lot during childhood and puberty but now he's distant with us, which is probably why our relationship with him is good at the present time.

To think about it, he fakes all of it really well, It's quite hard to hate him no matter what.. He's witty and calm, highly intelligent and charismatic, good looking, has a strong work ethic and is doing higher studies, a social butterfly with a very promising future from what I've heard and an all around nice guy, at first, but it's all a little too perfect.
What's behind the pretty facade then ? no empathy, no morals, no shame or sense of guilt, nothing is ever his fault, a mean streak when he doesn't get what he wants, that weird smile on his face sometimes when he does and the weird eyes too when he's excited, also manipulative to no end, big liar, you name it.
You guys are probably best qualified to know what type of guy I'm talking about so I will not get into too much details.


Anyway the point is, I need some advice on how to behave around him for when he's home, should I tell my girlfriend for example ? Maybe she'll freak out, or maybe she just won't believe me. Not to brag, but she's also pretty attractive so is he gonna try something with her just to mess with me ? Should I confront him right from the start, set some rules or let him adjust alone ? I'm guessing he would be smart enough to behave since we'll provide free hosting but you never know.

If it was you guys visiting your family, what would you want them to do or not to do so that you won't make trouble ? What's the manual for noobs around sociopaths ? I'm an easy going type of guy but I don't let people push me around either, we were never that close growing up but I've always been kind and patient with him, always the first to defend him when he did some fucked up shit. Even for someone like him it has to count a little right ? or maybe it's the opposite and I'm just an easy target ? I don't really know, I can't tell with him.

It's been years since we lived under the same roof, but even back then it was never just the two of us (and now with my GF too but I don't want his attention on her obviously) so it was much simplier.

Oh my god this is way too long, I'm sorry for the rant.

tl,dr : my brother is coming to live with me for a while and I want it to go smoothly without any trouble, what should I do ?

Edit : English is not my first language, I don't use my own language's board because the activity is not that great and so that I can practice, please go easy on me grammar nazis."

3ml02a,1,2015-09-27,"Post &amp; Core, post-root canal",greasypete9,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/3ml02a/post_core_postroot_canal/,"I'll give as much detail as possible because I don't know what's important and what's not... I recently had to have a root canal on one of my upper eye teeth due to an abscess. My dentist told me that me getting this particular abscess was about a 1 in 10,000 chance because there was no cavity, no ""trauma,"" and I have decent oral health (i.e., brush twice daily, floss 6-7 times a week). This particular tooth is dead and has been dead for many years, but I've never had any issues with it before Labor Day weekend, when I started having tooth pain. I went into the dentist the Tuesday after Labor Day and got a root canal with a temporary filling. I then took amoxicillin to remove the infection and went back to the dentist on the 24th. He completed the root canal (I guess with a more permanent filling) and the next x-ray he took showed that there is still some infection in the gums, so I am now on clindamycin.

Now, the problem is money. I'm a 24 year old college student, paying my way through college almost exclusively by myself while working and this root canal set me back a bit financially. My dentist had me set up another appointment for a ""post and core"" for October and I was wondering how important this appointment is. Can it be delayed until January, when I'll be starting a higher paying internship and I'll have some extra money? Or is it more important for me to get it done now and just really stretch my dollars over the next few months? I know I should probably talk to my dentist personally about this, since he knows the situation completely, but I thought I'd try asking this here to see if I could at least get an idea of whether or not delaying the appointment is a good idea. Thanks!"
3mld1v,2,2015-09-27,My Father and his hatred for tattoos might affect our relationship,shnz2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3mld1v/my_father_and_his_hatred_for_tattoos_might_affect/,"I'm 21 years old, almost 22. Over the past year, I have been thinking of getting a tattoo of a symbol that means a lot to me. I have adjusted it a bit on photoshop, did a few things to it to add my own personality to it, and a few days ago, I decided that I wanted to get it done this weekend.

So my mom already knew I wanted it, and though she preferred me not getting one, she accepted that it was my body, and she respected the decision I would choose to make. So I come home from school and my mom asks me ""when are you getting it?"" and my dad says ""getting what?"" and he found out what I want to do.

He started screaming, shouting, saying that if I do this, it will destroy our relationship and I will become nothing to him. That broke my heart... I didn't understand where his hatred was coming from. He was raised in Iran during the 50s and 60s and early 70s, so I understand where the traditionalist aspect comes from, but my mom grew up in Iran too... 

He started crying and claimed that he failed as a father, and I thought that was ridiculous. I'm finishing up my college education in a few months, I don't do drugs, I'm constantly looking for ways to better myself, I'm working to get internships and job offers. 

He told me that at his office, he has a woman who works for him, and he used to really like her until she revealed the tattoo she has on her forearm of a biblical quote, and now my dad has no respect for her. She does everything he asks her to do, and my dad says that she does her job VERY well, and my dad admitted that she's a kind woman, yet he has no respect for her, just because of this tattoo.

It is obvious that he is not thinking logically or rationally about this, and the fact that he is so close minded about it angers me, and upsets me. Obviously this tattoo is something I want, but I know that if I get it, he will break down, possibly have a heart attack and sent to the hospital. So I don't want to get it if it results in destroying out relationship, but I also feel like later down the road, I will resent him for it, and mostly myself for letting him tell me what to do with my body.

My mom is trying to calm him down, but he doesn't get it He thinks its trashy and evil. Any advice? I saw a similar thread in this subreddit but I thought because the circumstances are slightly different, I get your input on this as well.



   
**tl;dr**: How do I talk to my dad about this? How do I get him to be more open minded about tattoos? And how can I get the tat without destroying the relationship I have with my father? "

I had an internship from February till April that often left me tired so I really wasn't in the mood for preparing my own food. Add a stable financial situation and heaps of junkfood were ordered (I was also looking for places that deliver healthier food but couldn't find any). At the end of the internship I somehow hurt my knee (I really don't know if it was work related, but one day it just started to hurt and I went to see a doctor in May). I love the treadmill, but with my knee I just couldn't do it. I didn't feel like the doctor really put effort into finding out what's wrong with me (at least the X-ray image showed no sign of wear or injury of my knee joint) and sent me off with a prescription for 6 sessions of physiotherapy. I didn't care to find a physiotherapist because with my bachelor's thesis coming up and my part time job I didn't feel like I had time for it. 

After I finished my thesis I found another doctor who was able to help me. My knee didn't hurt for a few days only to be worse after a while. So, still no exercise. My problem was and still is that without exercise I just can't find any motivation to eat better. I recently went to a third orthopedist and with his help I was able to get an appointment for MRI that hopefully will shed some light on what's wrong with my knee.

I realize that the lack of exercise isn't the explanation of all of my weight gain. My lack of discipline to maintain healthy eating habits under those circumstances was and still is.

I just hope that I have built up some resilience in my episode of successful weight loss so that once my knee conditon normalized I can get a new pair of running shoes and that exercise will push a button in my brain and healthy eating habits and some motivation to actually lose weight will kick in once again.

But in the end it's not up to my knee or my brain or me being too tired to prepare healthy food. 

In the end it's about me and discipline.

P.S: ugh, I feel like my wrting style equals that of a sixth grader so thanks a ton in case you've read till the end :)"
3mmwmc,1,2015-09-27,No one believes in me [M/23],Glasenator,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3mmwmc/no_one_believes_in_me_m23/,"Today I got a call from my girlfriend(23) and she seemed really distraught.  For some background we are in a long distance relationship and have been dating for over two years now.  It’s not easy, but we alternate driving 700 miles to see each other for a weekend every 2-3 months.  We have met each others parent’s(50s) and siblings many times, and have gotten past all of the initial introductory phases of a relationship.  I would say it is serious and we have had some responsible talks about proposal and marriage when we are finally able to live in the same location.  We are absolutely in love with each other.

She is currently living with her parents while attending law school two states away.  I graduated last winter in animation at my state university.  I do not currently have a full time job and am still at home with my parents as well, but I have been working part time doing any graphic design work and web design work I can get.  Which to be fair is not that much.  It’s extremely hard to find any “employed” positions in the animation industry where I live especially since I am straight out of college. I have since lowered my standards job searching this past year to ANY position in a graphics oriented field that is in her city or one within a more reasonable driving distance.  It’s been almost a year and I have been strung along by a few positions but never gotten a yes.

Anyway, I asked her what was wrong and she said that an older lady at their church had started asking about me.  Why am I never here?  What do I do for a living?  My girlfriend explained that we were long distance and that I am currently working part time while applying for positions closer to her, yadda yadda.  The old lady seemed put off that I wasn’t officially employed and turned to my girlfriend’s dad and asked him if he was ok with this?  Her dad then agreed that it was an issue and something to think about.  On their drive home my girlfriend got upset at him because he didn’t defend me and they got into a huge fight.  Her dad is a quiet engineer type, I don’t think he hates me but it’s been two years since I have met him and he still doesn’t seem to accept that I am here for the long haul.  The fact that I am an “artist” and not STEM oriented seems to be a big issue for him.  My girlfriend loves her dad very much as she should, and is obviously unhappy about his feelings toward me, but I am worried that he may be slowly trying to convince her that I am some sort of burnout dead end.  I have felt the same concern from her mother and brother as well.  They’re all nice people but it upsets me that they’re still unsure of me after all that I have done and continued to do for their daughter.

This news came at a really bad time because I also just got into a fight this past week with my own parents about my employment.  They are slowly getting more passive aggressive towards me, suggesting that I should return to school and pursue an entirely different field/area of study since “art seems to be a bust.”  I thanked them for their advice initially, but as time has gone on it has begun to feel insulting.  Both my parents always pushed me to continue pursuing art since I was young and within a year they’ve done a complete flip on that opinion.  Frankly I don’t feel like caving in and admitting that I can’t achieve success in my chosen field.  I also don’t want to render the last eight years of my technical education useless.  I snapped at them during dinner last Friday when they brought it up and I made my mom started crying while in a restaurant.  The worst part about it was that I didn’t even feel bad.  I don’t want people to doubt me, and I don’t want to give up.  I feel sick to my stomach whenever the thought of starting over at school enters my brain.

Right now my girlfriend is the only one that I think truly believes in me.  And I understand that her opinion is the one that matters most.  But we are both still indebted to our respective parents.  We both respect their rules and wishes as they are graciously letting us live with them post graduation.  My parents are also helping me to pay for my ridiculously high car insurance in my state, which I am very thankful for as my car is the only way that I have to see my girlfriend.  Neither of us are rebels and are both practically minded.  I would love to just pick up my stuff and plop down in her city, but with no prospective jobs lined up and the little funds that I do have, it’s just not logistically sound.  I want everyone to be happy, but it seems that I am the origin of everyone’s frustration.

This past week it seemed like a graphic design position in her city was falling in to place for me.  I got through an initial phone interview and resume process.  It looked like things were going to work out, this place needed a whole new web redesign.  They called me back within a day and I was so excited to answer the phone.  Turned out that all they could offer me was an unpaid internship.  Wow.  Searching for employment today is such soul crushing work, I don’t think our baby boomer parents could ever understand.  I am worried I am taking out this frustration on my girlfriend, both sets of parents, and my own artistic drive.  Continuing to wear down what connections are left between each other.

Please help me fix this.
 
**tl;dr**: Lack of progress in employment search is causing parents to question my professional ability and me to lash out at people who I love."

Also, I couldn't quite figure out where to share this but the one thing I know is that I never really have anyone to cry to. Whenever a hint of emotions start to sweep my eyes, I feel this unspoken pressure to ""man up"" and it makes it very hard to share my pain. I always feel like men who act like this are viewed as weak, even though we're constantly told and I even feel that men should be consoled through their pain just as much as anyone else is.  
That being said, I'll give you **cliff notes**:  
My father battled addictions and didn't lose, himself, but managed to destroy our family with it.  
I grew up in a lot of gang influenced neighborhoods.  
Two of my childhood best friends are convicted felons, one got shot and killed, most are just societies' failures.  
Despite difficult circumstances, I managed to shake myself out of apathy after my cousin/best friend died.  
I worked my ass off through community college and got into a great school for engineering.  
More life problems happened so my grades plummeted but I never gave up.  
Finally I graduated, got a dream job offer, spent what little savings I had relocating and promptly was laid off less than a month later.  
Now I'm on the verge of being homeless again and seriously losing hope.  
**[/end cliffs]**  
Now for the main course...  
I grew up in a poor neighborhood and a lot of my friends tried to pressure me into drugs or gang activities when I was younger. My mom spent most of her energy trying to make sure I wasn't a *bad* kid, but that unfortunately meant, when my dad kind of didn't give a shit, she didn't have the energy to invest into making me a *good* kid either.  
So I kind of just existed, throughout primary school. I went to school and was a social outcast, but on the inside I was constantly battling depression because of my parents' arguments.  
I got kicked out of high school my senior year for getting into a fight and had to graduate with my diploma from adult school. After a couple years working in retail, one person who was always extremely kind to me and one of my moral beacons in my life, my best friend and cousin died of a brain tumor.  
He had went to the doctor and complained of having serious head pain and not thinking it was merely a headache. Unfortunately, he had Medicaid and the doctor didn't give a shit. They gave him migraine medicine and told him to fuck off. He had a seizure in his sleep a few days later.  
That really *shook* me, to my core. I couldn't fight the tears, I couldn't fight the emotion, I just collapsed. But it woke me up. I realized I needed to get away from that kind of life. So I finally went to college and took school seriously. In high school, I barely survived algebra. But with a renewed sense of direction, I was getting straight A's in calculus and most of my college classes.  
When your dad dropped out of high school and your family is lower class, poor societal minorities, you have a LOT of trouble figuring college out. I had to figure things out like financial aid and guidance counseling the hard way.  
Against all odds, I was accepted to a highly ranked school for engineering as a transfer student. But that's when shit started to just get messed up again.  
My mother finally got sick of my father stealing our belongings and pawning them for drug/alcohol money and started to file for divorce. Unfortunately, she also found out that my father forged her signature to sign us up for second and third mortgages and totally ruined my mother's home loan.  
My mom lost her house, had to move in with my sister and when my brother in law started treating her like a dog, she decided that she didn't want to burden me or my sister's anymore. She downed half a bottle of Zanax and locked herself in her room. I got the call and it pretty much did to me what it would do to any of you who has a great relationship with your mom.  
I begged my university to give me part-time study (you only have to take 6-8 units per quarter but you still get financial aid so you can survive) and even with me submitting a psychiatrist's note saying ""hey, this guy is going through some *shit*, we are putting him on meds"", copies of my mother's police report and medical report and basically telling them ""Hey, I can NOT take a break because I have nowhere else to go and if I don't get financial aid, I'll be homeless"", they still denied me part-time status.  
I've heard of people being denied part-time at my school even after they THEMSELVES attempted suicide...  
So, I had to continue school full time, worrying about my mother who had no place to live trying to kill herself, being cheated on by my girlfriend/best friend of four years, feeling like an outcast because everyone else in school had a mom and dad who went to college to ask for help and friends they went to high school with and I didn't fit in anywhere.  
My grades plummeted but I didn't give up... I survived and graduated with a B.S. in Engineering.  
I'm the FIRST college graduate in a STEM field from my ENTIRE family, the first MALE graduate from my father's side of the family. I had the biggest smile on my face as I walked up to grab a piece of blank paper rolled up to look like a diploma. My mother was so happy she cried. She cried when I was kicked out of high school because she felt like she was losing me. Now she was crying tears of joy because her boy was a college graduate and she was finally seeing me free.  
And then shit got real.... I realized after graduation that merely passing college wasn't enough. The degree program didn't teach me a useful fucking thing at all to get a job in my field. Finally I figured out my real passion was software development but all I learned for it was MATLAB and C++ for numerical analysis.  
So when my field didn't work out, I taught myself C#, Unity, Xcode and even published a game to iTunes. It wasn't a GOOD game, at all. In fact, it's pretty shitty but it was bug free and passed iTunes Connect so I was proud of myself.  
Finally I got a job offer for a development studio. I was very clear with them that I was VERY VERY beginner level and that it would take me 2-3 months to get to the skill level of their full timers. They swore up and down that they knew and were looking forward to it... And then they fired me 4 weeks later... I was crushed. I had spent all my savings relocated and I even asked them before I left if they could just take me on part time as an intern so I could be a low cost to them until I earn my place. They insisted on giving me the full time nod, only to can me later.  
Now I'm pretty much desperate, hungry and failing at every turn. I've put ads on Craigslist to do side jobs in tech support or engineering, I've applied to everything I qualify for, drafting jobs, tech jobs, the Apple store... I've put up ads, I've created a Fiverr gig, I'm even selling my fucking blood.  
I get nothing and my girlfriend is being dragged into depression with me. She'll randomly start crying throughout the day because my awful situation just brings her down but I can't go home because I have NO FUCKING home to go to. People ask me where I went to school, I say the school name, they ask my degree, and then they always act like ""Oh wow that's such a good school, wow good job, what are you doing *now*?"" And I don't even like answering because I can't think of a nice sounding way to say, ""Nothing. I don't have a job, no one hires me.""  
Finally, I have a chance to turn things around... My biggest barrier in college was that my financial problems and emotional problems always barricaded me from succeeding... Now I have a job offer to teach overseas and it will fix SO MUCH of my life. They pay really well, the cost of living is really low and the hours are really low. They also provide a paid furnished apartment with internet, electricity, water, a washer, fridge and even a meal card. I'll finally be able to live my life without the constant fear of losing everything, at least just for a year.  
The only problem is, no one calls me for side gigs or part time work so I can at least make the money to make the trip....  
And every time I talk to people about it, they all tell me to try something I've already fucking tried to do. ""Oh, you should post some ads on Craigslist and do some staffing work, you'll have it in no time! hehe :) yay!"" and I'm thinking, do you even fucking KNOW how badly I would rather earn this all myself instead of begging on Facebook and GoFundMe?  
So that's my story.....  
I'm not asking for help... I just needed to let it out because I have nowhere else I can go and I'm tired of parking my girlfriend's car in a dim lit area so I can cry. Figured this time I would post it on Reddit from a cafe for a change.  "
3mn1g6,11,2015-09-27,"I fear my alcoholic father may end up in an early grave, and my mother refuses to accept that she has a duty to help him.",JustSoFedUp,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3mn1g6/i_fear_my_alcoholic_father_may_end_up_in_an_early/,"A little background.

I live in a small town where my mother and father are both trusted local professionals. Through networking and community involvement, they're quite prolific and well known in the community.

They are under heavy financial pressure due to the economy, compounded by the fact that they now have to pay for four of their five kids to go to college. So if it came out that my father is a functioning alcoholic, it would ruin them and we'd probably end up homeless.

I've never really gotten along with my father. I've always found him hostile, emotionally distant and easily angered, and I feel he takes himself, and everything around him, far too seriously. He doesn't have a great sense of humour, basically.

My mother, I am much closer to. We share tastes in music, movies, I can tell her things about my life and my hopes and dreams etc. etc. because half of the time, she can sit there and listen without judging. She's quiet, soft-spoken and sometimes really wise.

The other half of the time? She's a shouting, vitriolic and insidious crazy person who wouldn't ever hesitate to tell my father she wants him dead, to tell me and my siblings to move out or to tell us she's never doing X again (like, cooking us dinner) (EDIT: I should say that this is hardly the worst thing she's ever said, just an example of how OTT she is. No, she'll regularly tell me I am a loser with no life, she hits my sister a lot, and she likes to tell my little brother things like she's going to leave him at school if he doesn't behave, or that she'll kill him etc.) My best friend has admitted that he doesn't like my mother due to how volatile he finds her. Tell me about it.

I've been seriously emotionally scarred by my mother's extreme rage issues, and I have sworn off ever getting married and to be honest, it's affected my relationships with woman. The fear that I may end up with someone so... callous, as my mother, it frightens me.

I don't particularly ""like"" my parents, but I don't hate them. And here's where I divulge why I am here.

My father lost a dear friend a few years ago, and after that, the sometimes difficult man I knew became a reclusive, bitter and weak human being who spends his spare time drinking and sleeping.

My mother has had dozens of opportunities to find help for him, to really try and improve his life, and has squandered every, single, one. I don't think she really wants him to get better. Even something as basic as removing alcohol from the house is too much for her, as in her own words, she ""should be able to enjoy a drink, even if he can't."" She finishes a bottle of wine a night. I'd call her an alcoholic too if she didn't clearly enjoy it so much.

My mother has always been very hard on my father. She'll assassinate his character for the smallest reasons (the way he drinks milk with his dinner, that was a recent one), and just take every opportunity to humiliate him or make him feel bad. When arguments escalate she gets violent, and has seriously injured him many times. On Christmas day last year she smashed a plate over his head. He retreated into the other room and stayed there until 4 a.m., crying. This broke my heart. I don't have much respect for the man, but no one deserves to be treated like this.

The saddest part of all, though, is that, no matter how hard I try to confront my dad about these issues that are clearly making our house a toxic environment, he rarely ever responds positively or sympathetically. He'll throw my anxiety back at me, or bring up the fact that I failed exams in college etc. When the argument escalates he usually stops paying my college fees, which lands me in the registry office lying about how we can't afford it right now or something. This has happened four times in three years.

The only time he did open up to me was on that Christmas night. He was drunk, so I don't think he remembered it the next day, but basically he admitted that he's contemplated suicide but would never do it as he loves us too much. I accept that he genuinely believes this, but anyone who kills themselves has thought at one stage that they would never do it. I spend my nights hoping that tomorrow is not the morning I awake to find him on the bathroom floor.

My parents are out of control. My mother is emotionally unstable and has been abusing my father, mentally and physically, for twenty years. My father is an alcoholic with some serious issues that may have arisen from some sort of trauma early in life, I don't know, and which have only been aggravated by domestic abuse and grief and financial trouble.

The two of them live in a world of their own, where my mother can emotionally abuse my father just to make herself feel better and say things like ""perhaps he should kill himself"" around her twelve year old son, and my father can drink his evenings away and just not raise his youngest child, but pretend that everything's okay because people avoid talking about it.

I have a job and am in college. I'm saving up to spend the summer abroad on an internship that I've secured, so I don't have enough money to move out. Even if I did, my little brother wouldn't stand a chance in that house alone. I can't leave him.

I just don't know what to do anymore.

After a lengthy conversation with my mom one day in the car, about how I feel the situation is going to keep getting worse, I told my mother ""I think he's going to die, and when that happens, I don't want to have to say I told you so.""

She responded, ""don't you dare."""

At defcon 23, there were a group of people on the top floor, in the suite area. I'm not sure if they were there officially, or if they just opened up a room because they felt like it, but inside they had a projector connected to a Kinect that they were writing software for live. They also had a number of other cool projects, and were giving out Arduino Unos to those that could complete some basic tasks on them. I talked to one of the Microsoft guys for an hour or so and got his contact information, and he offered to help me get a microsoft internship.
Unfortunately, this contact information is somehow missing, and I /really/ need to find out who he was.
Does anybody know who was in that room? Which organization? If they had an attendance roster or anything like that?
Any help would be appreciated, I really don't want to lose this contact."
3mnep1,2,2015-09-27,It's gotten bad these past few weeks. I'm just wallowing in it now.,_ASG_,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3mnep1/its_gotten_bad_these_past_few_weeks_im_just/,"Some history before I start: I couldn't tell you how long I've been depressed, but I know I had symptoms of it dating back to my early teenage years. It got worse as high school went on and it got really bad in college. While I managed to keep good grades, I struggled socially and emotionally and even though I never planned or attempted anything, I wanted to die and I fantasized about it frequently. I was in therapy nearly half of my undergrad, due to the urging of friends. It helped, but it felt like a band-aid. I've been on two different medications. They helped some, but they killed my sex-drive and I'm convinced that they caused my hair to thin (not sure though). I'm not sure what I've been diagnosed with, but I imagine it was Major Depressive Disorder (I know I met the criteria at least). It was really bad during my senior year where I wanted to kill myself nearly everyday. Only a few friends knew about this. I always was quiet about it, especially when I had one friend who told me that I was pathetic for using medication for my depression (she's since apologized, but that sort of thing sticks with you).

Fast forward to graduate school. My first year was stressful, but I dealt with it. Classes were hard and my low paying job sucked, but I made it through. I usually felt lousy, but not nearly as bad as I did before (not bad enough for meds at least). I was lonely though. My friends are pretty spread out, and since I'm in a social work grad program, most of my peers are older, so I didn't really make any new friends. But I managed... until now, that is.

A few weeks ago, my internship terminated me. The reasons were absolute garbage (another story for another day) and they did this without consulting me or my supervisor. It was pretty devastating, especially since I actually liked this internship more than the last one I got shoe-horned into. While everybody involved told me that it wasn't my fault, I still felt awful. I'm being placed at a new location, but I'm going to be roughly 72 hours behind. Since then, things got progressively worse.

I've tried to keep myself busy with work, school, and friends, but that only got me so far. I ended up going out to a strip club with some friends that week. It was a great time, but it just reminded me how sexually frustrated I am. This past week, I binged on porn, but now that doesn't interest me either. School has been getting harder and I can't focus on anything. My appetite has been dwindling, I'm always tired, and I enjoy nothing. TV, movies, video games, drinking, reading... nothing feels fun. If there was one good thing to come out of this, it's that I've started running again. I figured that if I get into better shape, I'd feel better about myself, but so far, nothing.

Socially, I feel so alone. I have a few friends I can talk to, but I feel like they get overwhelmed by me. One who I chatted with today told me that I frustrate her with my problems. She doesn't understand where I'm coming from, I guess. I don't know. To add to my low mood, I went on a date this week with a girl I met recently. It was fantastic and I felt better than I had in awhile, and since she said she wanted to see me again and we texted afterward, I felt that things were going great. But she suddenly stopped texting me for who knows what reason (if you look in my history, you'll find my posts in r/dating that talk about this situation in more detail). This sort of bullshit happens all the time, but I still felt miserable because she actually seemed different from most of the women who let me down. Also adds to that sexual frustration I mentioned earlier.

I scheduled to get into therapy at my school (it's free, so I might as well use it), but I've already been pushed back two weeks (one week because the therapist was sick, the second because I had a staff meeting I couldn't miss). I meet with them this week (hopefully), but it's just the initial interview. I feel like there is nothing else I can go to and nobody to talk with. And I wish I was dead. I don't think I could kill myself at this point in time, but I always feel that it's inevitable: that someday, I'm just going to do it. I haven't because I keep hoping things will get better, but I still see myself at some point in the distant future... and this is terrible, but sometimes, I wish I could purposely botch a suicide attempt just so I could get attention. That's wrong, I know, and it enforces a negative stereotype, but sometimes, I wish I could do it so people would actually realize how I feel. I just feel like a worthless, lost cause at this point with no self-esteem. Sometimes, I believe I could believe in some sort of religion, but I can't.

And now, I'm sitting at my computer, typing this, feeling nothing but emptiness. And honestly, I don't feel like I'm ever going to get better... I think that's everything... I just miss when I was younger and everything was easier."
3mo43a,2,2015-09-28,"Me [23 M] with my now ex [21 F] of 2 years, broke up with me suddenly and is now imploding... trying to figure out my role.",michaeljordanofweed,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3mo43a/me_23_m_with_my_now_ex_21_f_of_2_years_broke_up/,"We're starting our senior year of college, and she broke up with me suddenly about a week and a half ago. Let's call her... Polly. Fuck it.

Her wording was vague, but I can't say I didn't see it coming. We lived together this summer to save money so that she could do her dream internship (which was, obviously, completely unpaid). We had a decent summer, but by the end it was clear that it the tiny apartment was putting a strain on the relationship. Sex got less frequent (from ~twice a week to once in two weeks. Yeah...)

So she moved into her dorm a few weeks ago, and we talked about . We even had dinner with her mom last Sunday. Then, two days later, she came over all serene acting and talked about how she has to be outside of a relationship, but wants to stay close friends. I've done this dance before with other people, and I told her we should talk in a week 

Week passes, she tells me she needs a couple more days before she can talk. Then when we finally talk, she's talking about how much she's missed me and how she still loves me and wants to kiss me but knows she can't. I say I can't open myself up to get hurt again and that we can have a slow friendship but I can't be her emotional support dog anymore. We agree to both attend our mutual friend's birthday party the next night and the conversation ends kind of optimistically. Call the friend Mary.

I end up having another commitment, but figure that's ultimately fine. I text the friend to let her know I can't make it, text Polly to say she doesn't have to worry about seeing me. She seems bummed, but I don't think about it.

Polly gets shitfaced at the party because she's nervous, then Mary walks into her own bedroom to find Polly hooking up with one of the 15 guys at the party. To be clear, it's not clear to me how drunk my ex-girlfriend got. I don't know if they had sex and I frankly don't care. Whatever relationship we had is now gone.

I know taking her back isn't an option. But all of this behavior is extremely out of character for her. She's a homebody who generally prefers getting high with me and watching documentaries to going out and drinking. I'm much more extroverted than her, so she was happy to let me deal with people at social engagements.

So she lashed out and killed the relationship, which is fine for me. But she didn't have any sort of an emotional support system outside of the relationship, and it's getting increasingly hard for our friends to see things from her perspective. She's dealt with suicidal thoughts in the past, and I'm honestly worried about her well-being.

I also only found out this information through the friend (Mary) who told me to promise not to tell anyone. Also Polly apparently broke one of Mary's fans (?)

What's my role in this? I never want to date Polly again, but I can't help but feel like I'm the only person in a position to help her until she can start helping herself and figuring out why she decided no one else's feelings mattered. She still hasn't admitted anything to me (she isn't obligated to) and we agreed to stop talking indefinitely. But we still have all the same friends, and our friend group feels a responsibility to get her help.

I want to e-mail her mom to say ""I loved your daughter but she needs a LOT of therapy, like STAT"" but I don't know if that's overstepping my boundaries. For what it's worth, her mom loves me and told her the breakup would be a bad idea.

   
**tl;dr**: gf broke up with me, got drunk and hooked up with someone on our other friend's bed. I'm worried about her but I also know she's not my fucking problem anymore"
3mohjz,19,2015-09-28,Lets talk about game improvements for new players,TitledTitan,heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3mohjz/lets_talk_about_game_improvements_for_new_players/,"I think we can all agree that Blizzard are trying new things all the time with MM to try their best to improve their system, whether it's improving is pretty debatable, if you take a look at their forums you'll notice 90% of it is qq'ing about MM.

From my own experience in the game (playing since early beta) I made the big mistake of losing alot of my first HL games, this was mostly becuase the game was still in beta and I wasn't taking it very serioulsy, I just wanted to try every hero and see what HL was like.

This obvioulsy tarnished my MMR, I learnt how MMR/MM worked long after my MMR was tarnished, been trying ever since to improve my game enough to climb out of what some of you call ""MMR Hell"" (below 1.5K MMR)

What I've learnt is that it would take me several months to do this with a 60% win rate which I'll just have to accept. I cant blame teamates here, there are ways to carry in Hots, again I agree with what most of you say that the ""Carry"" as we know it from other MOBA's is very different in Hots as hots is more like a ""babysitting"" type of carry.

So on my journey back up to acceptable ranks on my main and starting up a smurf to see differences I've noticed some interesting points.

1. Blizzard does not do anything to train new players:
once you complete the really easy tutorial and understand the mechanics you are on your own, you can freely jump into a game with others and try to socialise, find your own way around, Hots is good at making you feel like you know what you are doing, great rewarding sounds when you kill another player and the constant motivational vocals coming from the game to push you on throughout the match. It's easy to get the feeling that ""you are a beast""

2. New Players aren't informed of what they are doing and how it will affect them in the long run:
Playing QM/HL is fun, it's nice to jump in and explore, but players should really be informed more of how wins/losses will affect them, you see alot of new players (myself included when I was new) picking lvl 1 heroes in HL and having their first games with that hero there. if they only knew that they were going to screw up future games for themselves maybe there would be less of these mistakes happening.

3. New Players not prepared for draft mode:
jumping into ranked and seeing draft for the very first time can be overwhelming, players have a countdown then have to decide which hero to pick, all of the sudden they have to base their picks on map and enemies, if the enemy picks their favorite Hero they freak out and panick pick a hero, draft should be taught to new players

4. DPS/CC/AOE/meta.. etc.. are all terms new players will not understand:
Here's a scenario, you're a seasoned player but at a 1.8K MMR level, new players start at around the 1.7K mark, after a few lucky games a new player gets matched with you, it's his pick, you type ""we need more CC"" new player picks Nova, you flame and the new player has no idea why, this happens all to often, its really not the fault of the new player, there needs to be some way to improve the knowledge of new players and intern improve the game.



I think 1 way to fix this is by having weekly Bootcamp quests in Hots, make them single player quests and make them difficult to complete, design these around the perspective of teaching new players positioning, peeling, focusing, etc....

One scenario is that you could know the draft you are up against (A.I), you can choose/discuss your draft if you play with allies(real people who want to complete the scenario), you start 3 levels below the enemy and have to try make a come back.

or on BHB, you down to core alone, there are no minions, and you have to get the coins and make the turn-in before the A.I does in order to win.

Mines, get the first 3 golems in a row which are more powerful than the enemy golem, if the enemy get a golem which is more powerfult the game stops and you have the option of trying again.

what about terror, single player mode, make 5 kills with terror, or you start the game just you against 5 enemies, no buildings no minions, you have to keep terror alive for its full duration and when the clock runs out you have to be in the enemy base, if the terror is killed games can be restarted.

Use the Maps, use the current mechanics, maybe as a reward give 500 gold to players who have completed all their weekly quests and maybe a monthly portrait if you managed to complete them all for the month.

This will improve the game for new players and even vets who could learn something. 2 sided quests where you are matched with equal rank would work best, forcing players to learn techniques and not affecting thir MMR in the process.

What you guys think?

3mpuvv,10,2015-09-28,Me [24F] with my husband [22 Trans FtM] of 5 months. I was raised Mormon and am having a hard time with his sexuality,09cjones1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3mpuvv/me_24f_with_my_husband_22_trans_ftm_of_5_months_i/,"Hey guys,

Sometimes I feel like I am crazy and that my perspectives are skewed because my husband discounts everything I say about my emotions.  Let me know if I am skewed.  I am in graduate school, working full time with a 20 hour/week internship and a time-consuming relationship and I have pretty high anxiety/depression.

This is really embarrassing for me but I don't really have anyone I can talk to.  I was raised Mormon and suppressed my sexuality completely until I was about 22.  I wasn't supposed to masturbate or French kiss or anything, although when I was in college I sexted a boy and believed I was going to hell for quite a while.  I left the church at 23 and lost my virginity to my boyfriend.  He would use sex as a manipulative tool, only sleeping with me if he wanted something and sometimes guilting me into doing things I didn't want (sex without a condom, blow jobs, etc).  I didn't realize anything was wrong until after the relationship.  I slept with one of my best friends twice after this relationship, but that was the extent of my sexual experiences until my husband.

I met my husband at work.  We were both dating someone at the time, but we both got broken up with eventually and had a whirlwind romance.  We shouldn't have gotten married so early (known each other 1 1/2 years now) but I was raised with the mindset that marriage is the most important thing and I needed to do it ASAP and I would know when it was right.  I'm only starting to see my thinking errors the longer I am out of the Mormon church.  Everything in our relationship was great - we got along really well, our sex life was amazing, he was caring and thoughtful.  Then he started testosterone, became really depressed/suicidal and verbally aggressive, and started on antidepressants.  He has been trying out different ones; some haven't done anything and some have made him into a different person.  The antidepressants killed our sex life.

I have a really hard time with the idea of him masturbating.  It makes me very anxious.  I caught him last night and wanted to join in and I practically had to beg for him to let me (pathetic on my part, but I was half asleep and wasn't thinking too well).  Our sex life consists of him occasionally saying ""Blowjob?"", me eating him out, and that's it.  I've tried talking to him about foreplay, getting me off, etc. but it's always just words with him (""I'll do better, we can try that"") because when it comes down to it he seems so disinterested.  I get anxious on the thought that he doesn't really care to sleep with me but he's fine getting off by himself.  Even now when he goes off his meds, he still barely sleeps with me.

I cannot change what he is doing or communicate with him about anything emotional.  He gets very angry when I tell him I am unhappy about something and it escalates very quickly; he will hurt himself, call me a bitch, play the suicide card.  (I make sure to use I-feel statements instead of blaming language and to keep my tone neutral or calm.)  I have no support from him, emotionally or physically. I'm 95% sure he has borderline personality disorder.  We had our first couples' counseling two weeks ago (next appointment is tomorrow) where he made certain promises that he has already failed.  He is very irresponsible and I am in charge of all the bills, transportation (he won't drive or use public transit), cleaning, making sure he eats.  He will stay up until 2 or 3 am watching Netflix when I have a hard time sleeping when he is in the apartment and awake; he gets very angry when I bring this up, saying that I am trying to control him.  It's almost like he is stuck in his teenage years due to past trauma. So I just let him be and keep taking care of him. I know this is a huge problem on my part - I am codependent - but I have started trying to set limits and working on my own self-esteem.  

I am a very happy person in all aspects of my life except when I am with my husband.  I know the sexuality thing is one small problem among many, but I didn't know where to start, so I picked the most recent thing that has happened. I picked that because he tells me that everything is in my head and that my perspectives are skewed because of my upbringing.  I guess I want to know what's normal for a sexual relationship?  How do I make increase my self-esteem in this area of my life with no support and no one to help me?  

And, this may be off-topic, but I found an intensive adult outpatient therapy center I want him to attend.  He told me he would be fine learning about the options, but now that I've made an appointment he is almost refusing to go, just saying ""I don't want to"" without giving me any reasons at all.  Is it terrible to either say that he needs to go to this therapy (that I'm not sure how we'll pay for) or it's a deal breaker?  The more I am around my husband and try to get support, the more I feel like I am a terrible, nagging person who is expecting to much of other people and not doing enough myself.  Am I being stupid? Do I just need to kick myself in the ass and fix everything myself?


   
**tl;dr**: Have a hard time with the idea of my husband masturbating (picked one of the 300 things wrong in our relationship to ask about); feel like I am a terrible person who is failing the relationship due to things husband says.  Can you give me advice?"
3mpx5d,45,2015-09-28,&lt;x/post /r/conspiracy&gt;,Reddit003,magicthecirclejerking,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/comments/3mpx5d/xpost_rconspiracy/,"Ok guys, before I get silenced by the DCI, Wizards of the Coast, district judges (who may be in on it too), shady LGSes, or any of the Unseen Hand working for Hasbro, hear me out.  I think I may be on to something **HUGE** here that will **BLOW YOUR MINDS**.  If my sources are correct, this shit floats all the way to the top to **MARK ROSEWATER** himself.

If you remember PVDDR's article from last week, Battle for Zendikar is a steaming pile of shit- literally full of unplayables in a set that the magic community is emotionally tied to.  Why does the set suck though?  **By design**.  By MARK ROSEWATER's design, and I can prove it.

In a document that a secret source showed me on a dimly lit billiards table in the back of a wedding hall, MARK ROSEWATER is said to have made a bet with top wizards employees, mainly Aaron Forsythe, that he could concoct the most serpentine swindle on the magic community AND wizards all while lining his own pockets AND being applauded for it by the entire magic community.

I can't go into very specifics, as I'm afraid for my life coming out with this, but I will tell you the gist of the story.  MARK ROSEWATER tasked himself with creating the worst magic set in over a decade, purposefully did this to a set that the community was attached to, and made sure that every card in the set was unchaseable and unplayable at once...  EXCEPT -now here's the kicker- the Zendikar Expeditions.  **NOTICE!**, the Zendikar Expeditions would be deliberately be diffused with printing errors, specifically on the *right side*.  Note that it's on the *right side* - i'll explain why that's important later.  In an announcement to be made later this week, wizards will start allowing players to ship their expeditions directly back TO WIZARDS.  Now, here's where it gets diabolical.  MARK ROSEWATER paid off the mail handling intern at WOTC, so that he could pocket the returning expeditions for himself, and send back CHINESE FAKES in return, thus **LINING HIS OWN POCKETS TWICEFOLD**. Told you it would get deeper, but it's about to get even deeper, I'm talking *wrexial , the risen deep*.  

Now, as you recall, last week, **LSV** pulled PVDDR's article complaining about BFZ, and even changed the date of the article.  Here's where we connect the dots.  MARK ROSEWATER couldn't allow the set to be completely trashed by the mainstream media; it would cut into his profits too much.  In an audio recording that was played back for me on an old jukebox in a dimly lit room with a billiards table in the back of a wedding hall, you can clearly hear MARK ROSEWATER sternly demanding that LSV *""pull""* the article from ChannelFireball.  Now some people might claim we don't know what the term *""pull""* meant in this context, but I can assure you, based on the industry experts I've spoken with, it means to take the article down completely and remove it from data archives across the web.  LSV, knowing he had all the leverage in this situation, replied that he wouldn't do it unless he was inserted into the top 8 at the next pro tour, to which MARK ROSEWATER begrudgingly agreed.

HOWEVER, MARK ROSEWATER, being the most evilly diabolical menacing (satanic) bastard that he is, wasn't content to sit back and let LSV blackmail him like this.  In a bold and sweeping move, Wizards of the Coast banned Dig Through Time (LSV's most treasured card) today in legacy, and restricted it in vintage.  

Anyway, I have to fold into the aether now, and if I turn up dead, I didn't commit suicide.  

**TL;DR BFZ is an inside job, expeditions miscut on purpose, so MaRo could make a fortune, LSV tries to blackmail MaRo, Maro bans DTT in response.**"

3mqaht,14,2015-09-28,[Update] My First Six Months as a Sales Rep,Canadohio,labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/3mqaht/update_my_first_six_months_as_a_sales_rep/,"Hey everyone,


I posted this 6 months ago and wanted to give an update: https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/2yz69s/what_makes_a_good_sales_rep_for_you/


It was a quick and dirty gauge of what you all thought made a rep stand out for you and what you looked for in terms of someone to help you do your research. I took some good pieces of advise from there and tried to add my own expertise in my first 6 months. I finally feel like I am getting a hang of this job and am getting to know most people in my territory. It's a fun job at times, tedious at others, and rewarding once in a while. What follows is a random list of musings more or less while I have a bit of time between quotes, e-mails and lunch.


My background: BS in Microbiology (honors / co-op [internships]), MBA with a marketing / sales focus, 7 years experience in a commercial immunology / microbiology position.


My company: A small-medium sized supply and services company focusing on low cost alternatives while maintaining quality


**#1** People love free stuff - It's a delicate balance. People love free stuff, but giving away too much free stuff leads to not really getting a marked increase in sales. I try and give out pens and magnets etc whenever I can but it's not really something that is drives sales. If I get a big order I like to stop by with donuts as a thank you and to let them know that I am still around to help even after the sale if anything isn't to their liking. I remember being an undergrad, I would have killed for some free donuts. It's a great way to let people know that I appreciate them and their order. Especially when they are trying us out for the first time.


**#2** On a related note, Samples - Samples are a HUGE point of contention for us. There are internal debates frequently about the value of sampling. We have found that about 10% of samples we give out actually get used. I visit labs where they wanted kit samples in the past and they still haven't used them, 3-4 months later. I know that writing, finding time to do these things, etc, cut into the ability to do that but from my seat it is very frustrating. It may just be a sample to you but to me it is a lead, someone who is hopefully a future customer, someone I am relying on to hold up the fact that they are actually interested in an alternative to their current method or product. It's the least important thing on your mind and the most important thing on mine when I come and visit. Especially for a frozen / cold pack sample. Those samples end up costing us about $40-50 each time we ship them to you. I know that you might say you want a sample to get rid of us but it would really be nice if people did that less often than it seems.


**#3** People are way more open to talking with me than I had imagined - Coming from the bench background, I totally understand the downtime that people have in labs between incubations, exposures, etc. It's great for me when I get to come in at that point, sit down, and learn a little bit about the lab. I am the least knowledgable person in the room about what you are doing. Helping me to get past that and actually hear about the work that I am trying to help you do is a great honor.


**#4** Making money is really hard - I never realized this job would be this hard. I thought I would come in with an option that was less expensive, worked just the same, and the products would sell themself. Boy was I damn wrong. People are very wary to switch. Either they tried something different in the past and it didn't work or they know what they are working with works and won't switch. Or they like their rep. Or they don't like their PI and don't care about saving them money. It's really really hard as a smaller company no one has heard of. I imagine being with Fisher or VWR would be easier but I imagine then the difficulties are making sure people get what they want and are happy. Grass is always greener. 


All in all, it's been a good experience so far, and I am much less uninformed than I was when I started. It was immensely difficult at first because I didn't know all that we offered, and no one knew about the company either. It was tough to get up and running but now that I am much more comfortable with the company, the products/services, and my customers which makes things easier.


That's about it for right now. If anyone is curious about this kind of thing or has other suggestions feel free to let me know!"

I havent received any news as to whether or not a drug test will be administered at all, but I'm apprehensive as to whether it will be urine or hair. I know follicle testing is on the rise, and thats why I'm nervous. As an every day user, this is evident failure. My friends say they've never even gotten tested for their interships, yet my friend that worked at Wegmens told me they administered a hair test for him (at a damn super market..). My question to ya'll is how likely is this company to hair follicle test? A urine test is off my radar, as I can easily get clean or fake it. But hair follicle...unless im doing a Jerry G method of bleaching my hair, i'm probably screwed. Any help here guys?"
3mqg0t,10,2015-09-28,"Me [21 F] with my team leader [late 20's M] of 3 months, I think he's cheating on his fiance but don't know if I should say anything.",otherpeoplesproblems,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3mqg0t/me_21_f_with_my_team_leader_late_20s_m_of_3/,"So long story short, I'm an intern at a large company abroad and I've been working with my team leader/coordinator for a few months now. The nature of our profession occasionally necessitates really busy schedules, often 12+ hour days and even all-nighters, so it's not uncommon for our team members to go home late or not at all when we have a deadline. My team leader has been generally a nice guy, he can get a bit chatty with the pretty girls but overall really professional during work. 

We often celebrate with a night at the bar/ more than some beers after we turn in a major project. We recently just handed one in, and his fiance shows up at work lunch the day after to congratulate us. She also asked if he had more work to do, since she didn't see him in the morning after and it didn't look like he came back last night, which made things a little bit awkward at the table. He basically said he didn't go home because he had to finish a few minor assignments that had later deadlines, so he was stuck in the office all night.

The thing is, I was at the office until maybe 4 am, being an intern abroad with no life and needing to finish those minor assignments he mentioned. I didn't see him at the office at all - the last time I saw him, he was leaving the bar with a before-mentioned pretty girl that he's been chatting up the past few hours. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to get into their business and obviously I had no proof of anything and didn't want to stir up trouble where there is none, but I did fidget a bit and cough as an instinctive responsive to hearing a straight out lie and I think she noticed. Now I'm wondering if I should've spoken up. His fiance visits him all the time, and he doesn't seem like he puts in an equivalent amount of effort, referring to her on a few occasions as his 'ball and chain'. But again, it really isn't any of my business, and he may have had other reasons for lying that I don't know of. But I think he thinks that I suspect something and he's definitely been giving me a bit of the cold shoulder. I'm also partially worried that his fiance will come in and straight up ask me, because I don't want to be in a position that might affect my employment. I'm still really new to this whole corporate job thing and all, so reddit, what do? Nothing?
   
**tl;dr**: Project leader might be cheating and it might affect my job thing. I want to be prepared in case I get put in the spotlight, should I say anything?"

**Notable Box Office Stories:**

* Adam Sandler scored his biggest weekend opening since...well the last Hotel Transylvania with the sequel, which beat the original as the #1 September release of all time at $47.5 million. The smart strategy of placing a family friendly film with horror characters in the dull month before October has proven to be a very smart strategy and the inevitable Hotel Transylvania 3 will likely follow suit. This also could mark a shift in Sandler's brand. His live action films continue to disappoint while his animation has soared. Now that Sandler has a deal with Netflix for four live action films that will not be judged (business wise at least) by their box office receipts, it could be that Sandler will push his live action output to VOD and Netflix and keep his animation efforts on the big screen. 

* The Intern is another film that benefitted from great timing. With the competition mostly focusing on the young, the Nancy Meyers film fit in well as an alternative for the older crowd and gave Rober DeNiro his biggest opening since Little Fockers.

* While Everest did very well in IMAX last weekend, its expansion to wide release was less than stellar, with a significantly lower per theater average. Its possible that the branding of Everest in IMAX lead some to believe that this was more of a documentary/event film than a traditional narrative. However the filmmakers shouldn't fear. The $55 million film has already made its money back just in the overseas take.

* Sicario continues to impress in limited release, earning $1.7 million in only 60 theaters. In comparison, the much derided Stonewall opened in double the amount of theaters as Sicario and only grossed $112,000. Its likely the strong word of mouth from critics as well as the action oriented trailers have pushed the film's impressive limited release. Sicario does have stiff competition for its wide release debut next week, including the highly anticipated sci-fi film The Martian and the IMAX release for The Walk, but it could still easily score a $20 - $30 million opening.

* How many resumes does one usually bring to these?

* How much time does one have with each company/representative?

* Do i have to be declared as a CS/Engineering major? I am currently undeclared but have taken CS classes.


Finally, how was your guys' experience in career fairs? Were you able to get internships or was it largely pointless for you? I heard most of the people at these are graduate students doing their masters and PHD.

Thanks as always."
3ms0c7,1,2015-09-28,A good friend of mine passed away Friday,Miamihawks,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3ms0c7/a_good_friend_of_mine_passed_away_friday/,"**Please don't reply - I'd prefer just to get this out of my head for now.**

I don't know how to feel and I don't understand why. A good friend of mine passed away Friday and I just don't understand how to react. 

I have a great fear of grieving because I learned I'm not too good at it. My dad passed 3 years back and now I'm struggling to walk the line of getting it all out and choosing to remain numb. I don't think I am strong enough right now to be the shoulder for friends to cry on but I really want to be there for everyone else who knew him longer and better than I did.

Monday morning I came into work ready to wrap up a huge project months in the making, we are already very behind - approaching the go/no go date Wednesday at noon, and within 15 minutes of waking in and hearing the news, all I could think about was how much I don't care if we make it or not. It's bizarre for me to go from completely fine to physically ill so sudden and I fear/expect it will only get worse when the shock wears off.

My friend was one of the funniest guys in the office and though we hadn't been hanging out too often as of late, I can't help but want to cry or break something or yell until my throat is dry. This kid, and yes he was still in his 20's, had a gift for what we do and a very rare trait of wrapping it up with humility and helpfulness - always mentoring interns, even mentoring me when I came in still pretty green.

I'll never forget his humor or his ability to really bring everyone together and make them feel truly included. He had completely mastered most skills I one day hope to possess. I will miss running into him between meetings, at happy hours and more than that I will miss what he brought to the company and the people who got to work with him on a daily basis.

I feel especially guilty for this miserable outlook because it's not in line with how I remember him evaluating bad situations. Always the joker, I don't remember him ever getting actually flustered. I was taught to never speak bad about those that have passed but I honestly don't think I could if I tried - he was just a goofy, smart, down to earth guy and I will really miss seeing him around."
3mscou,13,2015-09-28,Motivational Monday – There’s not one route through life.,Niezo,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/3mscou/motivational_monday_theres_not_one_route_through/,"**Motivational Monday - there's not one route through life**

Hello everyone, you might have seen me around here or on /r/depression before. I’m a new mod here, I’ve been helping on “depressed” subreddits since the beginning of the summer.

So, as the title suggested, I figured I would post something that was important for me in my life. The realization that there is not one route through life.

Originally, I was doing a vocational degree, and I wanted to become a laborant. Later on, I originally wanted to study biochemistry.

However, for me, this went wrong. At an internship, my Autism held me back… and I was consequently sort of kicked out of college(Tl;Dr version: I did got a degree, but at a low level so I had nearly zero chance of getting any sort of job). Afterwards, my school told me that the best thing to do was to find a job, to help deal with my Autism. This advice was practically a joke because 1) it was in the deepest depths of the recession for my country back then and 2) what company would want you with a backstory like that?

At around the same time I realized that I wanted to study physics, a completely different field. However, my educational degrees were not good enough. But my mother heard something interesting; some sort of extra high school thingy that allowed you to “up” your education. I took it, and now, three years after the problem on my internship started, I’m doing an internship for my major in physics. Not just that, but I’m doing it overseas… at a big name university as well, and on a very well-known international project as well. In particle physics. And it’s going pretty well right now. All because my mother heard about this “extra high school thingy”.

So… long story short, sometimes life can get weird and difficult, but still work out. There are a lot of routes in life, and lots of possibilities you’ve never heard of.

Did you have any similar “weird route” through life? Please do share!

3msts4,3,2015-09-29,RP advice for landing an internship?,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3msts4/rp_advice_for_landing_an_internship/,"As a third-year college student, one of my goals right now is to find a summer internship. The degree that I'm currently pursuing is Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. 

Here at TRP, we are a no-bullshit group of people that discuss how the world actually works and how to navigate/fight our way through it. What is some RP advice for finding a summer internship? 

The only things that I have so far on my resume are my high school, university (currently attending), work experience at these crappy fast-food/manual labor gigs, *Toastmasters*, my experience as a section leader in my high school marching band and one collegiate honor society."
3msxe5,4,2015-09-29,My [21 F] relationship with my SO [21 M] of about 3 years is disapproved of by his parents.,xiaosoul1994,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3msxe5/my_21_f_relationship_with_my_so_21_m_of_about_3/,"We've been dating for 3 years and I have to say that we've never come across an actual argument like this before. Every issue we've had has been resolved in a night, so I just feel horrible about this.

I'll start from the beginning...

We were very happy going into his graduation. He graduated a year early from undergrad and his parents were coming from China to see his graduation ceremony (he's an international student from China while I'm Chinese American). I met his parents. We talked and I left for an internship in Taiwan for 2 months and he left with his parents to go traveling and then an internship in San Jose, CA. 

As I was interning in Taiwan, he messaged me saying his parents didn't like me since my skin didn't look healthy, I hunched, and I walk differently. They think these traits are in my genetics and don't want their grandchildren to have that unhealthiness. My SO tried for a month trying to convince them otherwise, but his health became worse...and every time he fought with his parents (who eventually returned to China..so fighting through webcamming) he felt more and more hopeless, so he messaged me saying we can't be together anymore. We broke up in July. 

After I got back to the US, I drove to San Jose from LA to see him and I stayed in his apartment for a month. In that time, we got back together and I managed to convince him to talk to stay with me because he told me it hurts to think we aren't dating anymore and leaving me is the hardest thing he'll ever do...so we got back together. He told me he has tried studying, sports, working, and even cmb to try to forget me but couldn't...so I knew he loves me still. 

Every time he talks to his parents though he feels weak and he comes to me saying he can't do it. He wants to take a break. I always end up comforting me and then he'll say he doesn't want to and he's sorry. This pattern continually happens...the stress is just too much for him to handle since he's hurting his mom and me. I love him and will comfort him and change my hunch and how I treat my skin, but I don't know what else to say to him that'll help him be happier!

For the last week, we've started school and we've just about had a huge talk everyday about not just his parents...him...he started to believe that it's impossible to change his parents' mind and I guess he's started to believe that my hunch and skin are ugly and...I'm flawed because of them...and maybe that's true...but I've been working on my hunch and my skin, trying to be a better girl. He just feels like giving up...and it kills me to see him so sad. He's told me that he doesn't want love (and he doesn't deserve it) from neither me nor his parents. He told me he wants space...I feel like I should give that to him...but he had so much space in the summer and he said so many mean things to me in that time where he had so much space, so I'm a little scared.

From today's latest talk, he said we could try and we agreed not to talk about this topic/taking a break for a month, but I'm scared I can't do anything since I really just don't know what to say to him...

Another promise that was made was that if I ask him to sleepover and he says no, I can't do anything about it. I am a clingy girlfriend, but I do love sleeping with him too...so it's kinda scary (but understandable and reasonable that he have his space as well). It's just...I feel bad about this whole thing...normally this kinda thing wouldn't bother me but in context with everything that has happened..it's more heightened my hurt feelings...

I'm really not sure how to TLDR this...I'll do my best.

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend's parents disapprove. Boyfriend confused what to do...hurting relationship (obviously). I'm not sure what to say to him."
3msyjm,0,2015-09-29,"31 y/o male. Inheritance probably coming in 10+years, GF wants to pursue a career that may take me from mine.",DZTheDiscoveryZone,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3msyjm/31_yo_male_inheritance_probably_coming_in_10years/,"Hey all. So I'm 31. I work a job right now that pays me 33k a year. I have a bachelors degree in piano performance and a masters in library science. I'm using neither degree for my current job, though I do find it fulfilling. There does not appear to be much in the way of upward mobility in my current job. 

I own a condominium that is mortgaged through my parents. As in, they paid cash for the place, and I am paying them a 30-year mortgage at an APR lower than what a bank would charge me for a 15-year. This is spelled out in a legal contract, and I bought it this past March. I have about $25000 total in savings+checking. My monthly payment for HOA/Mortgage/Property Tax/HO Insurance is about $800/month, and I have a tenant who pays me $510/month. This mortgage is also my only debt, as I was able to go to school on my parents' dime, and I own my 100,000 mile Camry outright. I owe about $65,000 on the mortgage.

My girlfriend is 9 years younger than me, and looking to start her career working in art galleries, after receiving a bachelors degree in art studies. She's had several quality internships, and will be working through January in a full-time-but-temporary entry-level position. 

I'm not particularly tied to my job or geographic location, but we've never been able to be together. I think that my relative stability would be a good base for us to live together for a few years, decide if this is actually a relationship that will go the distance, and plan our future moves from there. I also feel that, at my age, I'm a fairly good judge of whether a woman is in a relationship for the long run, and for what it's worth, I trust her when she says that she is planning to stick around. 

I want to say that I feel like a lot of what follows from here on out feels very cold, and that there is a lot of love in my family, but that the questions that will follow feel like the responsible things to be asking in terms of planning my next 5-10 years, and with the understanding that those years will affect the ones that follow.  

My mother makes extremely good money; around $200k a year, but my father has been pressuring her to retire soon. My father is 7 years younger, and aside from a brief stint in his 20s, has never worked full-time, and never topped 20k in income on his own. He's the one who stayed home with me and my sister, and now that both of us are long out of school, he wants to have more time with my mother, and feels that since both of them are in their 60s, it's time for them to enjoy their retirement. My estimate is that their assets are worth $2-3 million at the moment, and they have both been very generous with helping my sister and myself with big life payments, and plan to leave us both substantial inheritances. They live on less than ~60k a year, and a good portion of that expenditure is put into their properties (their home, a vacation home, two small rental properties, as well as my condo). Those properties account for roughly $1M of their net worth. They do have medical expenses, and I could foresee those increasing in the coming years. There is absolutely no enmity between any parties in my family: I get along very well with my sister, and my parents both get along very well with both of us. My sister is a hard worker who has her own finances under control, and I see no scenario in which we would turn against each other where the division of assets is concerned. None of the extended family is close enough or in need enough that I could foresee them leaving anything to anyone other than my sister and myself. 

Before this year, my planning had always been that I would simply try to live as independently and within my means as much as possible, and that any time my parents stepped in, (such as with my mortgage, a generous check at Christmas, or if they were to both pass and leave an inheritance) that the extra money would just be gravy. The current situation with my girlfriend, however, has me reconsidering my own finances. I feel that she has greater ambitions than I do, and that I would be happy to move into a role as the secondary income. We have not discussed marriage, but have both expressed a wish to remain childless, which I feel frees us up a lot financially, though of course that is a scenario that could potentially change over the next 15 years, given her young age. The plan, as it currently stands, is that she will spend the next year with me, the following year either in school or also with me, and then she will look for full-time jobs in earnest. 

My questions are as follows:

1) Am I crazy to consider moving and selling my condo a mere 3 1/2 years after purchasing it? I know that 5 years is typically seen as the minimum amount of time before you sell a property. If the property holds its value and I'm able to sell at a break-even price, will I still be in the black compared to renting, even after realtor commissions?

2) Am I delusional to, even in some small part, be ""counting on"" an inheritance from my parents, and for trusting that any financial missteps I make now would be covered over by that windfall?

3) I understand that the field that my girlfriend is interested in can be difficult to break into, and that even if she is on a successful track, we may not be making very much for the foreseeable future. Is there a point where I should tell her that we are not leaving my current job and location unless she's making at least $X in order to support both of us? Because we've been apart for our entire relationship, I do feel comfortable in letting her move ""ahead of me"" and following her 6 months or so later once we're sure that she's at least a bit established. 

4) I realize that a lot of this is going to come down to how much I trust my relationships (with my girlfriend, with my parents, with my sister), but in general, how would you all reccomend I proceed from here?"

3mt5cr,0,2015-09-29,[28/M] Unrequited love at work has turned into a nightmare. Help.,Quarter_Lifer,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3mt5cr/28m_unrequited_love_at_work_has_turned_into_a/,"Yeah...I've shat where I work. Much more than being smothered in it, it's caused me a world of hurt, and might cost me years of blood, sweat and tears if I don't come to peace with this.

I work for a small company (with a staff just shy of two-dozen), and have been here for the better part of the last two years. Went from an unpaid intern to P/T and just recently, F/T employee. Early on I became acquainted with a co-worker who also was an intern-turned-employee (albeit a year before my arrival). Off the hump I thought she was cute, but didn't pursue as I was a newbie and, at the time unemployed and broke.

Sometime around last November/December I started taking time to chat with her, and found that we shared a lot in common (same alma mater, similar low-income, second generation backgrounds). We vibed really well at our holiday party, yet I caught myself in the midst of my new-found infatuation...I didn't want to make things awkward at work, nor get burned if things didn't go well. Hindsight sure sucks. :/

We gradually grew closer over the next couple of months, chatting, taking lunches, opening up to each other. I of course grew more and more infatuated with her, but played it cool and let things occur organically. Once I felt we were on the same page (which also coincided w/my balls dropping), I asked her out on a date. She agreed, pointing out that she hadn't dated in awhile and had ""given up on dating"" some time ago, yet wouldn't mind going out with ol' Quarter_Lifer (the only instance in which I'll speak in the third-person, honest).

When we stepped out for dinner several weeks later it was...magical. Laughing, joking, flirting...good vibes all around. We subtly confessed our feelings for each other during an after-dinner walk so I figured it was finally time to make a move...so I grabbed her hand. She didn't react well to it, and I felt her demeanor, and the vibe of the date overall, go downhill after this. Damn.

Two days later, she got back to me via text explaining that she, as much as she would've liked, did not share the same feelings that I did, and that she couldn't explain why. I accepted her apology and assured her that things will be cool at work, but was devastated and beside myself.

All the advice I'd received from friends, family and strangers alike pointed towards this friendship being over, with no-contact being the best solution. Still, like a lovesick fool, I futilely spent the next couple of months trying to get back to where we were before that date, but the texts have gradually become intermittent, the convos shorter and her demeanor more distant. We no longer communicate outside of work-related stuff and the occasional hallway greeting. While it helps that we're on different floors all this time, I've still felt miserable both in and out of work.

While I'm not too surprised that it's ended in this manner, what's given me the most grief is the feeling that she's moved on to another co-worker/mutual friend at our company, who works in her department/floor as her. She talks, jokes and sneaks out for lunch with him much like she used to with me, and he's openly expressed interest in her in the past. The thought of being faded with little to no explanation, and in favor of another guy in the same workplace...has robbed me of my happiness.

So yeah, this is where I'm at now. While it's far from the perfect workplace, this company has done so much for my career, and will continue to do so if I stick to my guns and bolster my skill-set. But I've jeopardized all this by losing my head (as well as my happiness and self-respect) over a woman who ultimately wasn't feeling me.

Any advice as to how to reconcile all of this, forgive myself and move on? Or will I have to quit my job to achieve this? Thanks."

3muhw4,1,2015-09-29,My mom and I might lose our house? idk what to do (super long story inside),yungbutthole,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3muhw4/my_mom_and_i_might_lose_our_house_idk_what_to_do/,"tldr; my mom got let go from her job, again, and we may not be able to keep our house.

i don't really know what to do. my mom just called me saying that the bank wants to foreclose on our house. this isn't the first time and usually we can overcome it due to talking to the mortgage company about our hardships and delaying payments or whatever, but i don't know about this time. 

since 2012, it's been really rocky after she went through a bout of domestic abuse,alcoholism, being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and everything just kind of fell to shit since then. she lost her well paying job. she started drinking. my step dad beat the SHIT out of her on a constant basis. you know the rest. she stopped being able to make payments for a while. the bank wanted our house. she dumped the asshole. i forgot what happened (probably a divine intervention from god) but we were able to keep it for the good part of 2013. everything wasn't as good it HAD been but it was ok enough for the house not to be taken. i was bouncing around sleeping on friends couches and eating in the dark at my home because my mother was either drunk off her ass or my stepdad would whisk her away to pennslyvania where she wouldn't come back for a week at a time. mind you, i was in high school so this shit was wild af to me.

fast forward to later 2013, my mom gets a job through a temp agency, aw yeah! i graduate hs! we're safe for a little bit. the asshole dies and leaves my mom some money (because even though he beat the shit out of her, he still loved her i guess), and we are able to stay afloat for some time. the beginning part of 2014, i think, my mom lost her new job. i go off to college and get a scholarship to a school i hate but can afford through financial aid! it's okay right? she'll find a new job? we have some money to keep us afloat for a little bit? fast forward to the later part of 2014? (my timeline may be off a little but essentially this is how it went) the money ran out at some point. but my mom gets another job through the temp agency and manages to keep it for like 6 months! woo hoo! i get a cool internship at disney! i move away to florida in jan of 2015 for a little bit and all is well as it can be. well the place she was at decided to terminate her position and fill it with something else? i really dont know how it worked?? that was in march (or sometime around then) and it's been shit for a while. 

she's desperate as hell. i don't know what to do? i want to start a crowdfunding thing but fuck i don't know how any of this shit works. i want my mom to be happy and not worry about her damn house that she worked her ASS off to get and move our ass out the ghetto. she's a single mom so shit has been hard on her ever since. i wish i could do something ANYTHING. i would even start stripping and twerking that ass for money (comic relief? i tried?). i just want her to be okay. i'll just pray about it and hope shit comes through."
3mupmq,2310,2015-09-29,Parents Don't Help You at Work,PhantomSorano,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/3mupmq/parents_dont_help_you_at_work/,"Hello everyone. Here is the story of how I will most likely lose my job. Intrigued?

Background: I work as, amongst other things, as an art gallery assistant. We hang shows and sell artwork; it is similar to retail in many ways. Lots of work, long hours, and people that make you question humanity and its knowledge.

This weekend I had the job of taking down an art show. My boss is gone for the next few weeks, so I've been in charge. Stressful doesn't being to cover it. I rent the company van and pick up our interns who are college students looking to gain exp. in the field. One is trained and the new one, let's call him Bob, is not. Bob is not there. On the way to work he sends a text saying his family is in town and he is not coming in. I'm not happy. My boss is expecting me to have all this work done, and I need Bob because he is the only muscle we have. I tell him to come by after he is done eating with his parents if he can. Bob says okay.

Fast forward to being at work. The other intern and I are beginning our shift, seeing what pieces didn't sell and those that did. Bob sends another message saying that he is outside. Bob then comes in with his girlfriend and ENTIRE family. His mother then begins to yell at me.

Mom: ""How dare you make my son come into work today when we are in town?! This is the only day we can see him and you are ruining our brunch!!!""

Me: *baffled* ""Well...ma'am...your son has known that he has had to work today for two weeks. I saw him two days ago and confirmed that he would be here. If you want, you guys can go out to eat and drop him off here later. I can take him back to his dorm.""

Mom: ""No! No! Forget it! We are already here! We're gonna help him so he can leave early!""

Me: ""Umm...your son is already late for his shift, but I can have him out of here by 2:00. Unfortunately, I cannot use your help. You are welcome to look around or go explore downtown until it gets closer to 2:00.""

Mom: ""FINE!""

I then went back to getting Bob started. The father stops me to ask an absurd question, which I answer in my best retail voice when I hear Bob calling for me. He is confused on how to get a screw out of the wall...with a hammer. Bless his heart. I take Bob to our storeroom where we have....wait for it....a drill. I am explaining how to drill works when I hear a loud CRASH.

I run out to find Bob's irate mother standing there with a broken sculpture all over the floor. I now know what fear and angry feels like when combined in a perfect storm. 

Me: *shaking in rage while giving a Meryl Streep performance of retail smiles* ""What are you doing with the art?!""

Mom: *cannot even see death in front of her* ""I'm helping my son so he can leave early.""

Me: ""You are not allowed to handle the art. I can handle it because that's my job and I have been trained. Intern has been trained. Today I was going to train your son. Not you. Not your husband or daughter or Bob's girlfriend, but Bob. You have no right to be handling a piece.""

The guard is located and a report is filed out. The parents keep getting in my face and asking me questions until I have to leave and call my boss to report what has happened. Boss is not happy and as shocked as me. Tells me to send Bob and Company away.

I return to Bob and his entourage and tell them to please leave. The father spends 20 minutes arguing with me. 

Dad: ""What makes you qualified? You're just a kid. Will my son get in trouble? Will we have to pay for it? It said NFS, so it's like free right? How much does it cost? 20 bucks? 100?""

Me: ""I have held this job for over two years, and I have never damaged a piece or had one of the interns damage one. I don't know what will happen regarding your son's position or payment for the broken art. NFS means not for sale. That piece is easily worth $6000. It is generally understood that interns don't bring their parents to work nor do pedestrians touch artwork.""

Dad: ""Oh well, haha! Accidents happen!""

Me: ""Not on my watch they don't. I don't break art, and my interns don't break art. Your wife did, however, because she had no business touching the work. I have spoken with my supervisor and she has said that you all and Bob should leave.""

The family then left, the mother hiding behind a column and glaring at me the entire time. The rest of the day was full of panic and tears on my behalf. I will most likely loose my job. Sorry for the long post, and thanks for reading the woes of the gallery assistant. 

EDIT: I was not the one who let Bob and Co in, but the security guard who was at the door playing on his phone.

EDIT 2: tl;dr Boss left me in charge of training new employee. Employee brought entire family to his work. Idiot mother broke an expensive sculpture. Awaiting my fate...

UPDATE: Hey everyone. It seems my update reply has been lost in the comments. A few users have requested an update, so here I am. First, thanks for all your comments, both positive and negative. Reading them has really helped. During a staff meeting a few days ago (when boss returned), Boss spoke with me and Bob. Bob was told he had a strike against him for being late to his shift and was dismissed. Afterwards, Boss spent roughly twenty minutes lecturing me how parents should always trump work, and how it is not Bob's fault but mine since this is his first job and not mine. I made it very clear that I had given Bob and his parents the option to go; Bob's mom acted on her own and looking back there was little I could do to stop it. Nowhere have I ever been allowed to miss a shift for wanting to hang out with my family-especially last minute. I politely said this, and that how in many other jobs, this type of mindset and behavior would result in termination. Boss said its better to agree than disagree. My job is still intact; I have been at my assistant position longer than any of my bosses, so I am an asset. The artist will get compensated by the gallery insurance."
3mv3od,3,2015-09-29,Office Women Part 9: Intern Courtney,Scast716585,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/3mv3od/office_women_part_9_intern_courtney/,"Spring is a wonderful time of year, the weather gets warmer, the women start wearing less clothing and the summer interns start as soon as college finishes. I was particularly happy about the start of the summer interns this year as I interviewed them over Christmas break and selected two of them that seemed very competent and were attractive. I did interview over ten candidates but let me be honest if I have two equally qualified candidates I am going to pick the attractive woman every time. This year I selected Courtney and Yan, two rising seniors from the local State University. 

Their start snuck up on me as once they are selected they go through the HR department to get things straightened away for their start of work, so when they showed up this past Monday I was surprised but in a good way as we were very busy and could use the help and I was definitely reminded why I hired them when I saw them. Courtney is tall about 5-10 and thin, she has long straight brunette hair, big brown eyes, full pouty lips, long sexy legs, a thin waist with a nice little ass and I would guess about B sized tits. She was wearing tight black pants, black high heel shoes and a pink dress shirt that she had unbuttoned down about three buttons so as to show her bare chest. She wore a long gold chain with a cross on the end that sat right in her cleavage. Even though her tits are not big I love to look at them as she moves through the office. She wears very sheer bra’s that do not give her support so her tits are free to sway and jiggle with every movement. Yan is about 5-4 and is from China. Her English is not the best but she is at the top of her class and seems to be a very bright girl. She is also very cute. I do admit to getting turned on by Asian girls and Yan is my ideal. Very cute face, long black hair and a small firm body but with C to D size breasts that look very firm. She was wearing a tight navy blue skirt and a white dress shirt and matching navy blue jacket. Very conservative and professional looking but her body is so small and tight she looked good. 

“So ladies, things are really busy here right now and we will need your help. I am Steve the supervisor for this department, I hope you remember meeting me at your interviews,  and I am looking forward to working with both of you over the summer” I said introducing myself and suppressing the thoughts running through my mind about how I think they are both hot. “Please see Tina, my assistant and she will show you to your desks and introduce you to the rest of the department and will get you started with work.” I added, “And Tina, book the two of them on my calendar for lunch on Thursday, that will give us a few days to see how things are going.” They both seemed totally overwhelmed and confused, like any other intern. 

The next few days were business as normal. The two new interns seemed to be fitting in and I had heard good things about them from the other people in the department that they were hard working and bright. They were professional in appearance and in their behavior so everything seemed to be going well. It was my usual week for me too, I had my Tuesday lunch with Tina, which was the usual blowjob/titty fuck, pussy eating and fucking that we do in an hour. She loves it and is quite fun so I am always willing to oblige and on Wednesday I helped Angela with some more “filing” which was allot of fun, she practiced her deep throating skills and we had a nice fuck to finish me off. Now it was Thursday so I knew I would be having lunch with Courtney and Yan which I thought would be fun, I did not expect any sex with them, not that I did not want too but I had hardly gotten to know them and I had no idea if they had boyfriends or what their situation was. I had meetings all morning with accounting, which I used to dread, but the meetings were with Sue and Kim so we joked around allot and had a good time. We were booked into a conference room with a full glass wall so there was nothing more than talk happening and Kim told me she really needed to see me again because it had been more than a month since we were last together and that her husband was going out of town next week for work so she wanted to plan an evening together. I was all for that anytime as I enjoy being with her as much as any woman. 

When our meeting finished I went to my office and it was lunch time. The two girls were waiting for me at my office. I was glad to see them, especially Courtney, She was wearing a short blue plaid skirt, bare legs, heels and a white button down shirt that only had the bottom couple of buttons done because she was wearing a pink tank top underneath. I doubt she had a bra on because I could see her nipples pressing through the tank top. Her legs are amazing, they are long and thin not skinny but shapely and fit. She looked like a naughty schoolgirl but at the same time cute and innocent enough to pull it off in the office. Yan was dressed as she always was in a skirt, matching jacket and a white blouse, very conservative. “So Steve you ready for lunch we have been looking forward to this all week?” Courtney asked. 

“Yes, let’s get going I will drive, we have a lunch reservation at my country club, you ladies OK with that?” I asked. 

“Yes boss whatever you like” Courtney replied and Yan nodded. I what I really thought was that I would really like was to bend Courtney over my desk and have my way with her. 

We drove to the Club and Courtney hopped into the front seat next to me, I tried not to stare at her legs as I drove because I knew I would get ridiculously hard so I tried to focus on the road and snuck a peak here and there, trying not to think about her made me think about her and I still got hard on the drive there. Courtney is one of those girls that is real easy to talk to and she carried the conversation for the three of us on the way to lunch. We were seated at a back corner table and we ordered lunch and drinks, no alcohol as both of them are below 21 and I had to work the rest of the day. After our salads Yan excused herself to go to the ladies room and Courtney was glad to have me alone. 

“So do you know that I know Katie from School, she was a senior and I was a freshman when I joined Tri-Delt and she was my big sister in the sorority?” She asked.

“I had no idea you knew anyone at the company” I replied. Wondering to myself how well they knew each other still, because I got to know “Cock Sucking Katie” quite well that one night late in the office. Man she could suck cock and was a hot little fuck. 

Courtney then leaned into me and whispered to me “I can’t suck cock like Katie but I really like to fuck, and I hear that you have something I would really enjoy. Do you want to fuck my sweet young pussy Steve” she said as she spread her legs in her chair and lifted her skirt to reveal her bare pussy. “I don’t like underwear it just gets in the way” she said as she pulled down her skirt. “I see you like my pussy” she said looking down at to big bulge in my pants. 

I did not have any time to reply as Yan returned from the Ladies room and sat back down and the waitress brought our lunch. “So Yan do you have a boyfriend?” Courtney asked. 

“No, No boyfriend, do you” she replied to Courtney. 

“No I do not, I don’t like to be tied down, well I mean committed, tied down is OK” Courtney replied. Yan not understanding the innuendo, but I sure got it. “It is hard to believe you don’t have a boyfriend Yan you are so pretty. I bet any guy would like to go out with you” Courtney kept on. “Have you had many boyfriends since you came to school here” She asked

“No, no just a few but the Chinese guys here act like jerks most of time” Yan answered, starting to open up “They don’t treat girls good all about what they want”

“Have you ever dated an American man” Courtney asked, “You should try that besides I hear Chinese men are very small, you should try a big American man” 

Yan looked at Courtney very confused and Courtney whispered in her ear and Yan giggled. “Yes very, very small” 

The rest of lunch was fun Courtney got Yan to open up more and she also slid her foot out of her shoe and rubbed her foot against my hard cock under the tablecloth. We finished lunch and headed back to work, Courtney sat next to me again, this time I did not hesitate staring at her legs and she had her skirt hiked up farther so her ass and pussy were barely covered. As we pulled into the office Courtney spoke up “Steve I forget that I wanted to stop at the bank you mind giving me a ride, you can drop Yan here and run me there I am sure it will only take a minute” 

“No problem, glad to give you a quick ride” I replied. We dropped Yan at the office and I sped out of the parking lot, reaching one hand over to Courtney and placing it on her pussy. She was dripping wet and I started rubbing her clit. I pulled around the vacant building next door to our office and hopped out of the car. Courtney met me on the side of the car, I picked her up and set her on the hood and spread her legs wide. I dove face first into her sweet little pussy licking up her juices. “Oh god, get that big cock of yours out and fuck me will you” she demanded. I complied and stepped back from her and undid my pants dropping them and my underwear to my knees, releasing my huge cock. I don’t think I could ever be any harder than I was, the teasing through lunch was driving me mad and I needed to stuff her pussy with my throbbing cock. “Oh fuck that is big, Katie said it was huge but I never thought it would be that thick, stick it in me come on stick it in” Courtney pleaded. I did as I was told and took my cock and lined it up to her pussy at first just rubbing the head of my dick against her hole and then slowly sliding it in. This girl liked to fuck but she was still young and oh so tight. “Oh yes give it to me” she begged and I slid it all the way in, she was so tight I could feel her stretching around my shaft finally accepting my cock. “Fuck me , fuck me I want your hot cum inside of me, fuck me’ she moaned as I increased my pace. “Cum in me, cum in me, cum in me, fuck that pussy oh yeah fuck that pussy” she repeated over and over. I pulled her bare tits out from under her tank top and sucked on her tiny perky pink nipples and then I grabbed that sweet little ass of hers and started to really thrust hard into her making her scream, she wrapped those long sexy legs around me knowing that she would not release me until I gave her what she wanted a big load of my hot cum. I could feel her pussy intensify its already tight grip on my cock as she tensed and came this was more than I could handle and with one last deep thrust I gave her load she was begging for. I never felt more cum shoot from my balls and I filled her tight sweet little pussy. “Oh god that is what I needed, I love your cock” she said as she squeezed me tight with my dick still buried inside of her. I kissed her deeply while still inside of her and groped her ass and tits until my dick softened some. “We should be getting back” I offered. I pulled up my pants and she straightened her skirt and tucked her tits back into her top and drove back to the office. 

That afternoon I stayed busy at work, I did notice that some of the other guys kept on stopping by Courtney’s desk to talk to her, word must have spread through the building of how hot she looked today in her little skirt. At one point I received a text form Courtney and it was a picture taken from her desk up her skirt with her legs spread showing her sweet little pussy and some of my cum dripping from her. The text read “Thinking of you” I replied to her “I need to fuck you again, can you stay late tonight???” She replied with a smiley face I was hoping that meant a yes. I needed to give her young pussy more attention and the thought of her had me rock hard. 

I kept hard at work the rest of the day trying to focus on what I needed to do and not to just think about Courtney. She knew she had me wanting her because she as teasing me all afternoon. She would walk by my door and would wiggle her ass as she walked by she also made a point of standing at Tina’s desk outside of my door in full view, looking over Tina’s shoulder and bending over so her ass and pussy were barely covered. She stood like that for about 5 minutes swaying back and forth talking to Tina about something on her computer. I wanted to walk out into the middle of the office and fuck her right there. 

It was finally 5:00 and everyone in my department was gone, I could not see Courtney and I was hoping she did not leave. I stood up and walked towards my door and met her in the doorway. “I hope you don’t mind but my contacts were bothering me so I went and put on my glasses” she said standing in front of me now wearing black plastic framed glasses. 

“No not at all, I think that you look very sexy with them on” I replied, and she did the glasses added to the slutty schoolgirl look and I am sure she knew that. 

“Well Steve what are you going to do now with that big cock of yours, you want to put it in my young little pussy don’t you? I know you do, you want to fuck me hard I can tell” She spoke as she walked forward into my office pushing me back into the room. I quickly shut the door without saying a word and grabbed her around the waist pulled her tight and kissed her deeply. I pulled her shirt and tank top up over head and off to expose her small soft supple tits with her perky little pink nipples. She pulled off my shirt and it felt great to have her soft naked skin against my chest. We continued to kiss and as I fondled her tits and ass she groped at my pants feverishly trying to get my belt undone and my pants off. She wanted my cock out and she couldn’t wait. She finally got my dick out and it was fully hard she began stroking me as I slid my hand up under her ass and stuck two fingers in her pussy. It was easy for me to grab her being so tall and with her heels on she was only an inch or two shorter than me. She squealed as I penetrated her with my fingers totally taking her by surprise as we were kissing. What surprised her more was when I pressed my thumb into her incredibly tight little ass hole. “Oh fuck” she yelled as I slid it in deeper. I could see a tear roll down her cheek as I thumb fucked her ass. 

“You OK?” I asked but not stopping what I was doing. “Yes” she replied “I have just never had anything stuck in there before, but don’t stop I think you are going to make me cum” I kept up for just a moment longer fucking both of her holes and she grabbed me tight with both arms and squeezed me as she came. Her whole body shook and then finally totally relaxed her head resting on my shoulder. My throbbing cock pressed against her stomach, I needed some relief I had to fuck her again. I turned Courtney around and bent her over my desk and flipper her skirt up over her ass. Shit the looked hot like this in her heels and her long thin shapely legs that went on forever up to her firm little ass and her pink pussy swollen and dripping in front of me. I leaned over behind her kissing her neck and grabbing her breasts this moved my cock up under her and rubbed against her clit. She pushed her ass against me. I moved down her back kissing her every inch along the way, kissing her all the way down her ass cheek and one of her long sexy legs. I worked my way back up to her ass and moved my tongue onto her inviting pussy, she moaned in ecstasy. I worked my tongue in her pussy and rubbed her clit burying my face in her little ass. She swayed back and forth and moaned with every lick and touch. I knew she could not take much more and she leaned back into me and came all over my chin. 

“I am going to fuck you now, like you have never been fucked before” I told her, knowing how big and hard my cock was and also having cum earlier I knew I would last longer. “Yes please fuck me” she replied. I slowly slid my huge cock into her pussy, she was so wet now it was easier than before but she still stretched tight around my girth. I started taking it slow on her, I wanted this feeling to last a long time and she did feel great. I held it all the way in so my balls pressed against her clit and slowly slid it out so just the tip was still in her. It was a great view watching my cock slowly slide in and out of her tight pussy. “Rub your clit” I demanded and she obliged. I slowly increased my thrusting which was now at a slow steady pace. Her tight cunt wrapped around my cock she was so wet but yet still so tight. I could hear her cross and chain swinging into the desk with every thrust as I gripped her narrow hips and drove into her harder so that you could hear me slapping into her. She released her hand from her clit as she came one more time. I never slowed in my fucking, I wanted to make her cum so many times until she was exhausted and totally spent. I slid my hand over to the middle of her ass, never slowing, and pressed my thumb onto her ass hole making her jump up against me as I slid it all of the way in. “Oh FUCK!!” she yelled over and over as I fucked her ass with my thumb and rammed her pussy with my cock. After a couple of minutes she yelled “Make me cum, make me cum!!!” over and over until she let out a very loud scream and came again shaking violently. I pulled out of her, turned her around, picked her up, sat her on the desk, spread her legs wide pushing down on them so she was bent in half with her feet up past her head. Her swollen dripping pink pussy staring in front of me. I lined up my dick and pressed it deep inside of her making her let out another scream. “Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me…” she kept saying over and over our eyes locked together as I drilled her with my throbbing cock. I repeatedly slapped hard against her pushing my long hard cock as deep as it could go. She took one hand and started rubbing her clit again, making her almost instantly cum again. I kept up thrusting deep into her, she still tight and slippery I kept going for at least another 5 minutes until I could start to feel the cum swelling up from my balls. I pulled out of her and stroked my cock, “On your knees” I demanded and she quickly slid off of the desk and was kneeling in front of my cock, a couple more strokes and I exploded all over her face, glasses, mouth and chest. She eagerly licked my cock clean and wiped my cum from her face, glasses and chest with her finger and licked and swallowed it all. 

I pulled her up and held her tight against me, she was limp from exhaustion. I kissed her deeply not minding my cum on her lip, and held her ass and one breast as we continued to kiss. “That was incredible, I have never had a cock like that and I have never been fucked like that. When can we do that again? I know you fuck other women around here but I will do anything to have you again.” Courtney asked as she fell back into my desk chair. Her skirt still flipped up exposing her overworked pussy. 

“Don’t worry we will do this again, you are way too sexy not to. I will tell you the day before and you wear a skirt that day and I will fuck you at some point during the day.” I told her. She did not know that I had the same understanding with Sue and Tina that whenever they had a dress or skirt on it meant we were going to fuck at some point during the day. 

As Courtney dressed she told me that she was going to have dinner at Yan’s place tonight and that she was going to help her love life out. I could only imagine what she meant by that. As I stood there looking at her holding her blouse,  wearing that little skirt and  just the tank top I wanted her so bad. She is so sexy with her long legs and perky nipples protruding through her top I did not want her to leave. She kissed me gently and walked out the door, I stared at her perfect legs and ass as she walked away and I wondered more about how she was going to help Yan.

What's the best option for me to grow my savings? My housing/food expenses will be taken care of until I graduate in 2018 so 90% of the money I make until then will be put away. I have an additional 12 months

3mw77x,4,2015-09-29,"A question for JonTron, accompanied by a wall of text explaining the reasonings for asking as such.",BrotherGrim428,JonTron,https://www.reddit.com/r/JonTron/comments/3mw77x/a_question_for_jontron_accompanied_by_a_wall_of/,"I absolutely loved the latest StarCade JonTron, as many of us did. Most definitely the best and funniest of the five! but I have a question.

Did you not consider the 2001 released game [Star Wars: Obi-Wan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Obi-Wan) for the Xbox, a Phantom Menace game? It was a very thrilling and whimsical experience for myself. *as a child*. 

Of course, if child me thought [this blurry picture was an okay representation of Yoda](http://i.imgur.com/zJFchDp.png), then obviously I wasn't aware of how ""*stunning*"" these visuals are.

But still, (in my opinion) it was the best thing since the Pod Racing game for the n64 to come out of the Phantom Menace. 

So, a bit of backstory to it, and a brief look at the game's assets.

First of all, The game doesn't directly follow the movie itself, but is a prequel to it.

---

It has held mixed reviews from multiple sources, gaining a 5.9/10 from IGN, but ranging from 4-to-8.8/10 overall. Most of its hatred came from the fact that it was part of the dumpster trilogy that is the prequels, but other than that, it's a solid game on it's own. 

The game has some very open, and empty levels. While there's some neat and funny details, most of the boards feel uninspired. It's very easily possible to get lost or lose your bearings, while some of them are so short.

----

It actually plays a lot better than you'd expect. In the game, you're playing as a Jedi, specifically discount pre-cool Obi-Wan, and the force feels very flowing and fun to use. 

Whether you're throwing people around using force push, or throwing your lightsaber at hordes of enemies using force throw-your-thing-at-guys, it's very fun to use. Especially how you can move certain environment pieces. And the multiplayer is very fun after you unlock all the characters, because the combat in this game is very fun. It very well holds up, and is definitely the best feature of the game.

 **If** you can get the hang of it. 

Because for a lot of people, the game is pretty clunky for your first time playing, as movement itself feels awkward, and is very loose. Very much the reason why that the game has mixed reviews, and can be a serious turn off. 

But...

----

...By **far**, the movement isn't the worst thing in this game, no. it has some of the worst, absolutely horrid and awful voice acting of any game ever, let alone Star Wars. Obi-Wan sounds like (the best way I can describe it) someone doing a very, very poor Christopher Walken impression whilst congested. and the droids sound like some intern talking through a fan. One of the many reasons why I felt excited for you to cover this game, because holy hell, it's like they didn't even attempt at doing any of the voices. And this is a licenced game, from Lucas Arts even! Someone looked at it, and said ""hmmm that's exactly how he sounds, SHIP IT RIGHT AWAY!"" You'll have to check it out for yourself to get the full effect. 

And to top it all off, the game has a very confusing development cycle! Which is always great.

---

The reason why I included all this information is so the game will seem more worth your time, while also mentioning some key reasonings as to why I was moderately upset when not seeing it in the latest. 

So, if this game isn't worthy of being part of the Phantom Menace episode, when also do you expect you'll cover it (if at all)? I feel like this game could be very well some comedy gold, as well as a decent review to a mixed results game. And that's what usually makes an episode stand out more, when the game isn't thought of as widely good or bad, so it is more of a personal review!

And if Jon doesn't feel like replying, then like, what're you guys' thoughts on him doing a review on this game? And do any of you have any experiences with it to add to this wall of text?

3mw9cw,6,2015-09-29,STEM Career Fair - What should I do?,TawyerSom,UCONN,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCONN/comments/3mw9cw/stem_career_fair_what_should_i_do/,"I am a Freshman studying Electrical Engineering, and I was considering going to the STEM Career Fair to get a feel for it/perhaps get an internship. I've already had an internship I got through an online application and then an interview process, but I would love to have something more relevant to my degree.

The catch is, however, that I only have about 45 minutes in the middle of the day to go due to classes (and I can't skip them either - I'm stuck between a midterm and a discussion block). Furthermore, I haven't really done the research to prepare a spiel for each of the companies I'm interested in, as I've been pretty busy the past few weeks. Adjusting to college is tough, man.

In any case, what can I do to make the most of my limited time there? Do I have to be at a career fair to snag a great internship as a freshman, or can I do it through the online process like before (with follow-up, of course). Are there later career fairs in the year that could help me get an internship?

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated."

What I really want to do is oil and gas research at a firm like Schlumbarger or something similar. I've gone ahead and applied to a bunch of internships in mining for the summer of 2016, I've also looked to transfer to another program for a semester or two. 

I've also looked at taking a year off to do something in the field itself like a rig or refinery, but I don't know if that will help as I'd be labor rather than working in actual geology. 

What else should I be doing to try and break into oil and gas?

I've grown so much as a person in the last couple of years, or so my mom says. I've lost so much weight, I've had a couple of internships and I'm feeling great about my abilities and my outlook to find a job after I graduate.

But there's always this one issue that always hangs over my head. It's a brick wall that I'm always trying to tear down. It's social interaction, especially with girls. I'm so out of touch with people of my generation and I don't feel like I have any similarities with people my age. 

I grew up pretty much isolated and it's been so, so hard to break out of my shell. I still haven't done it. I don't have people in my life whom you would call ""friends"", just ""acquaintances."" When I go home at night, I just have myself and my hobbies. 

I've never had any success with girls. It seems like I try too hard or not try at all. How can I find a medium? It just sucks seeing all your friends having it so easy and girls are just fellow human beings to them, when to me they're like a different species when I develop an interest in them. I just want to find someone because I'm so sick of being lonely

I'm so scared that I'm going to wake up one day and be 35 years old and have nothing but a one-bedroom apartment with a dog with no girlfriend and no friends in my life. 

My biggest problem is my laughable lack of self-awareness. I often do things when trying to interact with people and I have a hard time getting what their perceptions of me are. I feel like I do things without realizing that make people figure that I'm not worth being around. I mean nothing but well and it sucks. 

What really sets me off is when people like my mom so badly miss the root cause of my problems. My mom thinks I don't push myself enough. The hell I don't. The problem is I try too hard. I can't find a medium. She thinks I set unrealistic goals when it comes to making friends and talking to girls. Little does she realize that it's not like that anymore.

My mom keeps telling me to think about the great things I've accomplished at college, but it's just that this issue is so important to me that thinking about these positives is only a distraction. It's hard to stay positive when you try so hard and fail so much to do the things you desperately want to accomplish.

The worst is when somebody says ""don't worry about it. It's going to happen. Just give it time."" Pretty much every person who has everything figured out gives out this advice. They never understand how lost the people they're giving this empty advice to are. 

They say I've grown so much, but what has really changed? I still feel the same and my problems are the same.

It just really sucks that I still can't really convey all the things that are part of my problems, no matter how much I can write in this post.

I'm going to keep trying. What do I have to lose? I'm going to stay strong because I have everything to gain. But it's so hard and I'm trying to go into uncharted territory."
3mz118,16,2015-09-30,Leaving engineering.... feeling torn.,KestrelLowing,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/3mz118/leaving_engineering_feeling_torn/,"So I think this is almost going to be more of an 'off my chest' post, but I guess I'm looking for solidarity or something.

I've been on the engineering career path since I was 10 years old. 

I started FIRST LEGO League when I was 10, loved it, and immediately decided I wanted to be an engineer.  FLL was a fantastic experience.  I was one of 8 girls on a team, and we did really, really well - at one point we got 3rd place overall in the world.  Like, we were freaking good (granted, this was in 2003 or so - I'm sure now the competition is harder).  And everyone was super enthused about us in particular because we were a team made of all girls.

I loved it.  Working to figure out the problems, using the relatively limited resources you got in order to solve the problem as best you could, working with my team, learning to program, etc.  It was fantastic.

Throughout high school I was in a FIRST Robotics team (basically the 'grown up' version of FLL) and I enjoyed it.  Not as much as FLL, but I still had fun.  I also took as many science and math classes as I could.  I ended up taking the equivalent of 5 years of science and 5 years of math because I liked it so much.  Everyone knew I was going to be an engineer.

In college, I was a mechanical engineering major and enjoyed the vast majority of my classes.  There were some I really didn't like (fluid dynamics, I'm looking at you!) but overall, it was good.  I liked learning about all the ways that stuff interacts and how you can predict it all.  

During college, I had two years’ worth of internships at 3 different companies.  I hated all of my internships.  Like, detested to the point where I dreaded going into work.  It was incredibly boring; no one was doing anything new.

And now I'm here.  Working the exact job I actually did my career speech about in 6th grade - an R&amp;D mechanical engineer in new product development for a medical company.  And I hate it.

I hate it just as much as I do all my internships.  I've been here for a few months over a year, and I pretty much dread going in every day.  And I'm thinking about all the work experiences I've had and all the ones I might have and I cannot think of one I would actually enjoy in engineering.  

I tried academia for a bit, but basically ran into the same problem.  The work never interested me, and forcing yourself through sheer willpower to get through a masters degree is just not doable for me.

And so now I think I'm going to leave engineering.  Objectively I know it's the best thing because I dread waking up in the morning having to go to work.  Yesterday I actually dreaded it so much I actually made myself sick.

Instead, I'm thinking about going into teaching - high school math or science.  Throughout school I tutored and I did some TAing and that was easily the thing I was most excited about.  I like explaining things to people.  I've always done it.  I always taught my stuffed animals how to do my homework, etc.  I was pretty much always put into the ""learn this real quick and then teach everyone else"" roll on every team I've been on as I think that's one of my strengths - working through a tough problem, seeing where people probably will get caught up on it, and smoothing it over to make it more understandable.

But there's this horrible sinking feeling I have.  That I'm just another statistic.  Another  woman who left STEM.  That I'm running away from a job because it's too hard.  Ever since I was 10, people have been praising me for ""bucking the trend"" and ""being a strong woman"" and all that stuff because I was going into engineering.  I've defined myself as ""an engineer"" for so long I feel like it's become an actual part of my identity.

Thankfully financially I'm fine.  My husband is an engineer (and fully supports me leaving engineering, BTW because it makes me so unhappy) and we can easily just live on his salary.  Only debt we’ve got is the mortgage, and it’s cheaper than the rent I was paying when I was living alone.

But, I have to admit I just feel like a failure.  Like I couldn't hack it.  I mean, I can't hack it - I know that.  I've tried for many years to hack it and it just hasn't worked.  I keep trying to tell myself it's a bit like asking a bloodhound to herd sheep.  It's just not fair.  That's not what bloodhounds are supposed to do, and maybe I'm just not supposed to be an engineer.

And, intellectually, I know that teaching should be just as respected as engineering but, real world here, it's not.  It just isn't.  And that makes me nervous a bit.  I wish that it didn't - I wish I didn't care about what other people think but I do.

Ugh.  Sorry for the novel.  I just... I feel bad about being just another woman who leaves STEM.  Like I’m letting people down.

We were a couple for roughly one and a half months until she broke up with me because she “was not really in love”. However afterwards we started seeing each other again, had good times and then stopped seeing each other again. This happened twice before we were a couple and twice afterwards.


In may we started seeing each other again and it was phenomenal. Better than all the times before and we had an amazing month. Unfortunately I had to go abroad for an internship, but we decided to be faithful to each other even though we weren’t a couple. While I was abroad everything went well. We had good contact and we were really looking forward to seeing each other when I came back. Well thing is, I drunkenly made out with a girl while I was away.. I know it’s stupid and I regretted it afterwards but it happened.


So when I came back she picked me up from the airport and we went home. We lived together in September because I needed a place after coming back and her roommate was away this month. During dinner she was asking me if I was faithful or not. After 5 minutes of questioning I finally admitted that I had kissed a girl abroad and that I was really sorry and that it did not even last a minute. I said that everything I told her about looking forward to see her was true and that I’m really into her. As you can imagine she didn’t take it very well. This was a little less than a month ago. 


Due to our situation of living we interacted with each other on a regular basis. Sometimes we did watch TV together, went out for a walk or just sat in the kitchen and talked. Most of the time she was very distant, but occasionally she opened up and we had a good time. We weren’t intimate though. We talked three or four times about the issue but never with a clear result. At first she was angry that I lied to her and didn’t tell her while I was gone, but the last time we talked she was more worried about trusting me again. However I’m moving out today and I just don’t know where we are standing. I’m really sorry for what I did and tried to show her right after I came back, but she never really accepted it.
So today I’m moving out and just don’t know where we stand or what to do.


I really want her back and feel bad for what I did but should I just let it slip and hope for her to maybe contact me again or should I try to talk things over again? 


TL;DR: Was seeing a girl, went abroad, we decided to be faithful, I wasn’t, she’s angry, what to do?

I am currently panicking about the future and need any sort of advice.

I am 25 years old and living in NJ. My wife works full time and is our only source of income (only about $31k a year). I am one course away from finishing my Masters degree, however that course is an internship and I am currently at home with our two young children (4 and 2) during the day with no time to finish the course. We have barely anything saved.

For certain circumstances, we are anticipating my wife to lose her job in the near future. All of our bills combined, we would need to find income of a minimum of $30k a year if she were to be fired. New Jersey has proven very expensive and hard to get ahead, so we have been planning on moving to Indiana where some of our family lives at the end of our current lease (May 2016).

At this point I am so stressed out that I am looking for any financial or lifestyle changing advice. With two young children, it appears only one of us would be able to hold a full time job (unless one were to do overnight work) as childcare would just add even greater expenses. 

Please help!"

Some of the details of this story have been changed for anonymity, but it is all true.

The word crazy doesn't even begin to describe it. **Wall of text incoming.**

I have been married for three years, and as of right now, I can not stop thinking about a person that I fell in love with 10 years ago. This person, I will call Chris. Here is where it gets weird/crazy: Chris was my English teacher in high school.

There were no physical relations between us, just emotional, and it was on my part. Ever since I was a freshman, Chris lived in my neighborhood (we live in a big city), and I found out we commuted on the same bus. We started running into each other, and since the bus ride was about 30 minutes long, we had a lot to talk about. Me, being a stupid high school girl, was enthralled. He was great looking, a great conversationalist, and while he was a hardass on the outside, especially to other students, he was actually a great person.

Our conversations ranged from politics, to music, to life at home, and so much more. I loved these conversations so much that I would a] wait at school until I saw him leave to ""run into him"" at the bus stop or b] wait in the morning/evening and miss busses so that I could see him at the bus stop! It was a lot of wasted time.

I found myself doing silly things to get attention. I made up stories about my ""terrible"" home life, I tried to be the damsel in distress so he could be my hero, and found ways to talk to him only by lying. Either making things greater than they seemed, or worse. He has a good heart, and tried to talk me through those things, and while he was just doing his job, I thought he was paying me special attention. There were times where he did give me special attention too, like how we had to do community service hours every year and he would give me little projects to do for him that weren't exactly community service but he did it anyway. I once complained about how I couldn't come in for community service because I had too much homework, and he told me to do homework in the hallway and he would give me community service hours for it. 

 In my little high school mind, I thought this could go somewhere, oh the thrill of having a secret relationship with that hot high school teacher. Yeah..didn't work out that way.

Towards the end of my freshman year (or maybe it was beginning of sophomore?) he caught on and caught me trying to wait for him. I really did stop after that, and felt truly embarrassed. After he caught me and had me speak with himself with a counselor mediating, I had been getting off the bus a stop earlier to walk home to get him out of my head. It was an extra mile, but I was fat and could have used the exercise. 

There was a big supermarket on the stop before ours. One day, he got off on that stop too, presumably earlier than me, to go to the supermarket. I lived two blocks off of a major road, and he lived half a block off of the same major road. I lived 10 blocks further than he did. Now that I got the roadmap out of the way, I was walking on one side of the major road when out of the corner of my eye, I saw a familiar person walking: omg it was him! But I didn't think of our counseling session, I thought maybe he was following me now! Maybe he missed me! 

Alas, he came to his block, and while I was waiting for my light, he came straight up to me and asked why I was still following him. No explanation, even though it was honest, got through. Seeing this as an adult now, I would have felt the same level of discomfort he did. Things obviously weren't the same. I tried to keep a distance, and even when I ran into him on the bus, I purposely ignored him to make him feel like I had been reformed. When I was a sophomore, I didn't have him for English, so I recruited freshmen who crushed on him just like me to tell me how he was doing.  

Then, toward the middle of my sophomore year, the must crushing news came: he got married. All my dreams of ever being with him in the future melted away, I remember that day so well, I was bawling in my friend's arms. I didn't take the bus that day and walked home. The pain in my chest was unreal, I didn't know a broken heart caused physical pain. Most days after that, I decided I was going to walk to school and home, 10 miles in total per day just to avoid him completely. I woke up early to get to school in time, and came home 2 hours later than usual. I barely ate, I had a piece of fruit for lunch and a piece of fruit for dinner just to take the physical pain of hunger away. I took up smoking until my dad almost caught me, but I needed an addiction to replace this addiction. This went on for two weeks, and walked through every weather imaginable. 

Then, forced by the state, my school had a health week. They brought in counselors to have students take wellness tests, and I obviously brought alert to them because I had lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks and felt like killing myself daily. All unhealthy, angsty teenager shit because I had no outlet to talk to anyone about this. A counselor pulled me out of class to talk to me that day, and told me I had to go home with someone, a trusted adult. They asked if my parents or family worked near the school, or if a teacher lived near me. In the purpose of avoiding Chris, I said the name of another teacher who actually lived a block away from me. 

She was staying late that day but I desperately didn't want them to call my parents. My parents were the type of people who would belittle me and tell me I'm an idiot for wanting to kill myself and my dad was the type of person to tell the rest of the family who would have pulled me out of school to make me marry some uneducated guy from back home. They are immigrants; they don't understand mental health issues too well. It would make a bad situation worse. So they looked up my address and looked up other teacher's addresses and told me to go home with Chris. I felt even worse, more embarrassed, that they said to him, ""you must take the bus with her."" 

I tried not to show up. I tried walking past the bus stop but he was there waiting for me and said my name as I tried to pass. I did pass him, but he reached out and touched my shoulder reassuringly and everything I ever felt for him was like a cranial orgasm. I wanted to cry, to punch him, to run away and jump in front of the oncoming bus because everything was so agonizing but that touch meant everything to me. So I got out of my little fantasy and boarded the bus with him. He asked me if I wanted to talk about it and for fear of him thinking I was crazy (too late) I said no. So we had a light conversation, like two old friends catching up over a cup of coffee.

The year ended. I was doing well. I started eating again, started taking the bus when I wanted, and in those times that I ran into him, I kept it light. No matter what was going on, I tried avoiding deep conversations about it because I would have gone down that rabbit hole again. 

In my junior year, my whole objective was to avoid him completely. That didn't work out as expected. Some of my friends who were now seniors were talking about their awesome new English teacher from last year, and since our school had AP English, I was thinking how awesome it would be to have a totally awesome new teacher. 

Imagine my face when Chris walked in on the first day. My heart fell on the floor. I didn't want to go down this heartbreaking road. I wanted to run out of the classroom and transfer schools. That seemed like the better option than staying and facing this every day. Nope, instead of being the sharp student I was where I raised my hand at every opportunity, I tried to ignore his questions completely. He noticed, so he called on me without me raising my hand. I just wanted to be left alone, but for fear of my grades suffering, I answered. 

That year, I also had a counselor for the incident of last year. I slowly warmed up to him, and he made the insecure teenager in me feel a little bit more comfortable in my skin. I started warming up to Chris again, his humor and charm didn't help me ignore him. Despite the fact that I obviously had daddy issues, I didn't see this counselor as attractive at all. I saw him as the really cool uncle who helped me through shit, and he was really there for me. It helped me cope with Chris better because I stopped using him as a father figure but I was still head over heels. 

I coasted through my final years in high school. Tried to let go of the craziness, sometimes lapsing by waiting a little but then asking myself what I was doing and stopped. I just wanted to come out of this situation a better person than when I started. The counselor I was seeing figured out my feelings and told me it was normal, despite the fact that it wasn't at all. Who chases something that they will never, ever get in their lifetime?

I remember a project where we had to make a monologue based off of an interview with a person. I was in a lazy group, so I took on the role of leader and obviously chose him. He talked about volunteer thing he did when he was younger, building houses in another country, and he revealed so many personal details, things you normally wouldn't tell people. It was so deep. I almost wanted to drop him as the subject because I wanted that conversation to be our secret in a way. I ended up editing the monologue down to drop some of those super revealing things, as though he trusted me to edit those thoughts away and keep them for myself as a lesson. I still have a copy of that transcript.

When I was in my senior year, I occupied myself with other activities like planning the senior trip to Disneyland. It didn't help that he was chosen as one of the faculty advisors to come, but I stayed away. On the plane ride home, he somehow had a seat next to mine and decided to switch. He sat right in front of me, and another teacher sat next to him. In the middle of the flight, she was sleeping and put her head on his shoulder. That hurt me a lot, that could have been me, I thought, but what could I do. 

Graduation came, it was time to let go. Chris was selected to give our speech (why?), and there was a moment where he actually choked up in the middle of his speech. All of my feelings, again, came flooding back. What if he choked up for me? For himself? I didn't know, but in my crazy high school girl mind, I had something to do with it. That day, when I hugged him, I don't think I felt any greater heartbeat in my chest than I did that day. I wanted that moment to last forever, that if Medusa could turn us to stone in that embrace, I would die happy.

Fast forward to my years in college. I was on the newspaper, I was doing well. I was in the newspaper in high school (which he was an advisor for, but that happened after I joined and was not eventful enough to really talk about) so I was proud to continue down that track. Then, four years ago, I got a bug to visit the school. I went, I brought some back copies of issues to share with him. 

I found myself being that high school girl again. I made up stories to make things seem greater than they were. I told him I had a motorcycle, I told him I had a great internship with a big newspaper, and that I was making lots of money. None of it was true, but I wanted him to feel proud of me in some way or feel a certain validation that ""hey, I came out of this situation stronger and I don't need you anymore."" We talked about his son, about life, it was really awesome. 

I went back for an alumni day event three years ago, and talked to younger students about my ""career."" I didn't get a chance to have a one-on-one talk with Chris but I remember my heart fluttering when his head popped into the room briefly for no apparent reason while I was speaking. Was he listening to me speak? I don't know, but I wanted it that way obviously.

Well here I am today. I am married, no, I am happily married, but I have an itch I can't quite scratch. I am currently unemployed, I left a shitty job I was working, and I'm stuck in my head. I never told **anyone** the entirety of this story. But here is what is eating away at me: I still have feelings for Chris. I love my husband so much, but it feels like Chris was always the person I was meant to be with in some way. When I think of my teenage actions as an adult, I feel so bad for what I had done because I put Chris in a shitty situation. I put him on a pedestal in an inappropriate way, and I can see where he may have feared that my craziness could have put him in jail or ruined his career.

I still can't shake the feeling. The love I feel for him. It's so unhealthy, so fucking crazy. I used to be all over horoscopes, Chinese zodiac, read up on things like twin flames, and even used Myers-Briggs personality types to match us. Everything matched, but I'm here, in a different situation, stuck chasing a rainbow for that imaginary pot of gold at the end.

Sometimes I get the urge to run into him again. To intentionally go when school lets out and meet him at the bus stop by chance. I haven't done it, but even when I'm in the neighborhood, I get that itch. I don't know how sad I will be to find out when he eventually moves away or stops working for the school. I want to have a connection with him, to reach out to him, but he's not the type of person to answer emails anyway, at least, not the unimportant ones. I look for recent photos of him on the internet when I get really lonely, just to see how he looks, so I don’t miss him on the street if I pass him (he looks the same, he’s like a vampire).

I dream of him, and that makes me fall hard all over again. Some weeks are better than others, but some days I get all crazy and I take up my time to exercise or clean or do something active to get my brain away from these toxic feelings.  I find myself hearing his words in my head, thinking of what I would say to him if I saw him, still trying to make him be my friend, and realizing new things about his personality that I had never noticed before. Almost like I'm trying to get to know someone I never knew at all. I find myself getting lost in remembering what his eyes looked like, what he smelled like when I was close to him when the bus was packed, what his hands look like, down to every detail.

I think of what it would be like to be close to him, physically, sexually, emotionally, spiritually. I lust for him and pine for him when I'm alone to nothing but my thoughts. I sometimes wonder if its love, lust, infatuation, or obsession. 

I feel like I will always try to outrun this, it's burned into my soul. I hope that not even my worst enemy faces this kind of hurt, this kind of craziness, this kind of unhappiness. Sometimes I want to drop everything and move into a cabin in the middle of the mountains by myself because I feel like I'm too dangerous to society for having such strong, intoxicating feelings. 

As Damien Rice wrote, letting go is not the same as pushing someone else away. "

Her tight thin body and young tight pussy were just what my cock liked, I could have fucked her all night. On my way home I called my wife, Debbie, and told her about how Courtney looked today and what we did. We had talked about my new interns earlier in the week so she knew they were attractive but she did not think I would have one so quickly. When I arrived home Debbie met me at the door wearing a red plaid pleated skirt that barely covered her ass and a sheer white blouse that she did not button but tied the bottom to close the front of it. She was also wearing her glasses. God she looked hot. “Mr. Steve, I have been a bad girl I need you discipline me” she said in a sweet voice. I really do love this woman, we spent the night into the early morning fucking every possible way in every one of her holes, it was fantastic. 

The next morning, Friday, I arrived at work exhausted but very satisfied. I knew I could get allot of work done and not be distracted today and get to the weekend. I was so well taken care of yesterday and last night I was in a great place. I sat at my desk going through some morning e-mails and Yan, my second intern, knocked on my door and came in. “Steve, can I ask you a question” she said timidly. “Yeah sure anything, what can I do to help” I replied wondering why she seemed so nervous and noticing that she was dressed differently today from her normal conservative suites. She was wearing a short jean skirt, sneakers and a loose fitting low cut shear t-shirt with a silk and lace camisole underneath, I was shocked never seeing her like this before, her skin looked so soft and perfect and her thick long black hair was beautiful. She went on “I am having a happy hour at my apartment after work can you come?”

“I would love to, send me your address and what time and I will be there, I can bring something to drink if you like” I replied, figuring a few drinks after work would be nice, knowing that Debbie said she was going out with some of her work people tonight.  “By the way” I added “Glad to see you heard about casual Fridays, you look good” Yan said thank you and giggled, embarrassed by the compliment. She then ran over to where Courtney was sitting and was whispering to her. I knew that Courtney said she was meeting Yan last night and I wondered what she was scheming. Yan went back to her desk and Courtney got up and walked towards me. She was wearing a knit one piece dress that was cut mid-thigh and a v-cut top. It was clingy but loose so it outlined her thin fit body but was not too skin tight so it would be inappropriate for the office. Her legs looked great even in the sandals she was wearing and you could see a little of the outline of her perky little nipples. Shit she looked sexy and confident as she approached. She walked by me and whispered to me, “Remember what you said you would do if I wore a dress?” and kept on going. Knowing that I told her yesterday if I said to wear a dress that at some point during the day we would fuck again. Well I guess that she took it upon herself to wear the dress blatantly showing me that she wanted more of my cock, which started to stiffen a little thinking about her in that dress. 

I went to get some coffee, thinking about what was up with Yan’s happy hour and Courtney in that dress. As I waited for my coffee to brew I felt a hand on my shoulder and heard “Hey Steve how are you doing today, how do you like my new skirt?” I turned to find Sue standing in front of me wearing a tight black knit skirt that was mid-thigh length, high heels and a low cut silk blouse. For being older she looked as sexy as usual with her tight little body. “It is real nice” I replied, knowing that we had the agreement that when she wore a skirt or a dress that I would fuck her that day. “I am off next week so I need to have lunch in your office today to hold me over. I will see you at noon” and walked away, saying it so matter of fact as if I had no say in the matter. 

I went back to my desk thinking to myself that I was planning to have a quiet day and now I had two women expecting me to fuck them and a third not sure what she was planning. I sat there for a moment thinking about them and my cock stiffened. My phone then buzzed, “Hey Steve you there it is Angela?” “Yeah I am here what is up” I replied. “I NEED you to help me move some boxes down in storage right now.” She said sternly. “OK I will be right down” I answered knowing that all she wanted was to suck my cock some and for me to fuck her. Not that I had any problem with this, Angela is very sexy, but I was starting to feel like a giant sex toy for the women in the office. But hey, a guy has to do what a guy has to do and I headed down to the storage room. 

My cock, which sometimes has a mind of its own, was ready for Angela, it loved her mouth, her big firm breasts and her fat juicy pussy. I was still feeling a little used and that I was just here to perform what had become my duty. These negative thoughts vanished as I entered the storage area and went around the shelving to the left to find Angela Standing there naked except for a pair of 4” high heeled shoes. “God I am sure glad it is you, I would have been quite embarrassed if it wasn’t” She said, “I figured I would get all ready for you and besides I am so fucking horny I couldn’t wait, get over here and get that cock of yours out” she begged. I walked over and unzipped my pants, she dropped to her knees and swallowed all of me. I thought to myself “gee she has really gotten good at this but where is the romance, a kiss or even a simple hello and I am glad you could take time out of your busy day to spend some time with me” No it was just get out your dick and let me suck… oh fuck she is good at that as my cock was all the way down her throat so that her tongue was against my balls. OK I just got over feeling like a piece of meat and was going to enjoy this. Angela bobbed her head up and down the full length of my shaft and only stopped to suck on my balls. She really was into this as she stared up at me with her big brown eyes as she took all of me deep into her wet mouth. 

“I want your tits” I asked and she obliged letting my cock out of her mouth and placing it in her cleavage pressing her big hard nipples against my body I thrusted my cock up and down between her tits, and slapping her face with my giant thick cock. “You want me to fuck you? Tell me you want me to fuck you” I asked. “Yes please fuck me, give me your big cock, please fuck me” she begged. I pulled her up to me and I kissed her pushing her back against the wall. I pulled one lug up in the air giving me a clear path to her pussy, I drove my cock hard into her and she felt great. Wet and juicy not so incredible tight like Courtney was. I was able to fuck her hard as she easily took my throbbing meat. You could hear the slapping sound of me going all the way into her and she covered her mouth with her hand to try and to suppress her load moans of pleasure. Angela is so hot, so sexy, her tits bounding with my every thrust and I could see she bit down on her hand to stop her screaming with pleasure as she came from my fucking and a couple more thrusts I could feel my load building. I pulled out of her and she instinctually dropped to her knees and jerked my cock until I came shooting a thick load on her face, in her mouth and on her tits. She swallowed all of me and sucked every drop from me. Collapsed on the floor leaning against the wall and looked up at me with her big brown eyes and some cum dripping off of her chin and said “Thank you, I needed that, can you toss me my clothes I am going to sit here for a moment and enjoy this feeling, I will see you later, thanks again” I replied “Any time all you have to do is ask” I put away my wet cock, zipped my pants, straightened my shirt and went back up to my office. Thinking to myself, well that is one out of the way, this isn’t so bad. 

I stayed busy at work until lunch time knowing that as soon as it was noon Sue would be by for her lunch, which usually consisted of some mutual sucking and me depositing a hot load of cum in her pussy. I was not sure what I was going to do with Courtney, knowing that she wanted her little pussy filled sometime today. At 12:00 both Sue and Courtney arrived at my door from different directions surprised to see each other there. They both stared at each other for a moment not saying anything looking each other over from head to toe. I sat not saying a word just curious how this would play out. Sue finally spoke “So you are here to see Steve, I had planned on seeing Steve for lunch, I like you dress by the way is it new” With that I think Sue figured out that I had the same understanding with Courtney as I did with her. Sue was not shy being the little slut that she is “Why don’t you come in and we can talk about Steve’s lunch schedule. 

Courtney agreed “That sounds like a great idea” and she came into my office and leaned against my wall. To my surprise Sue entered and shut the door behind her. And walked towards Courtney “You really are a pretty young thing, I can see why Steve would want to have lunch with you” she took her hand and softly ran it up and down Courtney’s arm, you could see the tension release from her with Sue’s touch. Sue continued “I really like your dress the material is so soft” she moved her hand from her arm to Courtney’s shoulder and slowly down the front of her dress lightly skimming over Courtney’s breast, her nipple now fully erect. “My, you are not wearing anything under this are you” Sue continued now firmly holding Courtney’s breast and sliding her other hand up the inside of Courtney’s leg until she reached her pussy. “Well nothing at all under this dress, you are a little slut, but that is OK because I am a little slut too” Sue took a step back and pulled up her skirt so it was like a belt and revealed she had nothing on underneath it, she then unbuttoned her blouse releasing her bare breasts. “See I am a slut too and I like to fuck and Steve has enough cock for both of us, do you like to Fuck Courtney”

“Yes I love to fuck, I like Steve’s big cock in my pussy, he fucked me yesterday and it is all I can think of, I need it again” Courtney replied, pulling her dress up over her head so she was standing there naked in front of both of us. I sat there in my chair speechless but so turned on. Sue took Courtney by the hand so they were both in front of me and they both bent over so I had a close up view of their tight asses and pussies. Sue kept on her heels and Courtney had flipped off her shoes so they were close to the same height even though Courtney was at least 6” inches taller than Sue. I placed my hand on each feeling their wetness and rubbed their clits, I leaned forward and switched back and forth between them pleasing them with my tongue. They were both enjoying my work and started kissing each other and feeling each other’s breasts. I kept going until I was able to bring them both to orgasm. 

At that point I stood up and released my cock and stepped out of my pants and underwear. I took my cock and slid it all of the way into Sue and took two fingers and slid them into Courtney, I also slid my thumb into her as I did the day before. I always loved fucking Sue she loved my cock, she was always wet and was pretty loose for being so small probably from all of her years of being a little slut. After a minute I pulled out of Sue and guided my big cock into Courtney’s tight little pussy. Shit she is tight so much different than Angela or Sue. I stretched her open and slid all of the way into her and began thrusting hard against her so my balls were slapping her clit. Not to ignore Sue I gave her two fingers in her pussy and my thumb in her ass. She squealed when I did this not expecting the ass work as we had not done that before. “Courtney liked it, I thought you would enjoy it, you OK” I asked. Sue replied “Shit it feels great, I want more, you just surprised me.” I kept pounding into Courtney she had both hands over her mouth to muffle her moans of pleasure. I switched again to fucking Sue and fingering Courtney’s holes and switched back one more time to fucking Courtney. I had now stuck two and then three fingers into Sue’s ass as she begged for more. Courtney came one more time while I was fucking her and fingering Sue, but I was not finished. I figured I would see how much Sue could take in her ass and I slid my big dick up against her and slowly pushed it into her ass, she started to scream and she and Courtney covered her mouth as Courtney now sat on the desk holding Sue and watching me violate her ass. “You OK?” I asked, “Yes, don’t stop give it all to me” she said as tears were rolling down her face. I began steady thrusts in and out of her ass until I was getting closer. “Courtney do you want to try it?” I asked thinking I could give it to her some before cumming. “It hurts but it feels so good” Sue answered “Let him do it I will help you” she added. With that Courtney bent back over my desk and I lined up my dick with her little ass hole. Sue put one arm around her and locked her in a deep kiss. With that I started sliding my huge cock into her, Sue reached down and rubbed her clit which helped her relax and I pressed in deeper. Courtney’s ass is the tightest thing I have ever fucked. It was like a vice around my cock but I kept pressing until I was balls deep in her ass. Tears were rolling down her face and I kept going, getting in a slow rhythm Sue kept rubbing her clit and Courtney came hard making her tense up even more on my cock. I could not handle any more and I pulled out of her little ass and Sue and Courtney both dropped to their knees ready for my load. I jerked my cock a couple of times and shot it into both of their mouths and faces. Sue the slut she is licked my cock clean it had to taste like ass but she loved it.

 Courtney slumped on the floor in the corner of my office, her eye make-up ruined from her tears and cum dripping down her cheek. “You OK sweetheart” I asked as I walked over to her and caressed her head. “I am more than OK, that was the most incredible thing I have ever done. Can you do that to me again?” she asked looking up at me with a big smile. I thought I had wrecked this girl but she still wants more cock. Sue looked down at her sitting there naked and spent, “Girl you are amazing you need to come out and party with us” Sue tossed Courtney her dress and Sue fixed her skirt and blouse. They both wiped the cum from their faces and fixed their make-up some and left me there in my office in a partial state of bewilderment. I had now crossed two more off of my list of obligations for the day, all that was left was Yan’s happy hour, which I had no idea what that was going to be like.

3n0d1q,5,2015-09-30,Struggling with financial priorities and how much debt is reasonable debt. (CAN),nomoneyallprob,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3n0d1q/struggling_with_financial_priorities_and_how_much/,"I'm going to skip all the personal details aside from bare bone facts, need to know sort of stuff. Basics are, I'm a 24f living with my parents in British Columbia. I've worked a long list of random jobs and started/stopped a few professions over the years but never settled on anything. I do not have a bachelors degree, my most usable work experience is 5+yrs varied customer service and 2 yrs office administration. I traveled a lot, spent a lot, lived on my own for years, and have never been very smart with my money.
 

I'm at a point now where I desperately (mostly for emotional happiness) want to get out of debt and start to feel secure and independent again, in a way that will be reliable and consistent. My 5 year goal is to be debt free, able to call myself financially independent, and have a solid rainy day fund.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Current Debt:

-$350 owed on taxes from surprise adjustment of previous year. Received adjustment with 2014 tax year.
-$500 limit maxed out Visa card. 19.5% interest rate. Can be lowered to 11.5% with $50 yearly fee vs no fee.
-$230 phone bill. $70 p/month
-$2,900 previous school tuition owed to Bank of Parents
-$2,000 owed in personal loans to Bank of Parents
-$250 personal loan from sister - debt repayment deadline end of Dec.
= $6230

*Note on Bank of Parents debt. They are not charging me interest and we have clarified that I will pay them pack with monthly instalments once I have a salary/good pay/basics covered.



Upcoming expenses:
$100 to get new phone. Mine just completely died but I have insurance on it. Probs have to pay down bill, to get new phone...Not sure though
$1600 to get new macbook for school. Programs recommends this type of computer and requires powerful machine. Mine is 4 yrs old and on last legs.
$8,000 b/f tax for school tuition which I would like to get through Student Aid BC, then apply for the no interest grant. 
No textbooks needed, is 2 month coding bootcamp with 2 month internship after. Projected to receive $4,000 compensation at internship, and possible employment offer.


Monthly expenses:
$100 transit pass 
$200 in food, entertainment, sanity.
$15 visa minimum
$70 phone



I currently have about $20 to my name and $1500 from my grandparents for school. Just got a job that pays $11p/hr at a coffee shop after 4 months of depression and unemployment, post graduating a program I instantly regretted. Old boss did me a favour, will be covering and picking up as many shifts as I can. Shifts are 6 hrs. I am applying incessantly to admin/secretary jobs which I have work experience in but having a very hard time even getting an interview.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My parents are unwilling to assist me financially anymore than putting a roof over my head and some food. They will not cosign any loans or assist with any more education costs (for now they say, may change their minds later). I do odd jobs to help out and they sometimes will pay me for some work or give commission on selling stuff on craigslist for them. 

I'm really overwhelmed right now, especially being in a long distance relationship with an American, and looking at the prospect of moving down to California to be with him after I finish my coding program in the spring. I do not have US citizenship. Would probably apply for a working holiday visa and be partially supported by him until I could get a more legit work permit. He earns $90,000+ and says he would support me in dealing with debt etc. but I know it's foolish to rely on that entirely when it comes to giving myself security.

I wish I could consolidate my debt but I'm not sure if that's smart or even possible. I can't get any loans from the bank or increase my credit limit until I've been working enough again to record an income. I'm really unsure of how to prioritize what to pay off... I wonder if I should wait on getting into more debt although it's the only way I can see myself getting ahead right now.

I realize this is a bit of a shit-storm, it's certainly making me pretty miserable. I really need a shining ray of light right now to help me get through the next year. Throw your advice at me. Any suggestions welcome. Thank you in advance.

3n0h6f,8,2015-09-30,College...need help with friends. no time to exercise.,italia4386,proED,https://www.reddit.com/r/proED/comments/3n0h6f/collegeneed_help_with_friends_no_time_to_exercise/,"Hey guys. 

So I was able to get down to my lowest weight this summer (115lbs) because I was living alone in a city doing an internship, and was basically able to eat nothing and exercise for 2 hours a night without anyone noticing. 

So now I am back at college, and I have puffed all the way back up to about 128 lbs because of the environment that I'm in, and I need your help.

My main 'problem' is my friends. I have two best friends, and we spend most of our time together, meaning lunch and dinner. They are both healthy, average college girl eaters...they'll have sandwiches for lunch and pasta or typical entrees for dinner. But they also want to go to Chipotle and get frozen yogurt occasionally.  So what has been difficult for me, is to eat significantly less than my friends when I am around them. I am already about 10-15 lbs lighter than them, and while I can make excuses for missing a meal or two, they've noticed in the past when I skip out on a lot of meals in a row. As it is, I eat pretty much only salads with them, and they have made comments about how I 'don't eat that much' and I eat a lot of salad. 

My friends are also relatively heavy partiers...going out about 2-3 days a week. I was able to not go out this summer, saving me alcohol calories. But now, all of my friends drink, and they notice when I don't. I don't drink aggressively, but when each shot is about 70-100 calories, even a couple add up. I also hate missing out on spending time with all of my friends, when they are all out partying together.

Third challenge. I don't have time to exercise nearly as much as I could this summer. I have an incredibly heavy courseload, I have a part time job, and I'm job searching for next year. I also have a boyfriend. So by the time I'm done with classes and work at 8 at night, I have to immediately start doing homework. As it is, I only spend about a night a week with my boyfriend. He's also another 'problem'--we go out to dinner occasionally, and he always wants me to eat an entree and enjoy dinner with him. 

How do I lose weight when I'm surrounded by people who eat/are aware of me not eating, and when I have no time to exercise? It just seems like I have so many challenges to my freedom to restrict. Do I just have to accept that I can't really be super-skinny when I'm surrounded by food and people monitoring me? Please help :( It felt so good to be small this summer, and I want that feeling again. I'd be happy with just 120lbs. 

Thank you!"
3n0kr2,0,2015-09-30,Moving from Florida to Columbus. Male Mid 20s. Advice appreciated.,swornhabit1,Columbus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/3n0kr2/moving_from_florida_to_columbus_male_mid_20s/,"Background: I used to live in Columbus 10 years when my father was working for corporate retail. I am now hoping to move back due to (much) lower cost of living and greater amount of opportunities for work.  I am returning with some savings and am hoping to stay with some friends I recently re-connected with while I get on my feet.

Advice wanted: The plan is to get a job in my field, digital marketing, at a large corporation as soon as possible.  My previous efforts in trying to get a job in Columbus for the field have been met with limited response, mostly due to me being closer to entry-level and them not wanting to look at an out-of-state candidate.

 I understand that this takes time, so I am looking for advice on opportunities for part time work, or if anyone has corporate connections/advice, some help there would be appreciated as well! I have already reached out to a couple staffing agencies in the past and will be reconnecting with them once I am physically there. As of this moment I figure that this is a good time to come up and get a retail job temporarily while I find better opportunities due to holiday season. 

My previous work experience includes:
- 1 year Digital Marketing and Ecommerce for a transportation service.
- 2 internships involving Digital Marketing, both for an agency and an informational online service.
- 1 skills-based volunteering for a t-shirt printing company where my duties included assisting in the production of custom shirts as well as recommendations for marketing efforts (traditional &amp; digital) 
-3 1/2 years working retail, a local surf shop with highest position as an assistant merchandise planner.

Again any help is appreciated and will be taken into consideration! 
P.S. May need help finding a jacket as well."
3n0skt,85,2015-09-30,"I (21F) think I need to cut my family off permanently (42M, 42F, 24F) after everything they've done.",Badkidaplenty,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3n0skt/i_21f_think_i_need_to_cut_my_family_off/,"This is going to be a very long post as I have a lot of reasons as to why I want to cut off my parents and my sister. Mom 42F, Sister 24F, Dad 42M, Niece, 3F, SO 22M (6 months together)

It all started when I was a kid. My sister was a notorious liar and therefore got all the attention from my parents. I rarely got any attention and when I would do bad things, I still wouldn't get any. My sister kept my parents busy. 

Middle school comes around and my sister kept getting in trouble. But this time, she would take me down with her. She would date people my parents didn't approve of and I would get grounded for knowing. She would lie and I would get in trouble for not telling on her. However, when I would tell on her, my parents would say how I was jealous of her and how I needed to not be a tattle tale. 

High school was the worst. My sister graduated and everything she needed; she got. Someone else paid for her graduation party, cap and gown, college deposit, moved her to college, etc. My parents would go down for a two hour drive to visit her and would take her food. At home, it was still all about her. My mom would call and talk to her and then only talk to me about her. 

I was an A student in high school. I won awards and went to writing conferences and received medals. They complained if they had to go with me anywhere. I didn't get approval or even a good job. I graduated with two diplomas and I didn't hear a single thing from either of my parents about it. 

My senior year my sister came home pregnant. All of the sudden I had a curfew. Of 8 at night. I was 18 years old. Everything became about her and the baby and everyone forgot that it was supposed to be my year. 

I paid for my cap and gown. My CNA test and CPR test and any supplies. I paid for my graduation party and venue. I paid for my college deposit, for my college education, and for my braces. My parents did not help me move in or out. They did not visit me. 

I had been hired for an internship in New York and they refused to let me leave. They told me that it was a worthless decision and that it was stupid for me to go. They guilted me into not going. 

I was suicidal in college and all they cared about was that I wanted to leave them without me. My mom specifically said that I shouldn't do it for her. I told them so that I could get help, not a guilt trip. 

My sister graduated and no one cared that I opened my own nonprofit. Every time I try to talk to them about it, they said they don't understand so they don't care. i give out scholarships and apparently that's too hard to understand. 

I spent this past summer with them and I went to work and I did online classes. My dad screamed at me all the time that I was lazy because I didn't want to get up and help clean up after my sister and my niece. I was taking online tests and he would shut off the internet. Then yell at me some more. I decided I would spend as little time there as possible. 

I decided to get an apartment and they all encouraged me living with my boyfriend (22M) and I liked the idea. We signed a lease and that very night my mom and dad sat us down to tell us how stupid we are. How we are going to fall on our faces. They said that I am a bad daughter. Later that night my dad screamed at me that he was glad that I was leaving because I made the entire family miserable. 

I apparently made the family miserable because I did not want to spend time with them getting yelled at all summer.( I did not spend time with my niece (3F) as much as I would have liked to because my sister said that she didn't trust me going down the street with her.. even though when she wanted to go out and such I babysat for her. I did everything right. So the mistrust was very wrongly placed.) My sister then agree that I made her miserable too and that I needed to go. 

They also said that because I didn't contribute financially that I needed to leave. They wanted money for cigarettes, fast food, two entire bills. I was almost never there. Why should I be paying $300 to live there when I need to save money for college? 

On my 21st we moved in. I transferred schools. We fight a lot because we are stressed out. But we are also happy. My parents have not made an effort to come see our place. They complain that I don't see them but never contribute for gas. When I do get there, they make fun of my boyfriend and ask us for money. They ask him for cigarettes. They want us to buy them fast food. 

We got a dog after much consideration and we love this puppy. We were told by my dad to only spend money if necessary. Why would I work for all of this money and only pay bills? I wanted a dog for when I am home alone. So that we can be a family unit. My mom told me that I should return my puppy because I am not responsible enough for a dog.... When I took care of the family dog since I was seven and I had to pay for him to be put down when it was his time to go. 

Recently, I bought my first car. I was never allowed to use their car for my driving test, unlike my sister, so I still don't have a license. I went with my SO's parents to look at this car before and after it had some repairs done. I was extremely excited that I would no longer need a ride everywhere. I called my sister and because I didn't know exactly what had been wrong with it she started yelling at me and hung up. 

Later I called my mom to tell her my excellent news and she told me that I was making stupid decisions and that it was an irresponsible buy and that I hurt my dad's feelings. She said I should have had him come out to look at it, but he won't even come half way to the dealer which is where i live. She told me I am making bad decisions with my life and that I don't deserve a car or a license. She said that I wouldn't like it if she stopped worrying or caring about me, a threat she uses all the time. But then she said that I shouldn't call anymore. 

OK. 

So then she messaged me on facebook asking me to put out over $180 for a carseat for my niece. I never responded because I didn't want to talk to her anymore either. She then tried to guilt me and said that she would figure it out herself. Never mind letting my sister buy it for her daughter.  She then had my sister call me relentlessly until I answered and she was asking if I would buy it. I said no. She then said she had to go and hung up. 

My mom then says this: 

You know the silent treatment isnt called for. Of course im glad you arent at (MY SO's) mercy and dont have to wait alone in a darkempty parking lot. But im still mom and gonna worry you got taken. If that pisses you off to the point that youre done talking to me, just remember his fucking parents dont even care for him so why would they you? Im about done trying (my name) ill only take so much punishment for what you think i do wrong.

I never responded. I was trying to figure out in my head how this could possibly be my fault. Then yesterday I messaged my sister asking her to bring my niece over so that I could see her. She said that I only contact them when I need them and that I never bought her a carseat, so no. 

Another thing about my family is that my mom told my SO that he has to go to HER holidays and that if he doesn't that he isn't allowed back over. My dad I recently learned was doing meth. Everyone is hiding it from me. My mom has surgery last month on my one day off and they all guilted me into going saying that there was a chance she would die. Instead she yelled at me when she got out. 

What do I do? Do I just cut them out of my life and sacrifice my niece in the process? She's the only reason I have been putting up with them... 


TLDR: My family is insane and disowned me but still wants me to do things for them.

Codename: Ichor

Age: 20

 [Appearance:](http://i.imgur.com/a69IyUm.png) 

* Hair: Black, long, messy,
* Eyes: Dark Brown, hint of gold. They appear to be fully gold through his suit.
* Skin: light brown
* Body: Thin, lean and wiry, somewhat tall.  He has some scars on his body from his time kidnapped.
* [Supersuit:](https://i.imgur.com/BBsBgyF.png)  His supersuit is lightly armored with tiny gaps for the blood to flow through. His armored gloves have separated fingers, allowing him to have greater control of his blood manipulation. His legs are a little more armored because the majority of his attacks go through his hands.  The feet of his soles are made of a rough metal in order to get better grip on slick surfaces.

* When not wearing his suit, he likes to wear a graphic t-shirt and jeans.

Personality: Despite his macabre power, he is usually really happy and enjoys having fun and goofing off. He has a very odd sense of humor, and tends to speak first and think later.  Kind of nerdy as well, and loves videogames. He often doesn't know how to interact around people and can come off as a goofy slacker.  Despite this, he can be very serious if need be.  He’s a bit of a loner, but he can be really close to those he becomes friends with.  He's very trusting towards people he's become acquainted with.

Backstory: Growing up in Florida to immigrant parents, Sam was an outcast.  Despite being born and raised in Florida, he was always the foreign kid.  He didn't have many friends, either.  Except for a select few, everyone saw him as that one weird brown kid that didn’t know how to talk to people.  Instead, he turned to science and books.  He’d spend his days in the fantasy land of a book or game, or researching a new theory in biochemistry.  As time went on, he cultivated a reputation as the resident nerd of the school.  
All that changed when he was 13 years old, when Mexico and Canada declared war.  Like pretty much every place close to the borders, he was caught in the crossfire.  Suddenly, Canadian sympathizers were accusing him of helping Mexico.  Despite not actually being Mexican, he was caught up in Anti-Mexican sentiment due to his looks.  This drove him closer into his research, where he spent most of his time.  He graduated high school at the age of 17 and immediately began an internship with Booster Tech in the biological research division, where he studied biology based powers for potential artificial power creation.  

 The next year, war broke out once again: the Mexican-Canadian war became a world war when more countries joined in to support their allies. Living in Florida, he was all too aware of the effects of the war.  This time, it was the other side that hated him.  One day, while walking back to his place from work, he was ambushed by men shouting at him in Spanish.  When he woke up, he was more than 4000 miles away in Spain.  He spent the few weeks as a human punching bag for Spanish nationalists before breaking out.  

One day, upon waking up in the dark, humid cell that he was being kept in, something clicked in him.  He could feel liquid rushing through his body, pulsing with every beat his heart took.  After cutting his hand on a particularly sharp rock, he noticed that the cut on his hand wasn’t bleeding red.  It was covered with a shimmering golden substance.  His very blood itself had changed.  After a week or two of constant practice, he was able to control his new powers with some confidence.  The very next day, he escaped in a surprise attack.  Not one person was spared.

After a few uneasy weeks of blending in to the surrounding area and adjusting to his new life as a super, he received the news: The war was finally over.  Then, a few weeks later came another surprise: A large aircraft carrier had docked itself in Vigo.  It was definitely not a Spanish model ship.  His new neighbors had tensed up.  Did the ship not get the message that the war was over?  After a few days came another surprise: the identity of the sailors.  Emboldened by this new opportunity, Sam went to go check it out.  Finally, he would have a chance to be where he belonged.

_____
Power: Hemokinesis.

He can shape, control, and manipulate blood. He is even able to compact and crystallize the blood. He possesses overactive Bone Marrow, which replenishes the blood at faster rates than what would be normal. He has some conscious control of the blood while it is still inside his body, and is able to manipulate the flow of blood to different areas of the body. He is able to use this to bring more oxygen to different parts of the body to rapidly increase healing in some areas at the expense of others. Due to his mutation, his blood is an extremely efficient carrier of oxygen and an efficient carrier of nutrients. He is able to pull the blood straight from the pores of his skin.  The blood that he uses in battle is a golden color rather than a dark-red, as a result of his mutations. He uses his Hemokinesis in four main ways:

* Blood Blaster: He is able to shoot blood bullets of different sizes and shapes from his hands. This is one of his most used attacks, and can fire at speeds up to that of a Sub Machine Gun (about 1000 RPM) At low speeds he is able to change the direction of the bullet in midair. However, the blood cannot be reused once it hits its target.
* Blood Blade: He is able to create blades of varying size and shape out of blood that can attach to various body parts. He is able to create a sort of inner webbing in the blade to minimize blood loss while extending the blade. The blades are about as sharp and durable as swords, and can break. The broken end is still controllable, but it is difficult to turn it hard again.
* Blood Bulwark: He is able create protective armor out of the blood. The armor is as tough as steel and can be detached from his skin to form a mobile shield. He is able to create the armor on his arms, legs, or head. He often uses it on his arms as kind of an accompaniment to the protection already offered by the guards on the Katar that he uses.
* Blood Bullwhip: He is able to elongate his blood armor into a flexible whip that extends out of the front of his hands. The whip is about as tough as leather and is used to hold on to objects. He can also harden the end into a long bat or a spike, but it isn’t as effective as a weapon because it stays flexible. He prefers to use the blood bullets as a last resort.

Drawbacks: His Hemokinesis requires relatively warm temperatures due to him needing to maintain his body heat, so he is weakened considerably by cold temperatures. He finds it hard to use his blood manipulation in the cold because doing so drastically lowers his body temperature.  He can only manipulate his own blood or fluid that has been in contact with his own blood. With the latter, however, he has diminished control (about half as much control). He is unable to redirect that blood back inside his body, so it is lost after battle. He must replenish the blood naturally after battle through eating and resting. Because he is forced to use his own blood when battling, he has to be really creative about how to use it to minimize blood loss. He has a large appetite as a result of his taxing powers, so he is constantly seen eating or drinking something. When healing himself, he is not able to use external hemokinesis. Healing himself requires him to concentrate on the healing, so it is reserved for small injuries outside of immediate battling.

 The golden blood that he uses in battle is very distinctive and can be identified easily. 

Resistances: He is resistant to heat to a small extent.  He is resistant to slashing damage due to his blood closing up the wound easily

Weapon: He owns a [pair of Katar](https://i.imgur.com/JmKcRNE.jpg) that he uses as a short-range weapon and to extend the use of his powers.  

Special Skills: He is a good strategist and is an expert at biology and biochemistry/chemistry.  He is good at street fighting, but has no formal practice.

*Ichor walks out on to the shore and looks at his new home.  Finally, a place where he would belong.  He carries a large backpack with a few changes of clothes and the super suit he made over the past year.  As he walks towards the ship, he starts to see other people walking around wearing super suits of their own.  He grins.  This would be fun.*"
