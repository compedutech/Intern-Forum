lw4aq,2,2011-11-01,[FR] Halloween party after a snow storm (University){No closes},stateschoolfall,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/lw4aq/fr_halloween_party_after_a_snow_storm/,"I put ""no closes"" in the title for people who read FR's for advice/pointers/inspiration. Currently I write FR looking for those thing lol.

HB7:
Met a girl and found out we are the same major and I basically tried to brag about the internship offer I just got making a butt load of money(DHV?) and asked her her plans after college. After talking for a while some girl tried to get people to dance and I suggest the girl suggesting the dancing and the girl I was talking with sandwich me. 

So I'm dancing with two girls but I'm just trying to grind with the one I was talking to so I tell her to turn around, and like that; we're grinding. Luckily my friend was there to take the other girl. So we're dancing pretty intensely, I'm in state, enjoying her ass, even the girl my friend took complained to him saying why cant he be like me cause ""look, hes so into it.""

But after one song it dies down cause she get a serious text about someone she knows being stuck somewhere because of the snowstorm. We talk for a while again and I am bored of our conversation and really just want to feel her ass again so I suggest dancing again but it was a no go cause no one else was dancing and because it was a semi small party it'd be like we are putting on a show for everyone. I mean I was drunk enough that I wouldn't mind, but she wasn't down. Than she excused herself to get some beer.

After that I left the party to go drink some more, and came back and didn't really try to start the convo up again with her for some reason. I think I wanted her to show she was really interested and start the convo back up with me, which I realize is a stupid thing to wait for since she could be easily thinking the same thing. Didn't really interact with her the rest of the night which is stupid after getting to know her as much as I did, could of number closed if I caught her when I eventually left. SMH.

HB8:
Tried to talk to another girl who was just standing/hovering but just asked boring questions to keep conversation going. I realized this and even said ""could I ask you one more boring question"" and ended the convo after that.

She ended up sitting next to me later, which may sound stupid/arrogant but I should of took as a IOI cause she was just sitting there alone staring at the wall when she could of been over by her friends talking. I opened her with [this line(click)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZlZryEKdXE&amp;feature=channel_video_title#t=02m52s) from simplepickup which worked a lot in terms of receptiveness but I again for some reason let the convo end there, I wanted to use that line on someone this whole semester and I finally did and for some reason I took that as an accomplished goal and didn't even try to use the high energy I created with that line to get to keep talking to her or anything. SMH.



TLDR (Lessons for the future);

-keep the conversations more high energy, and at least keep em going!
-don't concentrate on one girl
-keep the conversation going!
-have bigger goals, dancing and opening aren't the end game
-with that said, more kino!...realized easier to do after dancing too"

This position has a high probability of turning into a full time position.  I am the head Web marketing analyst for a company in the Mira Mesa area and I need help.  Day to day work will involve reporting on client Web metrics, using Powerpoint to create analytics presentations (for clients), managing online advertising (no spam; mainly AdWords and Facebook), and helping determine online strategy for companies that are old school and well established, but are just now joining the modern age.  

Ideally, applicants should be very Web savvy and know how the Web works.  I can train the rest, but I can't start from zero knowledge of the Web.  You'll be provided with a laptop and our office is located off Mira Mesa Blvd.  I'm negotiating with the main office about pay, but this will pay in the area of $15/hr for 20 or so hours a week and will turn into a full time position if it works out well.  I can very easily work around school schedules.  Most importantly, the applicant needs to be friendly, enjoyable to work with, and dependable.  This person would be working directly with me to lessen my workload, so I can't stress dependability and affability enough.

If I really start to fail in something, I simply deny the reality of the situation until it becomes untenable and I'm forced to confront it, then I really feel terrible about it. So I do feel stress and embarrassment when I fail, but that far exceeds the satisfaction I get when I succeed.

To be fair, I do feel satisfaction when I really succeed at something, but it fades quickly , and stress and failure tend to stay with me, so I'd rather just not attempt an activity I might fail at.

Another thing is, for things like papers, where I know I can write a really good paper, I put a lot of pressure on myself and tell myself that because the paper *can* be good, it *has* to be good. And so because I've made it into such a big task in my head and I know it'll be a big ordeal writing it up to my standards, I'd rather just not do it.

**tl;dr: I have no motivation. I don't when I'm happy, and i don't when I'm sad. My family is successful, so I know it's not my environment, I internalize failure more than success. And, I hold myself to standards so high I don't want to meet them, so often times I don't even try.**

I went to Mission Bay High School here in San Diego. I spent my time in High School wrestling and surfing. My major hobby now is surfing and Jiu Jitsu - a brazilian form of submission grappling which is a natural compliment to western folkstyle wrestling. 

I went to Chico State for my undergrad where I majored in Political 
Science with an emphasis in Legal Studies. The curriculum mostly focused on societal changes in American history through civil rights and employment case law. 

After graduating in December of 2009 I took an internship in Sacramento to learn the ins-and- outs of the legislative process with a firm that represents local governments in the state legislature. I also worked in the state assembly for a year helping to analyze and draft legislation. 

I have recently accepted a job in San Diego and am glad to be back in my home town. One of the difficulties of moving home after more than 6 years away is that most of my friends from high school have moved on to live in other cities, so I am looking to rent with good, decent people. 

I don't mind going out and drinking or going to parties but I do have my priorities straight and I like to make sure my work is done before 
anything else. I drink socially and don’t do any drugs. I don’t mind at 
all if you smoke weed. 

I am clean. I pick up after myself. I don't mind being the one to throw out the trash, and I don't begrudge other people not being the tidiestof sorts. As long as someone isn't disgustingly dirty or unkempt or messy I really don't care. I don't mind people borrowing certain thingsas long as they put it back. For example I don't care if you need to borrow my bike as long as I don't need it at the time and you bring it back in one piece.

I work relatively long hours , 9 - 8(ish) and weekends, but I will not be a hermit or someone you feel like you need to avoid while I am home.

m0wfz,1,2011-11-04,"I was a banker during the collapse.  This is my story.  This is why I stand with #Occupy.  It's a long read, thank you in advance for reading the whole thing.  ",[deleted],occupywallstreet,https://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/m0wfz/i_was_a_banker_during_the_collapse_this_is_my/,"	In November of 2009, I was laid off from the bank that had employed me for almost 3 years.  The banking collapse had finally caught up to us, and we sold out to another company who decided that some of the employees that were coming with the merger were making to much money.  I was making 12 bucks an hour, plus commissions.  However, I had not seen a commission check in 3 months.  Not because I wasn't bringing in business, but nobody that applied for a loan with me was approved.  At 12 dollars an hour, I was making 50% more than people doing the same job with the company that had bought us.  That's right.  The company that bought us wanted to pay personal bankers a pittance of 8 dollars an hour.  
	
	But, they didn't just lay me off.  Had they done that, I could have collected unemployment benefits for a while.  Instead, I had been given a sealed envelope by the treasury service specialist and was told that one of her clients was sending an employee to pick it up, and that it contained a cashiers check.  That afternoon, a young man came to my desk asking about it; I asked him who he worked for and he named a company that was a client of our treasury services department.  I checked his ID, had him sign for the pick up, and he took the envelope and left.  A minute later he came in saying it was the wrong check.  Nobody had the right check for him.  When the treasury service specialist returned, we found out that she had taken the check she meant for me to hold and left me with a check that was for someone else.  I was fired for this offense.  
	
	Had they waited 2 weeks for the merger to complete, and then lay me off, I would have been 100% vested in my retirement plan, been able to be put on my wife's health insurance, and collected unemployment.  However, almost 6 thousand dollars was taken from my retirement account the day I was fired.  I hadn't been contributing long enough.  The near six thousand that was left wasn't enough for the financial firm that handled our accounts to keep mine open.  By the time I found this out, it was past the time I could have put it into another account.  I had to take a check with the IRS getting their cut, plus penalties for early withdrawal of retirement funds.  I used the money that was left, plus my tax return, to pay off my car note.  I had nothing but my wife's income after I did that.   

	I applied at every bank in the county of St. Louis, and it's neighboring counties.  I didn't even get a phone call back.  I did find work as a part time karate instructor.  I made 150 a week after taxes.  I also was able to take work as a personal assistant for a mortician.  For that, I made 250 a week in cash.  My first day on the job, I had to pick up and deliver 3 dead babies amongst other equally gruesome tasks.  The job was only temporary though.  My boss needed an assistant, but was waiting for an intern from a funeral directors college.  I was laid off in May of 2010.  My karate instructor job was only for during the school year, so that month, I was completely out of work again.  

	In June of 2010, I started graduate school.  No loans needed, I had a place to live.  My wife was back in school on a full ride, and I had a job working on my family farm.  My wife and I moved across the country for this opportunity.  I was to work on the farm during the summer, then I was all but assured that I would get a job teaching special education during the day while attending night school, and making a good living.  This was through a program called the “Teach Mississippi Initiative”.  

	That summer, I finished all of my classes with a 3.8 GPA, but the state of Mississippi was laying off more teachers than it was hiring, and laid off teachers were getting emergency certification for special education in order to stay employed.  I had to stay working on the farm.  

	I worked diligently throughout the abnormally cold winter.  We grew pond raised catfish, and more days than not, I was chest deep in freezing cold water before the sun came up.  Some days, ice floated around me while I worked the nets.  This job paid 400 a week before taxes, and no health benefits.  The job was extraordinarily dangerous, and in June of 2011, I was burned by a splash of sulfuric acid while I was mixing algae killing chemicals.  There was no neutralizing agent available, nor was their a wash station.  The only thing that saved me was my basic knowledge of chemistry.  While sprinting to the closest water hose, I spotted a 10 gallon barrel of undiluted truck/tractor soap and yelled to a coworker to grab it and pour it over me while I sprayed myself down.  The concentrated alkaline soap neutralized the burn quickly, and I was left with minimal 1st degree burns and no scarring.  My wife and I decided that this was a bridge to far, as I had come home injured, burned, or cut many times before from the dangerous work conditions that OSHA would have shut the farm down over.  Since it was my family farm, I couldn't bring myself to report them for their lack of basic safety precautions.  

	That afternoon, I called my friends in St. Louis and asked them if there was any work for me.  One man who I had been very close with for years said he had just opened up a restaurant, and was about to open 2 more and that I could come be a shift manager for him at 10 bucks an hour, all the hours I could want.  My wife was offered her old job back, which was a living wage for a single person.  Once we got to St. Louis, I found out that my buddy/boss had hired 2 restaurant's worth of employees to train, and that we were only getting 10-15 hours a week at 8 dollars an hour until we went full time.  My wife was informed that her old company was going into layoffs and that the job she was promised no longer existed.  In order to afford the move, we had sold nearly all of our possessions.  Everything we own now fits in a 10 by 10 room we rent from her parents, and a 5 by 10 storage locker.  
	Once the second restaurant had opened, I was given full time hours, but told I needed more training (which I did, I've only ever waited tables as far as food service goes).  So, I wasn't getting my raise yet.  After 3 weeks of averaging 35ish hours a week, I was told I was being cut back down to 10-15.  “Nothing personal”, said the owner.  The new store just isn't taking off like the first one did, and we're cutting hours on everybody who isn't salaried.  I was also told that I might want to start looking for other work, because it would be months before the restaurant could reasonably be expected to become profitable.  

	I lined up a couple of interviews, and they went great.  I told my boss about it and he was excited.  He told me to feel free to use him as a reference, as he liked me and hated the situation I was in.  He also told me that he would keep me on as long as possible, and that he didn't need 2 weeks notice.  A week later, I was scheduled for second interviews at 2 places.  My boss took me aside after I told him this and said, “Look, I've always been a straight shooter with everybody.  I hate to do this, but the company is losing four grand a month.  A big chunk of that is your pay.  I'll let you work out the rest of this week, and you will always get the employee discount here, but on Friday afternoon, I'll need you to turn in your keys.  I hope you understand, and that I wish you the best.”

	I went to both second interviews, and got offered nothing.  For a month I landed at least 2 interviews a week, but nothing ever came of them.  One job that I was perfect for, mortgage processor, not only didn't hire me, but they reposted the job on Monster.  I emailed HR from a different email address and said that I had seen the first posting after it had been up a little bit and figured they had already accepted their candidates, and was wondering if this was for the same position, or just another position in the same department.  HR confirmed that they had found no suitable applicants, and they reposted the same job.  I have 3 years in banking/mortgages/finance experience along with great references in the industry.  I have no idea what they are looking for if I'm not it.  

	Then, last week, I saw an ad on craigslist for a manager at a storage facility.  450 a week plus bonuses after 90 days, apply in person.  I went down there with my resume in hand, filled out the application, shook hands with everyone, and left.  A few days later I was called for a phone interview, and was scheduled for an in person interview.  The in person interview started with a personality screening, a basic sales test, math skills test, and finally a logic test.  I scored perfect on math and logic, and very well on sales skills.  I interviewed with the CFO, and then the district manager.  The CFO thought very highly of me and was impressed with my references and background.  However, I didn't think the DM shared her opinion.  When the interview was over, he said he would call me the next day if I got the job.  I shook his hand, thanked him, and walked away thinking, “he'll never call”.

m0v3d,1,2011-11-04,bizarre childhood turned me into who i am today. ,canistill,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/m0v3d/bizarre_childhood_turned_me_into_who_i_am_today/,"Hi guys, 22f here. This is going to be long, just a warning!


So, a little backstory on how I got to be the way I am today. When I was growing up I had things I loved to do. I danced, I acted, I rode horses, and I loved art and creating things. I had piles of friends, and always got invited to parties. There was never a dull moment in my life, and even at age eight I was always on the go. I'd get off from school, head straight to the barn to ride, then dance at night. This continued until I was 15, when my parents told me they were getting a divorce. And I was literally told I couldn't dance or ride anymore because of the cost. I was heartbroken. I had to stop riding lessons right when I was about to start pursuing my dream (of being a jockey, haha, I was a silly kid). My days were now filled with going home after school and playing on the computer for hours on end. It was like my life suddenly stopped when I was just figuring out who I was. I became a homebody, because my friends were still at soccer practice, gymnastics and all of their other passions, and I felt out of the loop because if someone asked ""How's riding going?"" I had no way to respond. I'd felt I'd become unworthy, boring, because I no longer had anything to 'do' besides paint with my cheap ass paint set and dance in my room with my door shut and blinds drawn. 

I got my first job at age 16, and that helped me out. It got me out of the house, and made me feel much less withdrawn. However, whenever I got those paychecks, I'd put half of it into my savings like a good girl, but I'd go blow the other half on ridiculous things. From that period of 16-18 in my life, I acquired more useless crap than ever. I taking out my new found worthlessness in material items. Even now when I look around my big girl apartment, I see the remnants of it. The main thing being a huge painting I bought when I wandered into an art gallery that cost about $700. I was 17 and I didn't blink when I handed my card over (it's not useless, and it actually brings me a lot of happiness, but at 17...totally unneeded). It got to the point where I would come home every day with something new, even if it was just a new pair of shoes or a DVD. I kind of alienated myself from a few of my high school friends cause when I said ""Let's go shopping!"" they'd insist on just chilling out and watching a movie, and I'd end up going to the mall. I finally got help with that.

At 18 I made a major move, all by myself for my mental health, and I was never happier. I made a whole new slew of friends, and I was the same old me again. I had an amazing job, and I smiled more than anything else. I was totally okay being in big groups whether it was a party, a chill hang out, or in the break room at work. I was so happy. I lived like that for over a year, when I realized I wanted to go to college. I knew what I wanted to do with my life since I'd graduated high school, but I was so scared to ask my parents, fearing it would be too much money, cause they hadn't even paid off my old sister's school loans. 

At this time, my boyfriend of four years and I broke up, adding to my life confusion, because he has always been there for me. It hurt so bad, and I actually ran back to my happy place for another six months, before returning to a new school.

At 21 I moved to a city which I go to school in now. I have only been at this school for about two semesters now (transfered in as a Junior), and I realized I have fallen back into my ways. I have a few friends (and a boyfriend), yes, but not a 'group', which I miss from my old lifestyle. My boyfriend comes over a lot, and we're happy, but I know he wants to go out and 'do stuff'. However, I don't have the desire to go out and get stupid face drunk with a bunch of random people I don't know/like, and I don't have the money to spend to go out for nice meals or fun activities like bowling or concerts. People question me all the time, about why I never go out on Friday nights, and honestly--it doesn't bother me that I don't. I'm an artist, and I have a little studio set up in my apartment, I cook amazing food for myself, my boy, and friends, and a few friends from home come visit me once in a while. 

I'm not shy, I'm not quiet, I just like being alone. Is that so wrong? 
I actually have a job as a performer, which has rekindled my love of dance. I love theater, art, fashion, animals and music. I have an awesome GPA, a great internship. I'm attractive, I work out, I have an amazing boyfriend, and to the few friends who I still call 'best', they're amazing. I know what's happening in our world, I've got a goofy personality, I'm kind of a big kid.

However, since I don't go out and get drunk every weekend, I'm afraid people have started to think I'm either: boring, stuck up, or mean. What if I don't WANT to talk to some people? I think I am a bit stuck up, I think I deserve the best, and I honestly don't mess with people who aren't worth my time. If you don't interest me, I probably won't talk to you a second time. Is that rude and stuck up? If so, fine, but I want to avoid the 'boring'. I would like to have a group of friends at school that I can mesh with my boyfriend, people who I actually get along with, not just people I go out with cause I'm bored, I just don't know how to make that first step.

....Sorry that was so long.

Main thing is: Messed up childhood that sent me into a downward spiral of feeling unworthy, I was built back up for about two years, and I am back in my spiral again. "
m0prn,70,2011-11-04,"Netsec, what is your beef with college graduates?",InsaneAngler,netsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/m0prn/netsec_what_is_your_beef_with_college_graduates/,"Recently I was poking around on here and discovered this subreddit. I think the content here is my favorite out of all of the subs I have on all of Reddit. There is one thing that has been bothering me though, the negativity towards traditional education; and even pursuits towards professional certifications.

The one that really set this thread in motion was the thread about a Master's in Cyber Security (www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/lxqxq/im_currently_pursuing_a_degree_in_cyber_security/). Now, I understand that a degree with that title sounds cheesy, generalized, and even shallow. But the fact of the matter is that no one in that thread knew the institution or what the program looked like. Instead of asking those questions the flames began to burn, and people start throwing this snarky comments onto the thread about how people pursuing education don't actually know anything, don't have a clue to begin with, or simply don't know as much as poster ""x"". 

To me this is total bullshit. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems, and I was exposed to a lot more in pursuit of an ultimate goal than I ever would have on my own. I was taught by one of Sun's former educators (the guys that used to write the white papers) in Solaris / Unix administration, a 20 year I.T. vet from TD Ameritrade, a former NSA computer scientist, an M.I.T. graduate who designed a large portion of software that Maryland's state institutions utilize, a lead network engineer at DISA, etc... I was exposed to a wealth of knowledge that no one person possesses. Also, on top of that, my pursuit of a degree is what got me in the door at a Fortune 500 company as an intern that upon completion turned into my current job. 

My point now is that I decided to continue onto my Master's because I know that I will not be willing to go back when I have a family of my own. I opted to go to UMBC's Cybersecurity program under the direction of Dr. Richard Forno (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Forno). In my first semester alone I have been able to meet General Hayden, been taught by the Director of Defense Cyber Security Capabilities at HP, and a current CISSP - ISSEP at NSA. 

This program, while being in it's infancy, has offered me access to two things that General Hayden said are not in place for the defense of the United States; policy and law in regards to cyberspace as a domain (think air, land, sea). 

So here's my question Reddit, if all of these people are endorsing programs like this, as well as government agencies, contractors, etc... what gives you the right to shit on educational programs like that? I'm not coming out of this expecting a six figure salary, and a management position. I'm not coming out looking to command people with no formal education. I'm trying to get my foot in the door and I'm trying to be effective when I get inside.

Also, prior to this, I've coded, used snort, aircrack, nmap, nessus, etc... all on my own. So to those that say ""you went to make money, not because you're passionate"" as someone so politely PM'd me after a recent post of mine, no, I went because I'm passionate, I went because I love this shit and I wanted to learn more.

So what is the big anti-education shit about?

TL;DR
My academics have gotten me exposed to high level thinkers, current working professionals, an internship that turned into a job, and acceptance into a master's degree program that I feel will keep me progressing. I see nothing wrong with trying to better myself, so why the cynical attitude?

EDIT:

I'd like to thank all of you participating in this thread. I think for the first time I've actually seen legitimate arguments in on both sides of the coin. I for one have decided that I would like to get out of the high level aspect of things and pursue another avenue more geared towards the Master's in Information Systems that is heavily based around programming / database development, and the security related to that.

Thanks all again for keeping it civil and keeping the trolls out."
m04tx,24,2011-11-04,Not feeling like I get any closer to my boyfriend...,forgotyourname,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m04tx/not_feeling_like_i_get_any_closer_to_my_boyfriend/,"I apologize beforehand for this post being freakishly long. TL;DR below.




I'm a 22 yr old female and my boyfriend is 26. We've been together for 10 months and known each other for about a year. So far, at least on the surface, it's a excellent relationship considering we've (literally) never fought. Actually the closest we have come to ""fighting"" was over a misunderstanding, over text mind you, that wasn't even completely serious. I didn't even know it was a fight until he mentioned it a day later when we actually got to speak face-to-face, if that gives any perspective. 




Anyway, I understand that 10 months might still be a little soon for ""i love you's"" and other sweet nothings, but I'm getting to the point where I'm becoming concerened about the length of time we've been together not presenting any sort of ""sign"" that we have created some kind of emotional bond or attachment. Clearly, saying ""I love you"" is an obvious statement of that bond, right? So what gives? I feel so silly with being concerened with time...it just seems unsual to me. Should I just let it be?





Before anyone tells me that it isn't his responsibility to say it first or anything like that, I completely understand. I would tell him that I loved him if I truly felt it. So why haven't I? Well, this is where the real problem begins...





I have my suspicions that he has a crush on another girl whom he has spoken of several times in the past. Fortunately, for me, this girl lives over 1k miles, several states, away from us, so whatever ""crush"" he may or may not have will continue to remain just that. :) 

He is an atheist, and he refers to her as his ""crazy christian friend."" At one point while he spoke of her, (I'm not entirely sure this statment is relevant because I may not have been dating him at the time), he was rambling about her and mentioned that the only reason he wouldn't date her was because of her beliefs. Then, under his breath, mentioned he'd go Christian for her. Heh. Yeah, what? He also has a picture of her on his phone. They talk from time to time. She wrote on his wall, on his birthday, that she ""wish[es] you were here!"" I'll admit, I did a bit of facebook investigating (stalking). She's attractive, she studies the same thing he does, and they have plenty in common from what I see. Why wouldn't he have a crush on her?





Bottom line: My suspicions about this crush are holding me back from wanting to get close to him because my past relationships have consisted of ex-boyfriends who were still hung up about a girl they couldn't be with, (it's like I'm always a secondary choice.) And of course, I would be devastated if it came down to that. I don't know how upset I would be with him, but I know for a fact that I would be torn up at allowing a thing like this happen to me again. 





Needless to say, this all makes me uncomfortable, and I understand that some of it is a bit irrational, but I can't help if I feel upset. I haven't confronted him about this for several reasons: 

* I keep telling myself it may not be *that* bad/legitimate. 

* I'm not really known for bringing up drama, and I don't want to bring up drama at such a critical point in the semester. It's not the right time. 

* I wanted to get a (hopefully) unbiased opinion from a close friend, and you guys FIRST to  organize my thoughts, somewhat, and not blow up on him and just start saying everything that's on my mind. I realized that would be a terrible idea.





I like this guy, a lot. Perhaps even love him if I can get past the things that bother me. He's a nice guy, and I trust him enough not to hurt me willingly. I have a tendency to tell him what's on my mind, but I've been incapable of telling him about this because of the aforementioned reasons. Overall, I would be sad to let him go. I'm just wondering  how to approach this, or if I really am taking some things out of context. Or maybe even suggestions on how to make a clean break, if it boils down to that. Thanks everyone.




**TL;DR: Possible crush getting in the way of emotionally bonding between boyfriend and I.**

**Edit:** formatting

**Edit:** I should mention the length of their friendship isn't that much longer than than the length of time he's known me. They met in the summer at an internship that took place in her state just prior to the semester when I would meet him upon his return home. Logically, he's known her, in real life terms, for about a month or less. So any friendship that they continue to have remains strictly on an online/phone basis. Just thought this piece of information might be useful..."
lzv9u,1,2011-11-03,Girlfriend can't orgasm.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lzv9u/girlfriend_cant_orgasm/,"Is it stupid to want to end my 5 year relationship because my girlfriend absolutely is incapable of having an orgasm?  I'm 32. She is 26. I have tried everything and she just can't cum. It completely ruins it for me. I don't even want to have sex with her because it's like ""what's the point?""
It's like having a supercar that doesn't run right.  She is super hot and I am pretty sure damn near every guy would want to have sex with her. But I don't even want to any more because she can't climax. It's just not sexy when she can't get into it.

Ok before you go off on me and my ""terrible"" skills you need to know: We have tried everything...even vibrators while fucking and she still can't cum.  

I have been with other girls and they were all very pleased in bed. Every girl I have been with has had multiple orgasms with me. Don't go off about ""how do you know they weren't lying?""  They weren't. 

The biggest thing for me is that it was very easy to get all of these other girls off. They let you know what they like. All I had to do was pay a little attention to their bodies reactions and it was easy. My girlfriend can't even communicate with words, much less communicate with body language.  

We lived in the same town for two and a half years then I moved to go to grad school and she moved to do her internship.  She couldn't cum then either...but she drank and smoked a lot so I figured it was that.  Now we live together and she is sober and she still can't cum. I can't picture spending my life with a woman who can't do something as simple as having an orgasm.  What do you think? Is this fucked up? I'm also kinda mad because I feel like I used to be good in bed and now I don't even try. It's useless.  I could give you details.  I mean I have done marathon foreplay, oral and fuck sessions with no results. I feel like sex is just pointless if it's with her.

I am a student at RIT that will be returning from an internship in Boston at the end of November.

Sufficed to say, finding a place to move back to Rochester that will allow my dog is not going well. 

Dog: http://imgur.com/a/2TLO4 Her name is Calico. She would need a home until the end of May / beginning of June.

She is somewhere around 6 years old. She is very well house trained and is great with people. Age and number does not matter. However, she would need to be the only pet in the house.

She is my first dog, and has been the greatest first dog I can imagine. She is very quiet. I got her when she was about 3-4 and it was 3 months until I even knew she could bark.

She loves to play tug of war and cuddle on the couch.

All food, toys, and various supplied will be provided. She has been spayed and has all shots up to date until well into 2013.

She has no problems during the day, and as long as she is fed and walked in the morning, she is good for 8-12 hours. I typically only walk her twice a day. If she does have to go out she will start doing tricks to let you know.

So if you've been thinking about getting your first dog, or just want to help both Calico and myself out, let me know!"
m1kbz,65,2011-11-05,"I have an idea for a peaceful, but extremely effective, protest in the United States Capitol Building. But I need your help!!",rastabrah,occupywallstreet,https://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/m1kbz/i_have_an_idea_for_a_peaceful_but_extremely/,"In the Capitol building, the heart of where laws are made, there are Senate and House galleries that are completely open to the public, provided you have a gallery pass. 

After watching the video of the protesters at Governor Scot Walker's fancy breakfast, and seeing how effective it was to use the human megaphone, I began thinking about where else this could be employed. Why not the place where laws are actually made? A lot of people here have been saying we need to change our target, and this would be an amazing way to have our voices heard. 

There have been some protesters in various congress buildings off and on, but they have been extremely uncoordinated, and overpowered quite easily. If we had 50, or even 100 people yelling at the top of their lungs, there would be no way that they could silence us before our message was made clear. 

I have the capacity of securing these gallery passes, but I don't have a bunch of people who are willing to do this. I would be risking my job by doing this, and I would try my best to not get caught, but fuck it. I'm an intern. I don't get paid anyways, and I'm not trying to get a job through this in any way. This would be well worth any repercussions I would suffer. 

ON A RELATED NOTE - Many, it not all people who participate in this will likely be apprehended on the charge of ""Disrupting Congress"", although they do a pretty good job of doing that themselves, which carries a mandatory 4 hour incarceration, and up to a 6 month incarceration, but that has only been administered once ever. Please discuss, feel free to give me suggestions, and feel free to let me know if you can help me arrange this. "
m1bmq,3,2011-11-05,"She's lost her self image, and I feel solely responsible. What do you think?",throwowowowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m1bmq/shes_lost_her_self_image_and_i_feel_solely/,"I'[m] 21, as is she. Been going out nine months, LDR the whole time (two hour plane), and I'm considering moving in with her once my internship is over.

Our relationship is something that came out of the blue for a lot of people, but we were tight as can be for a good while. She has the exact same interests as me, she has the same childish brain, and I think the absolute world of her. Always have, always will, regardless of what could reasonably happen.

I'm a man that believes in his morals - I have a pretty big aversion to lying, and I always feel better knowing that I've answered a question honestly. I'm from a student town, where me, my circle of friends, and their boyfriends/girlfriends are very open about sex, checking out members of the opposite sex, etc. This is a pretty stark contrast to my SO (let's call her Sarah), who has been with a social group where this seems reasonably taboo, at least when they're being serious. She's had two exes - one of which she went out with for seven years, and both of which cheated on her.

Fast forward a few months. Everything's awesome, we fly up and down to see each other every few weeks or so. One night when she's at mine, Sarah asks me if I check out other girls. I, being honest, give her the honest answer. I know it's not right to make assumptions based on other relationships, but every ex I've had had been accepting of the fact, since it's such a common thing, regardless of relationship status. I figured it wouldn't be a biggie to say so. Turns out I was very wrong.

Sarah burst into tears. Needless to say, it wasn't pretty. From here on out, when I've said something that might allude to this subject, even if I'm just joking around with buddies, she goes quiet, sometimes leaves the conversation, and it gets hard to communicate with her. Things start to fluctuate between being all good and being not so good.

Now, things seem to be taking a turn for the worst. I was up to see her last weekend, and she seemed a lot more distant than normal, and it still feels like that's the case now. I don't like saying negative things about her, but she has been a lot more critical about my flaws lately - generally to do with my more laid-back attitude to things, whereas she's a lot more planned out. She says that her self-image has been shattered because of what I said, and that she enjoyed the lie that she was being fed. Now, she feels unattractive, to the point where she is incredibly insecure whenever we go somewhere together, or even when we're with my friends. She's less inclined to cuddle at night, and she says her mind won't accept it when I tell her what I think about her (all positive, of course).

I feel like I'm at wit's end. I really don't know what to do or say. Regardless, I feel responsible. I feel like I've taken one of the things that mean most in life, and driven my boot right through it. A lot of people say that honesty is key, but have I been *too* honest?

**tl;dr - Had an awesome thing going with a girl, she seems shattered at the fact that I check out other girls (guys, I hope you understand what I mean by this.) Relationship has deteriorated, and I feel responsible. Am I right to feel this way?**"

I loved watching the horses and picking up on their individual personalities, there was totally a silly 'Pinkie Pie' horse and a bully 'Trixie' horse!

Unfortunately, I am very nearly dirt poor. I'm a student, and I'm currently living off of my boyfriends monthly disability check after the business I worked for went belly up. I didn't/still don't have the energy to work AND go to school (as it is an incredibly physical internship), so my boyfriend and I decided to stick out these last two months on his check (which covers rent/utilities and leaves about $60 for the rest of the month). We're in the process of foodstamps, but that very well may not pan out. 


My question to r/keto is - are there any foods that can be considered the keto version of ramen that I can get for cheap and will sustain me?

He is severely physically disabled, though mentally just fine. He basically can only move his face and his hand a tiny bit, which he uses to operate his computer. It seemed to go pretty well - some of our staff taught him about programming and I had some short chats with him. He's nice but very shy. During that time he had a pro caregiver with him all the time.
Now he's coming back for a longer internship, but without the caregiver so he can try gaining some independence. He's told us that as long as people are around to help him out if he needs something (such as scratching his head or moving his leg) that he can go without the caregiver (this is also a plus for his family financially).

Everyone in the office is happy to help. But we have no experience with this kind of thing. Personally, I think it will be as good for us as it will be for him and we're happy to have him. But I want to know what I can do to make his time with us as good as possible for everyone (I'm kind of the office manager). I mean, obviously I am going to talk to him and try to make him feel welcome, but not sure what else I need to be thinking of. All the really basic stuff like getting in the building and setting his computer up is already taken care of.

One thing I'm worried about is people tend to get really absorbed in their own work and wear headphones. I don't wear headphones but I can't be there every minute. It's a totally open plan office where we sit around big tables, so if he spoke up someone would probably take notice, but he can't even wave at us so I'm worried he'll need something and no one will notice him. Also, he's very quiet and shy so he's going to have to be a bit louder... I think it will be good for him to gain a little confidence speaking out as well. Should I just ask him to, like, email us if we're being oblivious?? Seems silly to email someone sitting right near you....

Not something that is likely to make a big difference, but I suppose anything helps! Here's the email I sent:

Hello Daily Show Team,

I really enjoy your programming, and I always look forward to watching a new episode and getting my Daily dose of news! However, I have a quick question: Why aren't you doing more pieces on the Occupy protests? I understand that there is substantially more humor in Black Walnut's sex scandals. I also know that it's a clusterfuck in the republican party at the moment, and that's like shooting fish in a barrel of comedic glory. Also, as New Yorkers you're probably sick to death of having your morning coffee run interrupted by Occupiers. 

However, there is history being made in these protests, just as there was history being made in the Tea Party protests. The difference has become that one was increasingly covered by the mainstream media, including the Daily Show, and has become a national  force, while the other--while just as large-- is being shunned by the news networks and is not being given the same chance at publicity. There is something huge happening in cities all around America, and as a viewer I would like to know why these people, who seem to be average, middle class Americans, are flocking to their streets day after day in what appears to be an increasingly unrecognized effort to change the status quo.

When former U.S. Marine Scott Olsen suffered a major head wound in the protests I figured the video of him laying injured on the ground while police kept his would-be-rescuers at bay with projectiles would be all over the Daily Show. Police firing on unarmed protesters, some of whom are ex-Military members, who are advocating a change in a corrupt system seemed like Daily Show gold. However, I was disappointed to see that your team did not have any stories about the protesters, instead focusing on stories like ""Hotdogs are 20% more likely to give you colon cancer, says wack-a-doodle group."" Not that your work is not funny, but in times like these it is disappointing to see your lack of interest in what has been the biggest liberal political movement in my lifetime. 

I suppose what I'm asking is that if you're going to talk the liberal ""we need a change in the system"" talk, Daily Show, you should walk the ""we need a change in the system"" walk. If you advocate a change, if you believe that money shouldn't be the only reason someone's opinion matters, and if you truly think that the financial situation in America today is something that desperately needs changing you should be at least giving coverage to the only people who are willing to sacrifice their time and energy to bring these issues to the center stage. 

I've watched several times as the Daily Show brought light to things that needed to be changed. I was extremely proud of my support of your show when I watched John Stewart and Steven Colbert take the stage at the Rally to Restore Sanity/ Fear (admittedly I watched from in between the porter potties, but I was still proud, even if it was a smelly pride). I was with you even more when you fought to bring attention to the injustices of the Nine Eleven First Responders. You proved that a ""fake news show"" had the power to not only bring attention to very important issues, but to directly effect the success or failure of their needs. Well, the American people need some attention brought to the OWS protesters. Even if you don't agree with their message it is still important to give people the information about the movement so they can make an informed choice over whether or not they to believe the protest to be valid. It seems odd to me that you've covered a group you're opposed to more than the movement who's views seem to line up with your own. It also seems odd to me that I'm appealing to a comedy show to bring me my news, but I suppose that's what kind of world I'm living in. In the end, my appeal is probably not going to be read,  but I like to thing that maybe, just maybe, this will end up in the hands of some intern who will pass it down the line, and I'll turn on my TV one night this week to seem some accurate, intelligent reporting on what the OWS protesters want, instead of a picture of a guy shitting on a cop car, with no other context about the protests. 

Thank you very much for your time, and, as always, I look forward to your next show!

m4gur,0,2011-11-07,Just an out-there theory (spoilers),angerman92,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/m4gur/just_an_outthere_theory_spoilers/,"What if (since Dexter/Brian obviously believe Jonah is copying his father) Dexter goes to Nebraska and kills Jonah, but then later in the season he finds out that it wasn't actually Jonah who killed his family, it was the new intern.
His motive: Get revenge for the death of his Idol (Dexter)
He's good with computers, so he could easily use the station's to find out where the family was relocated.
Obviously this would lead to him being crazy and he would end up on Dexter's table saying something like ""I was only trying to help you.""

Like I said, it's an out-there theory and probably won't happen. I just think it's an interesting thought."

m5o4g,4,2011-11-08,[REQUEST] Internal Hard Drive,[deleted],RandomKindness,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/m5o4g/request_internal_hard_drive/,"Hi, I am a 'starving college student' as they say. Almost half my tuition is paid with loans and since recent financial aid cuts, I only get exactly enough to cover tuition, fees, and books. I do not have a laptop, but I'm still content with taking the bus around campus to access a desktop to do my work - it is fine with me. I am currently looking forward to getting a job this summer as an intern (Or 'co-op') for an engineering company. Hopefully this will help my financial struggles. 

That being said, I only have ~$1500 in the bank left from my first year of college  when I took the full amount of loans offered. This year, I HAD to take the full amount just to cover the fees and tuition. I am now using the money from last year to pay for food. Pertaining to the summer job I want to get, I also need some way of getting a car, although I am confident my parents for help in this matter, even though they are short on money as well. That being said, I am planning on using the remaining money to buy a stable, dependable desktop computer for use at home. 

Looking back at my childhood, I have come to the realization that my cousin repeatedly stuck my family with crappy built computers. The parts were cheap, the OS was pirated, and the gaming never felt satisfactory. I have decided to spend part of my loan money to build a desktop (it came out to about $600) that I will be content with. It is not close to anything fancy, but just closing in on acceptable modern technology in my opinion. 

The problem is, however, with the recent flooding in Thailand and its effects on the prices of Internal Hard Drives. I am now much deterred from purchasing a Hard Drive after the recent prices sky-rocketing. I am sort of conflicted now since I am hesitating, because at the same time I know that the prices will only go higher as suppliers run out of stock. I was wondering if anyone stockpiles these things; I've heard of people buying multiple 1 TB hard drives periodically as a habit. If anyone can spare a 500GB -1 TB, 7200 RPM, 3-6 SATA Hard Drive, I would most appreciatively pay for a generous price. Thanks! I hope this did not sound too greedy."

I've been stressing about my schoolwork and grades and finals soon, my relationship with my boyfriend, a dick roommate, upcoming internship applications I need to finish, lack of sleep, and the sinus infection that I'm just starting to get over.
I start crying over the simplest things--today it was getting locked out of my apartment, yesterday because my room is such a mess and I don't have time to clean it up, the day before because it was my estranged dad's birthday. I'm even tearing up writing this.
I know its part of transitioning into adulthood (I'm a sophomore in college and 19 years old) but it's becoming too much to bear.

So, with that out of the way, what are your best stress relief tips? I'm in desperate need of some woman-to-woman advice.

Edit: You ladies are so great. Thanks for all the wonderful advice. I'm going to take some advil, alternate eating ice cream and drinking, and plug away on my programming project--and test out all of your other suggestions out soon. Thank you once again :')"
m7wbt,1,2011-11-10,Gf receding at the speed of light - or maybe it's all relative and I'm the one going away?,a_quiet_sort,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m7wbt/gf_receding_at_the_speed_of_light_or_maybe_its/,"**Background: M21** dating **F21** for 3 months, best friends for months before that and friend/acquaintances since 3 years ago. Had some initial concerns that since she's going to study abroad for 6 mo. starting in January that maybe dating was a bad idea, but any amazing first month and a half more or less overcame those . . . turned out to be as compatible in bed as in every other respect, and had a great time together whenever we went out.

**Problem:** about a month ago, had a shit week and felt really angry with myself for stupid choices I've made as a student. Angry me is scary, somewhat, and I tried to shoo gf away, but of course she was concerned so we have a not-fight in which I mostly feel guilty for being a lousy bf and getting so angry with myself and try to apologize for the next week more than I really should have (would have been better to let it go). Next weekend gf has a almost equally bad day and I again end up feeling shitty for not making her feel better. We spend the next week apologizing more and in the end nearly have an argument because neither of us wants to say anything is the other person's fault (stupid, I know).

Ever since then she has gotten busier and busier and I can't help but feel that she is drifting away. There isn't any time for us to be together except the small holes in her 10am-10pm schedule, she's usually gone on the weekends for family or events or internship hunting. She no longer wants me to be around when she tries to do work after class is done because during the week when we couldn't stop apologizing she got fed up with me being there and hasn't changed her mind. Sex stopped. Once in the last three weeks, once the week before. Down from . . . well, anytime we were together, basically. Mostly because she's too tired, I think. 

She's keeping secrets, too. She went to the doctor last week and accidentally mentioned it to me. I asked if she was feeling alright and she said it turned out to be nothing, but ""nothing"" doesn't usually end up with a prescription that she didn't mean to mention either until she accidentally dropped the bottle from her purse when looking for her credit card a week later and admitted was from the doctor visit. Still don't know what it's for or if she's ok or not, she was evasive and I don't actually care what it is as long as she's fine - it's the evasion that worries me . . . 

There are whole topics she won't discuss; certain activities and groups she's a member of that she thinks I don't like or ideas that we'd fight over. She thinks I have a negative outlook on life and the future for myself personally and people generally (I'm a pragmatist, I admit, but not a gloom and doom sort) and I swear it's all from that week I felt shitty. **Basically I feel like she lost all but the absolute minimum level of trust in me - trust that I care and trust that she can talk to me; and like somehow I went from seeing her semi-daily six months ago to hours and hours a day when we started dating to 3-4 hours a week now - if I ""bother"" her. That's less time than she spends in certain classes or even at some group meetings in a week. I'm not part of her life, I just suddenly became filler.**

The irl friends I talked to have basically said that even if I'm crazy and overreacting like a boss about some of this stuff, she definitely has stopped interacting with not just me but everyone, and they can tell we aren't as happy anymore, the few times they've seen us together. Their advice - tell her the paragraph above this and list the things from 2 paragraphs up as evidence of weirdness and either she'll change or I go. Any other words of wisdom how to handle this mess reddit? Because I like this girl. A lot. I started to fall in the lower-case kind of love with her - I will fight for her attention if there's a chance I can win that fight. If there is."

Context: I have had a really rough semester. My beloved uncle died within the first week of school, I've had to go through a slew of unpleaseant medical tests on top of getting strep throat and a 2nd degree burn, I crushed hard on a guy who turned out to be nothing but bad news for me, and my financial aid got reduced by $3k and I don't have rent money for next month. I've had to drop my favorite class and I've been starting to wonder if I'll ever get my shit together and really make something of my life. I've been desperately needing me some good Autumn days to center myself but our indian summer lasted through all of October, and it leaves me feeling so off-kilter. I feel like I've had nothing but tough days for a long time now.

It almost seems like my bad luck was a by-product of that summer overstaying its welcome. As soon as the weather finally tipped into fall, things changed completely. 

Totally out of the blue, I got a phone call from the director of a research group that's doing *crazy cool*, state-of-the-art work in immunogenetics and donor matching. My resume had been kicking around their email servers for a while and she thought I'd be a good fit for a position in her lab. We talked for a while and everything clicked - I was quite literally exactly what she was looking for. I just went in for an interview today, and the more she talked about the work they're doing the more excited I got. Within a couple of hours she called me back and asked me if I'd come on board as an intern, to be upgraded to salaried employee once this project was done. This is literally the job I figured I'd start looking for *after* I finished my master's two years from now. I'm so beyond excited and completely shocked. (Of course, I said yes!)

I told a few people in my program about it, and by mid-day people I hadn't talked to in ages were coming by my office to congratulate me on my new position. People were commenting all over my facebook wall about it. It was unbelievable. I felt so on top of the world. I even promised my 40 algebra students music and donuts on Monday, I was so happy. (what have I *done*?!)

And just to add to all of that, I am in the midst of a beautiful blossoming romance with a wonderful ent who supports and dotes on me something fierce and cooks fresh veggies with me and makes me smile constantly. Hell, I was basking in twitterpation the moment I got the phone call.

I just feel so blessed right now. Life had been so rocky for so long, and I almost feel as if the universe put me through all that just so I could really appreciate it when things were really, really great. It's very deeply humbling.

Sisters, always remember that when you make room for blessings in your life, they have a funny way of showing up. I feel like I'm practically glowing with good vibes and I'm sending it your way, entwives. This toke's for you &lt;3

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words! I'm trying to focus on cruising on the ""I can do fucking ANYTHING"" feeling while bringing good energy to those around me, I'm glad I got to dish it out to you first!"
m79fg,0,2011-11-10,Sometimes it feels like I'm doing all the work and accommodation in my long distance relationship.,is_it_worth_it,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/m79fg/sometimes_it_feels_like_im_doing_all_the_work_and/,"(Wow, this ended up a lot longer than I expected, apologies.)

Me: 21, male, Chinese for background reasons (see below)

Her: 23, female. Vietnamese.

It's a long-distance relationship in almost the longest sense possible. I'm in America, and she's all the way around the world. We met each other during my study abroad. I fell in love with her instantly: she was cute, happy, and kind. I confessed to her, and she reciprocated. We were in love. I felt giddy. We kissed, I stayed over at her house, we did everything except have sex since she was a virgin and she didn't feel that she was ready.

We kept a long-distance relationship after I returned to America. I was an only child, and so my parents probably doted on me more so than your average parent. It was my first relationship but they are already seeing this as something with marriage potential, which of course, gave my girlfriend and I something to fret about because that meant we had to think about the future. We didn't want to think about the future particularly: probably because the future is so uncertain. We talked about the possibility of her moving to America, but it's in so vague terms that we both didn't believe in it. I don't even have U.S. citizenship yet, so before that can happen she has to be here on a visa if she wants to stay in America for the long term.

She will graduate from college soon, but she does not know her future upon graduation. My parents doesn't want me to leave them very far away at all: they are Chinese, and Chinese children are supposed to be fairly filial. Her parents probably think so as well, but I think they would have no problem with her coming to America.

We try to work through that. 

My parents, in the meantime, have already asked me about the pros and cons about being with the girl. They like the fact that she's nice and kind, but they don't like the fact that she once collapsed due to exhaustion combined with a heart problem (I think it's irregular/fast beating) that I may have to spend a ton of money treating her if we are ever married. They even threw a hypothetical that if we got married and she died when I was still relatively young. She was pretty sad and disappointed when she heard they had said that. 

She is stressed about the future and the prospects my parents and I make about coming to America. Because truthfully, I would prefer America to Vietnam as well. Mostly because of the job and green card thing.

We are 4 months into our relationship and 3 months into the long-distance relationship. We try to talk every single day, and Skype frequently (maybe a little bit every other day). But lately, she seems to be more stressed out and depressed. I told her that I would visit her in Japan (which is where she goes to university despite her family in Vietnam) during the winter if I found an internship before then to finance my travel, and she is somehow scared of the idea. Maybe it's because of the prospect and the pressure my parents place on her, I don't know.

A couple of days ago, she wanted to message each other less. I understand that it's the 3-month period of a long-distance relationship and have tried to actually talk more. But she said that it's the commitment of talking (maybe about the same things and fretting over the same things without conclusion) every single day that she doesn't find appealing. We actually just talked about it, and I've suggested giving her some space and time by herself, but she waffles on my question of what I could do so that we eventually talk more in the future.

Thirdly, she does not want intimate chats. I know that we did everything short of having sex while studying abroad, but for some reason she's against the idea. I feel that intimate and sexy talks make us like each other more and usually try to bring it up. Also, I'm sexually attracted to her, figures. But she doesn't want to.

What should I do? I still love her, and I know that she still loves me. But it seems like I'm the one doing all the accommodating in the relationship. From perhaps talking to being affectionate to comforting her to finding out what's on her mind. If we continue as I've suggested, giving her space and maybe talking to her less, would it be beneficial to the relationship from her perspective?

m78nk,17,2011-11-10,PA needs advice.,Probably_Unemployed,FilmIndustryLA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/m78nk/pa_needs_advice/,"So, I'm 22 years old and I've been out here in LA about 6 months, from New York.  I graduated college, but not from a fancy film school.  I have edited a high quality documentary which has won a ton of awards (accepted to Harlem Intl. Film Fest) and got its own segment on the CBS Early Show.  I wasn't the smartest kid in school, but I have a lot of common sense and a lot of knowledge of film.  I've done 2 internships which proved useless (when I'm the one showing my ""boss"" how to key out a green screen, it's safe to say I'm learning nothing), one of them didn't even know it was my last day at the internship; I assume they expected me to just stay forever.  Neither of them offered jobs.

I have 8 years of editing experience and 4 years of camera operation experience, professional cameras, DSLRs, crappy handhelds, etc.  I had my own television series in college with a zero dollar budget.

I work my ass off all the time whenever I can find work.  People wonder why I'm a PA and wonder why I haven't been asked to do something more meaningful.  I've done the whole work for free, build my network thing off of craigslist/mandy/entertainmentcareers/etc.  The only problem is that these people that I work for SAY they're going to call me back for more work or SAY that it'll be worth my time to work on their project.  Being the stupid, hopeful kid that I am, I continue to work on these projects and nothing has come of them.  In fact, in the 6 months I've been here and the 20-30 projects that I've worked on, only 1 person has called me back and it was for one job.  I'm really sick of these people.

People keep telling me ""Oh, you're only 22, you have plenty of time.""  I might only be 22, but I'm sure there are people who have the fancy film school degrees and have awesome film reels.  They're 5 steps ahead of me, how the hell am I supposed to compete with that?

No one in my family works in the industry, so that's out the window.  Any connections I've made have been meaningless.  No one seems to like to return my phone calls, emails or hand written letters, regardless of how many I've made.  I apply to internships and office PA jobs everyday and have yet to land anything.  The only words my father (an oral surgeon) has for me are, ""You do that everyday?  Man, that really sucks.""

Now, I realize it's only been 6 months, but it's just starting to feel hopeless.  That, and I'm sort of running out of money; minimum wage jobs aren't cutting it since I live by myself and don't really know anyone.  I've had my resume looked at by others and they say it looks great.  I have 7 professional references.

I'm not looking for sympathy.  I'm looking for advice.  What can I do to find more paying work?  To find more non-garbage work?  An office PA job?  Anything worth my while?  Any websites I don't know about?  I'm not here to fuck around with worthless short-films that will go nowhere or spec commercials.  No, I can't work deferred.  Does that IMDb credit pay my rent this month?  No?  I can't work for that either then.  My end-game is wide open (except editing) (edit: I say wide open because right now, I'll do anything that pays.  My ideal is to get into producing television / showrunning / UPM / any other synonymous terms). 

I don't want to have to give up and go into something boring like IT or programming. "

m9yl9,2,2011-11-12,How should I wait?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m9yl9/how_should_i_wait/,"Ok time for a little background. So me and my close friend have known each other for about three years now. We've always got along really well and been really close for the entire time of our friendship;however, we were both in serious longterm relationships for the first 1.5 years for me and 2 years for her. So our friendship was platonic and we we're both friends with each other's exes. 

Earlier this year my relationship ended and it was messy and I spent some time getting over it. Also I'm in college and spent the Summer away from my friends for an internship. While I was gone for the Summer my friend broke up with her boyfriend. When I came back we both started hanging out a lot and became even closer. We avoided doing anything together for a long time because we both really treasured each other's friendship, but finally we couldn't stop and started basically dating. 

Things were going really well. We really liked each other and loved spending time together. It seemed very natural and didn't seem awkward even though we had been friends for so long. That ended up being the problem we fell for each other really fast and even though it had been a while since the end of my relationship it had been less for her. Even though she mentioned that she was worried about going from one serious relationship into another one but it was too hard for us to not see each other.

About a week ago she got really afraid that she was just going to let that doubt grow and end up resenting me. So she said that she thought it would be a good idea for us to tone things back for a while. She basically was saying that there was not enough time in between me and her last boyfriend and she thinks she needs to wait some time before she can start another relationship.

So basically we're back to being friends for now. We still see each other definitely less than before and we're not hooking up anymore. She says she wants to not be with anyone for a while and settle down and then when she's comfortable be with me completely without having to worry about it being too soon.

I really care about her and I am definitely not ready to move on and I don't want to. We we're working really well and we didn't stop seeing each other because it was incompatible but because of circumstances. Also I know this isn't some excuse for her to see other guys or w/e (which I know is going to be reddit's first response lol). I'm smarter than to let myself wait for that. She was very sincere and had been honest with me the whole time and truly seems like she just wants circumstances to be right. 

What should I do to help her get clarity about us while still not losing my connection to her? Do any other redditors think this will just be a short term thing before she realizes that the timing isn't something she can control. Or am I being naive waiting?

m9mta,8,2011-11-12,"Dear r/rapecounseling, I am planning to file suit against my rapist. I want your input and advice!",[deleted],rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/m9mta/dear_rrapecounseling_i_am_planning_to_file_suit/,"Hi, and thanks for taking the time to look at my post.

I'm a 17-year-old male living in Washington state. This summer, I was a camper and unpaid intern at YMCA Camp Orkila on Orcas Island. During my time in August as an intern, I was raped at night in an open-air cabin by a paid staff member of the camp; a cabin counselor. It was an absolutely horrific experience, and it was made much worse by the fact that there were more than a dozen sleeping children around age 11 within eyesight and earshot of us, which prevented me from screaming or calling for help. I mean, I could've, but... I couldn't allow myself to make that memory a part of their lives.

I avoided contact with him the following morning, and as soon as possible, I told my supervisor. She went to her supervisor. The San Juan County Sheriff police were called. They collected testimony from both of us, and interviewed the children in the cabin. Thankfully, none of them awoke in the night. I was taken to a local clinic for a medical examination, and there was no evidence found on me (penetration was with fingers...) besides a highly-visible hickey on my neck. In my testimony, I said that I had said ""no"" (I had), but that most of it had been coercion and fear of falling out of the bunk if I had resisted (it was ~8 feet off the ground) and waking the children. The guy in question testified that it was consensual.

We were both fired by the camp. No charges were filed by the county prosecutor's office (amazing to me, and not in a good way). I have tried a few times to get in touch with the camp; they blow me off, likely at the advice of their legal team. I have gone to Camp Orkila for 5 years, and their cold shoulder caught me off guard. My fellow interns (a little over 40 of them) now speculate that what I did was consensual, and I don't want to tell them the whole story. I'm disgusted with them.

I can count the hours that I knew this man on the fingers of my hands. What he did to me was opportunistic and disgusting, and it leads me to believe that I am not his only victim. When he applies for work in the future, he will not have to acknowledge any charges indicating him to be the horrible individual he is.

I feel many emotions about this, and it's difficult for me to articulate them entirely. Anger towards him, for raping me. Anger towards the camp, for allowing a situation to exist in which it was so easy for me to be raped. Angry at the fact that he escaped scrutiny; when I got back home and saw him on Facebook (suggested friends, oh joy!) he had told his friends that he ""got hurt at camp"" and had to come back early. Angry that I probably won't be his last victim if I don't stop him. Many other feelings.

3 months later, I'm ready to seek justice. I sent my letter to the SJCS office at Friday Harbor to request a copy of my case file. I haven't seen its' contents, but I'm confident that there will be sufficient information to level charges against the camp and him, separately. I'm going to be talking to a prominent Seattle-area sexual abuse lawyer about where I can go from here once I get the case file.

All that said, whatever advice or input you can spare would be greatly appreciated. What should I know about the legal system in my situation? Is it likely that I won't find justice? Should I tell the school that my rapist goes to? (He goes to UW... I'm applying there, because I want to go...)

Again, much thanks. You're all awesome for being here."
mausi,6,2011-11-13,"Need advice after breakup. She cheated, but we're still in love.",helpmeout_throwaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/mausi/need_advice_after_breakup_she_cheated_but_were/,"It has been about 1.5 months since I (22m) broke up with my girlfriend (21) of over two years. We were perfect for each other. We have the same interests and humor, we like the same music and movies, etc. She was my best friend and I was hers. I loved her more than my family. I thought she was the one for me. We even talked about marriage often. I thought I would marry her. So, here’s what happened...

This probably started about 7 months ago, right before spring break. We are both in college. She was a junior and I was a senior, in my last semester. We are poor college students and both decide to spend the break at home. Out of no where on the second day, she breaks up with me over the phone. She didn’t intend to tell me over the phone, but I knew something was up and prodded her to tell me. This was a huge blow to me, because I didn’t think anything was wrong and we were both in love with each other. But in reality, I hadn’t been taking the relationship serious at that point. She had been asking what I thought of our future. I had been ignoring these questions (dumb by me). She also said that she wanted to be independent and grow in her early 20s. And that she didn’t want to hinder her career path by being in a relationship that she thought I wasn’t serious about. But she said that she still loved me. Over the break I thought a lot and realized that I had been foolish in neglecting to think about the future of our relationship. I had been treating this very serious relationship as if nothing was going to come from it. I realized how much I was in love with this woman and how great of a friendship I was loosing. And that I wanted to marry this girl. After the break, we talked and I found out she felt the same. She said she saw us getting back together later in life and that I was the one, but that she needed to be independent at the moment. By the way, I’m taking this horribly at the time (no appetite, trouble sleeping/concentrating on school). We hang out often over the next couple weeks, even have sex a couple of times. Around the 3rd week, she tells me she had sex with a guy (her “friend”) from her hometown. I was pretty upset over this and thought everything was over with us. But, she told me it was a huge mistake and regretted everything. A week later she wants to get back together. Another week later, I take her back. I also obviously tell her I don’t want her to hang out with the “friend” again. She agrees. Everything is wonderful again. Months pass and our relationship is better than ever.

She goes to spend a couple summer months in DC for an internship. We had a LDR the previous summer for my internship, so no big deal. School starts again. She is starting her senior year and I’m beginning graduate school at the same college. We celebrate our 2 year anniversary and things seem wonderful. A few months pass and we start to have the occasional argument, usually after we have had some drinks. One of these times, I am especially drunk and blackout. From what she tells me, I verbally abused her and tried to swing at her (all in front of a few of her friends). I remember nothing. This is so unlike my character and I am appalled at myself. I apologize many times and express my utter remorse. She says she wants space, but after a couple days she says she can't be distant from me. Things go back to normal, but start to get a little rocky.

The following weekend, I stay in to study and she goes out to the bars. I pick her up. She’s more drunk than I have ever seen her. I put her to bed at my house and then her phone lights up with a text. I normally respect her privacy, but it was from a guy that I had been suspicious of for most of our relationship. They had briefly dated before us and had remained good friends. They hang out often when she is home, usually in a group setting (he’s part of her group of ‘home’ friends). I know the guy has tried to do stuff with her, but I trust her so I’m cool with them hanging out. Anyway, I read the conversation...they are talking about wanting to fuck and she asks him how to break up with me. I can’t believe it. I ask her about it in the morning. She says she doesn’t remember sending it and is extremely apologetic. I try to justify the texts as a drunken mistake like i had made the previous weekend. Things are very shaky at this point but I think we can still work it out.

Next is when the shit hits the fan. The following weekend she confesses she had sex with the guy from the texts when she got home from DC over the summer. She also tells me that she lied about the identity of the guy she slept with over our break up and that it was the same guy. The same suspicious guy that I was okay with her hanging out with because I didn't think she had slept with him but one of his friends. So she had been lying to me for 6 months and was also hiding that she cheated on me for 2 months. I was in shock, I never dreamed she could do this. I broke up with her.

I was not only losing my love but my companion in life, my best friend. I told her we shouldn't talk because I didn’t know how I could get over her otherwise. I deleted facebook and removed everything of her memory out of my life. I’m getting along okay now. I’m just trying to immerse myself in school to occupy my mind. But she is ALWAYS on it. I miss her so much. I am definitely still in love with her. We had coffee a couple weeks ago and that has been our only conversation. She says it has been very hard for her. She says she doesn’t know herself anymore. She’s not focusing in school and is going out drinking often. She says she is still very much in love with me and misses me a lot.

Looking at this logically, I’m trying to transfer to another grad school (the original plan was for her to come with me when she graduates) and she is applying for jobs all over the country. Trying to rebuild this relationship when we’ll probably have a giant LDR soon doesn’t look promising. Last week, we had a text conversation, mostly just BS but then our relationship was inevitably brought up. She wants to meet up sometime soon to talk about us. I told her we should. We are clearly both still very much in love with each other. But we’ve both made some big mistakes and we have crossroads and opportunities that will probably be dividing our lives soon.

People of reddit, have you experienced a similar situation? What should I do? I don’t see us getting back together anytime soon. But can we get back together? Can we still be friends? If not, how can I get her off my mind?

tl;dr: I broke up w/ my GF of 2 yrs (she cheated on me). She was my bestfriend, soulmate, etc. We are still in love with each other. We want to meet up to talk about our relationship. What do I do?"

We get to see each other once a month, and during school breaks. I am a 21yo guy who is completely in love with her.

Two weeks ago she came here to spend Halloween weekend with me. We had been having some awkward conversations for a week or two, but when I would ask what was wrong, she would just say she was tired or stressed. To be honest we both had a rough October with school and our various activities. So she comes in and everything is alright, but I can tell something is off. Saturday comes and we start to fool around, but she's having problems getting going. I stop and try to get to the bottom of it and turns out she was planning on breaking up with me. She brought all of my stuff and was waiting until Sunday when she left.

I tried to be cool about it for a while, but eventually I broke down and started crying. After I got that out of my system, I told her what she did wasn't right and I wouldn't let her leave until we talked about it. So we did, and she brought a whole ton of shit to the table. She's concerned about my future because I've never gone for research opportunities or an internship (she has a fear she will marry her dad, who has never had a stable job). She feels like over that month she just stopped loving me like she used to, and feels like we're best friends now. So I said why don't we give it some time because I never got a chance to say my peace and I didn't feel like we should end what I thought was a happy relationship in the middle of the semester at a very trying time for both of us.

So now we are looking to kind of reaccess everything at winter break. I feel sad every single day, and I'm really broken up about the whole thing to the point of losing sleep every night. When we talk at night though like we normally would everything is great. I've been trying to do little extra things to show her that I love her, like I made her a playlist, and I sent her a love letter which she should get on Tuesday.

I'm having a really hard time coping with the situation though, even though I feel like it's worth it in the end regardless of the outcome because at least I tried. Any advice/tips/really anything is welcome. Talking about it helps me a lot.

Edit: I'm going to see her next weekend as well and I'm afraid I might push her into making a decision because I'm having a hard time."
mcbq0,6,2011-11-14,22/M - don't know what to think about this...,confusedX,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/mcbq0/22m_dont_know_what_to_think_about_this/,"Hey /r/ihaveissues, this is going to be a bit of a story, I'll have a tl;dr at the bottom.

My girlfriend of almost 3 years dumped me after this last summer vacation ended (she took a 3 week trip back to her home after her internship ended). I know some people will throw around the phrase ""out of the blue,"" but I can't imagine a more apt description. She started the conversation by saying ""so, do you want to talk about our relationship."" There wasn't a fight, it was how I imagine being laid off from a job would be. Other memorable quotes are ""I just don't see the point of having sex with only you knowing it's going to end in a year,"" and ""well I haven't been with that many people."" I don't remember exactly how it was worded but she said she wanted to still be friends with benefits with me. I refused.

It's been a crappy time trying to get over her, I was totally depressed and wasn't eating, every time I saw her it felt like my guts shifted and I wanted to vomit. My friends have commented on her outfits going to parties on Facebook (so I end up seeing it inadvertently), and it's very obvious what she's been looking to do, and that has made me feel worse.

So fast forward to 2 nights ago. I don't know what got into me but I took her up on her offer. I thought maybe just a one-nighter kind of thing would help me feel better, maybe add some physical closure to the situation so I stop having guttural reactions when I see her (or maybe just desperate to get laid). It actually worked, I don't feel nearly as crappy as I did, but now I'm completely confused. The sex we had wasn't the semi-callous doing whatever turned us on sex that I thought it'd be, it was insanely passionate love-making, ranked among the best we've ever had (I'm one of the romantics that distinguishes between sex and making love), during which I could tell from the feel that she hadn't been getting laid either. But, she didn't want me to leave afterwards, she tried to get me to cuddle and was kissing me non-stop, more so that she did when we were together (to the point where it could be called clingy).

So here's the source of my confusion. We're both new to the concept of sex-buddies but I'm pretty damn sure that's now how things are supposed to go. She tries to treat me like a friend in public (the 2 times we've seen each other in public), and behind closed doors and under the covers she's treating me like her boyfriend again. I have no idea what to think of this. Does it mean she still has feelings for me? Does she want to be a swinger or something? Should I set up emotional boundaries to prevent getting hurt (again)?

For me, the sex is relieving, I've made more progress towards getting over her in the last 2 days than I have in the last 2 months because of it, and because of that I don't want to stop, but I don't think it's a good idea to keep going along with the emotional things she wants to do in addition, like cuddle or hang out afterwards.

**tl;dr** Dumped by ex out of nowhere, felt like crap. She wanted to be sex buds, I tried it. It was awesome, I felt loads better but there's no way what we did was what sex buds do. Confused about what to make of it."

I'm only 24, and I told him to play aggressively, yet he does nothing. Maybe this is the norm with financial advisors, and if that's the case, then I'll just keep doing what I'm doing but, I feel really left out of the loop about my money. 

I have no debt, I reliably get returns from an S-Corp I'm stakeholder in, and I'm going into a fairly lucrative career so, IMO, he'd want to keep me around but, I guess not.

Does anyone know of any good places to live with regular leases. my work would be near union park. I was looking at places like wicker park or even as far as uptown. I want to try to keep the public transportation commute under 50 minutes.

I can spend roughly 400-700 but prefer the former. I want a safe neighborhood

A bit over 4 years ago I met her in a random chat session; I was 17, she was 14.  Nothing happened then, we just talked from time to time. 2 years later (me halfway through college, her just starting... some sort of high school, I don't remember much about the British education system) we talk more often, eventually grow out to be best friends. Eventually feelings were admitted to during February of this year. After this things got serious.

We shared everything. Her being far away from her friends made her home a lot so we had plenty of time. During summer things were more intense, she was scared of college and due to vacations we missed each other for 3 weeks straight. 

We had talked about when we would meet and how things would go. I started my graduation internship in September but promised her I would visit after, in February. 

First week of college (in October) she had all her partying + introduction stuff and told me after a few days that things don't feel the same. She was realizing she wanted more, somebody who was there for her to hold. I told her to take her time and figure out what she wanted.

The day after she told me this wasn't fair. She was doubting and unsure of her feelings. We decided to end things then.

The three weeks after that were... weird. We would still talk, but less. We'd both mention how moving on was gonna take a while and she even jokingly told me she was gonna be the creepy ex type. Two weeks ago she was emotional and kept sending me messages in which she told me she loved me.

Last week everything changed. She wasn't emotional anymore and texting/talking slowed down. Then on Thursday I got the dreaded message ""just to let you know I've moved on"".

I asked her what she did, even though I told her before I didn't want to. Sort of relieved things stayed at making out + a little more. I remember that entire (short convo) that ended with us telling each other to be happy.

I'm turning 22 in less than a week and I'm feeling like shit. My internship is going ""ok"" on a good day and ""....meh"" on a bad day. I have lost the first and only girl I have loved and my goddamn troll brain keeps thinking of her doing stuff with another guy. 

But.... that will all pass. Eventually I'll learn to live with it and then just remember the good times. I was so happy for nearly an entire year, something I hadn't had since childhood. I don't regret anything we've done, we've shared and we've dreamt of. Our time is over and it's time for me to move on.

Just needed a place to vent. Trying to deal with feelings and had to let things out. This seemed like the perfect place since.... well... she introduced me to reddit and this is the place I first posted. Things can change so quickly.

That was and shall be my only online relationship. I wish all of you people here a happy and good time during yours. I hope you'll consider it an addition to your life if things don't work out. "

mchk7,4,2011-11-14,Religion Strikes Back,msk_501,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/mchk7/religion_strikes_back/,"Probably not the best title, but it definitely fits how my day was yesterday. I was too busy to type it up last night, so here's my wacky as hell Sunday for you now. 

I'll start with earlier in the week. My roommate who didn't give a shit about the church, got a job. A really nice internship with his friends that he didn't expect. So, he told me the day he got it, 
""I'm going back to church. It's been a long time since I've been, and I think it'd be good."" 
 ""Wait, didn't you say the only time you'd be caught in a church was if someone is dead or getting married?"" 
""Yeah, well, I have the human mindset where I'll change when I think it's good to change."" 

I simply shrugged it off and left it at that. I couldn't change his mind, but I was assuming he'd go back to normal. 

Sunday came and I had to go to church as well as him. It was two of my really good friend's mission farewell speeches and I promised him I'd be there. The first one, this kid I've known for a long time. He had an attitude, he hated the church, and he was the last person I would have guessed to go on a mission. Between me and him, the roles have reversed. He became the good church guy and I became the anti-church guy. I told him afterwards that he'd changed a lot and that I'd miss him. The second talk was of my awesome friend who I'm really going to miss. His ward is possibly the friendliest group of people I've met in the church and I knew a great deal of them. My friend gave his talk not as a professional talk, but as a real farewell should go: *I learned so much from everyone here, my family, my leaders, and my friends. I really appreciate it and will carry this all with me in the next two years.* I'm happy for him. I really am. He's such a great guy, even if he is super Mormon. I'll miss him a ton. 

Then there was his luncheon after church. I helped along with his family set up for it and this is where I sort of started to crack a little. I don't believe in the church much anymore. But the people here were...not mean in any way at all. In fact, his family is filled with tons of great people, most of which are strong members in the church. I hadn't felt this welcome at a gathering in months and I wasn't even a family member! I'm sure several people here have been to these sort of things before. I've heard plenty of mission farewell's but none of them really mattered to me. But these two guys I know very well. One of them is a very close friend. 

When I got home, my roommate was talking to the other one about religion. At about this time I was worn out and planning on hitting up r/exmormon to shake off the grasp church was getting on me. Yet, my non-Mormon roommate was talking to my relatively strong Mormon roommate. They weren't debating anything, they were just discussing. I have the feeling that my non-Mormon roommate might change. I mean, he even said, ""I love the culture. Imagine if the whole world were Mormon, then it'd be perfect."" I can't agree with that. Diversity is wonderful, despite the problems it brings up. And the church is all about authority. I can't do that either. I wonder how much of an influence it had on him yesterday. 

The people might be good, but I still think that many of them are blind to reality. I can't slip back into that. I just can't.

**TL;DR: Went to two mission farewell's yesterday. Going to miss both of them like Hell. And now the church is trying to become prevalent in my house. I refuse to give in, even if it feels ""good.""**

FAQ",Rye22,ems,https://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/mcfqi/how_do_i_become_an_emt_faq/,"I noticed a lot of people coming on here and asking how to become EMTs, so I typed up this FAQ. Im posting it here so that anybody can do with it as they like, so please feel free to add to or edit any part of it.

**What are the different levels of EMT?**

This varies depending on the state that you live in, but to speak very generally, there are three levels of EMT licensure. EMT-basic, EMT- Intermediate, and EMT- Paramedic. Each level requires a different level of education, and each level has a different scope of practice.

EMT Basics are trained in basic patent assessment and care. They can perform skills like CPR and defibrillation, oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation, use of airway adjuncts, splinting of injured extremities, and limited medication administration. They are taught to determine the severity of a patents illness or injury through basic assessment techniques, and to make decisions about transport or additional resources. Becoming a basic generally takes 3-6 months.

EMT Intermediate is the next level up from a basic. The major difference between the two is that Intermediates are trained to set IV lines, and they have more medications that they can administer. In some places, intermediates may perform more advanced skills, like intubation.  Becoming an intermediate usually takes 6 months to a year.

EMT Paramedics are the highest level of pre hospital care provider currently in the united states. Beyond the basic and intermediate skills already mentioned, they are trained in skills like intubation, cardiac monitoring and pacing, cricothyrotomy, and other advanced procedures. Paramedics have a fairly wide scope of medications that they can administer. They also have a more comprehensive education in emergency medicine, and have completed a more in depth internship.  Becoming a paramedic can take anywhere from 1 year, to a full 4 year batchlers degree.

Your state may or may not have other variations on these levels. There may be Intermediate 85 or Intermediate 99, there may be critical care paramedics, or CCEMT-Ps. Flight paramedics or tactical medics may have their own certifications as well. All of these levels may have differences in scope of practice. It is worth mentioning that in the next few years, the levels of EMT will be changed by the national registry. You can read about the new levels [here](http://nremt.org/nremt/downloads/Newsletter_2009.pdf) on page four. My understanding is that the new levels will be in effect by 2014

**Where do I start?**

All EMTs must start as basics. Becoming an intermediate is not required, and it is common for paramedic students to ""skip"" the intermediate level. But to enter into EMS, you generally must begin as a basic. Basic classes are offered in many different places. Community collages often have them, fire departments will have them, specialized and tech schools will have them. Do some looking around, and you will certainly find a class being offered in your area. Once you complete your class you will have to test with either the state EMS bureau or the national registry to receive an EMT license.

**What is the difference between a certification, a state license and a national license?**

Every state will have different credentials that they require you to have to practice as an EMT in their state. In practical terms, there is little difference between a cert and a license, so let me explain the difference between state and national. State licenses and national license are separate, and you will have to pass two separate licensing exams for each. Some states will require you to have a state license to practice, and some a national. Again, this completely depends on where you are in the country. You will have to research on your own the licensing requirements of your particular state.

**How do I get a job?**

It is common for EMTs for work for fire departments, private ambulance services, or emergency departments, but there are many other jobs you can do as an EMT as well. If you want to work on an ambulance, be aware that many services require you to be 21 or older, due to insurance requirements. Like any other field, the best way to find a job in EMS is to be proactive, make connections, and apply for many positions. having experience is often a requirement, so you could consider volunteering some place to get your foot in the door. Again, there may or may not be volunteer fire departments in your area

**How do I… What if… What about…**

Most of this stuff, you're going to have to figure out on your own. EMS systems differ greatly depending on where you live. You will have to figure out how things work in your area. Working as an EMT is a job that will often require you to think and act independently, so take the first step now and figure some things out for yourself. Many people have walked this path before you, but ultimately its up to you to find your own way. With that in mind, good luck!

",PUStarvingA,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mdz2k/over_the_span_of_2_years_studying_this_material_i/,"...the life of a hermit is now more appealing to me. Firstly, I'm not here to bash on this community. Some of the things I've learned here have helped me tremendously. The inner game material comes to mind. Hopefully someone out there can relate to my experience. Maybe someone out there has been in this place before. And they have found a way out. 

I've read almost every book out there. I've listened to the podcasts. Repeatedly. I broke out of the self defeating mindsets I grew up with. I have no AA, at least when I'm running solo. I've acquired the gift of gab. If my friends and family are around, I can't let them see how I approach women for they will judge me. I have no car. I have no money. I dropped out of school. I've become more extroverted but I fear I've alienated friends who were close to me because I've become a different person. I've gone out hundreds of times. I've seen progress. I've pulled girls into my bedroom. But for the life of me I can't get laid. And I feel hollow and numb and dead at this point. In fact I've been reading up on how to cope with suicide. I'm not trying to get all emo on you, but nothing else really makes me suicidal except this wall of countless rejection I keep running into. It's like my body is telling me on a cellular level that I'm useless...I can't spread my own genes, the one thing I was put here on this fucking earth to do. 

Guys I know who don't read any of this material do better than me. In fact, my 'wing' usually fucks all the female friends I've had for years. I've learned to deal with rejection, but I've come to the point where it's hopeless. To top if off I'm a good looking guy. But I've always been oblivious about women. In the past they would come to me, but now I find that when I want it and go after them, they run away.  

I might be moving back in with my folks soon due to me being broke. I dropped out of art school. My friends are all graduating college and looking at internships and grad school, and some marriage.  I'm young, 23, my grandfather just died, and I've been horribly introspective. I feel like I've dragged my soul through mud and slime by going out countless times only to fail everytime. Or learn something new. But I still come home alone. And feel empty. Again. 

I think I'll put this stuff on hold. I want to shut off the outside world on focus on my music and art again. I've put in hours of work into various girls and nothing has panned out. I think I do really well with a girl but she doesn't respond to my texts. I reject a girl only to have her blow up my phone like crazy. I never get what my heart desires, I'm a social outcast where I live, I'm an atheist in a christian town, I love books in a place that loves football, I'm a person that has let my artistic and musical capabilities fall to the way side because I wanted the immediate gratification of sex. And I've never gotten it. 

The last time I felt the warmth of real human female energy in front of me and we were bonding in a sexual manner was 2 years ago. I've had makeouts since then, but I hopelessly chase girls away. I can't do nothing but everytime I do something I shoot myself in the foot. I've come to the conclusion that this world is not made for me. I do not function correctly in this world. I harm myself more than I help myself. The earth may be pure and natural and beautiful and vibrant and full of life, but this society I was born into was not made for humans. It was made for machines. Humans are torn apart and destroyed from the core, and something as simple as connecting sexually with another human is so frustratingly and depressingly hard to find. I see the matrix for what it is, I see the social control, But I am currently powerless to manipulate it or navigate through it to my advantage. This is a new low point for me, usually I keep my chin up, but I feel broken. I'm bored with porn. I'm bored with the superficial games. Where are the real people at? I'm in my prime, why can I not function correctly in this 21st century environment. 

I don't know what to expect by posting this, but maybe if someone who has been in this space before can share some insights into how they got through it, I'd be all ears. "

I happen to be french, living in France and everything...
I would be interested in living/working in London... reasons are personal mostly.. can't explain it, just that each time I visit there, I am the most unhappy guy in the world when I get home even without doing any crazy stuff there... Must be the atmosphere or whatever... anyway... not the point...

So I was wondering, how is the market looking for a guy like me, with a little experience though far from being a Senior?

How is my french-ness gonna look when facing the UK recruitors?

And is it possible to search/find something while being actually available only 3 months later (since I have a 3 months notice in my french job and would not want to resign before having something else to cling on to)?

Anyway, this is really mostly about testing out the waters before trying out anything...

I feel like a douche. 


This summer I took an art internship at a studio that I have oggled over since childhood, and I feel like I socially failed it. Getting this job was a lifetime achievement that I really busted my ass for. I had created the chance to meet and work with a bunch of people that were (and still are) idols to me. The production work they laid out was truly a fanboy's dream. I was lucky to be there, and felt very confident on the first day. I couldn't wait to immerse myself and be a part of the team - to show them that I had the creativity and drive to be as badass as they were. 


The trouble started on the second day. I woke up feeling emotionally out of it, and my first assignment (a REALLY simple task) took a while to get started. Then shit started to get bad. The two lead artists took me out for lunch. These guys are a huge inspiration to me, and alot of my more recent personal growth strides have come from simply checking out their work from time to time. The moment we walked out of the studio, a flip switched inside of me. I became extremely quiet, and very self concious. It felt like I was having some kind of heart pounding panic attack, and I proceded to make the worst first impression I have ever made in my life. I was unable to express myself and unable to get a sentence out without tripping over my words. On our way back to the studio, I felt so dissapointed. The lead arists seemed concerned...


So was I.


My awkward behavior persisted, and in some cases worsened. The culture of the studio was prett frat-housey and there was alot of joking and people making fun of each other going around. Very honest environment, but jokes that came by my way I would fail to see as jokes. I took everything personally, and couldnt relax. When I opened my mouth my voice would sometimes come out way too loud. I'd start to laugh for no reason at all. I would uncontrollably talk behind my hands that seemed to just force out strange gesticulations. Every lunch with the art team was a disaster. They were hillariously creative people, and I felt like any contribution to the conversation I could make was stupid. I truly felt dumb sitting next to these guys, and I felt ashamed of the fact that I had nothing to say. Sometimes I would get myself into some really retarded shit, like accidentally microwaving a soup for so long that it exploaded in the kitchen, speaking out of turn in a few small meetings, sulking about graduation/job insecurities infront of one of the lead artists in an effort to try to reach out to him - only to see it backfire in my face when he took it as me trying to beg to get hired. (This by far was the worst.) I started to hear more shit about me, like ""22 years old and not even the least bit interesting!"" or ""He wont talk to me because he likes my art too much"". I was hearing the results of my fear connecting with them - my isolation casuing their frustration. I hated hearing all of this because I've never screwed up like this before. I have plenty of friends back in college and I knew none of this had to happen. 


I felt like I was failing them - letting them down. They could have taken any other kid, and instead they had to deal with my emotional garbage that was some how disguising itself as a social disorder. Sometimes i'd hear backlash about it behind my back, and that got me really fucking mad at myself. The self-hate shrouded over my entire internship as potently as it does now. It drove me crazy, and for the first half of the four month job I was simply a nervous wreck.


Work, throughout the internship, was my one refuge. I took to isolating myself into working because if I couldn't at least churn out some awesome work then all would be lost. Fortunately, I believe I succeeded here. I have allways been confident about  my work ethic and ability to grow my art... That is because I have realized that creating stuff is an escape for me. I have run from many social situations to simply sit and create all day. I totally love it, but frustratingly I feel like it has allowed me to ignore the insecurities that plagued me at the job. I didn't hang out with the other intern much and everyone else was about 7 + years older so I was kind of alone. This kind of life is not sustainable. I want to be a fun guy to work with, and I want to be an awesome person. 


Nearing the conclusion of the internship I began to break out of it. I wanted them to know that I was aware of how awkward I've been - and that I didn't mean it. I made direct efforts to reach out to a few people I came to not stammer infront of, and also indulged in some public self-deprication. (Not greatest idea, but I found some comfort in taking jokes and laughing at myself). I realized that alot of my anxieties were coming from the fact that I was very self-absorbed. I wanted to be a badass at this studio, I wanted to befriend everyone, and that was my problem. I was only out for what I wanted, and wasn't thinking about anyone else. Sometimes I feel like this summer was supposed to teach me how I've been kind of selfish in that way - and sometimes afraid of connecting emotionally with people. Eventually I started to get open, voluntarily picked up coffee for people, and tried to become more sensitive to when others needed help. I tried to pick up my attitude, but I had and still feel so much dissapointment. Every now and then I would still feel terrible and fall into an awkward moment with someone.


At the end of the internship I said my good bye's to everyone. I left the art team for last. When I got around to them I felt a swell of emotion I couldn't handle, a swell that exploaded when the lead artists I had so much trouble connecting with gave me a hug that was so tight it lifted me up to the cieling. I bawled my eyes out like a fucking baby. The potential humiliation of it was washed away by this giant feeling of relief that I was at last able to reveal my emotions to these guys in a very real way. 


It's two months later now,


and I feel like a douche. 


My boss asked me to send him an email when I graduate, but I am very aprehensive about contacting them again. The more painful memories seem to control my life, and I have come back to college kind of forlorn, burnt out, and lifeless. I havn't painted anything decent in two months and have wasted alot of time playing games and forcing myself out to a few parties. 


I am not so sure what this summer was supposed to mean. I am looking for the next step in my life, but feel restraint. Sometimes I feel like I need to take some time to broaden myself and take some extra classes, be a student instead of living the work obsessed life I used to have. Sometimes I feel like that's a mistake, and that I should just graduate and get myself in a studio - forget about what happened this summer and keep moving forward. 


Most of all I want to know what the people I worked with think. I used to not care about what people thought of me, how I presented, the things I did and said, but now I do more than ever. 


Writing and posting this got a bunch off my chest, which I guess is what this reddit is about. If anyone did me the favor of reading it all, thanks alot, and do you happen to know: 


How I should move on from this?

mfhd3,9,2011-11-17,What do I even do?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/mfhd3/what_do_i_even_do/,"So, to begin, I feel like nobody is going to take me seriously because I just created an account.  I've been lurking for years, and never felt the need to say anything because...well, I don't know why.  I just didn't.  But if you have something to say, some advice that might dig me out of this hole, I would love to hear it.  Please.
I'm gonna start from the beginning of my troubles.
I was a ""popular"" kid until I started middle school.  Then, for whatever reason, I was suddenly ostracized.  I think it may have been because I was a smaller kid at that point, and everyone who was trying to claw their way up the social ladder saw me as an easy target.  I hadn't always been this way (small, I mean)- in third grade, I was the third tallest kid in school, and in seventh, among the ten shortest.  Even my supposed ""friends"" were assholes.  They didn't resort to any physical abuse, for the most part, but were constantly verbally assaulting me about my size, goading me to fight them because they knew I wouldn't fight because I couldn't win.  I started having a lot of suicidal thoughts by the end of eighth grade, literally not being able to think of anything else when I was falling asleep except killing myself.
One night I woke my mom up at three in the morning, telling her ""I'm afraid because I don't want to kill myself.""  She had me see a psychologist, which did not help anything.  I'm not going to get into specifics, but, to simplify, I can talk about how my week went with my best friend (not that I had one at this time).  
Anyways, high school was a little better.  I had always been a good student, and was enjoying every chance I got to display my intelligence and make someone else look dumb.  Looking back, it was kind of my ""revenge,"" if you can call it that.  I had a new group of ""friends,"" but was somewhat embarrassed to hang out with them; I was used to being in the ""cool"" clique.  We never really meshed- well, except for one guy.  But, as it turns out, he ended up being gay.  This is not and never was an issue for me in and of itself, it just hurt me that he never told me this until college.  I mean, I sat downstairs by myself senior year at his girlfriend's house while he fucked her.
I did grow in high school, and thanks to the aforementioned gay friend, ended up joining the wrestling team with him (save the jokes).  I started out at 103 my sophomore year, then started to grow: 135 junior year, and 162 my senior year.  To be honest, I was never very good, but somehow managed to place third in conference.  My complete and utter fear of failure probably motivated me.
As I said, I had always been good in school.  I got a 1400 on the SAT (when it was out of 1600) and a 33 on the ACT (out of 36).  I got into every college I applied to.  The last week of senior year, a kid I knew from class and myself decided to skip the AP physics test because we didn't think we'd do well.  Sidebar: good choice, everyone I talked to got a 1 or a 2, scored 5s on the three other AP tests I took.  While this may seem like a bad choice, it was an important twist.  This kid, who I barely knew at the time, is my best friend in the world to this very day.
Skip to college.
I left the state and went to school 2000 miles away.  I started smoking a lot of pot.  I had smoked before, but it was maybe twice a month.  I started drinking and doing coke.  This didn't affect my grades, I was still pulling a 3.6, despite rarely attending class.  Then, my sophomore year, during winter break, my parents dropped a bomb.  They were getting divorced.  I was getting pulled out of school.  I had $24k in scholarships, but that still left $12k a year out of pocket/loans, and we could no longer afford it.  I moved home.
I worked some jobs I hated while I was back, and ended up dating a girl I really, truly loved.  During this time, I hung out with one of her friends who was a lesbian, Caitlin.  Eventually, this girl and I broke up- she cheated on me, and I was shattered.  We had been living together with a couple of my friends, and I had been working two jobs and going to school (for only one semester) to pay both her rent and my own.  
I was heartbroken.  It had never hurt so badly.  I ended up hanging out with Caitlin again one evening shortly after the breakup, and she shot heroin.  She offered me some, and I did it.  This was the beginning of the end.  I brought another friend into the opiate game, and he ended up with a prescription for oxycontin.  We were getting fucked up every night.
The friend (who was also very smart) and I ended up moving to Las Vegas for a very well-paid internship.  I quit both of my jobs with no notice.  While in Vegas, we went doctor-shopping on the weekends so we both had a full bottle of pills for the week.  It was fucked up.
Anyways, the internship ended, and I moved home.  Ended up kicking opiates cold turkey because his RX ran out.  I got a job, and ended up dating a very cute girl who was totally clean, which led to me even quitting smoking pot.
After a few months, I started smoking again, and got her to smoke.  She liked it, so we did it pretty much nightly.  This girl also happened to have very rich parents, so I had access to a bunch of money.  I broke my wrist and was not able to work for two months, and in this time, got into heroin.  Like REALLY into heroin.   Previously it had mostly been pills, but this time I was spending a lot of time in the hood every single day, just trying to score.  Eventually I came clean to both my girlfriend and my parents about this, and got into treatment.  Shortly after, she dumped me.
So, I successfully completed treatment and had been working as a server.  Relapse.  Came clean again to the parents about what had happened, but couldn't afford treatment this time around, money was tight.  So, I've been getting my Subutex on ""the street"" from a friend of mine who is a doctor.  Ended up getting fired for a bullshit reason (I gave a 20 year old coworker a beer out of my pitcher after work, even though the owners had let her drink at the bar countless times before), and am currently on unemployment.  It runs out in a month.
I have been desperately looking for a job, and am signed on with an IT recruiter (got 95th percentile on their skills test, largest IT recruiter in the nation).  Nothing has worked out.  I am literally four weeks away from living in my car, and like eighth grade, when I lay down to sleep, all I can think about is killing myself.  This week I have started to look for jobs that I consider ""below"" me.  I am two months away from getting off of the Subutex- I wanted to do it December 1st, but am just not ready.  I haven't slipped on the drugs at all, which I am very proud of (and even quit smoking pot for the first ever, which has now been six months clean), but feel more hopeless than ever.  All I can think about is that if I don't have a job by the time I get my last unemployment check, I am going to spend that entire check on heroin, shoot it all at once, and check out.
I need something to hold on to."
mfg8k,0,2011-11-17,My Thoughts on Law School,Me_Ranting,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/mfg8k/my_thoughts_on_law_school/,"
Hey everyone.  I don’t know if I just need to write this out for cathartic reasons or maybe I’m looking for someone to renew my spirits about the whole thing or warn others thinking about going to law school, but this is my rant about law school.

	
I’m a 3L in a part time program, so I have one more year after this.  I have slightly above average grades in a second tier law school.  I was working full time before starting law school and switched to part time and then was laid off.  I worked part time my first year and then got laid off and have just been going to school part time since then.

	
The only reason I decided to attend law school was to make more money.  I never had and still don’t have any particular interest or motivation in any part of the law. 

	
I’m sitting here figuring it out and it is doubtful that it will have been worth it for me to have gone to law school even 10 years after I’m out.  I projected what I believe I would have made in my old career over 10 years and compared it to what I can expect to make once I graduate and then subtracted the amount of my loans.  I know that entire calculation is a lot of guess work, but it’s the only thing to go on.  I can adjust the projections to make it better or worse, but it’s disheartening knowing what I could have been making and instead I’m taking useless classes (more on that to come).  

	
That’s my main gripe.  I know in the grand scheme of things it is a first world problem and that I’m not going to starve, but for the amount of time, effort and money that school is costing me, it is just depressing that it could end up maybe not being worth it.  I feel like my family and friends don’t grasp this and think “Oh, you’ll make a ton of money as a lawyer.”  I hope that is true, but as you can tell from the tone of this, I am not optimistic.     

	
My next complaint is the overall uselessness of the entire process.  The only things I have learned that are useful are how to do legal research (using Westlaw and LexisNexis) and then some of the overall legal process and the way to analyze a legal problem.  I have had some pretty poor teachers, which is my schools’ fault, but even in the classes with good teachers, you learn the information for the test and just forget it right after.  That’s not a problem with only law school though, as I have felt that way since middle school.  I feel like you learn everything you need to know in the first semester and anything that you are going to become really knowledgeable about you will learn while actually being out in practice.  
	

All of the substantive law classes that I’ve had are just learn it for the final and move on.  I’ve had two of my worst professors in my procedural classes, so what I understand of civil procedure and evidence has been from Barbri.  While I’m on the topic of teachers, I did have one that was like the guy from the Paper Chase, with the Socratic Method and randomly calling on you and giving you are hard time if you don’t know the answer.  I found it to be annoying and him to be an asshole.  Berating someone for getting the facts or the reasoning of the court confused wasn’t an effective use of my time.  Luckily I can make my own schedule and avoid the teachers like him from now on. 
	  

Then there are the other people in my classes.  I feel like for the most part everyone has swallowed the Kool-Aid and loves everything about law school.  Even the people that I talk to that do complain somewhat don’t seems to have the disdain for it that I do.  During my first year when I was working part time and only going to school at night, everyone seemed to be getting involved in all the clubs and activities and everything else going on.  I was just trying to get the stupid cases read in case I got called on that night.  For what it’s worth, I feel like being in the part time evening program the first year meant I missed out on the bonding and friend making process that full time people had.  People were coming to class after work and just wanted to get home when class was over.  I have friends in my classes, but I take day classes now and people seem to just be closer than at night.  

	
As of right now, I just take regular classes.  People that I know write on or edit journals, are involved in clinics, or have internships or externships.  The journals seem to be a massive waste of time.  I know they look good on your resume and that is why people do them, but it just doesn’t seem to be worth the work.  I have heard that journal experience is pretty much mandatory for the federal judiciary, academia, and big law firms, but I have no interest in working in those areas, which is why I picked up the writing competition to get on the journals and didn’t bother to do it.  I’m hoping to get a summer internship, so that I will finally have some sort of legal experience.  Without going into it, my prior work experience relates to what I will likely do as a lawyer, so it’s not like I will have no relevant experience on my resume.

	
Thanks for reading if you’re still with me.  Let me address a point that I’m sure some of you have thought by now: that I am lazy.  I see people in my classes that work full time and then come to school part time.  I don’t have it in me at this point in my life and my circumstances don’t necessitate it.  I worked full time and went to school full time for most of undergrad and I felt like the reward for that was just getting to work more full time when I got out.  The only real benefit that I feel law school has given me is that I have not needed to work full time.  As much as I dislike law school, I disliked working full time at my last job even more.  Switching to part time at that job was good and then getting laid off has been even better.  The time I have spent laid off has shown me what I think is really important, and it isn’t school right now or going to be my job when I go back to work.  All I want is to make a decent amount of money and have time and money to spend on things that I actually enjoy.    
	

So that’s what I have to say on the subject.  Let me know what you think or maybe take my perspective into consideration if you are deciding whether or not to go, but I just felt like I needed to write this all out and get some sort of feedback.  Thanks.

mgzw0,0,2011-11-18,How do I breakup with her?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mgzw0/how_do_i_breakup_with_her/,"I posted yesterday about whether or not I should break up with my girlfriend, but it didnt make it through the spam filter.

A little back story. I'm 19, she's 20. We met eachother through work with our local NASA high school activities. We both had an internship there as well and worked in the same building. This was the summer before our freshmen year (We are both sophomores now). This is when I started to develop a serious crush on her. I learned that she was going to the same university as me, but that she had a boyfriend. I figured it wouldnt last one college began and decided to wait it out. For some reason, I was really attracted to her cutesy-ness. Like she was very innocent and bubbly. Oh, and she's smarter than me. Which is really big, cause if a girl knows what a valence electron is, she becomes instantly 5x hotter to me.

So Freshmen year rolls around and she breaks up with her boyfriend. We started a small fling. Nothing major, just hung out alot and occasionally made out. She was really uncomfortable with me drinking and smoking, so I stopped hanging out with her, cause its college. I'm going to be drinking and smoking. There were some other reasons as well, which I forgot about until recently.

We still texted a lot and she actually smoked weed with me for her first time in the spring. I didn't think much of it at the time.

Fast forward to about two months ago and sophomore year is beginning. I figured I'd ask her out on a date because she seemed to be more lax toward drinking and smoking. After dinner and a movie, we were at her place and were drinking with her roommate. We ended up making out and I spent the night. No sex, just light touching. About where we left off a year ago.

I start seeing her more and more and we both came to the realization we were boyfriend and girlfriend. I became more open with her. This was my first real relationship.

The thing is, she is starting to annoy the fuck out of me. The bubbly and cute personality seems to be some sort of coping mechanism from her mom being bat shit insane when she was growing up. She acts like a 7 year old for the first half hour I see her, and intermittently for the rest of the time. At first it was cute, but now its fucking annoying. Like I can't have a conversation with her cause she will literally go ""Wheeeeeeeee, I like puppies. Did you know I liked puppies?"" She actually told me that last night after I asked her something. 

Theres a multitude of other reasons I don't want to be with her anymore. She actually isn't cool with me smoking, though she puts up a front like she is. something along the lines of ""I'm alright with you smoking weed everyonce in a while, but I don't see why someone would do it everyday."" I dont think she realizes I smoke everyday. 

Also, she thinks her handjobs are the best. Which they aren't. They're fine foreplay, but it shouldn't be what an hour of making out ends with. I understand that she isn't ready for the next level of intimacy (she blew me once, but thats been it) because we've talked about it. Our conversation ended with if you're not ready to blow me, please don't bring my penis out. Which she still does. 

A little info about myself is that I am almost a polar opposite of her. She was raised in a small farm town as a daddy's little princes. Grew up on Disney. I am from the inner city and am a huge metal head. I despise Disney. Usually that wouldn't matter, but this girl fucking loves disney. I know remember that this is also part of the reason I stopped hanging out with her a year ago. We have nothing in common besides both of us being smart.

TL;DR: I started dating a girl because she was smart and cute. Had a fling a year ago, but stopped talking to her cause she was too cutesy and we had nothing in common. Started dating her again this year, thinking she mightve matured, but hasn't. Realize I want to breakup with her for the same reasons we stopped hanging out a year ago. Want to let her off easy and without hurting her feelings. Since this is my first real relationship, I have know idea how to do this. 

EDIT: Wont do it, like her too damn much"
mgi66,4,2011-11-17,Why it's so hard to move on.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/mgi66/why_its_so_hard_to_move_on/,"I'm 23(f) was with my ex (26) for 5 years.

I've cut off all contact with my ex. I go to the gym, hang out with friends, go to school and intern with the ASPCA. My days are busy, eventful, and full. 

I haven't talked to my ex in 3 months. In the 3 months we have been broken up, I starting dating his brothers best friend. He turned out to be a jerk.. and now I'm single again. 

Throughout my whole relationship with this new guy, I couldnt get over my ex. I met new friends, new people, had full days.. and still.. by the end of the night.. it was ALWAYS him that was on my mind. 

Even after a new boyfriend, new friends, a new job and no contact, AND the blatant obviousness of why we will never work out... I still lay awake at night, replaying his goodbye over and over again. 

I've come to the conclusion that there is a psychological reason humans can't seem to move on, like some sort of evolutionary adaption.. and I'm going to stick with it until I can think of another reason to make me feel better about this situation.

Can anyone tell me how I can stop these thoughts for good? Sometimes it feels like time won't..."
mie3l,7,2011-11-19,Adopting our first cat; a cat that has gone 3 weeks without food.,clevermoviereference,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/mie3l/adopting_our_first_cat_a_cat_that_has_gone_3/,"Hi r/pets!  My fiance and I are adopting our very first cat, and it's one that needs love! A friend of a friend interns at a program that provides people with mental disabilities with housing or help to maintain the housing they have.  One of their clients dropped off for a bit and when they went to do a home visit, his or her cat was found starving and the cat was taken away.  The cat needs a home and our home needs a cat, so my friend hooked us up with the person fostering.

This being my first cat, I was wondering about the basics. So far, we're getting a litter box, food and water dishes, and an alpine scratcher (all of my friends' cats loooove these) and I'm sticking all of my knitting yarn in a closet with a closed door.  Is there anything we're forgetting?

Furthermore, I was wondering if anybody knows about the special care that a cat that has been starving in the recent past needs?  Is there a special food that we can buy to help this cat put on weight now, without him become a fat cat?  Does anybody know any online resources about getting your home cat-ready?

The cat was originally from a shelter, so he has been vaccinated and neutered.  I think we should take him for a check-up anyway, considering the health crisis he's had recently.  Thanks!

edit: 
UPDATES: http://www.aspca.org/Home/Pet-care/cat-care.aspx

This has been an excellent guide in case anybody else has any cat care basics questions.

We found a really glowingly reviewed vet in the neighborhood!  AND we're getting Mr. Cat tomorrow.  Now we need a name, but maybe we should live with him for a short time to get to know him."

I'm HS student who's interested in applying to Rice. I'm from MA, and I just wanted to get an idea of student life, academics, and the overall atmosphere of the school. Being from the Northeast, not a lot of people know about Rice, but the right people do know about it :).

I'm interested in majoring in ME, CS or EE. I'd like to work on robotics/space exploration. For engineering students, how are the academics? What sort of out of classroom activities related to engineering are there? Are there lots of opportunities to intern in Houston? How's Houston (I'm from Boston) ? What's your favorite thing about Rice? Lastly, the other schools I'm also applying to are: Northwestern, Cornell, Duke, Brown, Michigan, UVA, GeorgiaTech and MIT. How does Rice compare to these schools (on engineering academics and overall atmosphere/student life)?

I know these are a lot of questions, but any input would be really helpful. 

Thanks!"
mjf0x,0,2011-11-20,Is it possible to put two fixed cogs on my rear hub?,ukulele13,FixedGearBicycle,https://www.reddit.com/r/FixedGearBicycle/comments/mjf0x/is_it_possible_to_put_two_fixed_cogs_on_my_rear/,"Currently I'm running a 48x16 ratio in the hilly city of Cincinnati, Ohio.  I live in the hills of the city, but I ride down into the valley during the week for an internship.  My current setup has been comfortable so far for climbing my way home, but I'm interested in trying something a little more intense to ride faster in general.  

I'm relatively new to riding fixed, so here's my question.  I've got an Origin 8 flip flop hub on the back with no freewheel on the other side.  Would it be possible to put a 13T fixed cog on the other side so I have the option of riding faster when I want to?  I've already ruled out using a freewheel because there is no mounting eyelets for a rear brake on my Bianchi Pista and I don't feel comfortable riding with only a front brake.  If this isn't possible, are there any hubs that have the option of mounting two fixed cogs? Any insight would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!

TL;DR - Can I mount two fixed cogs on my Origin 8 rear hub?"

I think I need to get this off my chest, even though it's something great. I guess you could also take it as a story of hope though.

The past four months or so have been a bit...well...fucked. My girlfriend's depression returned. My OCD flared up at the same time, and, well, we ended up splitting a couple of months ago. We still talked, which could have made it harder, I mean, I still liked her at the time and wanted it to work out. A couple of weeks ago, we met up and had a chat. We both seemed fine around each other, I mean, we'd both started getting our lives back on track again. Afterwards, I asked if we could try it all again, but got a bit of a confusing answer along the lines of ""yes, but I need a little more time to sort something out"". Turns out she'd gotten close to someone else, but had then decided to cut that off.

Sadly though, that never came around, despite me trying to ask if she wanted to do anything. Finally, this all came up and ended up with her saying she'd gotten close to someone else (different to the first one) and couldn't deny she was close, and that she likes me as a friend. Of course, this was a bit soul crushing (especially given the person, but it's not apt to go down that route here). I was annoyed at something, I don't know if it was her, me, or the person she had gotten with.
Which brings us to a couple of days ago. Four months of trying to understand her depression, trying to hold a relationship together, trying to hold my job down (which, if it wasn't an internship at the university, I'd have probably been fired from by not putting enough hours in), trying to keep myself together, trying to hold down my PhD, and finally trying to understand what the hell was going on. I had no drive or energy, my OCD flared up and I had to keep it under control, and I just generally felt crap. Then finally, albeit after a good session of sorrow drowning with spirits and Mario Kart with a close friend, it was as if a weight had been lifted. I woke up on Thursday with a little hangover, but more importantly, I just didn't, well, care any more. I opened the curtains, went out into a lovely sunny day, put Foo Fighters on on my phone, turned it up, and just said ""fuck it, I'm going to make this day amazing"".

I went to see a bunch of friends, went on a semi-date, and had an amazing day. I have no idea how, but any worry from before had just, gone. In a sadistic sort of way, it seemed like closure. Only a week or so before, I was on the edge of taking a leave of absence from university. Now I see opportunity again. I feel better, I feel like I have drive. I feel like I want to live again. The intrusive thoughts of suicide have gone, and I feel like I have my OCD in better control than I did a year ago. Hell, I don't even know what is going on from the semi-date, yet, I seem fine about it, which would normally have me being paranoid and worried before. Of course, this isn't over. I'll never escape my issues fully, but at least for now, I hope I can get a few more years like this in before I come crashing again.

Again, I don't really know why I wrote this. I think I just needed to get it down. Get some final closure on my thoughts and get them out there. That said, thanks to the people in /r/OCD, /r/depression, /r/offmychest and /r/relationships. I don't think I could have got through this in my current state without those, and my close friends. To anyone else struggling with relationship issues or post-breakup issues, it gets better. It takes time, and sometimes something awful turns out to be one of the best things ever, but it gets better with time. Good luck to you all."

Only a week or so before, I was on the edge of taking a leave of absence from university. Now I see opportunity again. I feel better, I feel like I have drive. I feel like I want to live again. The intrusive thoughts of suicide have gone, and I feel like I have my OCD in better control than I did a year ago. Hell, I don't even know what is going on from the semi-date, yet, I seem fine about it, which would normally have me being paranoid and worried before.

Again, I don't really know why I wrote this. I think I just needed to get it down. Get some final closure on my thoughts and get them out there. That said, thanks to the people in /r/OCD, /r/depression, /r/offmychest and /r/relationships. I don't think I could have got through this in my current state without those, and my close friends. To anyone else struggling with relationship issues or post-breakup issues, it gets better. It takes time, and sometimes something awful turns out to be one of the best things ever, but it gets better with time. Good luck to you all."

I am currently attending [name of college] in [city name, state name]. I am in the honors program, make good grades, I worked as an R.A., and I try hard to make life better for my brothers and sisters in humanity. I graduated high school with honors, and was an honors student in high school. I am also a criminal. I have used cannabis for a few years now, recently chronically, as in more than once a day. I still make the same grades, I still am an honors student, and I am still the same person I was, if not a better person. I liked to use cannabis. This past Thursday, the police came and asked if I had any illegal substances in my room. I cooperated, I was polite, and I understand they are doing their job. I now face misdemeanor charges, I can no longer live in university housing, i lost my job and i have nowhere to stay because my home is 3 hours away. I may end up with a criminal record that could keep me from being employed among other things. I also face the prospect of losing all of my scholarships, loans and grants, and possible expulsion from school. My question to you is this- what did I do to deserve such sever consequences? I smoked, yes that does carry health risks, but not as bad as alcohol or tobacco, and only to myself. I liked to smoke and play video games, hang out with friends, go for a walk, meditate, read a book... Nothing that harmed anyone. I am facing life changing consequences that could keep me from being a member of my very community or society for consuming a plant that has never caused any deaths from overdose, has possible medical uses, and is safer than tobacco or alcohol. This  ""crime"" in no way harms anyone. Gang violence hurts people and, because of the legal status of this plant, gangs are who profit from marijuana sales. But what if those gang members did not have control over the cannabis market? What if we put the market into the people's hands? What if people did not have to risk their future just for a bit of relaxing? What if we did not have to worry about laced cannabis because we grew our own? 

Alcohol prohibition required a constitutional amendment to be put into place, and we see how that turned out. Why is there no amendment for marijuana prohibition? How is this drug war legally justifiable? According to the tenth amendment of our U.S. constitution, any powers/responsibilities not explicitly delegated to the federal government are assigned to the states to decide, and I find nowhere in the constitution that leaves it up to the federal government to dictate what we the people can and cannot put into our bodies, and definitely no mention of cannabis prohibition. In fact, when we were still colonies of Great Britain, farmers were REQUIRED to grow hemp due to it's usefulness. 

Speaking of choosing what to put into our bodies, does every person not have the right to decide what is acceptable to put in their body? When did the government acquire the power to control what I do, so long as I am not infringing on anyone else's rights or causing harm to others? 

Next up is the economics of it all. We spend millions of dollars paying for prisoners. Imagine, we pass a legalization bill, those inmates who were NON-VIOLENT offenders whose only crime was possession or ""intent to sell"" could be released. Not only would we not be paying for those inmates, but it would free up space in our overpopulated prison system. No marijuana arrests means not clogging up the judicial system with people who did nothing worse than possessing/consuming this plant, which in reality is no worse than having a drink to relax. Then we have the possible tax income on the sale of cannabis. 

The drug war is obviously helping nothing. We have been fighting this ""war on drugs"" for far too long, and nothing has changed except for more and more otherwise law abiding citizens becoming ""casualties"" because of the legal status of a plant. The purpose of this message may be a bit unclear, so I will sum it up- The war on drugs is not a war between ""good"" and ""evil"", but between our government and the people it governs and is supposed to protect. How many more people must go to jail? How many people will be killed this year in raids by over-zealous ""drug warriors""? Support for legalization is at an all time high in America. You as REPRESENTATIVES have a responsibility to your constituents to at least pay attention to their opinions. I realize I will probably receive a condescending and vague reply that some secretary or intern typed up, and no one of any importance will ever read this, but if anyone does, I would be fine with no response to anything but my final question- a serious question that I would really appreciate if it were answered-

Besides breaking the (unjust) law, what was wrong with me having plant matter that just so happens helps me get through tough times, that makes the good times better, breaks down cultural, religious, racial, and social barriers, and just overall makes me feel good?

My plea to you today is to seriously sit and consider how locking people up for cannabis is helping our society, and then consider how you would feel if someone told you you would go to jail for smoking your cigarettes, or drinking your alcohol, or even drinking your soda/eating your favorite food. Just think about how it would feel to have your life turned upside down for eating pizza, or whatever your favorite food is. 

Would you not support the legalization of pizza, when the only reason ever given to you for why it is illegal is that it will make you fat? Think about this- why is cannabis illegal? Because it produces a ""high""?- but that can't be right because so does alcohol(Which is a drug). Because the smoke is ""dangerous"" for your health?- that can't be it either, because so is tobacco smoke(Which contains nicotine, also a drug). So what is it that makes cannabis so ""dangerous""?

Please, take this seriously. I may not have worded this ""professionally"", but  this is something I am passionate about, and our government was founded on the beliefs that the people have their voices heard. That the government should answer to its people. That our representative, our ELECTED officials should answer to the people the represent. I may have said that my earlier question was my last, but it seems that was a mistake for I have one more, and this is all- 

I realize that this is a controversial topic, and you risk re-election by supporting legalization, but I ask you, what is truly more meaningful- helping out thousands that have their lives ruined because they like to enjoy partaking in a plant, or another term? "

Toward this end, my plan after my Master's is to do a research internship in some lab for a year and hope to get a/some publications out.

I just want to ask you guys, will this really help my PhD applications? I want to get into a good PhD program.

 What about working in a ML startup? I know there are a LOT of companies out there with TONS of data, will it boost my resume if I worked in some such core ML company (even if only a small startup), gained good knowledge, but got no publications?

Thanks a lot!

While in college my girlfriend at the time (wife now) made me get on anti depressants and have been on them since I was about 20. Had a few med changes since then mainly due to sexual side effects and now I'm on effexor and lamtic (or something like that). When I was a teenager I began to self mutilate with more emphasis on just feeling pain rather than trying to kill myself. Never got along with my dad and by the time I was a senior in high school I was pretty much isolated from my family because I couldn't get along with any of them. I stopped cutting until January of last year. I was feeling overwhelmed and just wanted to feel pain again because I thought I deserved it. By mid spring I was drinking more and more, cheated on my wife, drove far more wreckless, and was beginning to consider drugs. Towards the end of may my wife found out I cheated on her and later that morning I attempted suicide because of the guilt I felt about it and I just didn't want to live anymore. Got hospitalized for a few days and since then have seen a therapist and just recently started seeing a psychiatrist. I am still pretty miserable. The meds I'm on now seem to work better than previous meds but I still am not happy with myself at all. I have been busy with work and an internship and have recently rejoined a band that I took a break from so I don't have alot of idle time which helps. However I am started to isolate myself from other people other than my wife. I think about killing myself alot anymore (more so when I forget a dose of my meds) and all I can say is maybe I should. If my brain is that adamant about wanting to die than maybe I should just end it. Right now the only thing really stopping me is the holidays being so close. That's really about all I got.

I'm currently a junior at Cornell University, and I will be working a 28-week full time internship starting Jan. 9th with Johnson &amp; Johnson at Spring House, PA. I'm looking for a place to live in the Philly area during this time, and it's been tough because I don't know the area at all and I only know one person in the area.

I was originally thinking I would get a studio apartment, but I've been becoming more open to the idea of having a roommate or two. However, I'm still reluctant to just room with any random person. I've been browsing Craigslist, but I'm getting tired of terribly-written ads and sketchy offers, and someone recommended reddit to me as a nicer community to appeal to.

Some info about me for potential roommates: I'm a 20-year-old male bioengineering major, currently living in a dormitory here at Cornell working as a resident assistant. I'm very good about not leaving common space messy, and I tend to be very quiet as a roommate (I only ever listen to music or watch videos with headphones on). I'm a pretty introverted person and have a lot of nerdy interests (classical music, math, video games, and Doctor Who to name a few), but I'm pretty friendly and enjoy hanging out with other laid-back people. I plan on getting a cat when I move in because this will be the first time that I have the privilege, time, and money to do so. I also would prefer a furnished place if possible. My maximum budget is something like $700 per month, though of course cheaper is quite welcome.

So, if I sound like someone you would be willing to sublet a room to, or if you know someone who would be interested, or if you know of any other good opportunities, please let me know! We can also talk through e-mail if you shoot me a message with your contact info.

I'm quite busy this semester and I don't really have the money or a car to spare right now to come visit beforehand, which I understand can be off-putting. However, my identity is easily verifiable by searching my e-mail on the Cornell website, and I can get both Cornell and Johnson &amp; Johnson to contact you and confirm that my story is legitimate, and I would be willing to do a videochat or something with a potential renter or subleaser to talk about stuff, so that we can remove as much anxiety as possible about not being able to meet in person. Trying to find a good apartment over the internet is really tough, so I would be extremely appreciative of any advice or offers you all could give. Thanks a bunch!"
mlz9z,3,2011-11-22,Undergraduate Field Camp or Internship?,brenng,geology,https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/mlz9z/undergraduate_field_camp_or_internship/,"Hey guys,

I have been debating back and forth about whether I should apply for a field camp at a university or an internship.  The summer I plan on doing either of these options is next summer (before Junior year).  Currently, I am leaning towards pursuing a Masters degree in the Geosciences/related discipline, and do not plan on job searching immediately after I graduate.

So, in terms of experience, enhancing my knowledge about the geosciences, and being prepared for graduate studies, which option have you felt is more beneficial?

I know there are many different field camps focusing on different areas of the geosciences, but I'm focusing this question on field camps as a whole.
Additionally, are there many opportunities for financial assistance for the field camp?

Lastly, if I were to pursue an internship, it would most likely be at an environmental remediation firm, dealing with geotechnical work primarily related to hydrogeology.

Thanks for your input!

I turned 22 yesterday (yay?), first girl in this story is 20 atm. Second girl is 18.

I have been raised to do what I love. My parents aren't racists and have always told me and siblings to love, not be judgmental and not be a fucking ass. Generally nice, they wouldn't care if any of their kids admitted to being gay or bisexual. Also not religious, supportive of everything. The only thing they were wary of was my sister dating older guys.

Anyways, I have never been socially successful (you know because I'm on Reddit, zing), so relationships haven't come easy. Actually, in my grand total of 5 attempts of actual relationships only two ever came anywhere near actual intimacy.

First one was with a (then, not anymore) Muslim girl. Met on the internet, we had fun, talked a lot etc. etc. We met up a few times and we kissed. Things were fun, but eventually didn't work out because the Islam is kind of a bitch. We part, don't talk much besides a few random conversations on MSN. Eventually, 3 months later, we start talking due to my internship being close to her college. Being the curious ass that I am I eventually ask her how things are going with her boyfriend. She says they have done oral and....

I was fucking sick. I felt like I could throw up right then. I couldn't even get turned on for a week after that. Up until that point I thought I was over her...
Skip ahead 2 years (holy shit that's today!) and here I am, the same feeling. Now it's because I have lost a girl I honestly loved.
This time it was a friend I also met on the internet years ago. She lives in the UK though, so I can't just randomly go over and meet her. We admitted feelings, did naughty stuff on cam and admitted we loved each other. I said this when I felt there was no way that what I felt wasn't love, she said it a bit sooner.

She had rather low self esteem and barely any friends in high school. I'm nearly done with college so I told her I would meet her when my internship is over and I got my Bachelor's. She agrees and we make plans for stuff when she's in Uni.
The dreaded moment comes and she leaves. It's early October of this year and she starts out shy in her dorms. Things progress and during her first week she tells me she got drunk and engaged in dancing close to a guy (club style, you know). I tell her that I don't like it but that it's not the end of the world, just that I would prefer it she didn't do that while we're together. The day after she goes home for a bit and says that things don't feel the same anymore. She has been thinking of having a relationship with a guy who can be there for her. I tell her she knows what I can offer her and that I can't change that until I at least finish school.

She decides it's not fair this way and we break up. The first few weeks we both have trouble to stop talking, but things do slow down. It seems we both have trouble getting over each other and we even finish watching Firefly together. I try to be determined, save for one weak moment, and whenever either of us say we want to get back together we say it's better this way.
Almost two weeks ago I get a text where she informs me she has moved on. She made out with a guy and did more... Exactly one week after that (day before new Zelda, easy to remember) she texts me again. She thought it was funny how I was right that she found a new boyfriend in no-time and also friendzoned somebody.

I asked her if she had sex (nope) and if she had done oral... She asks what good knowing would do and I admitted it wouldn't. She says she has both given and received oral sex. I feel like shit again, but not as much as with the other girl.

Then last Sunday, about an hour before I decide to break off all contact, I had another stupid moment and asked her about... blowjobs....

She says it was what she wanted and that she doesn't regret anything. I can see that and I assume it's normal, we talked about doing much dirtier stuff than that and I don't think of sex as wrong.
But when girls I like have had sex? Especially when I'm not over them by a long shot? God I get sick. It's all wrong. I can only imagine them having sex. It haunts my mind. It distracts me from everything. I can't even think of her without thinking of that.

**tl;dr: I feel sick when a girl I like(d) does things with somebody else. Oral sex more than anything.**

Does anybody else have this and know how to deal with it? Any suggestions from people who don't have the same problem? How do I stop seeing girls like that? What the fuck is wrong with me? (Besides being an idiot and actually asking them for details about their sex life. I believe I only got answers because both wanted to be friends with me)"

mlbeu,3,2011-11-22,"[FR] Suit up for a mini date, or so I thought.",starfoxisdown,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mlbeu/fr_suit_up_for_a_mini_date_or_so_i_thought/,"Ok fellas time to contribute. But first a bit of background so we understand what I'm working with. I'm a professional student in my mid 20s, just got out of a 6 year relationship that I had been in, with some off and on, since freshman year in college. Nothing messy or dramatic spurring me to this subreddit, just long distance sucks. In fact I did a lot of my personal development from shy nerd to gregarious nerd within the parameters of this relationship. In any case, I gotta get back into it sometime, might as well be now. 

The report:
On a sunny (for Seattle) afternoon I was sitting on the bus, heading back to my school after a meeting downtown. I'd had an internship interview that morning so I was wearing my best suit and tie. The interview had gone well, and I was also pretty stoked from the meeting planning a legislative campaign to end the death penalty. All in all an excellent afternoon, and it probably showed.

Sitting on the bus with an empty seat next to me, an Asian girl walks on, looks at me briefly, and asks if she can sit down. I don't have much experience using the scale here, but I'd say HB8; very pretty face and nice body. She sits down and introduces herself, and we exchange pleasantries. Now I'm not used to people randomly introducing themselves on public transportation, though I try to chat up people who seem receptive whenever possible. I'm so thrown by this I almost let the interaction die right there, but then I remember 1) she's hot and 2) I'm single. 

**note: she later told me that because she is shy, she only sits next to people she thinks look nice or who she'll be comfortable with. I'm no expert, but I think this illustrates that first impressions are huge, and they happen before you ever open your mouth. I attribute this interaction solely to my good attitude and dress.**

We mostly talk about her, with me asking question about her major and future career aspirations and dreams. Social kino on the shoulders and arms throughout. We get of the bus and she tells me she's going to the library. I suddenly remember that I too have to pick up books from the library. This is perfect because I actually do need to pick up some books, and there's this really cool cafe on the way there.

As we walk and talk I kino a bit more on the small of her back, but not much more after this. When we pass the cafe I point it out and talk up how great it is. When we near the library a couple minutes later, I tell her we should grab some food at the cafe sometime when she's on campus (she commutes), and to facilitate said food grabbing we should exchange numbers. Now I was expecting this to be some time in the indeterminate future, but after I get her number she suggests we get lunch right then! Well hellz yeah! We split up while I get my book, and when we reconvene (easy since we have each other's number) we head to the cafe.

This whole time the conversation has been mostly on her, though I have shared when prompted; like when she asks what my ethnicity is (Chinese). This gives us some common ground and moves the conversation forward comfortably. 

We each get our food (paid separately) and sit down. We're sitting on adjacent sides of a small square table, but even so it's kinda awkward to kino. Plus I was really hungry and kind of intent on my sandwich. At one point she got out her computer to show me a project, which necessitated leaning in to see. In retrospect I should have capitalized on this, but didn't. 

Anyways, part way into our lunch she drops the boyfriend bomb. They've been together since high school (she's now a senior) and it sounds pretty serious. However, she complains that his department is housed on a far part of campus which is 'hard.' 

**Having just gotten out of a trans-state long distance relationship I find this absurd. But when I told a female friend about this she concluded the fact that HB8 complained about it to me means she wants to break up. Thoughts?**

Anyhow, I can feel things going stale, mostly because I can't wolf down my sandwich and hold charming conversation at the same time. I tell her I have to go and wish her good luck on her project after walking her out of the cafe. Probably should have gone for a hug or something, but oh well. A few hours later I text her telling her I had a good time and state that we should get together again. She writes back but is silent on meeting again. 

Reflections:
I don't really plan on pursuing this any further because of the boyfriend, so I saw this as a way to get my feet wet again. It's just my own ethics, but I don't want to be an asshole, and if she wants to break up with her boyfriend she should do it for her own reasons. But maybe it was all a big shit test. 

I think my kino was pretty good at first, especially given that she's a self-described introvert and it was during the day, but it tapered off toward the end. It definitely had a more friendly feel once we were in the cafe. What do you think? Anything you would have done differently? Escalate faster, stick with the date? I felt like I was kind of high energy the whole time, and in my limited experience in the past I've done better with a more low key approach. I was no dancing monkey, but I certainly could have been more seductive with my energy and tone of voice. Any feedback or further clarifying questions are welcome. 

*edit for typos
**Update: She texted me this morning asking if I was free for lunch. I told her I had a meeting (which was true) and that I am usually more available in the evening. Not very girlfriendly behavior, but then again some girls are just oblivious. That or I friend zoned myself just that quickly."

Guess what, Newt, the American people aren't that fucking forgetful. Suck it.

Did I overreact?",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/mmrc6/update_to_ldr_just_ended_what_do_i_do_with_his/,"Here's the original post (it's tres short): http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/mljfw/ldr_just_ended_what_do_i_do_with_his_stuff/

 This might be lengthy, so I apologize in advance. I'm just extremely confused.

 A little background us. He's 21, I'm 22. He goes to school near our hometown, and I'm at a different school 5 hours away. We met through a summer internship at our parents' job. I'm the first girl that's made him want to ""settle down and commit to a relationship."" Known each other for 6 months, dating for 4, LDR for 3. I've been in a few relationships, but I've never felt as comfortable or happy with anyone else as I am him.

 We talked last night in circles and I'm in need of advice. I'm a fairly laid back person, but I'm all strung out.  Here's what we talked about. 

* 1- He told me previously that when he doesn't want to talk to a girl/gets bored with her, he ignores her.

 He doesn't talk to me for a week (not even a hello) or answer the handful of times I contact him.  I assume he wants to break things off. He tells me that was stupid and illogical, I'm making a big deal out of nothing and we're okay.



* 2- He's still ""single"" on facebook. His reasoning: is that it's not a big deal if he keeps it up there, he knows what's going on the relationship and if he takes it down, he might as well deactivate his whole facebook.

 I'm a pretty private person as well. My friends and family know I'm dating him. I don't have any status up on facebook at all. He said it wouldn't bother him if I had single up there. I just feel kinda put off that it's as if he wants to give the impression that he's single, or that he has to resort to being irrational and deactivating his facebook
  

* 3- He wants to keep his ""private life private"" and therefore I don't think anyone has a clue we're together. I've met some of his guy friends, but the introduction was ""This is so-and-so, she's goes to StateU."" I'm not sure what message that sent.

 I guess what bothers me is one of his guy friend's tried to get him to sleep with another girl. If his friend knew we were together, maybe it wouldn't have happened? Also, someone made a joke about him having a girl, and he flipped out saying ""Whoa, no girl here.""
   


* 4- He says I overstepped boundaries by contacting his mom last week. He might be right, but I'm not entirely sure.

 I have met his mom a few times in the work environment, and spoken on the phone (per his request) with her but haven't met her officially as the girlfriend. She had invited me to Thanksgiving with friends, and said she considers me part of the family.

 I was supposed to work all this week but got the time off. I emailed his mom to see if she could help me surprise him. She was happy to do so. When I was trying to see what his schedule would be like for the week and he never answered, I simply told her I wouldn't be able to do it and might not be making it to Thanksgiving after all. She mentioned it to him, and he got mad that I contacted her before ""meeting her in a social setting.""


* 5- I have to work early Friday so I'm leaving tomorrow. He said it's pointless to see him today or tomorrow since it's an immediate family member's birthday and tomorrow is Thanksgiving. He said he'd see me at Christmas, since I didn't stop by since getting into town.

 He's going to his family's later this morning, so I offered to just see him for an hour or so. He lives on the way to my best friend's (they go to the same U), so it wasn't as if I was going completely out of my way. He said he wouldn't be up if I stopped by and the birthday would be a whole day affair. I also offered to stop by on my way out of town tomorrow, and he said he'd be celebrating with his family.

 He then said that I should just do what I want since I don't listen to him anyway. I ceded and said I'd just see him at Christmas. He said me agreeing to side with him was a turn off because it made me seem like I was doing it to please him. He said the only way to see him since I picked an ""inconvenient week"" is come to spend the night. Mind you this is at 1am, and it's a 40 minute drive to his apartment.




 I'm feeling slightly crazy since everything is apparently my fault. Everything was great up until last week. He's a sarcastic person, but if this was all a joke, I think it went entirely too far. I have (or had) implicit trust in him which is a rare thing for me when it comes to relationships. I'm not sure what to do/think. Two weeks ago, this guy is telling me how important I am to him and nearly drops the ""L"" bomb, excited for me to come home, and now this...

 Did I read too much into everything?

**Final update: Thanks redditors for your thoughts and support. I broke up with him a few hours ago. Instead of his 'playing dumb' scheme, he finally got the point I wasn't playing anymore.**"

I hope you are doing well.

I am from Montreal and I just arrived in Michigan for an internship and to improve my English (it's getting better but still far from my French).
This internship is part of my Master degree that I am doing at l'Université de Montréal. 

I am here since a September so I don’t know a lot of people yet.
It`s too bad because I am sociable, I like to party and I would like to go out to discover the city (bars, restaurants, etc.) but alone it`s not the top.

I am 26, super chill, easy going. I like to have serious discussions from times to times and also like to have fun and enjoy life.   

I have been abroad several times (just for fun with friends or for school in exchange) but it`s the first that that is in a «professional environment» and I am realizing that is way more difficult like that to meet people. So, I decided to give it a try on reddit, I thought it be a good way to talk to interesting people.

PM if you want to chat...
Ciao

mnwws,3,2011-11-24,Am I being too hard on him? Ultimatums and job issues...,stille88,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mnwws/am_i_being_too_hard_on_him_ultimatums_and_job/," 23F dating a 32M. I've been with my bf for 1.5 yrs, and I thought he was actually the man I wanted to marry. Everything seemed to go well at first; we have a lot in common and we're intellectually compatible. However, he's had some bad luck with money. It started out where we'd go out for dates. But, then he ended up following me across the country for an internship, and had a hard time finding a job, so I started supporting both of us. 

I thought this would be temporary, and that when we got back home (i was finishing my degree), he'd get a job and things would get back to normal of sharing the weight. So, he finds a job, works at it for a month, and then one morning decides to call in sick. Of course he gets fired (this wasn't the first time). However, instead of looking for a new job right away, he decides to play video games and smoke pot with his sister and her bf for the next month. Meanwhile, I'm working a pt job while going to school, and i'm financing everything. 

So, at christmas we have a chat, he starts looking for a job, finds one, again things seem to be finally resolving. Fast forward three months later. His car is stolen (which he needs for this job), and he gets fired again. This time he starts looking right away. Finds another job, that he doesn't realize only gives commission. 
The whole time I'm financing everything on my entry-level just out of college job. 

Fast forward to now. We moved across the country for my post-grad studies, and after a month he had a job, then lost it again because it turned out to be a scam. Cycle repeats.

He's a great boyfriend in that he's there for me emotionally and is supportive, but he sucks at keeping a job and giving me financial stability. I feel gulilty and frustrated that I have to nag him about this, but hey, i'm a poor student that didn't expect to be supporting a 32M. I hoped that he would be the stronger person, but i was wrong.

Now, I've given him an ultimatum. Find a job by Christmas, or we're done. It's hard because I honestly thought he was the person I'd marry, but this cycle just wears and wears on me, and adds to all the other pressures I deal with externally.

So, am I being to hard on him? He's had some bad luck, but he owes me alot of money that I feel i may never see again and I'm tired of being the mother figure. Hell, i want to be the gf.
And, to top it all off, this really makes our sex life suck.

Thanksgiving woes, general observations..",[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/mnn7z/first_post_in_this_subreddit_thanksgiving_woes/,"So I was 300 pounds, a junior in college, and miserable. One day it finally kind of clicked that I can change my habits, or remain miserable.

Since Feb, I'm down to 266. I see counselors, nutritionists, etc - every week, or every other week. I have decades of self-loathing, social anxiety, and family bullshit to work through, and it is really tough. I feel broken. Between my schoolwork, internship, and other responsibilities, it is really hard to make the time to workout every day. I wish I was losing weight quicker, and it is difficult to stay motivated when I literally have an entire person's worth of weight to go.

But I'm seeing changes, and that's nice. When other people notice it, it is nice as well. Some days I feel really body-positive, and other times I feel super regretful. I wish it ""clicked"" for me when I was a freshman, I'd probably be at my ideal weight by now. I've wasted college being obese, and it really affected the amount/quality experiences I've had here. Tons of what-ifs. 

This semester I started taking Wellbutrin and I guess it helps. I am home for Thanksgiving break and it is difficult to stay out of the fridge. Tomorrow I am really going to enjoy my meal. I want to taste everything, but not as much. 

In general, I'm happy I found this subreddit, but half of the posts here make me rage. A lot of you are already have amazing bodies, have never been over 160 pounds, etc. Argh. "
movs6,12,2011-11-25,The exact opposite of last time :),[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/movs6/the_exact_opposite_of_last_time/,"My SO 23 [F]lew in last Friday to spend the week of thanksgiving with her family and I (22 m). It has been fantastic seeing her face and celebrating the holidays with her. We also had the chance to celebrate me getting my dream job, at a fantastic local sushi place, have some wonderful sexy-times, great food cooked by her mom, and generally just enjoy each others presence. Well, all good things must end this included.  
  
However, unlike when she left 6 weeks ago for the first time, this was a very easy separation. In this week I found out my job starts a month later than I was thinking (late feb instead of early feb) so I can spend a long period with her over Christmas and still spend time with my family here before I move out to my job (closer to her). So I purchased tickets to spend 3 weeks with her and I will be leaving to do so in 3 weeks and we will celebrate Christmas AND New Years together. I fly out the day after I officially graduate college with the degree I have been after since freshman year of high school. My job will pay me enough to fly us around to see each other at least once a month over the next year while we are still LD, as well as cover rent in a kick ass apartment by myself until she can move in and get a yob for herself once her current internship is over, and still have allot left over for fun shit. And it will halve the distance between us and drop the cost of plane tickets by at least half.  
  
Last time we parted I had no idea what the future had in store for me, we had no plans to see each other until around Christmas-ish (this trip that just ended was unplanned, just good fortune) and even then we didn't know for how long we would be together. Everything on all fronts is going better than my most optimistic hopes and I am so thankful for the support this forum provides, as well as the good fortune that has been afforded me. I know there are many of you out there in much more difficult situations and this may come across as kind of gloating, but I am sorry I just had to share this.

TL;DR: Its much easier to say goodbye when you know how amazing the future is going to be.

mq1z8,4,2011-11-26,A Season Six Frustration [Spoilers...] ,BulletStorm,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/mq1z8/a_season_six_frustration_spoilers/,"I've got somewhere to be in a few minutes, so I'm going to keep this short I suppose. 

Anyways, the first five episodes of the season were full of callbacks to Brain Moser. All of that Ryan the Intern crap, and then that dialogue where Deb recalls aloud in public that Rudy the Ice Truck Killer, is Dexter's brother. 

All of that - just to serve as a reminder for the fans of the show for who ITK is? I mean, I hate to jump to conclusions but I feel like that's all it was. There are still four episodes left to be proven wrong but - well - at the moment - its a frustration. 

I mean, I understand spoon-feeding the audience background info on characters we haven't seen in a while - but that is what ""Previously on Dexter"" is for. A ITK montage before ""Nebraska"" would have benefited the season more than a bunch of ITK hints and teases, am I wrong?"
mpu1c,5,2011-11-26,Boyfriend and parents trouble,IllHaveASalute,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mpu1c/boyfriend_and_parents_trouble/,"Ok Reddit, here goes nothing.

I have a boyfriend, and we've been together for about four year (I'm 22, he's 25). He's sweet, he's nice, but, the big problem is that him and my family don't get along. Various reasons for this ""He's no good for you."" ""They're trying to control you."" ""He/his parents don't have jobs."" ""They're dicks."" and so on, and so on.

My parents aren't as controlling as he seems to think they are (we're from quite different families, mine are a little pushy when it comes to expectations and social behaviour, his are more the 'as long as you're happy doing what you do' types.) They were, however, especially in the beginning, quite critical about him, his education, clothing style etc. 

Now, my parents aren't too bad to him any more, and that's a big relief to me, but he still doesn't like my family or being around my family. This makes every single birthday, holiday or otherwise special occasion in my family absolutely horrible for me. Not as much being there, but the discussions before it.

For example, today is my little sister's birthday, and tomorrow we're having a farewell dinner for her, because she's going abroad for her internship. My parents were hesitant to invite my boyfriend to this dinner, but did anyway, because they knew it would make me feel horrible if he wasn't invited. Logically speaking, this means my boyfriend would also go to my little sister's birthday, but he refuses to hang out with my family two days in a row.

This, in turn, makes them disinclined to invite him to other things, which makes me feel bad, which makes him behave better when it comes to my family, which causes them to invite him to things despite his attitude, which makes him annoyed because of the time spent with my family, which makes my parents disinclined...

You get my drift.

What can I do about this? Do I just stay in the middle of this? It's getting really, really annoying, and makes me feel bad, generally.

Edited for ages and a little more info on why he doesn't get on with my folks. "

I'm a senior at a public university in the U.S. and will be going on to Grad School after this year.  I'm from out of state, so I'm paying a higher tuition than most people.  For the last 3 years, I've also had to fund my own education.  Because of the tanked economy, my parent's can't afford to pay for me and my two sisters to go to school so I've had to take a large amount of student loans to fund my education.

My parents never set up a trust fund or anything to help fund our education, and they didn't emphasize saving extensively while we were young to help pay for college education.  I've been able to get pretty good internships over the summers, but that income has gone towards living expenses (rent, food, gas, etc.) and haven't been able to save much of it for living throughout the year.  I've also had a part time job for the past two years during school to have some sort of income to try and take a dent out of all my expenses.

Overall, I've got barely enough to pay for rent.  I can't go to the grocery store to get food that often because I don't have enough money.  I've got about $1k for expenses, which seem to add up left and right.  Overall, I'm a very frugal person.  I don't go out often (maybe once a week compared to what seems like every night for most of my friends).  I don't buy new things or get sucked in by impulse buys.  And I do what I can to save wherever I can.  But none of it really seems to work when I look at my empty bank account every month.

Not really sure where I'm going here, but do you guys have any advice of things that I could be doing to a) minimize my expenses even further, b) get a little extra income, or c) do anything else that could help.  

I look forward to hearing your advice!"
mr15y,0,2011-11-27,Why does he still want to be with me?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/mr15y/why_does_he_still_want_to_be_with_me/,"My boyfriend (24) and I (22) moved in for the first time this past summer after having dated for three years since my sophomore year of college. This is the first serious relationship we've both been in. He and I have never lived out on our own before excluding dorms, so the first time I moved out, I moved out with him, which probably wasn't the best idea.

We've been having a really rough time adjusting, and fighting over a lot of things especially chores. I'm the one who has a lower tolerance for mess, and I would nag him incessantly, always wanting things to be done a certain way. He's really stubborn, and tends to rationalize how his way of (not) doing things is correct. He would complain that I would do all the chores before he got a chance to get to them, and then I would yell at him for not doing them. All of this bred much resentment on both of our parts. Whenever we would have serious arguments, he tended to leave the house when I got too annoying, which would frustrate me even more. I have also done some pretty irrational things when upset (e.g. pouring cat litter on his head), so I know I'm not blameless in all of this.

I also don't feel like we have a lot in common anymore. He enjoys sleeping in until 4 or 5 pm on weekends, whereas I would like to be up and doing something productive, preferably outside, and not in front of a monitor screen. However, he is content to merely play video games or watch GSL. I don't have any friends of my own or a lot of hobbies, so I know I rely on him too much for a social outlet. I would complain about not spending enough quality time together, but I can see how that may be an issue I have to deal with on my own.
Never throughout this time have I wanted to break up despite all the fights, however, he has expressed before that he would be happier being single, and that this isn't what he signed up for. I have a feeling I am just afraid of being alone, or that I am too attached to him because I don't have much of a life outside of the relationship. Flash forward to somewhat recently, we had another fight right before I left to visit a friend from high school on the opposite coast. He wrote me a check reimbursing a rather expensive birthday gift I had purchased him, and didn't come home the night before I left.

While I was at my friend's, I contacted him, and bought him a video game to try and reconcile our past fight. I asked him if there was anything that could be done to fix our relationship, and he said no. This was when I finally mentally checked out and accepted that maybe we weren't right for each other and even though I cared about him, that might not be enough to fix things. I also stupidly got really drunk, and asked his good friend to sleep with me (one I had a bit of a crush on from a year before). I know it was wrong and a huge bitch thing to do, but I thought we were over. My friend did not help because she encouraged me, saying that I didn't owe my boyfriend anything, and he should have no control over what me or his friend choose to do.
I come back from my trip, and my boyfriend does a complete 180. He says he wants to work things out, and that he learned that I mean more to him than he previously thought. (He did get food poisoning and got into a minor car accident, while I was away). He's willing to put more effort in doing things that make me happy (cleaning, spending more time with me). Of course, at this point, I'm still obsessing over his friend. I agree to try and work things out with my boyfriend, but I continue chatting and texting with the friend (including minor flirting), which is really wrong, emotional cheating, etc.

I understand I'm putting his friend on a bit of a pedestal in a grass is greener type scenario. My boyfriend never officially graduated from college (needs two more credits). He was going to take a class over the summer, but he never went and had to drop it, which wasted $2000. I think he can be a bit irresponsible, and honestly, I don't want to be put in a situation where I have to pay for all of our living expenses because he can't get a job due to not having a degree (his paid internship right now is temporary for one year). His friend on the other hand seems more driven (applying to medical school), and even though he was probably as much of a gamer as my boyfriend, he claims to want to do more productive things with his time.

My boyfriend catches me talking to his friend and lying about it (twice), and of course accuses me of leading him on, which I don't dispute. The only problem is he still wants to be with me even after all of this. I even told him what happened when I was away. I've since stopped talking to his friend, but I almost still want to us to breakup because he certainly deserves better than how I've been treating him. Now I don't really know what to do... our lease isn't up for another 6 months or so.

It didn't used to bother me that I've only ever been with one person, but it's definitely starting to now. How can you possibly marry the first person you've ever had sex with? The only person you've ever kissed? I feel like I've settled down way too early. I live in the suburbs with a relatively stable job, but I feel very repressed. I never partied or dated a lot in college, so I never got it out of my system. Even if I were single now, I doubt I would have any success because it's hard for me to meet people, and I'm not the most friendly or social person.

I'm tired of my older coworkers asking me to check in with myself to see whether or not I'm happy, and telling me I'm too young to be putting this much effort into making my relationship work. I'm tired of my boyfriend's parents getting involved and suggesting we go to counseling, giving us relationship self-help books. I don't understand why they're so vested in our relationship in the first place. It's hard for me to separate my unhappiness with my own life verses my dissatisfaction with the relationship. I just don't want to get married, have kids, be stuck in a huge rut, end up getting divorced and generally regretting the way I've lived my life. I also don't know how to stop thinking about the friend, and wondering if things would be better with him because even if I were single, that's not something I could feasibly pursue anyway... My boyfriend is doing everything I've wanted him to do, but now I can't get any of these stupid thoughts out of my head, and it's definitely poisoning my outlook on our relationship.

I have a software engineering internship this summer in Arlington with a web startup, and would love to find a fellow intern as a roommate (for financial and social reasons). If anyone has any interest, please don't hesitate to ask questions. I'm cool with living in Arlington or DC, apparently the office I'll work at is on the orange line.

mqhox,6,2011-11-26,Advice for student?,Beignet,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/mqhox/advice_for_student/,"So here's my situation: I'm a college student determined to graduate debt-free. I've got enough saved up to pay out of pocket for another year or so, but that still leaves another semester for which I have to take out a loan for, unless I do something about it. So in this next year, in between whatever I can do, be it a job, scholarships, stricter budgeting, methods a la r/beermoney, short-term investments, or whatever reddit can advise I do, I've got to save up about ~$9000. 

Some info:

* I already budget, and most months it comes down to: $338 for car payment and insurance, ~$150 for food, ~$120 gas, and ~$100-150 for misc.

* I'm currently doing a paying internship that I'll repeat next summer, and I'll hopefully get a raise for that also. It's given me a well-sized positive margin this semester. 

* If up to it, I can have a paid TA position next fall also. 

Is this even feasible, or worth bothering with? I go to a top engineering school with a reputation of good job prospects after college, and people seemed convinced a small amount of loans won't matter, but the idea of living with debt and not being able to find a job after school is truly frightening. As always, I'd appreciate any input. "
msm69,8,2011-11-28,At my low-point. Time to change.,lazyengineer,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/msm69/at_my_lowpoint_time_to_change/,"I’m continually hitting my all-time low every day, hoping to turn it around. I'm a semester past my expected graduation date for Mechanical Engineering, going another semester on top of that. Not because I missed a year due to bad grades/co-op/just taking a break. I just failed enough classes to force me to take an extra year without failing out. 

I have a 2.0 GPA, which if you know anything about engineering, isn't really what employers want to see. I know I can do better, at least a 3.0, but I don't because of pure apathy. Almost all of my classes in these 4.5 years have had 10% of the grade as homework. I can probably count all the homework assignments I have done on my fingers and toes, and that's what actually makes me tear up at night. Knowing that if I just took 20-30 minutes out of my days to do those homework assignments, I would be in a much better situation.

I've managed one internship, this past summer, and I have no idea how I got it, I guess I just have good interpersonal skills because it sure wasn't my resume. Originally the plan was for me to graduate this semester and work full time for them starting January, plans changed when I found out I wouldn't be graduating this semester. I still had to apply to get the job, but that was essentially a sure thing. Instead I haven't applied, and haven't even contacted the company to update them on my situation. I slumped back into apathy. Every week for this entire semester (going on the 14th week in a row) I have told myself ""this is when I e-mail the company, I'm not going to put it off again"" but I never do. I think it's out of fear of rejection, that they won't wait for me to graduate, that I will have to find another company as generous as they were. No matter what it is, I can't bring myself to do something as simple as e-mail them.

On top of that, I have almost entirely stopped going to any classes. I sleep in late, stay in my room watching movies and TV shows to pass the days. The only classes I go to are the ones where there are tests, or group meetings/labs. I at least still do work for the classes where other students rely on me like lab reports and group projects, but nothing more than that. The killer is that I know I can learn the material in a night if I need to for tests. Knowing that I can get by without doing any work has kept me in this state of limbo for 4 years. Don't go to class, don't do homework, take the test, get an A or B on it, still get a C or D in the class. I almost wish I couldn't learn the material that easily, then I would have failed out long ago and gotten a wake-up call.

I’m overweight as well, only at 180, but I’m pretty short, 5'1"" short. Overall it gives me a rather poor self-image, adding in the fact that I haven’t had anything even close to a girlfriend since high school. 

The worst thing, and probably the lead cause of my apathy is how much I have lied to those around me over the past 5 years. My closest friends, my parents, my siblings, I have fed them all lies about my life. Telling them stories of what I wished my life were like as if it were the truth. I have had to live my life as if they were truths, but only as an outward appearance. Even as I’m writing this, I have to force myself not to lie to you, and this is a completely anonymous post… who do I have to lie to? I really want to turn those lies into realities, because it truly is who I want to be. I just can’t muster up the motivation to do anything about it when, for now, it’s easier to maintain the lies even though it causes me to be unhappy.

Just writing this has helped a bit, maybe not with motivation, but with sorting out thoughts. I began writing this because I felt tired of what my life has become and just wanted to tell someone because I haven’t had anyone to confide in since they all know me as the person in my lies and none of what I said here. I want to start changing my life, and I hopefully will start that now. I know that I will have to either force myself to start now, or eventually my lies will unravel and that will be my wake-up call.

TL:DR; I’m a lazy, apathetic, slightly overweight, pathological liar who wants to change. I just needed to tell someone.

It was a two person team affair.  It was the girl's (Kyle?) job to gain access to the Ice Truck Killer files and items.  Lewis, the computer whiz he is, set up that auction site for the girl to show Masuka in order to cover their tracks.  Knowing Masuka can't reveal any of this to anyone, they know the girl is in the clue.  Insert Lewis.  Lewis can apparently do anything with a computer.  He probably has already copied large amounts of information from Homicide.  He has also learned about each person in the unit and has mapped out the place.  Lewis knows there is something different about Dexter, but doesn't know what it is past Dexter being a superstar and the one who could ruin the big plan.  It is setting up for something big...which is...

Either Lewis or Lewis and the blonde, intern girl are going to be the major villains of Season 7.  I predict right now that in the final episode of Season 6, Jamie is killed by the pair in an Ice Truck Killer fashion which launches us straight into Season 7.

There is also something else I'm not so sure of.  Remember the first promo we got for Season 6?  It involves someone's fingers running across Dexter's slides and I have always thought it wasn't Dexter's fingers.  Maybe it is just me though.

The entire Travis / Gellar relationship was blatantly obvious for avid watchers and a source of entertainment for the casual watcher. The writers are drawing our attention away from something extremely significant happening in the last couple of episodes. Let's put aside the DDK case ALTOGETHER and focus on everything else that has been happening.

* Where has Quinn been going. Yes, we know he's been man whoring around... but maybe he's up to something else
* Batista has changed. His life is going down the shitter as Quinn so politely pointed out...but maybe something else has him riled up. He knows about Dexters sporadic schedule since his sister is constantly baby sitting Dexters kid.
* Laguerta and Matthews need to figure out how to keep Deb in line. They can't fire her... so maybe they will approach Dexter to change the blood report. This will also give him leverage over LaGuerta and Matthews
* Debs is having epiphany after epiphany with her therapist. The more sessions Deb has, the more distant she's becoming with her brother. You can even see in the preview that she finds out Dexter is her safe place. Maybe she will break those bonds to stand on her own feet which lets her look at Dexter objectively rather than subjectively...something Dexter has been depending on for his sister not to find out
* The first interns short stay doesn't seem right. She was obsessed with the ITK and the latest victim had 1 of ITK's MO's...maybe she's helping Travis? Maybe both interns are?

**Edit** - Forgot to mention that I think Quinn and Batista are getting rather close. So close, that they might confide in each other about their suspicions in Dexter. Quinn will tell him about his past findings that will match up with Dexters sporadic schedule that Batista has noticed. Maybe next season... Dexters nemesis will be Quinn and Batista...now there's a twist"

mrq96,6,2011-11-28,Help with Statement of Purpose,falconj,HomeworkHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/mrq96/help_with_statement_of_purpose/,"Hi, I'm going to be applying to graduate school in a few days, and my statement of purpose is shit. Absolute fucking shit. I'm desperate for people to help me look over it, and if anyone here can give me any sort of advice I'd be really fucking grateful.


Statement of Purpose
	When I was young, my father brought home The Private Life of Plants by David Attenborough. I was captivated. I finished it within a week, and watched it over the greater part of a year. When my father subsequently bought The Blue Planet and The Life of Mammals, I knew that I wanted to be an ecologist. Over the years, these goals have evolved and become more refined, but the general idea remained the same. With this goal in mind, I set out on a journey to improve myself and acquire knowledge in the biological sciences. I remained fascinated by ecology throughout high school, working on projects involving the effects of growth stimulants on tadpoles, and scoring a perfect score on my Biology SAT Subject Test. I volunteered for hundreds of hours in the _________ Zoo, and gained experience with dealing with all sorts of fauna, including deers, boa constrictors, and snapping turtles. I also helped develop a few programs to boost the zoo’s popularity. Near the end of high school, my interests shifted towards biochemistry, and I entered college as a biochemistry major. I was lucky enough to be granted the opportunities to intern in various biochemistry labs. As a high school senior, I worked in Dr. ________'s lab, where I studied protein active sites with the help of some graduate students. I learned to operate many advanced laboratory equipments and learned various techniques for keeping good lab notes. As a freshman, I interned in Dr. _________’s lab, where I studied neuronal morphogenesis using pluripotent embryonic mice cells.  As a sophomore, I worked in Dr. ___________s lab, where I was fortunate enough to participate in a high funding study that studied impaired cognitive states using a 3D virtual-reality environment to simulate driving situations. As I continued through college, however, I realized that I wasn’t particularly happy with what I was doing. Remembering the visceral enjoyment I used to have working with animals, I decided to switch my focus towards ecology and evolutionary biology. I worked in Dr. _________’s lab as a junior, where I studied mutualistic interactions between endophytic fungi and plant hosts, namely those that can cause a high increase in plant fecundity. Currently, I am acting as a lab assisant in Dr. _________’s lab, under the guidance of graduate student ________. The project I am currently assisting with studies biotic controls of ecology and the evolution of plant growth and defense in response to these biotic controls. The project focuses on examining the differences between plant tolerance and plant resistance, using different herbivores as biotic controls to influence selections on plants for growth and defense. The questions that the project seeks to answer include the matter of whether herbivores select plants that tolerate damage or whether tolerance is a product of selection. I aim to conduct my independent research on a similar topic. I plan to use Sapium sebifera, the Chinese Tallow, as a study system. My goal in this project is to introduce herbivores as a biotic control to determine the change in herbivore tolerance and growth rate that occurs in the Chinese Tallow. Scale insects are a group of herbivores that have not been used with Chinese Tallow before. A study like this can be significant, as the Chinese Tallow is a noxious invader, and studying such interactions can allow ecologists to better understand how to fight the Tallow’s spread. I’ve also broadened my knowledge by taking all sorts of classes. The fields that I’ve been exposed to include insect biology, conservation, immunology, evolution, genetics, infectious diseases, and biodiversity. I’ve also expanded my base by taking all sorts of psychology, philosophy, and language classes. With all that I’ve done as an undergraduate, continuing my studies in graduate school is the obvious progression. I plan to acquire my Ph.D. with similar research to what I have experience with. Most likely I will be focused on the evolution of interactions between organisms. My prior experience consists mostly of mutualistic plant interaction with fungi and conflicts between plants and invertebrates, but I am also interested in studying population dynamics and how introduction of invasive species and other novel interactions can change the population structure. I hope to work on study systems that are having strong effects on the ecosystem that they occupy, and to publish data that can be significant in understanding the ecological interactions that they have. All things considered, I feel that _______ university is a good fit for all of my needs. The research of Professor ________ is especially compelling, as it focuses on biological interactions and population dynamics. Dr. _______’s research is a great fit for my interests, and I believe that I can definitely cultivate my knowledge and grow as an individual in his/her lab. I would be extremely pleased to work with Dr. ______, and if I were to be given this opportunity, I would do my utmost best to succeed in my studies. 

edit: Sorry about the strange italics bold font... I can't get it to go away for some reason. Any help would still be greatly appreciated!

mrfuz,2,2011-11-27,Why does he still want to be with me?,[deleted],ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/mrfuz/why_does_he_still_want_to_be_with_me/," My boyfriend (24) and I (22) moved in for the first time this past summer after having dated for three years since my sophomore year of college. This is the first serious relationship we've both been in. He and I have never lived out on our own before excluding dorms, so the first time I moved out, I moved out with him, which probably wasn't the best idea.

We've been having a really rough time adjusting, and fighting over a lot of things especially chores. I'm the one who has a lower tolerance for mess, and I would nag him incessantly, always wanting things to be done a certain way. He's really stubborn, and tends to rationalize how his way of (not) doing things is correct. He would complain that I would do all the chores before he got a chance to get to them, and then I would yell at him for not doing them. All of this bred much resentment on both of our parts. Whenever we would have serious arguments, he tended to leave the house when I got too annoying, which would frustrate me even more. I have also done some pretty irrational things when upset (e.g. pouring cat litter on his head), so I know I'm not blameless in all of this.

I also don't feel like we have a lot in common anymore. He enjoys sleeping in until 4 or 5 pm on weekends, whereas I would like to be up and doing something productive, preferably outside, and not in front of a monitor screen. However, he is content to merely play video games or watch GSL. I don't have any friends of my own or a lot of hobbies, so I know I rely on him too much for a social outlet. I would complain about not spending enough quality time together, but I can see how that may be an issue I have to deal with on my own.
Never throughout this time have I wanted to break up despite all the fights, however, he has expressed before that he would be happier being single, and that this isn't what he signed up for. I have a feeling I am just afraid of being alone, or that I am too attached to him because I don't have much of a life outside of the relationship. Flash forward to somewhat recently, we had another fight right before I left to visit a friend from high school on the opposite coast. He wrote me a check reimbursing a rather expensive birthday gift I had purchased him, and didn't come home the night before I left.

While I was at my friend's, I contacted him, and bought him a video game to try and reconcile our past fight. I asked him if there was anything that could be done to fix our relationship, and he said no. This was when I finally mentally checked out and accepted that maybe we weren't right for each other and even though I cared about him, that might not be enough to fix things. I also stupidly got really drunk, and asked his good friend to sleep with me (one I had a bit of a crush on from a year before). I know it was wrong and a huge bitch thing to do, but I thought we were over. My friend did not help because she encouraged me, saying that I didn't owe my boyfriend anything, and he should have no control over what me or his friend choose to do.

I come back from my trip, and my boyfriend does a complete 180. He says he wants to work things out, and that he learned that I mean more to him than he previously thought. (He did get food poisoning and got into a minor car accident, while I was away). He's willing to put more effort in doing things that make me happy (cleaning, spending more time with me). Of course, at this point, I'm still obsessing over his friend. I agree to try and work things out with my boyfriend, but I continue chatting and texting with the friend (including minor flirting), which is really wrong, emotional cheating, etc.

I understand I'm putting his friend on a bit of a pedestal in a grass is greener type scenario. My boyfriend never officially graduated from college (needs two more credits). He was going to take a class over the summer, but he never went and had to drop it, which wasted $2000. I think he can be a bit irresponsible, and honestly, I don't want to be put in a situation where I have to pay for all of our living expenses because he can't get a job due to not having a degree (his paid internship right now is temporary for one year). His friend on the other hand seems more driven (applying to medical school), and even though he was probably as much of a gamer as my boyfriend, he claims to want to do more productive things with his time.
My boyfriend catches me talking to his friend and lying about it (twice), and of course accuses me of leading him on, which I don't dispute. The only problem is he still wants to be with me even after all of this. I even told him what happened when I was away. I've since stopped talking to his friend, but I almost still want to us to breakup because he certainly deserves better than how I've been treating him. Now I don't really know what to do... our lease isn't up for another 6 months or so.

It didn't used to bother me that I've only ever been with one person, but it's definitely starting to now. How can you possibly marry the first person you've ever had sex with? The only person you've ever kissed? I feel like I've settled down way too early. I live in the suburbs with a relatively stable job, but I feel very repressed. I never partied or dated a lot in college, so I never got it out of my system. Even if I were single now, I doubt I would have any success because it's hard for me to meet people, and I'm not the most friendly or social person.

I'm tired of my older coworkers asking me to check in with myself to see whether or not I'm happy, and telling me I'm too young to be putting this much effort into making my relationship work. I'm tired of my boyfriend's parents getting involved and suggesting we go to counseling, giving us relationship self-help books. I don't understand why they're so vested in our relationship in the first place. It's hard for me to separate my unhappiness with my own life verses my dissatisfaction with the relationship. I just don't want to get married, have kids, be stuck in a huge rut, end up getting divorced and generally regretting the way I've lived my life. I also don't know how to stop thinking about the friend, and wondering if things would be better with him because even if I were single, that's not something I could feasibly pursue anyway... My boyfriend is doing everything I've wanted him to do, but now I can't get any of these stupid thoughts out of my head, and it's definitely poisoning my outlook on our relationship.

tldr; Asked my boyfriend's friend to sleep with him. Told my boyfriend, and he still wants to stay together.

Edit: never actually slept with the friend. "

My best friend has decided that she will not do anything with me one on one. She won't give any explanation. She doesn't seem to want to understand how much this is hurting me. Just a few months ago, she swore up and down that she would never abandon me in any way (something that has happened a lot to me in the past). She doesn't accept that when I start my internship in two weeks, I won't have time to coordinate meeting up with her and someone else during my downtime. She won't accept that I don't even have many other friends to hangout with. She won't accept the *fact* that sporadic text based communication is not, under any circumstances, a way to sustain a friendship long term. She won't accept the *fact* that what she is doing without any explanation is exceptionally painful to me. She won't accept the *fact* that as painful this is, it is equally infuriating. She won't accept the *fact* that I cannot hold on much longer because of how painful and confusing this is. Yet, in spite of all that, she still thinks we can be the close friends we once we're if this continues.

In terms of backstory, she and I both have been suffering from severe clinical depression for years. I'm a 19 y.o. male, she is the same age. I suspect her passive aggressively jealous boyfriend (who she has know for less than half as long as we have known each other) has something to do with this, but she won't give an answer to that either. Now, the thing you need to understand about me is that my friends are my family, as my real family can't seem to understand what I'm going through. I love my friends, and would fight to the death for them. I would fight just as hard for the friendship itself. I don't have any idea what is going on, but I do know that what she is doing is making everything worse for me in terms of depression management. I can't afford to lose another friend. Not again. What do? And if you need clarification, just ask. "
mtixa,0,2011-11-29,Depressed - Is My Life Fucked?,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/mtixa/depressed_is_my_life_fucked/,"Hey there Reddit, not sure if I am posting in the right place, but might as well give it a shot. This is my very first post.

I understand that life is not easy, and that we all have a ton of problems to deal with. However, its as if my problems have compounded substantially over the past two or so years, and now I am feeling hopeless, depressed and unsatisfied with everything I have worked for.

*1* I'm a senior in college, and on May 20, 2012 I will graduate. What is supposed to be the day of my greatest academic accomplishment feels more like the impending day of reckoning. Academically:

- I'm 28k in debt (and growing), graduating with a degree in Political Science in May.

- Realized I hated my major and program last semester, but am finishing with my degree since I only have two courses left.

- I've worked part-time since I was 14, and pay for all my own expenses in college (except phone and car insurance). I was working 35 hr/week last semester with a 17 cred. course load.

- I've been very successful outside of the classroom (elected to Student Govt., appointed to city rent control board, did undergrad. research, and had spectacular federal internship.) 

- My major GPA is around a 3.4, but my cumulative GPA is right under a 3.0.

*2* Nonetheless, I am completely hopeless, sad and unmotivated to get out of bed most days. I feel intense anxiety, sadness, anger, disillusionment and contempt about the world around me, and have even sought psychological help:

- Diagnosed with inattentive AD/HD three times, including last semester, for which I began taking Dextroamphetamine Sulfate (Dexedrine). I stopped after three months because I became a zombie and developed social anxiety.

- Diagnosed with depression four times, once in each level of schooling: elementary (8yrs), middle (13yrs), high (17yrs), and college (20 yrs). 

- Recently quit attending therapy for general anxiety because I couldn't afford the visits after my insurance refused to cover the costs.

- I also identify as gay, which has had its additional issues. I'm out to most of my family and friends, but because I come from split parents, I still haven't told my Dad's side. Although, I am happily in a relationship that just surpassed the 1.5yr mark (woot!).

- I recently have developed a bit of an anger issue, though its more like I get enraged over the fact that I have so many self-perceived problems.

*3* My parents are another issue. I am extremely grateful for my mom, who has been my primary caregiver my entire life. I'm 21 years old now, and times have changed, and now I am attempting to become independent as much as possible. However, my Mom and I are not without issues, as she suffers from some serious issues herself:

- Blamed me for her financial problems and marriage issues this past week, even though I am never home.

- Attributed it to the fact that I am without a job for the first time ever. I was offered a seasonal job at UPS for 8.50 an hour, but turned it down because the shifts were from 10pm- 3:30am Sun-Thurs. 

- My mom and stepdad called me a loser and lazy because I turned down the job, but it would have seriously hindered my schooling (9am classes) plus term papers and finals season coming up.

TL;DR Help me Reddit, I have always worked hard, pushed myself academically, and exceeded people's expectations in my academic life and professional life. I am considering staying in school, but the money is not there. My parents are irrational and scapegoating because they are having financial problems due to their frivolous spending. I am hopeless, and just have nowhere to turn. I can answer any questions, because its too difficult to elaborate in one post.

mth5l,0,2011-11-29,How should the last 2 seasons play out?  Describe your perfect ending to the series.,Trax123,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/mth5l/how_should_the_last_2_seasons_play_out_describe/,"Anyone who watches Dexter can agree that the show has fallen off a cliff since Season 4.  What could the writers do over the next 2 seasons to redeem your faith in the show?

In between intermittently dozing off during Sunday's episode, I cooked up a plotline that I think could be fun to watch play out.

Louis isn't a serial killer, he's an FBI agent that's working undercover with Miami Metro Homicide.  The feds have had a file on Dexter ever since Rita's death and they now suspect him of being the actual Bay Harbor Butcher.  His relationship with Batista's sister and his work in the internship program are designed to get as close to Dexter as he can.  This is revealed at the end of this season.

Season 7 would be ""Dexter on the lam"".  He'd be on the run from the feds, giving the show the chance to get out of Florida and away from the characters we all hate in Miami Metro.  Deb would take a leave of absence from work and would be tracking Dexter separate from the FBI.  At the end of season 7 she catches up with him, and given the opportunity to kill him or turn him in, she delivers him to the FBI.

Season 8 would be Dexter on trial as a serial killer.  He'd spend the bulk of the season in prison or in a courtroom.  At the end of the series, Deb has a change of heart and decides to help him break out of custody and he flees the country.

mt485,14,2011-11-29,Recently moved to new city. coming to terms that I can't function socially or in school. advice?,throwaway_83219,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mt485/recently_moved_to_new_city_coming_to_terms_that_i/,"**Warning: Long post, TL;DR at end**

**Background:** Male college student, early 20s. I've been dealing with anxiety/depression to varying extents for years. Dealt with some bullying back in high school, including by my own brother which my mom refused to do anything about (he's a lot better now). It was never any 'worse' than emotional/verbal abuse, but there were situations that I had no option to get away from him (ie driving to and from school).

I'm also gay, and felt horrified about coming out and such (even to people who would end up accepting me). Eventually I did it after I started college, and my family/others were ok with it. I would have never done this in high school because of possible retaliation from family, and being ""gay kid"" in HS.

I haven't felt that passionate or motivated for years (maybe when I was in middle school). I'm a CS major and have managed to slide by, but don't really have the drive to do awesome stuff outside of class that some of my peers do.

**Current situation:** Recently moved to a new area (fairly big city) and lived with family (wanted to take a break from previous school). Eventually I started school here and got a place on my own, which is paid for with college funds. I guess part of this whole thing was thinking I could run away from my problems…in theory it might help being that i'm now in a far more tolerant/diverse place.

I have very few friends here. Mostly it's because i don't feel like i can be myself around people that I meet. There's a couple of people that i get along with really well, but I met them online and don't hang out with them incredibly often (one moved away recently). 

I don't really think i'm that interesting or cool compared with everyone else in the city. Some of my old friends might think i'm a really interesting/smart person, but i derp out when meeting new people here. I haven't dated that many people, and tend to go out with people i'm not highly attracted to because i feel that i'm not good enough for anyone else.

Yes, i've gotten involved with student organizations and stuff, and months later I'm still paralyzed with fear whenever i'm around them. Some of them seem like great people (some others a bit less so), but they still really don't know me at all…i'm a complete weirdo around them. I held an unpaid internship in the city before starting school, and faced the exact same situation there. Made absolutely no connections there, and in the future it might end up having done more harm than good. Where I used to live I could go up to people and chat with them fairly easily (although i had few close friends), but can't really do that here.

I managed to get through the last semester okay, but I think i'm going to fail some of my classes this semester. It's not that i'm not intellectually capable of doing the work. But I constantly worry about my ability to complete it until I get started at the last minute and do a half-ass job, then later realize I could have done it easily.

**Long-term worries**: I continually question my ability to sustain gainful employment and sustain myself (unless I can find some sort of business venture to get into on my own or something). In theory i should be able to do well, but once again can't be myself at job interviews and end up settling for bottom-of-the-barrel jobs. The area I live in is a fairly big city, and for whatever reason I always think a person like me doesn't deserve to live here.

**Therapy?**: I've seen a couple of counselors/therapists in previous years. Didn't really get much out of it, and I don't know if i was actually diagnosed with anything. One of them recommended an SSRI eventually, so I went to a doctor and got a script for Zoloft. It worked a little (albeit with side effects) but eventually went off of it when the doctor shut down and I never bothered to go back. I tried to go to the student medical center once to get a prescription for antidepressants again, but they basically just blew me off. (Now I understand it's best to just see a real doctor or psych if possible.)

I know that I need help…I have insurance but don't know how to go about finding where to go. Should I go to a psychologist or psychiatrist first? What would I expect from a psychiatrist…is it basically just discussing symptoms and being given a prescription?

**TL;DR** Have dealt with (anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, lack of assertiveness, …) to varying extents for years. Recently moved to new city. I can't be myself around people, have very few friends, difficulty with dating, etc. Also having problems succeeding in school (likely in part because of social issues). Advice?

And thanks for reading."

We dated for almost 2 years and were living together when we broke up (I'm 24, she's 21).

About 9 months into the relationship, I ended up getting an internship at a company that was in a city 4000km (2600mi) away from our city. We weren't living together at the time. I was in love with her, so naturally I did what any other person would do; I invited her to come with me and live with me there for the 4 months that I was required to stay there. She didn't have a job at the time, so she came along. Everything was going ok, and I say ""ok"" because she has some depression and anxiety issues which made it somewhat difficult to live with her, but I'm a strong person so I made it through. About 3 months into my internship, she ended up asking me what was going to happen when we moved back home. Were we going to live together? Or would she move back home with her parents? In my head, I wasn't really ready to actually ""move in"" with her, even though we were living together during my internship. I told her I didn't know yet and she told me that she didn't want to move back in with her parents because she didn't really get along with them. She ended up guilt tripping me a little bit, and I didn't really want to be a jerk so I said we could move in together.

Moving forward about 8 months or so, we got a letter from our landlords saying they didn't want us to live in their suite anymore (long story). That same day, me and my ex sat down to talk about what we were going to do. I thought I should be honest, and told her the truth. I told her that I wanted to live on my own and that she should move back home because she had no job and couldn't afford rent. At that point in time, she had lost her job about a month ago and was looking for a new one. She also was planning on going to a local college to take a couple classes. She had no savings and couldn't afford rent (I had to pay rent for the both of us that month) so in my mind it didn't make sense to continue living together (no job, was going to school). I also told her that I felt like she guilt tripped me 8 months ago when we decided to live together.

When I told her this, she was shocked and moved out within days. I told her I still wanted to date her, but she said ""no, I feel like the relationship is going backwards, and it makes no sense to date if we aren't living together"". I pleaded with her several times but she didn't change her mind. About a week after we broke up, she slept with some guy she was hanging out with. After she slept with him, she came to me and said she wanted to get back together, to which I said ""no, you just slept with some guy ONE week after we broke up"".

She still says that I broke her heart by saying I wanted to live on my own. She says she will never forgive me and continues to guilt trip me. Am I really that terrible of a person for wanting to live on my own? I don't think I am, but she seems to convince me otherwise. I never meant any harm, and I still care about her, I just wasn't ready to live with another person yet. Yes, I made a mistake by saying we could live together when I wasn't ready, but it's not like I cheated on her or broke up with her.

**TL;DR** I moved in with my girlfriend because she guilt tripped me, we got kicked out of our place, I told her I wanted to go back to living on my own and now apparently I'm a terrible person."

msuea,0,2011-11-28,Tired of Being Alone (long but would really appreciate the read),[deleted],ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/msuea/tired_of_being_alone_long_but_would_really/,"I'm a 23 y/o guy. I've had 4 girlfriends, and consequently only slept with those 4 girls. As strange as it is, part of me is proud of that fact. All of my girlfriends were very special people to me, and to some extent, I have a hard time letting go of them all for different reasons. They have all left their mark, for better or worse. There are certain patterns that I have noticed over the past few years that seems to all play a part in my current situation.

One of the bigger issues is that all 4 of the girls that I have dated were dating someone else (usually a close friend of mine) before I took her from them. This is a terrible thing to do, and I've done it with all 4 of my relationships so far. This always leads to the inevitable mistrust because I know that if they left someone for me, they will eventually leave me for someone. Instead of just accepting that and keeping it light with them, I attach myself to them and smother them. It's a trend, and a very unhealthy one at that. I try to do everything for them, and try to be with them at all times because I'm afraid that it's only a matter of time before they meet someone else that is more appealing and leave just like they did to end up with me. For some reason though, I take it very personally when they do find someone else. It kills me to feel like I'm not good enough, and it ruins my self esteem for a long time after they leave. I feel like I'm always having to start my life over. I usually change careers, and go through stages of depression and huge issues with self identity.
I really don't actively try to take girls from other guys, especially not my friends. The problem is a combination of desperately wanting to be with someone, and not knowing how to meet new girls and really talk to them and get to know them without the pressure and nerves that come with it. I find there's less of a guard up when they are in a relationship, and I can be myself more. I don't try to make myself seem more attractive or appealing, but eventually it happens, and I know very early on because of how we are able to get along or not. For some reason, once that happens and i would gain a solid connection with the girl, I was able to justify it all to myself by telling myself that we are all still young and these things happen and we have a better connection anyway. As I said before though, this then leads to constant anxiety around my fear of being left and not being good enough to keep them even though I know it's an inevitability that they will find someone more attractive that doesnt smother them and has the self confidence to let them do their own thing and has a more functional foundation for a relationship.

This all being said, I have taken the past year since my last relationship where I did the same thing, and I have really worked on myself. I have come to these realizations and also decided to not go down that path ever again.
Now I'm left in a terrible hole though. I have zero self confidence, and I have no idea how to meet anybody new. The thought of just going out and having random one night stands is appealing because I've never been able to do it, and I feel like it would help me gain self confidence and ""swagger"". But truth be told, the thought from both sides makes my stomach turn. I can't help but find slutty girls unattractive. It disgusts me to think of myself as another random guy in the miles of dick that have been in her. And it goes the other way too, I have no desire to put my dick in everything I see.
All my girlfriends were very beautiful, and as I said, very special in some way. I guess you could say I have high standards, but both sides  would agree that while the looks play a factor, the connection between us is what made any of them worth it for either side.

That was all just back story to get to my current situation. After the rise and fall of my most recent relationship over a year ago, I did take a good hard look at myself. I realized that this is the wrong way to approach relationships and that I could never find a girl that I could trust with this approach, and ultimately, every one of them cheated on me before it was over. I also realized that I needed to make myself attractive, or at least make myself feel attractive to even have a fighting chance. 

I grew up around bands and live music. There are pictures of me on mixing consoles before I could walk, playing with effects on my own voice. In highschool, I owned a sound company that would tour around the region with local bands. The summers were spent on tour with national acts. The summer gigs were never paying gigs, just a chance to get on a tour bus and see the country and get some experience. I went to college to do this for a living, and have a degree in Audio Engineering and Concert Production. I graduated at the top of my class and had a job at the regions largest touring company right out of school. I worked there until the economy collapsed and they had to let me go because I was the low man on the totum pole. Since then, I have started and owned 5 companies, 3 of which were profitable at one point or another. My most recent was a film/photography company based in New England. It was very successful, and I ended up submitting a patent for a piece of camera equipment I invented/improved. When the economy fell apart though, I worked in local theaters and eventually closed the film company due to some greedy business partners. These are all moments and accomplishments that I have learned a lot from and hold a lot of pride in, but that pride never translates to self-confidence. 

A little over a year ago, I changed careers again, and now work in IT. I started at the very ground level, in a job training program for convicts. I then gained an internship from there, and began working at the company that I am still currently at, while tutoring at the job training program. I'm now a contractor at a great company, and just looking for my fulltime break in this new industry. This is my new identity and where I find myself in the present day. 
When I started this new job, I had been unemployed for almost 2 years, with the exception of the work my companies could generate. I had a girlfriend, but because of my trust issues, and the way it all started, it didnt work out. 
I have since tried to turn myself around and embrace this new career and life. I have worked myself into pretty good shape. When I started my IT job, I was 150 lbs. I am now 180 with 10% body fat. I work out at least 5 times a week, and I volunteer and coach 2 youth hockey teams in my town. I have taken on a lot of charity and volunteer work, as well as changed my work schedule to accommodate my sick grandmother. Once again, I have a lot of pride in myself as a person and the work I do, just no self confidence. I can't help but realize that no girl finds me attractive no matter how hard I work at it. I even find myself fairly attractive, but I've noticed that girls don't find me attractive. My friends are approached whenever we go out, and get hit on constantly, or get the girlfriend, but I'm just left alone. 

It's starting to make me very bitter. I can't stand the sight of couples, or the cheesy terrible pickup lines that seem to work for everybody but me. 
I have realized, the only difference between 'romantic' and 'creepy' is looks. If a good looking guy brings a girl flowers to wish her luck for something, it's romantic. When I do it, it's just the creepy friend.
It sucks though, because a part of me really likes doing nice things for people I care about, but I get friendzoned by anybody I have a crush on because I don't have the self-confidence to make a move, and then it just comes across as creepy and desperate instead of a genuine gesture from somebody that cares about someone else. 
Now I have one girl that I have had a crush on for a long time. We've been close for over 6 years now, but have always done our own things. The only times she's ever expressed interest in me, I was away at college, and already had a girlfriend. Since then, she has been in and out of failed relationships and so have I. She is an amazing person though, and really does deserve somebody who can appreciate it. She also has taken a lot of time to figure herself out. She opened her own dance studio recently, which I find amazingly hot being an aspiring entrepreneur. It seems like it could be the perfect situation for both of us, if I could figure out how to get close without seeming creepy. My problem is, the only way I know how to get to know somebody and get comfortable with them is when they have a boyfriend and the pressure is already off. She is at the point where she can't handle anything serious because of her new business, and I would love to start slow like that to see if I can get myself comfortable without the insecurities and trust issues that seem to come with my relationships. But I have been friend-zoned so hard for so long that it's almost impossible at this point. It's frustrating, mostly because I really haven't felt this way in a long time. I brought her flowers to her first recital for her new studio. Not because I expected anything from it, but because I wanted to show my support to someone I care about on a day for them. It was a huge step for her and her new company, and I wanted to be there for her. I couldn't stay because I had to go coach one of my teams, so I just stopped by, gave her the flowers, and wished her luck. I haven't heard a word since. So this leads me to believe that it came off waaaay creepier than I had intended, or that she indeed does have a boyfriend, and I am just getting caught in the same cycle again. Either way, I did a lot of this transformation over the past year with her in mind. I kept the smallest hope that if I got in shape, really worked on myself, and did enough things that I was proud of, that it would translate into some form of attractiveness, but I guess I was wrong.

mstyy,7,2011-11-28,I really need to get this off my chest. [Long],chuck_e_,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/mstyy/i_really_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest_long/,"So, where do I begin.  

I'm the life of the party no matter where I go.  I'm always the nice guy who talks with everyone.  I'm the type of guy that no matter what question you ask, as long as it doesn't involve me, I will give an honest answer.  My mother(60) is sick and constantly in bed.  My sister is young and always off with her friends.  My father(in his 70's) is a work-a-holic who has basically worked for the same company since he was 14 and was never there for me when I needed him most. We moved a total of 19 times because of his job while I was growing up.  This year when I turned 22, I had my first birthday outing with friends. I study mathematics at my university, and have worked with two different professors on two separate projects.  One of which we made a huge scientific discovery that should help scientist in understanding HIV.  I always go to class rain or shine.  I never take notes, but I listen to what the teachers say and remember it.  I can replay in my head every lecture that I have attended that dealt with math or science.  My classmates always ask me for help with their studies, and I always put a smile on and say I'd be more than glad to help them.  I intern at a company that most people would kill to be at.  This company has asked me to come on full time after I graduate and move over 2,500 miles away to be at their head office.  I was a resident assistant at my university for two years.  My residents and their friends loved me because I wasn't a jerk off like most of my co-workers. I let them get away with things because it's college and people should have fun. My bosses never liked me because I was the one that spoke out for the residents.  In January of this year a resident of mine died while I was not on duty, but I was there to help out as much as I could.  The school kept it under wraps because it happend during a big snow storm, and they didn't want the media to get involved.  They didn't tell anyone who lived in the same community, and they didn't provide any support for the residents who knew what had happened.  They wanted everyone to keep quiet and threatened my job when I tried to speak out.  I've had a few girlfriends over the time of my life.  One I thought I was going to marry.  We dated for a year and a half.  I finally worked up the courage to tell her that I loved her earlier this year.  Less than two days later she dumped me.  She told me that she had been cheating with another female who we were close friends with.  I've been seeing this new girl.  She studies microbiology, but refuses to believe in any sort of evolution and this bothers me.  What bothers me even more is that every since I hit puberty I have had a liking for other males.  I live in the south east where the bible is still the rule of law, so no one knows this about me.  No one.  No one could probably even tell.  I'm to afraid to come out because I will lose friends.  My father once told me that we should move the Australians off of their island and put all the gays there and when they get comfortable nuke them.  My family would disown me, my friends would leave me, and I would be all alone.  I know I need to tell this girl that things aren't working out between us, but I cannot bare to see anyone upset.  I know my best friend would be there for me know matter what, because he is a friend for life. More than a friend he is a brother from another mother.  I cannot convey these emotions no matter how hard I try, no one even knows the story of my life.  Only the professors I worked with know what I have done(Not even my family, and not a word to my friends).  None of the residents understand how hard I worked for them to have a good time in college.  My close friends don't know that I am a closet homosexual.  No one knows the torment that I had growing up being constantly ridiculed by my father who told me I would go no where in life.  My family and friends do not even know that when I graduate I will pick all of my things up and move to the other side of the country for work.  No one knows, no one knows anything about me.  I wear a mask everyday to protect myself from people.  No one knows that on most nights I cry myself to sleep because I am living a lie.   I cannot go see someone to talk about these things, because no matter what happens I'll lie to them and tell them that I am okay.  They will believe me too, because for whatever reason people always do.  My mother tells me I have a way with words and when I speak to people time stops for them.  She says it's like magic coming out of my mouth, and that people get lost in my blue eyes and can't help but to believe every word that I say.  She has told me this since I was very young and still believes to this day that it is true.  But even this person who pushed me out of their womb, will believe every word that I say.  Even when their gut tells them otherwise.  So, instead of telling someone in the real world what has happened to me and who I am,  I tell the internet.  I tell you because none of you know who I am, and even after you read this you will forget about me.  That's what I want though.  I don't want anyone to know who I truly am because I am a liar.  I am no one, but I like it that away.  I want people to continue to see my smile, and feel my warmth when they talk to me.  Because this is the only thing in life that brings me happiness.  I apologize if this is hard to read because of the grammer but it's hard to write when you are crying.  My crying is not from sadness or being upset, it's a happy cry for finally telling my story.  I'm glad to get that off my chest.  (&gt;^ _ ^ )&lt;  Happy redditing.  "

I wanted to create this AMA to give tips, secrets, and what not on how to survive college and to never give up.

In a bit of a bind and I want some opinions.  So back in high school there was a girl I always had really strong feelings for but never made any attempt to act on because I saw her literally everyday and didn't want to risk friendship.  Fast forward a few years, we're both sophomores that go to separate colleges about 2 hrs away from each other.  We hadn't talked as much during the first year of college, simply because we were busy living our lives.  About a month and a half ago I get a random text from her and we talk for a little bit about how life is going.  I find out that she and the guy she had been going out with broke up a few months earlier and whatnot.  We continue to talk for a little bit and that's that.  A few weeks later I get another text from her saying that she hopes I go to our mutual friend's house who was having a thanksgiving dinner and so we catch up some more and BAM, I realize that I still have feelings for her.  I make the decision that I'm going to try and pursue her, for better or worse, this upcoming winter break when we're both back home for the holiday.  I've been texting her every couple of days and talking and jokingly suggest that she move in with my housemate and I next Summer because she's going to be doing her internship in the city I live in.  To my surprise she is considering it and if she gets the internship she will probably live with us.  So Reddit, I'm full of all kinds of thoughts and emotions trying to figure out what I should do next.  To pursue her this winter as I had planned?  Wait until next summer if we live together?  Confess my feelings for her up front or just leave them quashed as I did in high school so our friendship can survive?  Sorry about the novel but as you can tell I'm a little lost... "
mv32y,1,2011-11-30,Here is what's going to happen...,elitegamerbros,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/mv32y/here_is_whats_going_to_happen/,"I strongly believe that Louis knows something about Dexter being a serial killer killer, and he is out to find out more (possibly for his video game?) Here is the evidence: 

- He suggested a new search engine for Dexter to use (Elliot) which he probably made himself or he is able to hack into it some how and view Dexter's search history (he is a computer hacker so there is nothing stopping him) and find out that he is looking for the DDK behind every ones back. 

- He is always wondering and asking Dexter about how he is able to know exactly what happened in a crime scene and he is trying to learn as much as possible from him.

- He ~~purchased~~ got his hands on the fake hand probably because he wanted to collect it based on the fact that his apartment is loaded with collector's items, and if his game goes big, that item is going to be worth A LOT of money. He might have gotten access to the hand by paying off the previous intern (HOT CHICK) to get access to it because he knew she had a lot more power to persuade Masuka. The whole "" I couldn't stop the auction, but I deleted the records of it"" was just a cover for the fact that he actually got the hand from the girl after their deal.  

- He is possibly getting close to Jamie to be able to get into Dexter's apartment but at the same time he is not a ""macho hero"" that is going to be a physical threat to Dexter because he almost backed down from dating Jamie when Batista confronted him. 

- I forgot the rest...I'll update once I remember.

I have been hacking away at HTML/CSS/ASP/PHP lately for kicks, I just got a paid internship doing development too so I am picking up new skills/experience fast.

What would you charge?  I feel like $500 and a three week development period isn't unreasonable considering I have a day job etc.  I think they want a decent looking website that they can update listing new shows/events and sell tickets to said shows.  I was thinking I might be able to reduce the cost by going the ""Wordpress"" route (yeah, I know...).

Thoughts?  How much should I ask for and/or how should I approach this?"
mv294,46,2011-11-30,"Spent 20 years in school, $150,000, finally graduated med school, now I'm 5 months into internship, and I hate hate hate medicine. Now what?",disgruntledgraduate,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/mv294/spent_20_years_in_school_150000_finally_graduated/,"I got into medicine because I wanted a career where I could feel like I was helping people while using science.

I decided this in high school, then I did biology as an undergrad, then went straight to med school. I did pretty well in the ""preclinical"" years (lots of ""honors"" grades, 250s on step 1, etc) but during the clinical years, I struggled a bit. Turns out, my ability to understand intricate things isn't quite as important as having an ability to decipher what patients are saying, figure out their (usually mundane) problem, and then decide on a course of action.

Being truly shy, and also very introverted don't help either, when making hospital rounds, seeing patients in clinic, and talking with nurses, therapists and consultants is basically my whole job.

Anyway, I'd always thought that I wanted to be a surgeon, but gave that up in my 4th year because of the hours, the additional stress, and to be honest, some degree of not enough self-confidence. I ended up getting into a family medicine residency, which I started last July.

I guess it's OK. I do really believe that primary care is a valuable thing, I mean, I believe in the specialty. I CAN perform my duties. I'm convinced that my problem has a lot less to do with my specialty in medicine than being involved in medicine as a whole.

But now that I'm actually ""doing"" some real medicine, I hate it. I don't like being in the hospital, I especially don't like being ""on call"" just waiting around to have to go admit another alcoholic in DKA, and I don't like clinic (too quick, too much paperwork, too many drug seekers).

I keep telling myself that, once I just get used to it, get through the first few months, get past intern year, that it will be better, and I'll start liking my job, getting better at it, and I'll love medicine.

But I'm not so sure. I have a hard time thinking that I'll instantly change my personality to be compatible with doing medicine well. Its hard to believe that the nature of the work changes substantially after intern year. I worry that I've wasted so much time and energy and years of my life learning something, only to realize that I despise it, and given the chance would run far, far away from.

I don't know what to do. Part of me knows that I can stick it out, get used to this, just put my head down and do it for the next 30 years. There's another part of me that tells me I need to listen to my gut and find a different career. Obviously I'm torn. Like a lot of people, I want a career that matches up with my interests, and let's me feel like I'm doing something important for the world. I've thought a lot about the possibility of getting into more of a bench research type of career (though more schooling would probably be needed for that). 

I don't know what to do. Do any of you have any thoughts or suggestions?"
mulj7,5,2011-11-30,Disk Quotas and Group Policy in Windows 7,[deleted],windows,https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/mulj7/disk_quotas_and_group_policy_in_windows_7/,"I am taking a ""Windows 7 support"" class, and we got our take home final today.  One of the questions is throwing my classmates and me off, so I am hoping reddit can give me some good information.


The first part of the question had us create 3 user groups on a Windows 7 machine Sales Department, IT Support, and Interns, as well as use App Locker to restrict certain applications from different accounts.


The other part is throwing my group for a loop.  The second part asks us to enable disk quotas for the Interns group:

&gt;Configure disk quota of 50MB for the intern group.  Make sure the quota is enforced.

For our midterm we had a similar question, but we had to enable disk quota for a user.  After looking through all the Disk Quota options, as well as most of gpedit.msc, and our textbook,  we cannot find a way to do this.  Our teacher also teaches the complimentary Windows 2008 Server class, and we are wondering if this is do-able with group policy on an AD, but not in windows 7.


So basicly, is it do-able, or did he give us an impossible problem?"
mug4w,4,2011-11-30,A Little Help?,PrettySureYoureWrong,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/mug4w/a_little_help/,"Hey everyone. After browsing r/LawSchool for the first time, I've gotten a bit worried that pursuing a law career has way more disadvantages than advantages. I was wondering if anyone could straighten some things out?

I'm currently a in my senior year of undergraduate studies, but since my school offers a 5-Year BS/MS program, I have another year and will graduate with both degrees. I'm a computer science major and have had multiple internships in my field with a prestigious company. I have no law experience. Should I try to pursue another technical internship or get law experience?

My plan is to pursue IP law. My thoughts were that by working in the law department of a technology company, I would have a good understanding of the technical aspect, and therefore be better off. Does this make sense? Are there any better ways to combine computer science and law?

Also, I've seen a lot ""Don't go unless you get into a T-14 school."" My GPA is hovering around a 3.7/3.8 (and - if it matters - honors program, should get magna cum laude, etc). What LSAT score would I need to make T-14 schools a possibility?

I'm going to start looking at law schools and studying for the LSATs. I figured I would take a summer course and take the test in October 2012 (graduating Dec. 2012). That seem okay?

Thanks in advance and sorry if these questions were answered else where.

(There's been a lot of outlines/exams posts, so good luck!!)



EDIT: Thank you everyone that responded! You've helped a lot so far. I appreciate your valuable time during such a busy period!"
muf1t,1,2011-11-30,"Relationship potential, or broken heart potential.",[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/muf1t/relationship_potential_or_broken_heart_potential/,"So I'm 22M and she is 22F, we are both in university in two different majors.

About 2 months ago, I had a one night stand with this girl, but then I ended up sleeping with her again. A week later I arranged a proper date, but had to cancel because I got hold of hockey tickets. She then proceeded to have sex with my best friend/roommate.

I told her and my friend to fuck off, didn't talk to her for 2 weeks, but then she told me she really wanted to talk to me in person. She explained that she was really drunk, that it's no excuse, but she didn't think I was interested in her when I cancelled the date. She says she wants to get to know me better, we really hit it off that night, talked for 3 hours then made-out when I dropped her off. She also explained to me how she had never been in a relationship, and is really not the kind of girl to sleep around.(I believe her now after we got to know each other better, but I was skeptic as hell when she first told me).

So since then, we see each other 2-3 times a week, I always end up sleeping at her place, and we always cuddle afterwards and get really intimate. More than I have ever been with anyone, including a past girlfriend. She tells me she is really comfortable with me, that she had never been this comfortable with anyone and so on. 

So last week, we were talking in bed and she told me she really wanted to see me over the Christmas break, and keep seeing me next semester (she will be away on an internship about an hour away from my apartment at school). To which I replied ''I really think we could have something meaningful in the future''. She said ''what'', I repeated, she said ''what'' again, I repeated. She just kinda looked at me, I told her I suck at these things and I don't want to scare her away, she replied that she also sucks at relationships, and that she isn't scared for once.. but she said ''I'll try not to choke this time, I'm a choker when it comes to relationships...''. This kinda threw me off... I've been dating and having regular sex with this girl, she wants to keep seeing me but something felt odd... 

I had a date with her last night again, had the most amazing time yet, I didn't mention anything about a relation, we just kinda joked around, slept together again, and she has been texting the living fuck out of me all day (I really enjoy it, shows that she is thinking about me...)

I am sleeping at her place again thursday... and she insists on making me supper. 

Anyways, here is my problem. I don't want to be just her fuckbuddy. I've been down that road before and got hurt. I'm sick of girls just thinking I'm a dick on 2 legs. I'm putting a lot of effort into this girl, and definitely want a relationship. I'm afraid she will go see elsewhere given the opportunity if we don't establish something... She gets attention from a lot of guys. The fact that she has already kinda cheated on me throws me off as well. 

TL;DR: I've been dating/having sex with this girl on a regular basis, but she has no relationship experience and seemed hesitant when I brought up the topic. How do I not end up in the ''sexzone''."
mubfy,1,2011-11-29,A long time ago,novembercomes,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/mubfy/a_long_time_ago/,"So this is a bit of a rant, but I'm very tired, and I feel backed into a corner. I am a Georgia Tech student who has been studying finance for the last 3 years. I still have about 2 years left to go, but that's not of any real importance. This has been my life for the past couple of years.

In 2009 I was studying here to be a mechanical engineer because of my background as a machinist and the family history of being engineers. Later I realized that I actually really hate engineering but enjoy business. So I swapped, but only after I had allowed my GPA to drop to around a 2.0.

In late 2009/ early 2010 my family life fell apart more so than it had ever before. I am a single child that comes from an alcoholic, and very judgmental family. In late 2009 I went to the hospital after complaining of a pain in my chest only to later find out that my parents had not claimed me as a dependent to our health insurance provider, and had subsequently been removed from it. They picked up the rather hefty ER bill, but still to this day blame me for the cost. About 6 months later, I developed shingles, and ended up having complications with the medication that ended up with my almost snapping my ankle after a blackout. When I asked my parents if I could go to the hospital, the response I got back was an accusation for having a drug problem. My mother then proceeded to remove the money from our shared account that was supposed to cover the rest of my college. We stopped talking after that.

At that time I had a job working as a research student/ machinist for $10 an hour. It wasn't enough to pay for rent, but I could afford to eat on that. I also had enough money saved that I could either pay for my summer semester, or pay for a place to stay. So rather than renting a place, I decided to jump couches and go to school for a semester hoping to figure something out with financial aid. During that time I maintained a 3.0 average, held a job, had an unpaid internship, and lost 30lb biking on a bike given to me for the internship.

When the semester ended I discovered just how difficult it is to not be filed as a dependent of your parents if you are under 23. The financial aid that the school offered me was not enough to pay for tuition, so I decided to leave school and try to save up enough money to go back and finish. I got a job working as a machinist down in Newnan GA, and secured a room in a house just north of Atlanta for the meantime. The job offer was about $5 less than industry standard, but they told me after the first evaluation that I would get a raise. I also figured that finding a place to stay in ATL for $300 a month that wasn't a pile of poop was something that I should probably hold onto for when I went back to college. By my calculations, I would be able to afford to return to college after a year of work, and be able to keep my loans at bay after I had to start paying them back. So I worked the job with extra hours for about 3 months. As we neared Christmas, I noticed that our work order due dates had gone from being 2 weeks behind to about a month and a half ahead of schedule. Sure enough they laid me off about a week later because they ran out of work for non-company men.

After that I received a couple of more offers for jobs in the Newnan area for the same pay grade, which was barely enough for me to make ends meet. So I decided that I would try to patch things up with my folks. They reluctantly agreed to let me move back in with them, and helped cover the rest of the cost of tuition. We have since been patching things up, even though they are still abusive alcoholics from time to time. So I started to commute to school from the Lawrenceville/Buford area to Tech every day. 

When I moved back in with my parents I immediately started having financial issues again making it to and from school (gas, insurance, maintenance, etc.) so I started to look for a part-time job. It has been a year, and I just found a job 3 weeks ago. Before that I had to give up almost everything I had to pay for gas and insurance over the last year which included my phone, a laptop, and the bicycle I got from my boss for the internship I took on while I was homeless. Now that I have a job, I finally started feeling like I would be able to absolve myself of my debt to my credit card providers as well as be able to move back into town to get away from my parents. 

I had to let my insurance lapse about 2 weeks ago. Last week I blew a tire somehow after coming home one night, and ended up spending about a $100 bucks fixing it. 4 days ago I scraped an RV's extendable compartment after the GT vs UGA game that was in my lane as I was leaving campus to go to work. The police officer gave me a charge for wreckless driving and driving without insurance. They towed my car. I got my friends to lend me enough money to get my insurance renewed and to get my car out of impound (~$300), but I feel terrible about it. I thought I was going to be able get out of debt and pay off my credit cards without defaulting on them, and here I am now $300 in debt to my friends with my creditors threatening to sell my debt. I am terrified of the man with the RV coming after me for damages.

I don't know how I am going to get through a lot of this. My grades aren't great, and I have trouble focusing on school because of my finances, but I don't want to leave school for fear of the loans I've taken out defaulting on me causing me to stay out of school indefinitely. I wouldnt say I am suicidal, but I bought a gun when I was working as a machinist because of where my house was, and sometimes I seriously ask myself if I purchased the gun to protect myself from intruders, or to give myself an easy way out in case things got too hard. I am a big proponent of being able to die with dignity, and some days I worry about myself.

While all of this happened, most of my friends stopped talking to me, I was barred from my fraternity for being poor, and I was fighting my depression. One of my most recent confidants and female friends told me a couple of days that she gets angry at me when I am sad, and has been very distant over the past 2 weeks. I don't talk to very many people anymore so this has been kind of devastating on my psyche. 

I have spent the last 4 days sleeping between my old fraternity's couches, and my friends couch eating nothing but rice and sleeping in the same clothes. I had to bike 12 miles in the rain to get my car out of the impound, and for the last 2 days I have been so exhausted mentally and physically that I don't really care too much anymore. I haven't been home to sleep in my own bed because I want to eliminated the travel costs too and from Lawrenceville so I can pay the friends who lent me money back ASAP.
 
TLDR: Life got hard, told myself it would get better, tried to make it better, and it got worse.


EDIT:   There's a lot more that contributes to all of this, but I tried to keep it as condensed as possible. (if that's possible)"
mu8o6,1,2011-11-29,Are there any acceptable excuses for sleeping with someone else... and should I be going to talk it out with her tonight?,yeskia,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/mu8o6/are_there_any_acceptable_excuses_for_sleeping/,"Been on and off with this girl for 4 years (mostly on). Had a big fall out about a year ago where I ended up flirting with her best friend and she slept with someone else. We got back together shortly after.

For the past year or so I've been working really hard (I'm 21, she's 20), doing internships and working late at multiple jobs and uni to really kick me off into an awesome career (I work web development). I've been a bit neglectful of her through the year but tried to be good and thought she understood. She made a few comments about our lack of sex life (as I was always totally exhausted) and joked that she would have to find it elsewhere if I wasn't satisfying her.

Last Sunday we had a slight argument where I got angry at her for losing another job. She said she didn't want to see me again and I chased her home, apologised and spent the night. (At this point, she thought we were broken up, I thought we were good).

Last night she wasn't responding to my messages, I had a strange inkling something was up. I went to her house, her lights were on (she was supposedly babysitting) and I could hear voices. I called her phones to make sure she wasn't on the phone, and heard her comment, 'oh, yeskia's calling). I pressed the doorbell and all went silent. I went back around the back to see her standing naked in the kitchen and wouldn't let me in, saying that I was an arsehole and had to leave.

I managed to get inside through a window (I wanted to find the guy) and went through 3 rooms before she stopped me. Beside the windowsill there was a glass of wine and a condom wrapper. She said this guy had come over, drank wine and taken pills, they skinny dipped and then he put a condom on, but she decided not to go through with it. She said he had already left (I have doubts on this looking back, he was probably still in the house).

She tried to justify it, bringing up how I flirted with her friend a year ago, how I haven't been satisfying her and how she felt like I was cheating on her. She swore it was the first time and that nothing had happened beyond that. She said it was the first time in a long time that she felt pretty again, like someone was noticing/appreciating her beauty.

I took my stuff and left. She's been calling and has asked me to come over tonight and sort things out, but she understands if I never want to see her again.

I've already deleted her on Facebook, made plans to go running every second day and lined up things for the rest of the week to keep myself occupied. Should I be content with her excuses for what she did, am I to blame? And do I go over there tonight?

tl;dr: Have fight with girl I've been seeing for 4 years and she says we're not together in a huff, I try and fix it, sleep over a couple of nights and thought we were good. Find her getting drunk, taking pills, skinny dipping and possibly sleeping with some 30 year old French guy. Wants me to come around tonight (after I've gone out with friends) to talk things through."
