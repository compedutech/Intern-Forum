dpwera,3,2019-10-31,I don't think I am Intermittent Fasting correctly. How do I get it right?,alchemicalchemist,intermittentfasting,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/dpwera/i_dont_think_i_am_intermittent_fasting_correctly/,"Hi Guys, 

I am writing this post to in order to gain some insight as to how I can actually make some real progress and to check if what I am doing currently is right or wrong. 

I’d just like to provide a little bit of context in order to explain my situation. I started IF in May of this year and have also been going to the gym 3 times a week. I follow IF 5 days a week, from Monday to Friday. I’m a 21 year old male and before I started IF, I weighed in a little over 200 lbs. Currently I am 190 lbs (Which I feel is not a lot of progress). I am currently away from University for a year long internship, so I wanted to make the most of this time by trying to lose as much as weight I can, in a healthy and safe way. 

My shift is from 8AM to 4 PM and since workplace is pretty far away, it takes me about 2 hrs to get there and come back as I use public transportation. So, I leave at 6 AM and get home around 6 PM. 

I mention this because I have my first meal for the day at 12 PM at work. I then eat some snacks around 3 PM. I get home by 6 PM and finish my dinner before 8 PM and head to the gym. 

This however did not work too well for me because I hated working out right after I eat. I kept burping all the time and felt very heavy and lethargic in general. However, I did notice changes. While at the gym, I am mostly doing strength training and I did see some definition form and just felt generally more stronger, lighter, and active. However, I felt all this the next day. Not while I was working out with a full stomach. 

However, due to the fact that I had to eat my dinner quickly and head to gym quickly and hit the bed early for the next day since I have to travel so far, the eating period between 12 PM – 8PM didn’t work too well for me. 

So, I changed my routine to eat between 4 PM to 10 PM. Honestly, this is a lot more painful than I had imagined. By the time 4 PM hits, I am completely exhausted since I’m so hungry. After I’m done eating, I feel relatively better but still feel exhausted. I come home, have some tea and go to the gym. I come back and eat my dinner, along with a protein shake. 

The 4 PM-10 PM feeding period worked well for a while until I just couldn’t keep it up. This started to affect everything else as well. I wake up tired, slog through the day, come home and end up crashing on the couch instead of going to the gym. It takes so much willpower to push myself to go to the gym now. Something that I only felt for the first few weeks when I started going to the gym consistently in May. 

Maybe, I’m just not eating enough or maybe I’m not eating the right things. I’m not too sure. However, to give an example, here is what I would eat/drink during a regular workday: 

8:00 AM: Plain, Black Coffee (w/o milk &amp; sugar) 

4:00 PM: Veggies/Lentils/Legumes (essentially something that has a good combination of carbs, fiber, and protein) along with Millets, which are a type of grass seeds that I eat instead of rice. 

9:00 PM-10:00 PM: Veggies/Lentils/Legumes along with Millets. Protein Shake (Whey Protein Powder + Creatine + Water)

And I keep drinking water consistently, i.e. whenever I feel thirsty. 

Given this information, I ask you, the good people of this subreddit, is there anything that I can do to speed up this process of losing weight? Because, I don’t think losing only 10 pounds over a 6 month period is really any progress. 

Thank you for taking the time to read through all of this and if anyone can provide any input that would be much appreciated!"

I started out as an intern and was later hired on the team. I did not start in IT, but as a blogger intern. Now, as a full time employee I am responsible for managing our company's social media page, creating blog posts, managing company wide communication, creating marketing materials, and providing IT support (as well as being involved with all of the currently assigned IT projects.

My boss recently put in his two week notice. The only other person in IT is my friend from college who will graduate the end of next semester. As he is only an intern, he is not in the office everyday. I do not believe they will fill the position in two weeks, and am a little overwhelmed that I will be the only person in IT to provide support for about half of every week.

WIBTA if I asked for a raise as I am going to have to handle many issues that I normally wouldn't cover because I will be the only person in my department on certain days? I know the company is already somewhat stressed about losing my boss, and I don't want to put more pressure on them but this seems to be the perfect time to bring up negotiations because I am currently not happy with my compensation..

EDIT: I should say, that my boss is not who I would be discussing this with, I would most likely need to talk to his supervisor. Especially since I heard they might phase out his management position, leaving my department under his supervisor's control.."

I am 23 years old and really love staying in and just like hanging out with my family, I am currently a full time grad student and go to an internship 24 hours a week. I also work part time on the weekends so I usually have a pretty busy week and the times where I have nothing going on I really love to just stay home and not really do anything. I used to get kind of sad because I would see other people my age posting on social media all of this stuff that they're doing and I thought maybe I was missing out on something. I always feared that when I was older I would have no interesting stories to share of my youth. I feel like a lot of people my age like going out to places like bars and I honestly hate bars so much. The just make me so anxious and uncomfortable. They're just so loud and dark and I really don't need a bunch of strangers to be that close to me you know? I'm a fan of a more lowkey night. I like staying home and watching Netflix or YouTube, hanging out with my dog, or even watching something with my mom. When I do go out with friends I like to do something more on the lowkey side, too. The issue with that, though, is that sort of stuff doesn't really make for interesting Instagram posts or exciting stories. So on social media terms I am a boring person. I don't have a lot of crazy stories to tell people of my wild nights out. I'm a pretty uninteresting person, but that is also very subjective. Who gets to define what's interesting? I don't want to just live my life to impress the people who follow me on social media because let's be honest, I highly doubt they even really care what I'm doing. I do have the memories that I've made by spending time with the people who mean the most to me and that's just as good right? Not everything can be worthy of a post on Instagram and not everyone can be these extroverted individuals who love to go out and be surrounded by tons of people, some of us have to be just average and kind of boring and there's nothing wrong with that. 

So yes, I'm a boring person and it's something that I've learned to become okay with."

dq037c,11,2019-11-01,Mort (Discworld #4) by Terry Pratchett: If Death Has An Intern - A Review,valgranaire,Fantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/dq037c/mort_discworld_4_by_terry_pratchett_if_death_has/,"&gt;*History unravels gently, like an old sweater. It has been patched and darned many times, reknitted to suit different people, shoved in a box under the sink of censorship to be cut up for the dusters of propaganda, yet it always – eventually – manages to spring back into its old familiar shape. History has a habit of changing the people who think they are changing it. History always has a few tricks up its frayed sleeve. It’s been around a long time.*

Death has always been my favourite Discworld character, possibly within my top 3 or 5 fantasy characters of all time. Naturally, I had high expectations about this book, hoping to see Death bumbling around with his disconnection and morbid fascination towards humanity. Sadly, it did not deliver.

*Mort* is about the titular teenager character, who's recruited by Death on Hogswatch Night to be his apprentice. Death plans Mort to be his successor in the long term so he can retire and relax. However, typical to classic internship and newbie horror stories, Mort may have messed up the very fabric of reality thanks to his personal love life.

&gt;*He’d been wrong, there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and it was a flamethrower.*

**Internship, Retirement, and Death**

I think this book has a lot of potentials. The exploration of a bumbling intern is a fun concept not explored by many in fantasy. The interaction between Mort and the 'customers' are also interesting, as everyone has different story and different predicament of death. It also explores the themes of redefining reality (in relation to abusing company's facilities and perks) and rethinking the concept of Death, but unfortunately these are only touched very briefly.

I think the book will be much stronger if it's focused on Death himself instead, since I find his side adventures to understand human much more fun and profound. From picking up new hobbies, retirement, to trying new lines of job, it's interesting how Death is depicted to be really good with cats, cooking, and harvesting souls (one of these things is unlike the other) but not so much in everything else. This actually has more potential and promising scenarios to explore, which I assume would be the case of future Death books.

On other hand, this book feels disjointed for me as the behaviour of some characters can change in jarring manner. For instance, the depiction of Mort and his adventures is simply uneven. In the beginning of the book, he's depicted as a clumsy but curious bookworm. As the book progresses, his curiosity is just gone and he becomes more and more like Death. This makes sense in universe since whoever takes Death's proverbial mantle will eventually take on his aspects too, but in Mort's case the transformation is jarring. (view spoiler)

In terms of plot and pacing, the book also feels non-sequitur as sequences happen without enough causality, especially the jump between the climax and the ending (view spoiler). At this point, I'm fully convinced that Pratchett was the strongest when he explored slice-of-life/small scale fantasy rather than high stakes and high action.

**Conclusion**

*Mort* is an amusing take on Death's character arc, exploring the duality of internship and retirement along with reality rewriting and the concept of death itself, but it could've been a stronger book had it focused more on Death himself and with several more rounds of editing to make narrative seamless.

&gt;*Then Mort said, ‘What do all those symbols mean?’*  
*‘Sodomy non sapiens,’ said Albert under his breath.*  
*‘What does that mean?’*  
*‘Means I’m buggered if I know.’*

**3.5/5**

dq0a6n,6809,2019-11-01,At my previous job I slept in my car outside the building where I worked for six months to avoid my long commute. It absolutely changed my life for the better.,pitograndeXXX,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/dq0a6n/at_my_previous_job_i_slept_in_my_car_outside_the/,"WARNING: Long story 

After I graduated college in June 2018, I moved back home with my parents. I had no job prospects upon graduation nor did I have any relevant experience or decent connections. All I had was an Econ degree and a 2.8 GPA, considering I wanted to go into finance, I was pretty fucked. 

Eventually two months later, after hundreds of rejected applications and five failed interviews, I got an offer. It was for an accounts payable role paying $17/hour at a big company. The office was in a city 45 miles from my home in a city with a very high cost of living. 

Despite the commute and low salary I took the job. I didn't really have much choice. I had student loans to pay off and I was naive and desperate. And I figured since it was a big firm if I worked hard and got to know the right people, I could land myself a better position later on. 

The commute was terrible. I started work at 9 am and was done at 6 pm. If I left my house at 6-7 am, it still took me two hours to get to the office. Going home was just as bad. If I got home earlier than 8 pm, I considered that a good day. I spent about 4 hours+ each day in my car. I was also driving a small SUV so gas was rough. 

After six months I was ready to crack. I would come to work already drained and coming home I just didn't have the energy or time for any hobbies. All I would do is watch tv or play video games. The job was dead end; what I was mostly doing was data entry, I hadn't learned anything of value to me professionally. Also a large portion of my salary was going to gas. And I was gaining weight from eating fast food after work. Moving to the city was not an option due to the area I worked in being very expensive. 

Then one day I was having lunch with my coworker and we were discussing his upcoming vacation plans. His plan was he was going to drive to the office the next week, work the whole day and then uber to the airport from the office. 

I was confused, what about his car? My coworker was surprised and he told me as we were employees we were allowed to leave our cars overnight in our office parking structure for as long as we wanted. All we had to do was sign a document saying if anything happened to our car the company wasn't responsible. It was a common thing since the office was close to the airport and it was more convenient to just uber. And right there, everything changed. 

At that point for the next six months this was my routine: 

Every Sunday I would pack my clothes and meal prep for the week and drive down to my office that night since traffic was much lighter. My office was accessible 24/7, so I would come in and store all food in the refrigerators. My office also had a 24/7 onsite gym with showers so I would go there, shower and brush my teeth.

I would then go to my car parked all the way at the top of the structure. I'd roll down the windows slightly for air and then put up my windshield cover. My car had very dark tints so I never had need to cover my windows. I then would go to sleep. Luckily with an SUV, I had plenty of leg room. 

Monday morning I would wake up at 7 am, go to the gym and get a workout in. I'd brush my teeth and shower and get into the office by 8:30. I was never ever late again. I'd work until 6 pm and then eat my dinner I stocked in the fridge. Once I was done with work, I would stay at the office (it was common for people to work late so no one ever batted an eye at me) and look up tutorials on certain skills I wanted to gain. I learned advance excel, financial modeling, certain softwares, etc. Then at around 9-10 pm, I would go back to the gym, shower and brush my teeth and go sleep in my car. I would repeat this the rest of the week until Friday when I drove home. 

I improved significantly. Meal prepping healthy food and working out allowed me to get back into shape. I was getting around 8-9 hours of sleep per night, so I was much better rested and more productive during the day. I was able to learn skills that were relevant to me and I had slightly better social life in the city I was in since I no longer worried about my commute. I was also driving less, so I was spending less on gas. I also managed to pay off my loans and help my parents out since I was able to save so much. 

Nobody knew about this. I would tell my parents I was staying with a friend who charged me cheap rent for staying the week. Since I worked for a big company in a minor role, no one really knew or cared who I was. Not once was my car ever ticketed or towed nor did anyone ever investigate my car at night. 

This went on until I resigned two months ago. I had interviewed and accepted a job offer out of state for role I specifically wanted and had been developing myself for. My new firm offered helped pay for relocation and my salary went from $18 to $35 an hour. The job is fantastic and with the money I saved I was able to buy a ""newer"" used car and get my own studio close to my job. My commute is now 15 minutes max.

***EDIT***: WOW! I did not expect this to blow up as it has and I sure as hell did not expect all the positivity. I was expecting more people to get mad at me for doing something that errs on the illegal side. But thank you everyone! Please be advised I do not encourage this though.

For anyone who was wondering I was living in Thousand Oaks and my job was in LA. Let's just leave it at that. 

For anybody here still in college, the reality is your bachelors alone is not enough. You're also going to need experience or you have to know someone. Internships, connections, clubs, even a high GPA (yes some places did check my grades and I got screwed because of that) does help. Hit up alumni or go to networking events and try to learn practical skills. It's a highly competitive world out there and the world doesn't owe you a thing.

And yes I considered myself very lucky to work for a company with all those perks. And that was one of the reasons why I really thought I could move up here and took the job despite the commute. But instead I was basically a clerk and pretty much everyone outranked and made more than me and treated me as such. What was worse was most of the people there were my age, so the environment was really cliquey and toxic. 

And for those who think this is fake due to my account. Well obviously this isn't my main account. Like most people on reddit I have several accounts for different interests. I couldn't post this on my main account because some people know me. I used this one due to it being the most anonymous and because it's my favorite account name."
dq0bfv,2,2019-11-01,"Landlord/Tenant Dispute - Retaliation, Verbal Agreements, etc. [Oregon]",Xen0plasm,TenantHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TenantHelp/comments/dq0bfv/landlordtenant_dispute_retaliation_verbal/," 

I  am a university student living in a college town in Oregon. I spent my  summer on an international internship, and a plan to move in with a  friend after returning failed. I had contacted another person before  leaving, but they never returned a call to set up a visit to the house. I  managed to contact this person from abroad, and signed the lease from  there via adobe. I wanted to look for other places too, but I was  studying tropical dragonflies in the jungles of Borneo; I was living in a  remote indigenous village and had to climb a tall hill just to get a 4G  signal.

So I returned at the  beginning of September, moved into this place, and everything seemed  okay at first. The living situation is three students renting bedrooms  in a house, but one of them is technically the landlord's agent as well.  I will refer to him as ""**J**"". J is in a serious relationship with the landlord's daughter, who I will call ""**K**"". I will call the actual landlord ""**R""**.  J began to show an erratic behavior pattern; unless an interaction with  him was mutually friendly, he was likely to take the most extreme  interpretation of what I said. I'm a very patient person, and he told me  he had some mental health issues, but I didn't know how bad this would  get.

At the end of the month, I  had an unexpected money problem come up. I explained the money problem  to him, and even though I had a way to fix it (i.e., pay rent), he told  me that he'd allow me to pay a part of the rent that day and then pay  the rest in a few days, when I got a paycheck. The money trouble made J  nervous; my lease started with a three-month term, since J had done all  of this with me sight-unseen from very far away.

The  weekend after I was unable to pay rent, he told me he was willing to  sign me on for another month; J said he would sign me on for a normal  lease after that, but only if I was able to resolve my money troubles.  I  was thankful for this reprieve, and waited for the check to process at  my bank that weekend. We had agreed that I'd give him the remainder of  what I owed as soon as the check processed, but J became antsy on  Monday, and kept asking me if the check had come through.

J  also ""doesn't believe in having a bank account"", which was my first  clue that I'd made a mistake. Knowing this already, I began to explain  to him how online banking works, but he kept escalating the  conversation, and even though I did my best to get him to calm down, he  ultimately shut down the conversation and slammed his bedroom door in my  face. Half an hour later, he sent me **a text that amounted to a refusal to renew my lease beyond November**. He told me that I was being dishonest with him and I wasn't working hard enough to get the money to him.

Moving  out in mid to late November would be extremely difficult to do here,  because my classes are going be picking up steam by then, and it is more  difficult to find places to live during this time in this city.

His  refusal is a violation of our earlier agreement, which unfortunately  was verbal. This guy seemed mostly alright until he snapped that night,  so I didn't worry about getting anything in writing. The only proof I  have of those exchanges is a receipt from our agreement about the rent,  and the newer lease (for the month of November).

I  tried to explain to him why none of this made any sense, but he refused  to listen to reason (and still refuses). I also talked to the other  roommate about it when I ran into him on campus; he suggested asking K  about it. K told me that she did not want to get involved, and after  asking me a few questions, she left. This was after she visited the  house one night in mid-October.

J  was upset about this; he accused me of harassing her. I told him that  the other roommate suggested it, and confronted him about his irrational  behavior. I told him that if he didn't relent and return to the  original agreement, I may have to explore legal action for the sake of  defending myself.

The next thing I  did to try to resolve the situation was talk to the actual landlord, R.  I met R and he seemed like a very reasonable person, claiming to  understand how J's behavior was difficult to tolerate at times. I  explained that it would be very challenging for me to move out during  that timeframe, but if I could stay there until July, it would be easy  for me to find a new place. He was receptive to this, and I hoped that  he'd override J's decision. J had also never contacted my previous  landlord, so I gave R the contact info.

Unfortunately,  J told exaggerated versions of my mention of legal action and my  conversation with the other roommate to R. Additionally, the landlord  contact info I gave to R was for my landlord from 2017-2018, not  2018-2019; this was done on purpose, because my 2018-2019 landlord tried  to break the law twice while I lived there, and I had to take legal  action against them to make it stop. I explained this to J when I was  talking to him on the phone from Borneo, and he agreed to accept the  contact info from that landlord instead. I also emailed the 2017-2018  landlord before giving the contact info, and explained everything to him  (the 2017-2018 landlord). He agreed to give me a reference.

And J explained *NONE OF THIS*  to R, at any point. The result is that R called the 2017-2018 landlord,  found out that it's not my most recent landlord, and because he didn't  have the background info, it looked like I was being dishonest. That  plus J's version of my interactions with him and the other roommate  caused R to decide to allow me to move out early, but not extend the  lease.

This is proving to be quite  a problem; I'm taking some really challenging courses right now, and  it's very difficult for me to find the time to patrol craigslist. I've  done it anyway, but I haven't found much; most of what is available is  either cheap and nasty or nicer and too expensive. I want to try talking  to R one more time about this, but it's likely that he won't listen;  he's in his early seventies, and it really seems as though he is more  interested in not rocking the boat.

Does anyone in [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/)  have any ideas? J sent me the text message that started all of this  immediately after I accused him of being unreasonable, and that seems  retaliatory to me, but the last time I checked on that definition, I  read that it was notoriously difficult to handle that in court.

But,  I'm trapped here, these people are barely following the rules for a  tenancy (there are details I've left out), and I need help. I would be  much better off if I could just stay here until things are calmer and  it's easier to find a new place."

*Youma:* Breaking News! The ABC has just called the Pearce by-election for the Social Democratic Party, now increasing their numbers to 3. With the resignation of both LegoYodaVevo and Plupsnup this week, this leaves the parliament in this state.

Government (6): Lib (3) Nat (2) CA (1) 

Opposition (3): UDP (3) 

Crossbench (4): SDP (3) Ind (1) 

Vacant (2)

We now have with us Leader of the National party, How are you Riley?

*Riley8583:* Thank You for allowing me to come on the program tonight, I am very annoyed with the Prime Minister, I stood up for him in Question time, only ever being the Present Government Member and he decides to shove a knife in my back.

*Youma:* What do you mean by ""shove a knife in my back""?

*intern is taken off set after an incident*

*Youma:* Apologies for that, please continue

*Riley:* Well his endorsement of a party that isn’t even in a Federal Coalition, I mean this guy thinks that he can go away for weeks or whatever than decides to come back when an election is present just to make an endorsement.

*Youma:* According to our records, the Centre Alliance is a part of the government. Regardless of the endorsement, why do you think tonight turned out as it has?

*Riley:* I’m referring to the Liberal National Coalition.

*Youma:* Talking about the Liberal National Coalition, how has this byelection affected it? Are you still committed to this government after the Prime Minister's endorsement of the Centre Alliance?

*Riley:* I will be putting a vote up at the Federal Executive Council of the National Party tomorrow which will decide on the party’s future within this government and the Liberal National Coalition

*Youma:* How do you expect this to turn out?

*Riley:* At this stage, i will be voting for the people and that decision will be announced tomorrow.

*Youma:* Moving on, the National candidate for Pearce has come out swinging against the Centre Alliance calling them "" a bunch of nutters that want thirteen year old ratbags assaulting people in the streets"". Do you stand by the comments of your candidate?

*Riley:* I don’t know if I’d phrase it like that

*Youma:* How would you phrase it?

*Riley:* I’d say that the Centre Alliance Party is nothing but failed centrists.

*Youma:* If they have failed at being centrists, what are they actually then?

*Riley:* They are left wing, clearly with their support of the Candidate who wants an economic transition from Capitalism to socialism

*Youma:* If I may ask, where did the Centre Alliance support the candidate that you accuse of supporting such a policy?

*Riley:* Their leader took to twitter to show their support of the Socialist candidate

*Youma:* Would you be able to highlight which particular tweet you are referring to?

*Riley:* She took to twitter to congratulate the Member and make ridiculous claims about the National Party

*Youma:* Are you suggesting the Leader of the Centre Alliance congratulating a candidate on their victory counts as an endorsement of their policies?

*Riley:* I’m not only referring to that, during her ABC interview, she claimed that our candidate was a fascist, what about the Socialist candidate, a self described Socialist is just as bad as a fascist, I don’t see why she couldn’t call the socialist out. She claims to be a centrist but she isn’t, and PM Porridge is a Malcom Turnbull on steroids.

*Youma:* I think thats a good place to finish this interview off at, Thank you very much for coming on the show 

*Riley:* Goodnight"

Campus placements are usually a major worry for students across [**top business schools in Kolkata**](https://calcuttabusinessschool.org/pgdm-overview) or other cities. Although colleges prepare you to crack interviews and build professional skills through various internships and workshops, placements and interviews can still instill a sense of nervousness. With an influx of multiple companies flooding the institute's campus for job interviews with lucrative packages, your career-defining time may be full of anxiety and bewilderment. You may find yourself in a dilemma of choosing the right fit for your career.

Numerous questions can pop in your head while preparing for on-campus placements. Some of them can be-

Did I choose the right company?

How much salary will be offered to me?

Does my resume look impressive or shall I make a new one?

What kind of questions will the interviewers ask?

While these are some of the valid thoughts that you might have, there are ways to add a healthy dose of confidence for cracking interviews. We bring you a quick guide on how to land your dream job-

**Research**\- While zeroing down companies to appear interviews for, make sure that you research about the profile, background of the company, products they offer, and recent news. You should also be aware of their target groups, along with their mission and vision, to create an impression that you have done your homework thoroughly.

**Practice**\- Rehearsing plays an essential role in cracking interviews. You may seek constructive feedback from students who have already appeared for the interviews and list down the frequently asked questions to prepare your answers accordingly. From working on the areas of improvement to recording the rehearsal to see how you appear to the interviewer, practice comes a long way in building success stories.

**Focus on your body language**\- Your body posture and gestures are as important as your resume and academic scores. Experts suggest that you should not slouch on the chair when you sit as it indicates low self-confidence. Also, crossed legs while speaking should be shunned to keep a proper body posture. Maintaining appropriate eye contact with the panel is also essential to portray that you are trustworthy and secure about your life.

While these are some of the major points to keep in mind while going for an interview, there are a few tips on making a good impression-

Be Punctual

Dress Appropriately

Prepare a concise summary of your internships/previous work experiences

Be calm and confident 

Lastly, ask questions to the interviewer

Generally known as the 'Make or Break' time, placements are a big, eventful part of every student's life. Pursuing a PGDM from [**top B schools in Kolkata**](https://calcuttabusinessschool.org/pgdm-overview) or elsewhere can help you develop the necessary skills to crack interviews. But interviews can be a tough and exhausting process. Remember to always smile, even if the interview goes terrible, because you are sure to learn new things with each experience."

However a bit ago I picked up an iPad for notes and an iPhone and have been really enjoying both of them. Seeing the continuity between the two devices really impressed me and has me considering switching all the way.
I currently have a gaming desktop and a laptop with a decent gpu, so I'd probably be selling those and downsizing to just a Macbook with an egpu at home for gaming. I've been looking at the i7/16gb/555x/512gb 2019 Macbook pro for this. I'd also probably get a Thunderbolt 3 SSD to run games off of. 


The use cases I want to cover are:

-Typical on the go student stuff, web browsing etc with some Matlab and light Solidworks use in bootcamp.

-eGpu gaming on both a 1440p ultrawide and the laptop display (I travel some for internships and don't want to carry a whole monitor with me)

Ideally I'd like this setup to be competent for AAA gaming for the next 3-4 years, I don't mind turning settings down but obviously wouldn't want to get a whole new laptop.

This summer I was making $22/hr as an intern and before that I was working retail at ~$16/hr, so I’m in this weird spot financially where I have a high salary but was low income for so long that for the last two months I’ve just been playing catchup. Moving out of my parents’ house, furnishing an apartment from scratch, building a business casual wardrobe, random stuff like buying dishes, long overdue car repairs, etc. adds up real fast. So my savings isn’t where I “should” be at at my salary level (yet). 

**Section One: Assets and Debts**

- **Retirement Balance**: $1727. I’ve been saving for retirement for two months, when I started this job and opened a 401k for the first time. 
- Savings account: $5101. Lower than I’d like, but I’ve been putting most of my extra income towards furnishing my new place. 
- **Checking account**: $4166
- **Credit card debt** (and how you accumulated it): $5636 at the time of writing this. I pay all my credit cards in full every month. I’m waiting for my (5 weeks overdue) $6k relocation bonus to appear in my account any day now so I can wipe out this debt. 
- **Student loan debt** (for what degree): $33k and growing, from two degrees. 
	- $13k from my first degree (bachelor’s in communication sciences and disorders). My first two years were tuition free because of a program in my state where you can do your first two years of college during high school for dual credit and free tuition. Rest paid from a mix of parents’ help and my own savings.
	- $20k from my second degree that I’m still completing - an online postbac computer science program. I’m about 2/3 of the way through. I was doing full time until I landed my software position and now I’ve gone down to part time. I’m going to try to pay for the rest of my degree as much as I can out of pocket going forward. 

**Section Two: Income**

- **Main Job Monthly Take Home**: $5374 after all deductions ($7708 gross)  
- **Deductions**: 
	- Taxes: $1559
	- 401k: $617 (8% of my gross)
	- Medical/Dental: $141
	- Disability Insurance (not allowed to opt out): $17

- **Other monetary benefits of my job**: 
     - Yearly bonus amounting to ~6.5% of my salary, so ~$6000
     - 401k: 50% match, up to 8%
     - Pension plan where my company contributes 5% of my salary. Vests 100% in 3 years, aka if I stay here for 3 years I can cash out my pension. 

**Section Three: Expenses**

**Monthly recurring bills:**

- **Rent**: $1658 (800sqft 1 bedroom apartment)
- **Parking**: $25
- **Heat**: ~$20
- **Other utilities** (water/trash/misc): ~$88
- **Internet**: $40
- **Cell phone**: $25 (I pay 6 months at a time for a cheaper rate)
- **Hulu**: $6 (student discount)
- **Netflix**: $13
- **Spotify**: $5 (venmo to my mom for our family plan)
- **Renters insurance**: $17 (pay 6 months at a time)
- **Car insurance**: $101
- **Car payment**: $172
- **Student loan**: $0. I don’t have to make payments right now because I’m still in school, but once I get my savings account to a more comfortable amount I want to start paying down my loans. 
- **Bus pass**: ~$71
- **Miscellaneous**: $25/mo to support my missionary friend

*Total: $2266*

- **Savings contribution**: Not consistent right now, honestly. Once my budget stabilizes I’m going to set up my direct deposit to send 25% of my take-home income into my savings account, so $1343/mo.    


**Thursday (10/24):**

7:00: Wake up and snooze my alarm. 

7:07: Roll out of bed and pour myself some Starbucks coldbrew with creamer. Brush my hair, do my makeup, and get dressed. I put on a black short-sleeved button down silk top I recently got from Everlane, American Eagle medium-wash jeans, tan Madewell loafers, pop in my cheap Target earrings studs and a short necklace from Express. I zip on my puffer jacket and head out the door to my bus stop across the street. It’s so rare to have a bus stop so close living in the suburbs, so I’m really thankful. 

7:56: Get on the bus ($2.75 per ride - already accounted for in my monthly expenses). I sit at my usual window seat and pop in my headphones. One of the deciding factors in choosing this apartment was the proximity to a bus stop that has an express route that goes to downtown Seattle where my office is. The parking at my office is like $400/mo, so driving is not an option. I only have to go into the office 3 days a week, so I don’t mind the commute. 

8:35: I arrive at my stop. I get off the bus and walk 2 blocks to my building. 

8:45: After dropping off my stuff at my desk and plugging in my laptop I head to the cafeteria and fill up my reusable cup with free coffee and creamer. 

8:55: Sit down and resume where I left off on my work yesterday. I’m working on a dashboard tool that will allow other team members to view all the details of the errors coming from our application so we can troubleshoot more easily.  

10:00: I pop on my headphones and jump on a Skype call for our daily stand-up meeting. Half of our team is remote, so we do all meetings via Skype. 

12:00: I head down to the cafeteria and go to the salad bar. I fill up on spinach, chicken, quinoa, tomatoes, ranch dressing and croutons. I weigh my salad and swipe my card at the pay station. I’m pleasantly surprised at the price today. I guess I didn’t pile on the ingredients like I usually do. **$4.67**. 

12:30: Head back up to my desk

1:00: Plug into another Skype meeting. Our most senior developer is walking through some process to move data in the mainframe database with me and the other newer guy. I honestly don’t retain most of it and wonder why we haven’t modernized this part of our application yet, but I do my best to stay attentive and take notes. 

3:55: Pack up and head to the bus stop. 

4:12: Catch the bus. The sky has surprisingly cleared up, which allows me to enjoy a view of Lake Washington and Mount Rainier as my bus goes over the bridge. 

4:55: Arrive home. Pour myself more coldbrew and add a little vanilla ice cream to it. I Flip on Netflix to where I left off with Riverdale (season 2). I know, I’m very late to the game on this one! I leave it on in the background while I finish putting together my Malm Ikea dresser I picked up on Sunday. I get pretty close to completing it but I realize there aren’t holes where there should be in a certain spot. I make a mental note to ask my dad if I can borrow his electric drill next time I’m home. 

8:00: I have to give up on my dresser for now as I need the drill for the last part, so I make myself some street tacos for dinner. My mom texts me that she’s at costco and asks me if I want another package of pre-cooked bacon. I say yes and venmo her **$15**. 

8:30: Binge Netflix for the rest of the evening. 

11:30: Go to bed. 

**Thursday total: $19.67**

**Friday (10/25):**

7:30: Wake up and snooze my alarm. I work from home on Mondays and Fridays so I get to sleep in a little. 

7:37: Get out of bed and turn on my laptop, making sure my Skype status is set to “available” and get myself some coffee. I have a dentist appointment in a few hours so I’m starting work a little earlier than normal. I make some notes of things I could discuss during my one-on-one with my manager. 

8:30: I join my Skype meeting with my manager for our bi-weekly one-on-one. I never have much to say during these so I try to make casual conversation to fill time. 

8:45: I do my makeup and throw on a hoodie, target leggings, and adidas sneakers. Finally sit down and do some work. 

10:00: daily stand-up meeting. 

10:15: walk to the dentist. yes I live a two-minute walk from my dentist! I have to get three cavities filled, which I’m annoyed about but not surprised by. I’ve been prone to them ever since I was a kid. 

12:00: Get back to my place and make myself a savory crepe with bacon, spinach, broccoli, leftover chicken and sour cream. I’ve been on a major crepes kick lately. 

12:30: Try to resume the assignment I’ve been working on but my mouth hurts and I’m just not in it today. I remember that I still have some training videos I’ve been putting off watching so I watch those. 

3:30: Well I pretty much accomplished nothing today. I feel kinda guilty but I honestly kicked butt the rest of the week, and I’m way ahead on my work anyway so I tell myself not to feel too bad. My mouth is still sore, so I crawl into bed and scroll through my phone. I see on instagram that the indoor cycling place that’s opening up across the street from me is hosting free rides next week, so I jump on that and book a seat for next Friday. I’ve been wanting to start exercising and indoor cycling is one of the few things I don’t hate, so I’m pumped this place is opening up. If I like the free ride I’m going to get a monthly membership. 

3:45: I turn on the Angel On Top podcast on Spotify and set my alarm in case I fall asleep. 

4:40: I did fall asleep. I get out of bed and fix my smudged makeup, put on my coat and get in my car to head over to my parents’ house. They only live 20 minutes away. My mom isn’t gonna be home until late this evening, so she asked me to stop by and let the dogs out and feed them dinner. 

5:00: I stop at my favorite coffee stand the way over and get a blended mocha. **$5.45**

5:20: Finally arrive home. That was a terrible time of day to make that drive, I hit the worst of rush hour. My dogs go ballistic when I walk in the door, and I play with them, let them outside and feed them dinner. I sit and chat with my dad for a while about his business and some other stuff.  I linger longer than I would normally because I’m postponing going to a hangout at an acquaintance’s house. 

6:50: As I’m playing with the dogs, I hear my dad flip on Fox News in the other room and I take that as my cue to peace out. I peel out of there with my mail, bacon, and borrowed electric drill. Before I drive off I send a quick message in that friend group’s group message chain on Facebook that I won’t be able to make it, with some vague excuse. I feel guilty but the relief I feel is stronger than the guilt. 

7:20: Get home, flip on Riverdale, and try to figure out how to use the drill. I realize I am missing a piece I need but I somehow make it work anyway. I finish my dresser and take my clothes from various plastic bins and boxes and organize them into my new dresser. I reward myself with more street tacos and a vodka soda. I try to spice it up with stuff I have laying around (frozen berries and a lime). 

8:30: I’m craving sugar., but I’m already past my calorie limit for the day. I tell myself not to go get ice cream, but I do it anyway and then feel guilty. I pour myself another drink and eat half an edible to escape all the guilt. I fall asleep around 12:30. 

**Friday total: $5.45**

**Saturday (10/26):**

10:30: Wake up and immediately chastise myself for not setting an alarm. On weekends I try to set an alarm for 9am because otherwise I’ll sleep in too late and feel gross when I wake up. 

11:30: Cold brew + avocado toast with bacon. I don’t usually eat breakfast but I’m particularly hungry this morning. 

10:45: plan my trip to Hawaii! Back in April I booked this solo trip on a whim because I found cheap plane tickets. I book an airbnb (**$381.96** charged now) and a car rental (**$123.15** charged now). 

1:45: Leftover crepes for lunch and more coffee, with a bit of vanilla ice cream. Watch a couple episodes of Buffy/Angel

2:30: craving something sweet - that bit of ice cream I put in my coffee triggered my sweet tooth. I try to resist but I give in and scoop myself a bowl with berries on top. I feel guilty because that means I only have 200-something calories for dinner. I consider giving up on my goal for today and getting pizza. 

7:50: give in and order dominos for carryout. **$11.31**. I spend most of the evening binging Angel. 

8:30: shower, clean my bathroom a little, shave, and go to bed around 11:30. 

**Saturday total: $516.42**

**Sunday (10/27):**

8:10: get out of bed and get ready for church. I serve on the coffee team every other week, and this week is my on week. I make sure to wear layers because last time I got overheated. I decide on a plain black t shirt tucked into jeans, adidas superstars and a long gray madewell cardigan from nordstrom rack. 

8:55: out the door

9:20: roll up to church slightly late. I grab coffee and a pastry and slip into service. I immediately feel my stress start to melt away. 

10:40: as service ends I head over to the kitchen for my serving shift.

11:35: After a quick final clean, I grab my stuff, fill up on coffee, grab another pastry, and head to my car. I had run into an old friend from high school and spent a couple minutes catching up and exchanged numbers. What a small world that we ended up going to the same church! I head home and grab a couple things that I need to return to my parents (the drill and a couple plastic bins I borrowed when I moved) and head over to their house. 

12:15: Most Sundays I go visit my parents for a few hours to watch the Seahawks game and eat whatever delicious food my mom cooked up. By the time I get there the game is mostly over and my parents are already slipping into their Sunday afternoon naptime sesh, so after watching the game for a few minutes and comparing fantasy football scores with my mom, I head back to my place, thinking about the homework I have due tonight. 

2:00: leftover pizza for lunch. I spend a couple hours watching more Angel.

6:00pm: start homework. The course I’m taking is one big project where we have to create a database and a program to interact with it. 

8:00: finish this week’s checkpoint and submit. I spend the rest of the evening by eating more leftover pizza and lounging around till bed around 11:30. 

**Sunday total: $0**

**Monday (10/28):**

7:45: I get up and make coffee. Thankful for another work from home day. It’s a great way to ease into the week. I sit down at my desk and get started on work. 

10:00: daily stand-up meeting.

11:30: leftover pizza for lunch and then continue work. 

2:30: start homework for next week since I’m gonna be really busy this weekend

5:30: stop homework, clean up a little and throw a chicken breast in the oven. 

6:00: for dinner I have a baked sweet potato with chicken, bacon, and salsa. It honestly was not that satisfying because I forgot I was out of some ingredients. 

7:00: shower and then decide to buy a month of HBO add on via amazon video so I can watch Silicon Valley (**$14.99**). watch a couple episodes, straighten my hair, and head to bed around 11:00. I can’t fall asleep until nearly midnight for some reason. 

**Monday total: $14.99**


**Tuesday (10/29):**

5:53: First alarm goes off and I say “oh hell no” out loud. There’s an optional meeting at 7:30 this morning (freakin east coast people planning meetings around their schedule) that’s an info session about one of our products our team works on. It would be good info but nothing is worth getting into the office that early. I set another alarm for 7:00 and go back to bed. 

7:07: Get out of bed and get ready. I repeat my Sunday outfit but replace my adidas for my black Vagabond chelsea boots. 

7:40: Catch the bus downtown.

8:25: Get into the office, grab coffee and get to work.

10:00: daily standup meeting and then work until lunch. 

12:15: Head with my team across the block to a little serve yourself buffet place. I go in with the intention of getting a salad but I am mesmerized by the teriyaki spread and scoop myself some rice, chicken teriyaki, and some eggrolls. **$14.50**. I’ve never been here before and thought this was a little pricey for what I got. At least I got enough to have leftovers for tomorrow. 

1:00: Back to work. I check my bank account as I have been every day for the past couple weeks, hoping that my relocation bonus has finally been processed. To my actual shock, it’s finally in there!! I make a mental note to pay off all my credit cards when I get home. 

4:55: Arrive home, crack open a la croix and my macbook to make those credit card payments. Feels so good to have a $0 balance again.

6:15: Drive to church for my weekly small group. I head over a little early so I can stop at my fave coffee shop that’s across the street. I get a blended mocha - **$4.90**. 

10:00: Finally get home, physically tired but emotionally filled up. Everyone in my group is so genuine and compassionate. Dinner is usually provided at group, but this time there were just some snacks. I’m not full but not hungry either - my danger zone when I most want to snack. I have a relatively easy time resisting snacking tonight, and head to bed around 10:30. 

**Tuesday total: $19.40**

**Wednesday (10/30):**

7:00: wake up and get ready. I put on black Banana Republic ankle pants, a knit orange cardigan from American Eagle, a green sleeveless top from Loft, and Madewell loafers. 

8:45: arrive at the office. 

10:00: In replacement of our daily stand-up meeting we have a story refinement meeting, where we go over all the work scheduled to be completed in the next sprint (2-week chunk of work). It goes a little long because we’re discussing a new big feature. 

11:35: lunch - leftovers from yesterday. 

12:05: back to work

4:00: out the door
5:00: get home and start on homework. this project is killer. 

6:00: leftover crepes for dinner. 

8:15: stop homework. I didn’t finish my assignment but my brain is fried. 
I watch a couple episodes of silicon valley and text with my friend about her visit this weekend. we’re going to a seahawks game this weekend and she’s coming up to stay with me the day before. I’m excited because I haven’t seen her in a while and she hasn’t been to my new place yet. 
10:45: head to bed. 

**Wednesday total: $0**

**---Final Tally---**

- Food + Drink: $55.83

- Fun / Entertainment: $520.10

- Home + Health: $0

- Clothes + Beauty: $0

- Transport: $0 (not including what I mentioned in my monthly expenses)

Other: $0

**Weekly total: $575.93**

——

Final thoughts: reading back through my week, I notice I talk about guilt a lot. I didn’t realize this was an emotion that plagued me so often, and that kind of concerns me. I also noticed my mental health was noticeably better on days I spent doing church activities. 

This was a pretty average (or even low) spend week for me other than the vacation expenses. The vast majority of my impulse purchases were on food and drinks. Seems like my apartment furnishing is start to level out too - this is probably the first week since I moved in that I didn’t buy any furniture or decor."

:-:|
The Eagles return to the friendly confines of Lincoln Financial Field Sunday after salvaging one win on their 3 game road trip taking care of business against the Buffalo Bills last week. They welcome the Chicago Bears to town in a rematch of last years NFC wildcard round and the second matchup of the Battle of Reid’s Bastards. where the Eagles squeaked out a win after the double doink missed field goal by Cody Parkey. The Eagles offense has struggled this season, but found a rhythm last week against a tough Bills defense by pounded it on the ground. They will need to do the same this week to slow out the always disruptive Khalil Mack. Part of that ground attack will be former Bear Jordan Howard who will look for some revenge on his former team after he was traded to Philadelphia in the offseason. In the passing game, the Eagles may get a boost with the return of the speedy Desaen Jackson who hasn’t played since week 1 where he put up 152 yards and 2 TDs in the season opener. Jackson was a limited participant this week, and is listed as questionable, but if he returns to the lineup it will be an immediate upgrade in the receiving corp giving Wentz a speedy deep threat and a guy with excellent hands who is always dangerous in space. On the defensive side, the Eagles will try to limit the Bears ground game and force Mitchell Trubkisky to beat him with his arm, something he has struggled with this season. Cox and Graham seemed to find their grove last week against the Bills and new Eagle Genard Avery will look to make and impact as well. Avonte Maddox will also resume his duties in the slot after missing the last three games with a neck injury. If the Eagles can get their offense going and get some turnovers on defense it should lead to an Eagle victory at the Linc.|

Eagles  16 - Bears 15|
In the battle of Reid’s Bastards, Pederson’s team struck first as the Eagles scored on a Jake Elliott field goal on the opening possession. The scoring went silent until a Nick Foles INT set up a FG for the Bears to bring the score to a tie, the Bears added another field to take the Bears into halftime up 6-3. The Eagles took the lead on their first possession of the second half with a Dallas Goedert TD before the Bears answered with a TD and FG of their own to take a 15-10 lead. The Philadelphia Eagles needed help to get into the playoffs, and Chicago provided it. The Eagles repaid them by knocking off the number defense for the second year in a row in the playoffs to send the Bears home. Foles lead the Eagles offense down field and scored a Golden Tate TD with under a minute to go in the game. The Bears marched down the field with a chance to answer and come away with the win on a last second field. Pederson iced Parkey on his first attempt when he lined up for his second shot. He lined up and kicked it with a slightly low trajectory, just low enough for the pinky of Trayvon Hester alter the flight and cause a double doink off the upright and crossbar. The Philadelphia Eagles needed help to get into the playoffs, and Chicago provided it. The Eagles repaid them by sending them home in the wildcard round as Pederson came out victorious in the Battle of Reid’s bastards.|

Recap from Last Week’s Games.|
:-
**Eagles** |
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP2SwXULebg) Have spending a week churning on 37-10 loss to the Cowboys, the Eagles responded with a 31-13 win over the Bills. The Eagles defense set the tone and the Eagles pounded the ball on the ground on the windy New York afternoon. The Eagles took control by scoring touchdowns 83 seconds apart spanning halftime to build a 17-7 lead. Graham's forced fumble of quarterback Josh Allen at Buffalo's 24 led to Carson Wentz hitting Dallas Goedert for a 5-yard touchdown catch with 25 seconds left in the second quarter. On the second snap from scrimmage in the third quarter, Sanders followed Howard's block of linebacker Matt Milano in bursting up the left sideline. The second-round draft pick celebrated his touchdown by leaping into a group of Eagles fans in the northeast corner of the endzone's stands. After the Bills answered with a  Devin Singletary score on a 28-yard catch on Buffalo's next possession, the Eagles responded with Wentz overseeing a six-play, 68-yard touchdown drive capped by Boston Scott's 4-yard touchdown run. The Eagles finished with 218 yards on the ground their highest total in a game since 2014.|

**Bears**|
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL9HBRgsqqY&amp;feature=onebox) Three straight punts preceded Piñeiro's 33-yard field goal hitting the right upright. On the Chargers' ensuing drive, Fuller intercepted Philip Rivers and returned it to the Chargers' four-yard line, but the offense struggled to gain a yard, leading to Piñeiro making a 27-yard kick. Chicago reached Los Angeles' nine-yard line but only reached their seven; Piñeiro kicked a 25-yard field goal. The Chargers answered with a four-play, 75-yard drive that ended with Melvin Gordon's four-yard touchdown run. Down by one, the Bears reached the Chargers' five-yard line with help from Montgomery's 55-yard run, but further red zone woes persisted, leading to Piñeiro giving his team the 9–7 lead on a 19-yard kick. To start the second half, the Bears mounted an 11-play, 75-yard series that included eight rushes as Montgomery recorded a four-yard score. Chase McLaughlin made a 20-yard field goal to end the third quarter. Early in the final period, Trubisky was intercepted by Casey Hayward, but McLaughlin's 42-yard kick was wide right; the Chargers regained possession on the next series after Trubisky lost a fumble on his 26-yard line. The takeaway led to Rivers' go-ahead score to Austin Ekeler. After two drives ending with punts, the Bears got the ball back on their 35 with 1:33 remaining in the game. Although Trubisky led the Bears to the Chargers' 21, Nagy called to kneel to run down the clock and set up Piñeiro's potential game-winning 41-yard kick. The kick went wide left as time expired,] marking the Bears' first three-game losing streak under Nagy.|

**Stats to Know**|
:--|
**Bears’ Play Action Passing**|
In 2019, Mitchell Trubisky is averaging a higher Yards Per Attempt and slightly higher Completion % via Play Action than not (6.0 vs. 5.5 &amp; 65.6% vs. 64.4%). Trubisky is only using Play Action 16.7% of dropbacks, which is 2nd-lowest of all QBs. It’s kind-of tough to threaten a team with Play Action when your running game is playing so relatively poorly (no Bears RB is better than 71st in RB Yards After Contact or 62nd in Yards Per Attempt. The best a Bears RB fares in overall Offensive PFF Grade is 58th.|
 

 
**Matchups to Watch**|
:--|
**Bears Defensive Line vs Eagles Offensive Line… or Andre Dillard**|
Everyone who covers the Eagles is quick to point out the likely matchup between Khalil Mack and Andre Dillard for good reason. While the Bears will move Mack all over the defensive front, he will likely get the bulk of his snaps across from the Eagles rookie tackle. Dillard has shown steady improvement since taking over for the injured Jason Peters. He is a great athlete at the position and moves very well for a man his size. Additionally, he’s pretty good in the run game despite the common criticism of him in that area in the pre-draft process. One area of his game that Dillard must improve, which will take his game to greater heights, his is ability to handle power rushes and to anchor. Right now, that ability is somewhat limited, likely due to his college coaching and competition. In the PAC-12, Dillard didn’t face the quality of rushers a lot of other prospects get to face in the Power 5 conferences; additionally, he wasn’t asked to do a variety of pass blocking sets in the scheme Washington State runs. Khalil Mack makes life difficult for All-Pro Offensive Linemen putting Dillard under the microscope on Sunday. Mack isn’t the only good player on this defensive front. The Eagles will catch a break with stud IDL Akiem Hicks on IR but the Bears still have Eddie Goldman with other effective rotational linemen behind him. Leonard Floyd has also emerged as a quality EDGE opposite Mack. Chuck Pagano isn’t afraid to bring the athletic linebackers they have on blitzes either. While this Bears defense isn’t producing turnovers at the insane rate they did last year, this is still a stout defensive front that has kept the team in games. They haven’t let the team down this year. This is a significant matchup for the Eagles given the quality of the opposition and their own offensive struggles. Can Dillard quickly rise to the occasion? How do the Eagles game plan, or alter what they’ve done, to account for Mack?|
**Bears Defense vs. Eagles Newly Dated Offensive Game Plan**|
Listen, running 40 times per game and averaging 5 YPC in the process is great to watch since we get to see the soul taken from our opponent. This happened last week against the Bills, especially on the 8 minute drive the Eagles had to effectively end the game. The issue with the philosophy is it’s normally an inefficient and ineffective way to win football games. Since the Eagles Super Bowl season, they have become more run oriented, with that shift occurring sharply this year. Part of the reason is due to injury; Desean Jackson figured to be a large part of the Eagles attack and can’t when he is injured. Another reason is due to players underperforming expectations. Alshon Jeffery is a solid receiver, but Nelson Agholor has remained the general liability he’s always been while somehow regressing and Mack Hollins is basically useless. Don’t even get my started with whatever is going on with JJAW. The Eagles are getting nothing from their WRs and the offensive coaching staff isn’t doing a good enough job scheming an offensive attack while suffering from roster construction issues. The Eagles are currently the 17th best offense by DVOA – 19th rushing, 14th passing. That’s not going to get it done for this team. The Eagles problems from 2018 have continued into 2019 while getting slightly worse. This is a Bears defense that is 7th in DVOA. This is a perfectly winnable game for the Eagles but their offensive struggles could keep this game too close for comfort. This is a long term problem for the Eagles this season and one that could have ramifications Sunday. Against a tough Bills defense, on the road, and in poor weather conditions, the coaches had a good game plan on offense that lead to the win. That’s not something the Eagles have consistently had this year. Part of the turnaround the Eagles need to have rests on the offenses ability to improve; improving the struggling passing game would work wonders for this team. The Eagles will likely have Desean Jackson back on Sunday. How effective he’ll be and what that means for the Eagles offense is huge. Ultimately, it’s a coaching and player execution problem above all else. Wentz hasn’t been the problem this year, which will aid in the turn around.|
**Bears Offensive Line vs Eagles Defensive Front**|
It has been slow-going for the Eagles defensive front on the season but it appears that this unit is starting to become a more effective group. The Bears offensive line is decent but isn’t playing at the level it has previously. Furthermore, their best offensive lineman, Kyle Long, is done for the season with injury. Fletcher Cox is fresh off a strong performance and appears to be rounding into form; the effectiveness of the Eagles pass rush rests on Cox given his dynamic ability. Brandon Graham also appears to be returning to a move effective form after notching a sack and forcing a key fumble last week in Buffalo. Derek Barnett has put together consecutive good performances which the Eagles really need. Prior to the trade deadline, the Eagles added Genard Avery via trade with the Browns. While Avery has been a healthy scratch this season, his play last year has shown him to be a more effective day 3 rusher than Shareef Miller has been for the Eagles in 2019 – not great. Avery is a pure pass rusher, though undersized. In Gregg Williams scheme, Avery was a good rotational rusher, which is where he thrives. Avery was a bit miscast under Steve Wilks this season since Avery isn’t effective dropping into coverage and playing in space. I don’t understand why coaches like Wilks don’t adapt their scheme to fit their personnel but what do I know? Either way, the Eagles still have issues in pass coverage. What is the best way to hide that? That’s right, pass rush. The Eagles still have a good defensive line that is slowly getting better each week. They face a QB that is a mess all around and an offensive line that isn’t as good as it needs to be to make up the difference. Pressure can force QBs into making mistakes; this is huge against Trubisky, who makes mistakes when he isn’t under pressure.|
**Bears Passing Offense vs Eagles Passing Defense**|
For the second consecutive week, the Eagles will face a QB that is a better RB than he is QB. The Eagles secondary has made fewer mistakes with the return of the swag-tastic Jalen Mills and Ronald Darby but “fewer” is deceiving. Simply put, the Eagles are up against another middling to bad offense and a passing attack this week that they need to take advantage of. The biggest issue they face this week are the Bears receiving options. Allen Robinson is a very good receiver and easily the best receiver Philly has seen since Amari Cooper. Taylor Gabriel, Anthony Miller, and Tarik Cohen are all playmakers in their own right. This is a deeper group of weapons the Bears have to work with than Josh Allen has. It’s just the QB is considerably worse with an offensive scheme that has regressed mightily. The Bears offense is ranked 28th by DVOA – 21st passing, 27th rushing – and it shows when you watch them. Allen Robinson is really the only player Trubisky can seem to get the ball to and he regularly struggles with that. The Eagles secondary was “better” against the Bills… but not really. Allen had issues locating open receivers for various reasons (pressure, general inability) that left points on the field for their offense. The Eagles still haven’t cleaned up a lot of the mistakes that regularly plague them. Their opponent this week may afford them the opportunity to skirt disaster again but all it takes is one mistake to cost them the game. The Eagles aren’t in a position to give up games against teams they should beat so every possession matters. The defense, while struggling, should be able to handle what the Bears will throw their way. More consistent execution from the players and coaches would work wonders here. Keep the Bears in a hole – force their offense to chase. Play and coach smart.|

dq8z98,5,2019-11-01,Help! Am I (30m) in the wrong for expecting my spouse (28f) to contribute in some manner?,rickyman818,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dq8z98/help_am_i_30m_in_the_wrong_for_expecting_my/,"We got married after not dating much - dating is just not something that is normal in our culture. I understand and know already it is not the best idea to marry someone after talking to them for just one month but it is what it is - please don't just comment ""This is what you get for marrying without truly getting to know the person"" because I already know that and it is not very helpful given the situation I am in. We also live in the same house with MY parents - this is also something that is culturally typical where we are from.

So, me (30m) and my wife (28f) have been married for about 4 years now. The first year was rough for both of us as we got to know each other and our communication patterns - a lot of arguing over super small things. Since then, we have really improved our communication and we barely fight or argue anymore. Though sometimes I question if the reduced arguments is because we just know the things we disagree on and have therefore just stopped talking about those things.

My biggest challenge right now, and this is what i need help managing, is that I feel like I am the only one contributing to the day-to-day functioning of our house and our family. I am the only one who works and earns money. I take care of most bills, grocery, car maintenance for both of us etc.

She contributes in the house for sure, but I find myself questioning often if she contributes enough. Since we live with my parents, 90% of the time, we just eat whatever my mom has cooked. My mom also does most of the cleaning in the house. My wife was studying full time until recently, but now that she is done, she has just decided to take some kind of a break (yet undecided how long this break is but she says less than a month) and she pretty much spends the whole night browsing social media or watching her favorite youtube stuff. This routine is not good for her either, she misses doctor appointments on a regular basis, skips internship days (she has a relaxed schedule but she barely goes ever). Her routine also means that she sleeps through most of the day and doesn't interact much with my family or even me if I am working from home or whatever.

One thing that just makes it worse for me, is that we have always struggled in terms of sexual compatibility - she rarely takes initiative and due to that I have subconsciously stopped making an effort as well. We on average have sex once every 2-3 weeks.

she also has loans from school that she expects I will pay fully, and she says she will try and pay me back if she is able to in the future. She says she can't take on the added pressure of the loans right now because that will make her very anxious. She is very ambitious and wants to pursue graduate school before she even pays off her existing loans.

I think its also important to add that she is someone who struggles more than I do ( and I'm lucky I don't struggle much) with depression and anxiety - she hasn't taken the initiative yet to see a therapist even though I have suggested it to her several times and we have really good insurance. So, there is a lot of emotional labor on my part making sure I don't trigger her anxieties or just in general when I need to be there for her as emotional support when she is struggling with anxiety and/or depression.

All of the above leads to me sometimes feeling like our relationship is one that involve me mainly giving (emotional support, financial support) and not getting any sort of support in return. Yes, she supports me emotionally when I need that support on rare occasions but mostly she is so caught up in her own struggles that she is unable to be there for me emotionally either.

I have tried to communicate about all this with here and her usual response is ""you are correct, I don't know what to do or how to manage and I can't do all that you expect of me"".

Are my expectations unreasonable here? Having her contribute in some way - i don't care if she earns money or not but if she doesn't then she should contribute in some form in the house. We don't have kids yet - and we both want kids - so this worries me if she'd be able to burden the responsibility of caring for a child when I am out at work (I have a feeling she would just leave the kid with my mom for her to take care of that as well).

It's all very confusing for me and I am not sure at all how to address some of these concerns and if these concerns are even valid. I know we both love each other, and want to work through whatever challenges we face, but she doesn't usually change her behavior after our discussions which makes me feel nothing I say has an impact.

Any advice would be helpful even if its y'all telling me ""hey, you're expectations are wrong!"". I just feel like a relationship is a partnership that is mutually beneficial, and right now I feel like I'm the only one making the effort and bearing the load."
dq92qz,1,2019-11-01,Importance of Enthusiasm In an Employer,cscqsim_repostbot,CSCQSimulator,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSCQSimulator/comments/dq92qz/importance_of_enthusiasm_in_an_employer/,"I'll preface with a background:
This summer I did an internship with Microsoft and got a fulltime return offer. I also have a fulltime decision coming from Google on the same day as my Microsoft deadline (not guaranteed to be positive of course).
I have gotten what I'd judge as some pretty positive signs from Microsoft (I dont mean this in a bragging way). In particular, my ex-manager and my recruiter have been super helpful and responsive, reaching out often and checking if I have questions. Furthermore, I made a negotiation bid, which they fulfilled and surpassed by about 30k.
Then I contrast to Google, which doesn't seem as eager to have me. They're getting me my offer on the literal last day I have to make a MSFT decision and my Google recruiter just doesn't send the same friendly vibes as my MSFT one (I know this might sound kind of petty). 

THE QUESTION:
I'm wondering if I should take these different levels of apparent eagerness into consideration for my decision.
I'm particular, I'm thinking that if Microsoft is doing so much to bring me back in, they'll be more willing to invest in me and my professional growth (especially since I already somewhat have a professional network and ""mentors"" from my internship). Plus I know my manager will vouch for me to get the team I want. Whereas with Google, I just don't feel like I have that same internal voice.
But on the other hand, I know generally Google is considered more prestigious than Microsoft and might do more for my career in that sense.
How would y'all approach the situation?

My situation might be biased because I interned at Microsoft and so they obviously have more invested in me (plus past performance to work off of). 

But I've been in my head so much and I'm hoping some outside advice will help. Thank you!

p.s. this is my first post here so lmk if I did anything wrong/should add more info

Edit 1:
I started a preemptive negotiation process with Google (I've been Hiring Committee approved) and now looks like they're gonna try to match Microsoft. It's still a little confusing bc I haven't gotten the explicit offer though.

Edit 2:
Officially got offer letter! Competitive with Microsoft but still slightly less. I don't really mind the difference though

dq9d2l,7,2019-11-01,"Blew Up My Life, Now What?",DimDinDah,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dq9d2l/blew_up_my_life_now_what/,"I'm 45 years old, I've blown up my life, and I honestly don't know what to do or where to turn next. I'm posting this on a throwaway account, because what I'm about to share is something I'm rather embarrassed about, and is something I have not been completely honest about with people in my life, including my family, friends, or even therapist.

A bit of background: In the last two years I became very disenchanted with my job. I was a low level but well paid executive for a company that I had worked my way up in without a degree. There was an incident where I had to discipline a bad actor at work, and in retaliation, this person made up a lie about me and reported it to HR. They said that I only hired young men, so that I could prey on them sexually, and that I was secretly having relationships with several of my direct reports. My accuser was a gay man, as am I, and this was later disclosed to me that part of the reason his accusations were indulged at all was because the HR department did not ""have a lot of experience dealing with same sex relationships in the workplace"", which I only mention to give context to how gross the whole thing was. While these accusations were ultimately proven to be complete falsehoods, the investigation was extremely embarrassing to me, as several of my direct reports and peers were questioned about my life outside of work and my behavior towards other men in the office. While I was never ""punished"", I was moved to a different office during the investigation, and when I was proven innocent, I remained at this new office, and there was nothing done to my ""accuser"", as punishment for lodging a false complaint. I should've gotten a lawyer, but my company had a lot of good lawyers and a lot of resources, and I was very intimidated at the time.

After this 4 month ordeal, I became very depressed and suicidal. My saving grace was that every night I could go home to my dog, who had been my faithful companion for 14 years. I was and am single, my partner of 8 years left me for another guy right before we were to move with my company, saying that he didn't want to leave the coast, and most all of my friends in the new city were from work. Having moved across country with this company, so I was a stranger in my community, and felt very isolated during this time in my life. Then, my dog died unexpectedly.

He was my best friend. I know dogs don't live forever, but he was in fairly good health, then suddenly developed a cough and was breathing heavy, he died in my arms waiting for a diagnosis from the vet later that night of what we assume was heart failure. I didn't pay for an autopsy, as my vet kindly advised me that the $750 wouldn't bring him back. This heartbreak was where I can pinpoint the moment I cracked. I remember sitting in my car, sobbing uncontrollably, thinking that I would just drive home and kill myself. I had lost the last thing in my life that meant anything to me. Thankfully, I didn't follow through. Somehow I found the strength to find a therapist.

In therapy I have been able to process the severe mental abuse I suffered as a child, the betrayal of losing my partner, the humiliation and anger I had about my job, and the grief I carry about my dog. I little over a year ago, I left my job and cashed out my retirement. I had saved up quite a bit of money. Being single in a relatively unfamiliar city with few friends allows you to save a lot, plus I was very well compensated. I couldn't work for that company for one more day. To be honest, I didn't want to work at all after all of that, but I didn't know where else to go or what to do. I didn't tell them why I was leaving, although I'm sure a few guessed. My therapist recommended committing myself for a while, as she was worried about my suicidal thoughts, but I decided that I could live off of my savings and cashed out retirement for a long time, even with the tax on withdrawing early. That was 14 months ago.

When I left my job, I had originally planned on pursuing a career in audio journalism, radio and podcasting. I had started down that path in college, some twenty years ago, but was sidelined by a great job opportunity (with the above mentioned company) and left college without a degree. I haven't worked in journalism at all since then, and that was over 20 years ago. Over the past year, I've looked for entry level jobs in the field. I've produced exactly one independent story for a workshop I attended on beginners podcasting and audio reporting, (which was aired on local public radio) and have very much frittered away a lot of time, taken a lot of naps, gone on a lot of hikes, and done some traveling. My former job was more than full time, 50 hours per week minimum, and many weekends and holidays, and I don't regret taking this time, as I feel that I had given over a lot of my youth to the company, missing out on a lot of these things.

I'm sorry this is so long. Thank you for reading if you've gotten this far. I'm writing this here because I am stuck. I am finding it VERY difficult to break in to radio, or audio journalism, or to even sit down and talk into a microphone about whatever's on my mind and make a podcast about it. I'm not very good at self-education; watching YouTube videos about how to use the tech involved in production is difficult for me. I feel like the world has passed me by, as I haven't had to keep up with technology at my old job. I feel like I'm 20 years behind every one else. There's a part of me that really does want to continue pursuing this, but there's also the depressed part of me that struggles to feel passionate about it. I know this is going to sound entitled or embarrassing or whatever (thus, the throwaway) but I'd really just like to find a nice guy and settle down and be a housewife. I love cooking and taking care of people. I love the idea of running a household for someone. I'm starting to run low on funds, so I'm having anxiety about having to find a job. I have no idea what I'm good at, or what I should do. Journalism and radio internships all want young students. The thought of working retail sends me into an anxiety attack, though that seems to be all I'm qualified to do when I look at job listings on Indeed and LinkedIn. I feel like I lack direction, and that really what I want is a partner to tell me what to do.

I'm leaving this here as a last hope that someone out there has either experienced this in their life, which I know is probably just a run of the mill mid-life crisis, even though it feels like a tidal wave crashing down around me most days, or has some good advice for someone struggling with how to spend the next 45 years of their life. I know that I risked a lot, giving up my retirement and not having a plan to work, but honestly, it was either that or kill myself at the time. That's how I saw it, so I don't really need any lectures on my own stupid financial decisions. Believe me, I'm better at beating myself up about it than you are. I'd just really appreciate any advice or direction or ideas from any of you.

Thank you."

This is my first time reaching out on my own post here on reddit. I love music of every genre and am looking to grow as an artist, make lasting connections, and who knows, maybe make a hit? I’ve done vocals from folk to pop to rock to rap and write all my own lyrics. I have a home studio setup rn complete with acoustic treatment, baby bottle blue sl condenser microphone, line6 ux2 audio interface, Rokit studio monitors, and audiotechnica headphones. I wanted to create the best setup to be able to record useable uncolored vocals for producers to work with. I pretty much have no friends in the area that I just moved to that I can collab with so I’m really committed to making something work/happen on here.

Anyway here’s a couple samples of my voice that has been progressing over the years. note: some of the best tracks imo are private so follow the link if you want to hear a particular one

dqalkf,233,2019-11-01,Day trading saved my life,mistressbitcoin,Daytrading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/dqalkf/day_trading_saved_my_life/,"(Or ruined it?)

I know the title is hard to believe, but it is true. Even if I did waste too much of my life trading.

Maybe this can be a little inspirational to someone here. Maybe some of you will think it is sad.

During high school I was addicted to a MMORPG and played 40+ hours per week. I would trade/invest in different items in the game, eventually becoming well known within the game and one of the best. I would corner markets to the point that drop rates/rules were changed to stop me. I was well regarded and well respected within the game. People would ask my opinion on stuff, want to join my trades with me, etc. etc.

In college I tried to distance myself from gaming, but my experience with trading virtual items made me see the potential in cryptocurrency early on. Junior year I turned $200 into $20k and cashed out $15k. Then senior year I turned the $5k remaining into $80k and cashed it out.

This is all while I got straight A's in math, economics (majors), and physics (minor). But doing all of this together led to extreme burnout. When I did not apply to grad schools I felt like I was failing all my teachers. I ""coasted"" my last semester still managing all As but was so burnt out I didn't apply to any jobs. I started applying to a few once I graduated, but when none of them got back to me for months I felt like a complete and utter failure because I had always been such a perfectionist and always on top of my game. I didn't know how to fail.

I eventually got an internship in the marketing department of a finance company. They would have me go stand in line to buy them lunch and stapled together their marketing material in an industry that was going through a rough patch. Meanwhile, a few of them mocked me for trading bitcoins (and traders in general) asking me if I had seen the price movement every large crash as it fell from like $400 to $200 over a few months. I do not have good social skills and couldnt make any friends or defend myself and my self esteem continued down.

I managed to get a job in programming about a year after college but I was no expert in it. I felt like the worst person on the team and was treated like it. Extremely regimented days where I would meet with the boss every day and tell her exactly what I was doing and had to record everything in 15 min intervals. Most people had depression and burnout it seemed like, and I realized I did not like programming or working in an office, and started to contemplate suicide.

Eventually I decided that I would travel the world for a year or two and then kill myself. That would be it. Maybe find a way to do it while travelling.

So I quit and my family freaked out like crazy. Dad suggested I should become a baggage handler at the airport. Mom suggested to apply to anything and everything. Grandma suggested going to church. I just wanted to travel. Now my family saw me as a failure, in addition to my past employers and teachers. I was 24 and had about $170k saved up, and there I was believing I was a complete failure while wondering if I should take a min wage baggage handling job at the airport or just off myself. (Nothing against baggage handler or min wage, but it was so different from my my plans/studies)

But then Bitcoin started to make a comeback and appeared to be entering another bubble cycle. I decided I would trade and while travelling see if I can make a year's worth of my old salary doing so. 

This was early 2017. Out of the $80k I cashed out of crypto a couple years earlier, I put $20k back in. In 2017 I was on top of my game. I had seen many bubbles play out before and I was going to trade it as perfectly as possible. I managed to turn the $20k into $1 million that year with no drawdowns over 20%. Completely killed it. Recognized it was overhyped in December and cashed most of it out. Made another few hundred k trading rebounds on the way down. Basically I was in ""do or die"" mode working upwards of 100 hour weeks analyzing everything. I had to basically prove to everyone (myself, my family, my last employers, friends who thought I was crazy, etc.) that I knew how to trade and the entire time I felt like my life was on the line with every trade. 

It was the most stressful year of my life. It was me vs the world and I put every ounce of energy into the battle. But I had done it - made $1M at age 25. Maybe this would be enough to stop the relentless depression and the self hate.

I somehow convinced a bank to give me a loan to buy a house based on my trading record alone, and rented it out to roommates who pay for most of it. Spent some on a Tacoma that doesn't depreciate much. Spent a little more on travelling.

Then i moved a large portion into stocks where I made a decent amount on Canadian weed stocks, a 30-40% rebound in REITs, and some others. All from strategies learned in crypto, which were modified from strategies learned in online gaming.

I am very far from recovering from depression. And if you asked me now, I still do feel like a complete failure. Except for one thing - the time it was me vs the world and I won against all odds. I don't really know what to do to get my mental health better. But at least I am still here."

I am a recent electrical engineering graduate, and I am interested in joining an MEP company. I do have a decent GPA from a top school 10 school nationally. I am familiar with AutoCad and Revit, but my school did not offer any classes for them. I do have a prior internship experience but not in the industry.

I was just wondering if there is any advice to help me navigate the job search for MEP? How to approach recruiters/ managers and show them my passion/ interest.

I would also to love to know if there any online classes/books to help standout."
dqc83z,5,2019-11-01,I just met this really cool Taiwanese girl in my university I like. I have a history of coming on too strong/scaring girls off and don't know how to date. Do I ask her our the first time I hang out with her or wait until a couple of weeks of getting to know her?,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/dqc83z/i_just_met_this_really_cool_taiwanese_girl_in_my/," 

21M in college in NYC - kissless virgin and pretty lonely and never really had too many friends. However, I've had a good finance internship so I know a thing or two about etiquette and feelings things out. Unfortunately, because I was raised in a really conservative Muslim household, I always sort of had my sexuality repressed.

I don't know how to flirt, am being really bad at gauging how to react appropiately in situations, and come on too strong to girls all the time. I don't know how to date or ask out girls or what the process was.

Three days ago I convinced myself to approach this really cute girl from Taiwan in my college by literally just walking up to her. She recieved my compliment really, really well (she was pretty bubbly/enthusiastic) and it turns out we spent some time in Korea abroad.

Also shes taiwanese and not chinese so shes pretty open minded/exposed to western culture

I added her on messenger and asked to hang out this week because I thought she was cool and she said she'd love to make American friends as her 'english wasn't too good' (total bullshit lol, her english was great and she had many western nuances in her english).

So what do I do? She said wanted to meet next week but didn't respond yet as to what days she's free (she said she's usually free in the afternoon on most weekdays in school). The last time I texted her was Thursday and she hasn't responded yet. Do I message her again now and see when she's free and say ('hey, so just wanted to follow up on when you were free!!!"")? or do I wait until Sunday/Monday?

Also, how do I actually get into a relationship with her? Do I just ask her out on a date at the end of the first hangout (still tentative and she hasn't even responded yet)? Or do I hang out a couple of more times and ask her out?

I really like this girl but have literally come on too strong with every girl I've ever met. It's Friday and she still hasn't responded. I just don't know what to do? Also do I flirt while hanging out with her? and how should I ask her out?"

Two days later go to er get admitted, ct showed colitis. Scheduled upper and lower GI. Both unremarkable. Severe pain, doctors chose that point to discontinue pain meds. They said there was nothing else they could do but send me home. At that point I couldn't eat, keep fluids down, pain 9/10. I got so worked up I passed out.

Now I am really afraid they were just trying to get rid of me, a nurse even said that it was all in my head and give the pain to God! 

I had my appendix out 3 years ago and it still shows clips, I had my gallbladder out six months ago and I'm wondering if I should go back to see the surgeon?? Would something be left that wouldn't be seen on scope or ct?"

He felt incapable and went back to manage what he could.

[\\""I just really need this vacation, I need a break.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/x93ne3boq5w31.png?width=429&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=133803945c672f3f7da60f9890eb68539eaae4c3)

Given how much of a critical point this is in how people regard the movie, and felt the original cut didn't do the best job of explaining it, I'd figure I would give it a crack.

[\\""Whatever's going on with you I hope you figure it out.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/4kzlchf2s5w31.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a1b234c57c3fecdacc2fe468b117bc9dd9130e)

The final scene in Homecoming was a critical point with Peter's character. He ends up in a classic awkward scene where he expresses his sympathies to the people he hurts, but doesn't get the reception that he wanted.

He ended up in this situation, originally, due to being distracted with the Stark ""internship"" (pointed out by May in the Thai food scene), leading Peter to neglect his student life while thinking being Spider-Man/ an Avenger was more important. The ferry incident proves otherwise, to which he returned to his life now having the courage and ambition to progress in his social life until stopping the Vulture once again costed that for him.

After meeting Tony, and refusing the full time Avenger position, I would imagine that he would've nevertheless continue on the path where he was at in focusing on getting his regular life back in order.

[\\""You can't be a 'Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man' if there's no Neighborhood.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/a3a281rhv5w31.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9097d43b7be0f5d4e10fb59639d0f37f6ebcf7bc)

By the time of Infinity War, Peter managed to convince Tony with a new rationale of being involved compared to Homecoming. Instead of asking to be an Avenger, he reaffirms that in order to be the local hero he wanted to be he needed to stay and help, which he manages to pull off in his plan in getting rid of Ebony Maw.

This is all and well until he dies, is resurrected, and then loses Tony.

[\\""Does anyone have any neighborhood questions?\\""](https://preview.redd.it/12u2o3zrx5w31.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c1a0100ea1861b7aa85b6bd2848f88001ee5a8b)

Peter, in the extended cut, is shown being Spider-Man yet with the Iron-Spider suit. Without Tony, he is still physically and mentally capable of being Spider-Man but not to his full extent.

The stress he felt over Tony's death is shown through his looser ""Spidey-Sense"", which the extra protection with the suit likely helps with.

Yet I'm not personally convinced that it is simply him missing Tony after Endgame. What is more concerning Peter is the expectations that everyone seem to want from him, along with seeing how highly regard Tony is outside of America while in Europe. His talk with Happy near the final act proves this. The scene where Mysterio uses Tony's death to ""guilt"" Peter I don't think was a genuine statement on Peter's feelings, instead I see that as a misdirection that Beck uses to play with Peter's head. The [Tony=Ben](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/cna4gv/mcu_peter_parkers_story_and_the_role_of_tony_stark/) thing I don't think works.

[\\""I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man sir.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/gtam0uyk06w31.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d0af1690446bcfcd7c5e02dcfa60dbb37de15f1)

When confronted by Fury, Peter openly puts himself down as just being a local hero, showing that during his experience being an Avenger is different from what he thought it would be and didn't want it to screw up the life that he almost wasted in Homecoming. Regardless, his behavior up to the point of understanding who Beck really was him being reckless as Peter pointed out to Happy and MJ.

His behavior was even inconsistent, in a way that shows that he knew staying back was wrong. For instance, saving people in [Venice](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/d0tm8v/peters_actual_decision_in_ffh/) while only wearing a thin mask despite being concerned about his identity. This being glossed over honestly irks me since he refuses not because he doesn't want to bothered, he does it more consistently with himself not being full capable in his eyes.

Likewise, people piecing together his identity and putting his friends at risk was also a factor in why he refused the mission. This was shown when Peter transitions from being at the hotel lobby with his class in Prague to meeting Fury after Ned said that he was counting on him. By this point he already figured out *not* how to simply be Spider-Man for his own comfort, but on how to be Spider-Man to prevent his mistakes in Homecoming (hence why I started with the scene with Liz).

This is something that Peter has little experience with compared to when 616 Peter got involved with large events, since this Peter's Spider-Man life is different from his life in the comics. Instead of having a steadily building flurry of rogues to be mindful of, he mostly acts as an aid to the police. Hence, why he manages to include getting with MJ on his list, because at that time he could afford it.

[\\""It's Beck, he's here.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/fa8wo69e56w31.png?width=814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f349649408c3acf5d529eee4782fe22477de471b)

Peter going after Mysterio after giving him E.D.I.T.H even shows his shift in responsibility because he ""sensed"" his presence faintly when in Berlin.

It's just kind off a moot point in arguing that what Peter does in un-Spider-Man like, given how his circumventing behavior up to this point shows that he is aware of it. If MCU Peter would have a talk and admit it based on what we see in the movie, then what more else is there to say?

Otherwise, a glaring thing I want to address was when he admitted his identity to MJ. As much as people want to point out the lengths he took to hide this from MJ in the 616 comics, he admitted it to MJ, Gwen, and Aunt May in the Ultimate comics when he wanted to A. Make is Spider-Man life easier with a helping hand, B. Make it easier to help Gwen understand her father's death, C. Finally explain the weird occurrences to May.

Peter in this situation was already being figured out by MJ, who in the 616 comics already had the suspicion seeing Spider-Man leave Peter's window on the night of Ben's death after Peter ran into the house. It's pretty comparable given she was also made aware of Beck's plan along with him. To run off as fast as he could and not be seen, his identity would be put together either way.

[\\""C'mon Peter-Tingle.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/hegqopda86w31.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9bb780f8f194033b5a98a9e7096fb3515b787ca)

Along with Fury as the peak of the demand for an active Avenger, Mysterio gains the upper-hand on Peter by manipulating his moment of feeling incapable in the beginning of the movie and his regard for older heroes with more experience with grand villains.

Mind you, it was after hearing the failure of Mysterio's Home world when Peter refused the mission. Having just barely managing to pull through from the events of Endgame, having to go through that again was clearly a fear of his when he saw Mysterio attempting to sacrifice himself.

Seeing Mysterio in the glasses, and again viewing himself as irresponsible and less experienced with these threats, he gave the glasses to someone who he knew was working with Fury, someone who had worked various Avengers and was already trusted with containing the device.

All of this being lies told to him, and seeing the world at stake, he manages to feel capable again. Though still using Stark Tech, he plays to his strengths that he had since Civil War, that is coordinating plans with the resources available to him. He also uses a [suit](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/dgx8dd/why_i_honestly_prefer_the_ffh_suit_over_the/) that is far less intricate than the Stark-made suits, again playing to the modifications he made for his homemade suit but with a Stark level quality.

**Point**: If the film seemed to lack growth from Peter's perspective, it's because the conflict wasn't simply that he didn't ""feel like it"", but that he held himself back due to the lack of experience in large event situations that he later criticizes. He had the capacity, he had the capability, but felt discouraged straying from the local hero role due to the risks."

She attends a different college but we still see each other every month or so, and we always play games together. We bond over games and tv shows, and we love playing games like Factorio, RimWorld, or Roblox together. For my sister's birthday, I figured I'd show my appreciation by getting her around $50 dollars worth of clothes. (On other people I spend around $30 or so usually).

My sister does very well for herself. She has gotten two paid summer internships at Exxon Mobil as a materials engineer. Last summer she went to over 14 different cities, alot of which were just for fun to hang out with friends. Also, these were all over the country so she clearly had money for air fare. Also, next week she is planning a trip to California so I know she hasn't ""run out"" or anything like that. But for my birthday, she got me a $20 tie that just had some binary on it because she knows I like programming. Now as rude as It sounds, I just kinda thought this was a pretty lazy gift, years before she would get me some games from my steam wishlist, and that was before she was making Exxon money. She even bought a $50 steam game for herself just a couple days after my birthday. I want to bring it up with her, its not that big of a deal its just that I expected a bit more. Any advice?"

Since then, my ndad has sent me flowers, a postcard that said “some of the happiest moments in my life have been with you”, and has sent me a sappy song on iTunes right before I left the state for a quick trip. Mind you, I never gave him my new address, and have not spoken to him since he sexually abused me when he visited me this summer at my internship. He also once told me that if my mom was sick and dying and homeless, he would not accept her into his home. 

My mom and I were not very close. She divorced my dad when I was little and my siblings and I hadn’t seen her in 12 years until we heard that she was very sick.  We finally visited her, and that’s when I found out my ndad has prevented her from her visitations with us for no reason, and drove her away, not to mention other horrible, abusive actions toward her while they were married. Since she was scared of him, she didn’t fight back like she wanted to, and now I’m living with the fact that my ndad is the reason why I never had a relationship with her. He would tell us about how weak she was and how she would lie about everything. He poisoned us against her my whole life. When I met her, I found the same, lovely woman whom I have so many fond childhood memories of, and she was so sweet and kind. I felt like I could really be myself around her, and realized my ndad’s words have been lies. 

My mom is gone forever, and I am heartbroken. I will never have my better parent in my life again. Before her death, I was in the process of removing my ndad from my life. I am almost done with becoming financially independent and I have a letter of no contact prepared. But all of his actions and moments where he reaches out have been so saddening. He has not apologized or acknowledged the sexual abuse. He has not mentioned my mom since he sent flowers. He seems to only be interested in reminding me that I still have a “good” parent left. I am emotionally exhausted. I pity him and his mental illness, but I cannot deal with the pain he inflicts over and over. I was so ready to cut him out, but I’m worried that his emotional manipulation is succeeding and I cannot afford to fall victim to it again."

dqg9or,0,2019-11-02,Do I deserve a raise or promotion?,hereforshts,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/dqg9or/do_i_deserve_a_raise_or_promotion/,"Can anyone please give my situation a read and provide some insight on how I should proceed?

Some background information:

\- I graduated March 2018 and have a little less than 2 years of accounting experience, 3 years including internships

\- Private mid-sized corporation with around $150MM annual revenue and 200-500 employees

\- I work in the finance/accounting department as a Staff Accountant, the team is very top heavy, with many senior accountants, one controller and asst controller. I'm the only Staff Accountant.

\- currently done with 2/4 tests on my CPA exam

&amp;#x200B;

Events &amp; accomplishments since being hired January 2019 in chronological order:

1. Initially brought in to take over the duties of a current Senior Accountant (lets say business segment A) and the senior accountant was to shift to ASC compliance testing. I worked in this capacity through audit and handled my duties very well in my honest opinion. Duties were Financial / GL accounting in nature.
2. However, plans fell through upon our current Controller stepping down, this put the senior accountant back into the role I took from him (segment A) and I shifted into a Corporate Accounting role. This was about month 3 - 4 months in and I also quickly relearned the processes and nuances of this role with minimal supervision and established a great reputation among my peers. Throughout this time, I also did some ad-hoc reporting and research projects for the FP&amp;A team working with the Director of FP&amp;A and Senior financial analyst for another busines segment (lets say segment B)
3. During month 5 - 6, one of the analysts left her position and my company was now looking to replace her. An executive had a referral come in to interview for the position with the Director of FPA &amp; SFA and they did not see him fit for the role. So the Director recommended me to fill the Senior Financial Analysts duties and recommended the referral to be hired as a Senior Accountant to take over my Corporation Accounting position. Keep in mind, I gladly accepted this without a promotion and remained as a Staff Accountant because I had a great relationship with the Director and saw his mentor-ship as being more valuable than a 5%-10% raise or a promotion. I also believed it was too early for me to deserve one anyways. However, I did have a conversation with an executive and my the assistant controller prior to accepting another job duty change, and one of them said ""we will keep your position the same and re-evaluate in 3 months at the end of September 2019 to see if you like it or not"". Not sure how to interpret this but this conversation has not happened.
4. Had a performance review around July/August and got very positive feedback (w/ new and old controller together) as well as a small standard inflation salary increase (2-3%)
5. After points 3 &amp; 4 have been resolved, I trained the new Senior Accountant that will be taking my Corporate accounting duties (as a Staff Accountant still) while slowly shifting into Bus Segment B training with the senior analyst that left (she was contracted to train me lol).
6. I am still in this current capacity current day. I handle the accounting close, some financial reporting (FP&amp;A duties of the senior analyst that resigned were split between me and the Director of FP&amp;A) as well as some sales ops duties including inventory reporting &amp; commissions calculation for sales reps.
7. Here's the bomb, this week my mentor, the Director of FP&amp;A, resigned for a better job in an industry hes interested in and his last day will be the in 2 weeks from today. He's told me that he recommended me to take over the executive month end reporting package and will be the sole person reporting for business segment B, as a stop-gap or possibly long term. He also told me on the side that he thinks I should definitely ask for a raise at this point ( I am not his direct report).
8. So I basically feel like the cheap bandaid for the company to stop its continuous bleeding and I will most certainly ask for a raise the end of this month.

**TLDR; my leverages for a raise/promotion:**

\- all the shit I mentioned above (solid progression, willingness to learn, fast learner, aspiring CPA)

\- I will soon be the sole source of knowledge for my segments commissions (comp analyst recently hired to consolidate commission calculations from the various business segments I'm the only one that has the knowledge to train him)

\- I will also be the person doing the ""rolled up sleeves work"" for accounting and FP&amp;A for my business division. My only buffer at this point from the executive team is the Controller.

\- It is expected, although not stated to me yet, that I will be going to the year-end inventory audit on January 2nd 2020

\- In my opinion, my company faces huge business risks from this point to year-end due to these issues as well as having me as a flight-risk if they deny my raise/promotion. I don't think I'll have an issue looking for another job. The only thing keeping me here is that it is more convenient for me to get my cpa experience signed off. I also highly doubt that my coworkers have any capacity to take on my work.

***Can someone please provide some insight on what they think my chances of getting a promotion / raise are?***

***Can it be reasonably argued that I don't deserve a raise?***

***If denied a raise, should I immediately start looking or stay until I get my CPA signed off?***

***I truly appreciate all feedback and responses, thank you!***"
dqh1t6,7,2019-11-02,WIBTA for reporting my roommate?,journey717,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dqh1t6/wibta_for_reporting_my_roommate/,"So I (20F) am in an internship program and live in an associated dorm type of apartment with 5 other women ages 19-20. My program is VERY strict on underage drinking and especially in having alcohol in our apartments. There are rumors (and I've even seen it happen) that if alcohol is found in the room, everyone in the room could get let go from the program. I'm taking a semester off from college to do this, plus I want to stay w/ this company so I would be extremely bummed to be let go, especially knowing that I am just a couple months away from my 21st bday.  

I'm not exactly ""purer"" then everyone else, I drink as well but am not drinking during this program as it's extremely important to me as I mentioned, also I turn 21 in Dec so I'll drink then. So like two weeks ago, I got home from a day out and one of my roommates was already in the apartment, obviously extremely drunk (this was like 7pm). I asked if she was ok, she said yes but in a SUPER drunk way and I was worried and ended up having to take care of her, she sobered up a few hours later. 

The next morning she thanked me for taking care of her and I just casually asked her where she had been out the previous day, she mentioned that it was just a ""self-care"" day and she had stayed in. I asked her point blank ""Do you have alcohol in the apartment?"" she said she had gotten 1 bottle of wine, finished it in one sitting and now didn't have anymore, and she said she was even going to go out of her way to drive the bottle to throw away in a different location so it wouldn't be seen in our trash (we are all PARANOID here). I said ok, but please don't drink here again.

A week later, I invited her to a party that my friend was throwing, I was driving since I wasn't drinking and I go to the apartment and pick her up. She is a bit intoxicated already, I asked her where she had pre-gamed and she was like ""shushhhh"". I took this to mean that she was hiding alcohol in the apartment. I asked her to get rid of it and she got mad at me in the car and basically said ""don't be a spoilsport!!""

&amp;#x200B;

I talked with her the next morning and laid things out, ""look this is important to me, you really can't drink here"" and she said I was being a bitch and I needed to mind my own business. But this is my business.... Our other roommates don't seem to care as much or think that we will be found out, they think I'm a bit paranoid and that there are good hiding spaces in the apartment. We do have apartment inspections though....

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a week since the last incident and she has been dropping hints that she's keeping alcohol in the apartment AGAIN! At this point, I kind of want to report her to our program staff to cover my own ass. I actually really like her and we are friends but she is being selfish and inconsiderate....I'm just worried that ratting someone out makes me the asshole??? So, WIBTA if I ratted her out?"

I never have any regrets but as I self reflect, I'm starting to think differently.

When I was still in college, I landed a summer internship with the company. Towards the end of the internship, the Senior Director invites a few of the higher performing interns to his house for dinner individually.  There I met his wife and we discussed my future career and my potential of being hired.  I had too much wine and when the night was over he drove me home.  In the car he basically said that he can give me everything I wanted If ""treated him right"" I just laughed it off and ignored him. He insisted that he walk me to the door... he somehow got into my apartment..  was very aggressive, and I dunno i just let him do what he wanted... it just happened.

Shortly thereafter I got hired. He acted as a mentor for me and really showed me guidance... however, I slept with him whenever he wanted. I had no issues with this because I thought to myself that the ends justify the means... he got me all the opportunities,  raises and promotions.....and I guess I even enjoyed the relationship. The worse part of it was the fact that I had become close with his family. His wife adored me, she would bake me cookies, we would go to the farmers market.... she treated me like a daughter. Meanwhile, I was sleeping with her husband. I did not date during this time.

Cut to now, the sex has stopped for about 2 years as I started seeing somebody who I'm now engaged to. He is now  a VP and is recommending me for a vacant VP position. In our last meeting he said, ""See, I told you I'd give you everything you wanted."" My whole life and career flashed before my eyes.  Would I be here If I didn't engage in this relationship? I felt sick to my stomach... Do I tell my fiance? Theyve met and hung out, played golf, etc...The messes up thing is I've only been with 3 men, my college BF, this Man, and my fiance... like it or not he is and has been a huge part of my life. No one knows about this relationship... I've managed to keep all my feelings down, but now it seems it's all bubbling to the surface."

Feel free to comment and thanks to this community to let people say thing they need to share. 

First of all, I have hearing disability.  This means that I have to wear prostheses, to hear better.  I am currently 26 years old and I started having them at around 19-20years old.  This had been a huge impact on me and my relationship to others, and I only realized this recently.  

I severely restricted my social interactions. Like I avoid to learn to know someone and let them know you. I avoid speaking or meeting people, and I found excuses for not going to class.  My grades dropped accordingly.  But at the same time I had a group of friends that I knew for a long time, with whom I often went out at night in bars.  these moments suited me because the people we met are ephemeral, it's dark, and especially when I drink I become much more sociable or rather I can be sociable again. 

So I started having a drinking problem. I don’t know how to explains this but it was much easier to go out drink talk about stupid thing than going regularly to school, doing group project, thinking about futur. It’s end up at the point that I was incapable of meeting someone in a common place or thinking about a social activity that doesn’t involve alcool. 

I was always shy with woman and it’s become worse with the hearing disability but when I’m drunk I’m way more fun otherwise I don’t talk much. 

At 23, I went in a weekend party with the same friends and I met a girl. It was the Saturday on the evening after the first party. I was with my friends and we were sit down next to a sound speaker (I don’t know the English word sorry) . the music was rock or punk. She came and she started doing what metal or punk people do when they hear rock music. And it was super cool. She end up sitting next to me. At a moment I ask her for the orange vodka bottle she had and we met like that. We spend all the evening just sit down listening the music, drinking, at a moment there was food and that’s it. Then I don’t remember really but we were dancing I kissed her and she brings me to her camping tent. It was my first time but I was not nervous because the evening with her was so cool. I didn’t told her that it was my first time. It’s became weird because after kissing session she just removed her clothes lay on the floor and it was like « come do your work now ». So I start, I was afraid to be too quick because I wanted her to enjoy but I think at a moment she was like « finish now ». But I stressed! (Even when I taught I was not stressing!). So I faked, after that I removed quickly and I removed the condoms to throw it outside the tent. When we left her tent it was the night (I met her around 3pm and when we left it was maybe 9pm). During diner we lost ourselves. So I went to eat with my friends. They were crazy because they knew that it was my first time. I never said to anyone that I simulated for my first time, I don’t know what to think about that. The next day one of my friends told me that she ask him to give me my teeshirt (don’t know what I was wearing at the diner). So maybe the sex wasn’t that bad, if she didn’t enjoyed it she could just have throw the teeshirt and not try to find me. 

Also on Monday she added me on Facebook to ask me if we used a condoms. Of course, but it means that she doesn’t know that I faked and that’s cool. So for her it was just casual sex and it’s for the best because if she knew that I faked it would be bad for her confident and I would feel extremely guilty. Also there’s hope now to meet her again. 

Couple of week after my college fired me because of my grades. I already lost one years so it was my last chance. It was a good college and I worked very hard to have it. I found another one not as good but still better than nothing.  I lost all my friends, was in a different city. I stopped drinking, going out. The first mouths i was crying frequently during night. I also didn’t want to meet new people and I just did all the school project alone. My marks was very good and I graduated. But the fact of being alone during two years, not talking often to people make me a very quiet guy. I didn’t wanted to start professional life because I was afraid. Like what I’m going to do ? Go to work every day, go home eat something, maybe play a game and sleep ? I don’t see myself capable of meeting new people after I saw all my friends stop talking to me after getting fired. I have no confidence with being with a woman since my first time. 

The company where I did my last internship proposed me to do a phd and I accepted because at least it will give a goal. It’s also in a different country so few chances to meet anyone from my previous college. 

TLTR:  prosthesis Since disability hearing became to difficult to live with it. Drinking problem after that. Met a girl was unable to finish and faked orgasm. Was fired from college find a new college, graduate. Started a PhD."

I recently finished university (UK) and have started a job as a grad software engineer (also UK working on VB rn which I hate). I feel that my coding, computer science and software knowledge are all severely lacking. Kinda feel ashamed I have this job title when there's plenty of good students out there who are far more competent. But I want to prove myself. And I'm looking for others who want the same. 

**Aims/Who I'm looking for:**

Open to all but only ""requirement"" ( not the best word choice)  is that you are aware of your limitations and lack of skills and want to do something about it. Ideally at the end of a two month period we're able to have a software project done like in an internship or something. After that hopefully we can keep on going and become more and more confident and proficient. 

I am also hoping to learn concepts taught at college/uni comp sci modules like algos/ DS etc etc ie more theoretical/mathematical stuff (all of the things I have no formal training of). 

Hopefully we can decide on a project quickly and then go about doing it!

Timezone obvs I'm in the UK so it would be preferable if you were in a similar timezone

**My languages and experience:**

C++ - a couple years - not delved properly into STL and OOP or used them in any real project. 

Python - did a year long project but again not delved deeply into OOP side

C# very much a beginner. 

Open to learning others; No proper linux exp; done some gitlab tutorials. 

**Time** \- can commit two hours in the evening and around 4/5 hours on both sat &amp; sunday but obvs willing to commit more thats just a basic estimate

Apologies for long post and thanks for reading!"
dqk7zj,442,2019-11-02,ExistingTonight’s Slutoween,ExistingTonight,stupidslutsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidslutsclub/comments/dqk7zj/existingtonights_slutoween/," Hello sluts, whores, fucktoys and all manner of deviants (just choose the moniker you prefer).

As promised, this is my entry for this slutoween, slutalloween, slutathon, whatever. For those few who are unaware of what I am talking about (shame on you), this event was brought to you by the god team in celebration of the SSC 200,000 subscriber milestone, an Halloween themed slut fest.

Of course, I as love to be a mindless slut at the whims of the god team, there was no way for me to refuse to partake! I also wanted to attempt the side goals of 20 people/acts, try something new I have never done, and act in true slut fashion by never saying no.

As things would have it, this event lined up with a week with a lot of free time for me. This was perfect as the 20 figure was kinda scary to attempt in a single night (maybe, I don’t deserve the right to call myself a slut?), so I opted instead to make things happens during the whole week climaxing with an Halloween night out on the 31st. This is a longer post, but bear with me please as I try to make it as succinct as possible.

## Monday, a slow start

Despite what I said about having a lot of free time this week, I still had a full work day on Monday. Now, here’s something most of you probably don’t know, there’s someone I hook up with on a regular basis at this job (for bonus slut point, he used to be my internship supervisor). How that came about is outside the scope of this post though. Needless to say, I thought about him to open up this week’s festivities. I sent him a message early that day to ask if we could grab lunch, making sure to include that I wanted to go with him alone, but I didn’t say the reason why. So, lunch time approached, we left together in his car. During the short car ride, I just straight up told him that I wanted to suck his dick, putting my hands on his thigh as I say it. Basically, just super forward. There was a need for a bit of convincing, him being a bit more vanilla, but stroking him through his pants got him to accept. We got to the small mall where the restaurants are and we parked in a remote spot a bit farther away from any prying eyes. I got on my knees on the passenger seat as he got his cock out, and I blew him. It was neither sloppy, slow nor sensual, rather, it was a methodical, fast blow job to get him to fill my mouth as fast as possible. He showered me with praises and compliments (as he always does) while cumming. I swallowed his hot cum before we went along as if nothing had happened for the rest of the day.

At some point during the day I texted Jay, another guy I hook up with from time to time. We set up to meet later in the evening. Now, unlike the work guy, Jay has no problem acting out stuff with me. If I want a rough fuck, he is my go to (last time we met, he left bruises on my ass that took almost a week to heal). With him, I wanted to try “lying on my back with my head off the bed as he face fuck me” position. I don’t know how it’s called, but I am sure you know what I am talking about. This also needed to be a faster hook up because he told me he had something later that evening. I get to his place, he is already there, we do not talk much except that I tell him about the position I want to try. Couples minutes in, we are getting naked and feeling each other up. I blew him to get him hard and went straight into position. This was something new for me. He grabbed my head, put his dick in my mouth, and he just went to town. Because of the position, I felt like I couldn’t swallow, I could barely breathe, so every chance I got to take some air in, I had to first spit, which would just gets on my face more and more. Him being himself and knowing how to treat me, every time I would gag, cough or try to get him to slow down, he would let me, but reward me with some insults and slaps across my face or boobs. He ended up cumming in my mouth too, but as you can imaging, I couldn’t swallow it and had to spit it out on my own face coughing. I was a sorry mess. Afterward, just to please me, as the gentleman he is, he got me up and holding me by my throat, he finger banged me until I came all over his fingers. This was the end of that, I washed up and went home to relax before my next day’s adventures.

To summarize: 2 guys; 2 blowjobs, 1 off the bed facefuck (which was new and pretty fun), 1 fingerbanging

## Tuesday, a date to remember

Tuesday came around, I had nothing on my agenda except for a “date” in the evening (more on that later). Having a mostly completely free day meant that I had ample time to have some fun, so I decided to go to the mall. This time, I choose to dress with only leggings and a hoodie with a front zipper, nothing underneath it. My idea was to flash some people along the way. Second time I even attempted the mall challenge and it was as daunting as the first time if I am being honest. It was the same mall as last time, but I still decided to check for some good spot. Without going into much details, some guys I flashed first, some I would approach and talk to first, got rejected most of times but still got a lot of guys to smile and give me compliments. I hooked up with my first guy at Walmart, he was in the clothes section. I flashed him first, he stared and smiled. I went to him and told him I would suck his cock if he ever felt like trying on clothes. We went to the dressing room, I removed my hoodie and let him play with my boobs for a little while as I got his cock out and stroked it. Got on my knees and gave him a blowjob all the while playing with myself and letting him fondle my chest. He came in my mouth and I swallowed, and we parted ways soon after. A little while later, I was checking some stuff out at a pharmacy and was mindlessly playing with the zipper on my hoodie, it’s a bit of a reflex that I have. I spotted this guy checking me out and I went to him, introduced myself and made small talk and flirted a bit as we waited to pay for our stuff. When we got out of the pharmacy, I told him about the emergency staircase that I knew wasn’t far and told him I wanted to meet him there for a quick hook up. We went there and things went pretty much like with the first guy, hoodie off, me playing with myself as I sucked him while he fondled me. When he told me he was close, I decided to finish him off on my chest though. It was incredibly hot to have him jack off on me while I was playing with myself and begging for his cum. He shot a good few ropes on my chest and we went our different way when we got out of the staircase. I could feel the cum on my chest slowly cooling down, it was around 16h00, and I needed to get home for my “date” so I decided to end it there and cumwalk home, which was an incredible mix of crippling anxiousness as I was sure people could smell the cum on me, but super exciting at the same time to be so horny drunk to actually do something like that. Got home, took a shower and waited for my “date”.

So, this “date” was actually a evening with my friend Amy and her boyfriend, will call him Ben. Ever since we live together her and I, I always made a point to make myself known when she was fooling around with Ben, because it’s hot and funny. We would often talk about it afterward. Both of them found it super hot to fuck knowing I was listening and masturbating in the next room. We even talked threesome from time to time, but always in a joking manner. By now I am sure you all know what this “date” is about, I had brought the idea up earlier during the week end. I could write an entire post on this night alone, so for the sake of brevity, I’ll only gloss over the whole night. Amy decided to be the devil I know herself to be. She choose what I would wear (a low cut black dress), but I had a surprise for her in the form of a butt plug. She picked me up from our place to go to Ben’s. He made us dinner, we ate, drank a bit and smoked a bit of weed, just to get a good groove going. It didn’t take long for us to get frisky, we all knew what we were up to. She was ordering me around, to dance for them, to get naked and to suck him as she watched. When she saw the plug though, she went straight to it and toyed with it with an evil grin on her face, good thing I brought the lube with me cause she wasn’t gentle with it. At some point she made me watch them fuck and she ordered me not to touch myself. We tried the double blowjob for him. There was this moment when I was on my back, Ben was fucking me while Amy was sitting on my face. It was rather strange at first to actually have sex with her, and do stuff with her as I do not consider myself attracted to women, but it was fun even if she told me I am bad at eating pussy. She was also encouraging him to be rougher and rougher with me, but the worst I got was from her actually, he nails digging into my breasts and ass as she ordered Ben to fuck me harder and harder. The evening proceeded like that on and off, one of us taking a pause as the other two continued to fool around. There was even a single moment when I found myself kissing and groping Amy for the only sake of Ben’s enjoyment. Great time all around, orgasm where given a plenty, and I am sure we’ll revisit the experience.

To summarize: 2 guys, 2 blowjobs, 1 cumwalk (a first for me), and 1 FFM threesome (also a first). For a partial total of 6 person and 3 new acts. 

## Wednesday, a preparatory night out

Wednesday was also a full work day for me. Unlike Monday, I didn’t call on my coworker to fool around for various reasons, so I didn’t do anything during the day. I already had plans to go out to the club though. I actually didn’t know if they would have something planned for Halloween on that night, but for the sake of it, I went disguised anyway. For monetary reasons, I decided to go ultra conservative as far as costume go, meaning, a slutty school girl uniform. I already had everything needed at home, mini skirt (check), white blouse (check), high socks (check), contrasting undergarments (check) and pigtails (check). Turns out there was only some decoration and people were invited to come wearing costumes but that’s all. 

I walked and prowled the club with my barely buttoned blouse, exposing most of my chest, basically screaming that I was DTF. I would get all sorts of looks, from thirsty guys wanting some, from incredulous people just staring, from more conservative girls being consterned by my overt sluttyness, and from other girls that also took the opportunity of dressing up to be a bit more slutty. I gathered some attention, which in that situation was a turn on. Got offered drinks more than once and talked to more people than I can count.

The first guy to get me going wasn’t wearing a costume, he was flirty and physical right out the gate, touching my ass even before asking my name. I let him do his tricks on me cause that’s what I was there for. His car was in an underground parking lot not far from the club, so we went there for a quick fuck. On the backseat of his car, we didn’t even undress and just fucked until we both had our fill. Meaning I came on his dick and he came in me. Afterward he wanted me to go back to his place, but I refused, instead going back to the club.

Back at the club, met some people here and there, drank and danced with a few different guys, letting the more daring ones fondle me on the dance floor. Letting each of them get me ever so horny one after the other until I brought the last one to the bathroom to suck him off as I touched myself, swallowed him whole before leaving him in the dust gathering looks from the drunk guys in the bathroom. 

Back at it, even more drinks and socializing. I was talking to this guy when I realized the hour was getting late, so we left together. We went to his place where we proceeded to have a drunken fuck session. It was alright, but nothing to fret about. I called a cab and went home after that. Took a shower and crashed in my bed at around 02h30.

To summarize: 3 guys, 2 drunken fucks, 1 semi-public blowjob. For a partial total of 9 person and 2 new acts.

## Thursday, being spooked

Woke up to my alarm at 06h30 because that’s were the stupid comes into play. I had an appointment with my trainer at the gym at 08h00 and I was still hazy from the night before. Took another shower, had a big breakfast with an energy drink and went to the gym hating my life choices. The rest of the day was spent trying to get myself on my feet as much as possible because I couldn’t not go out, this was THE day after all. I knew of this party that was happening at this apartment through a public Facebook invitation that was going around the uni.

I went there at around 22h00, dressing in my slutty school girl attire. Similarly to the previous night, I gathered all kind of attention, got offered some drink but mainly drank the bottle of wine I had brought with me. I met with some people I know from uni, talked about our classes and stuff like that, pretty standard considering the setting. Of course, energy was a bit low for me, but I still wanted to get stuff done.

At some point, I was trying to get it on with this cute guy but we were interrupted by this older guy. Now, that night wasn’t my best night out, and it was mostly because of him, I’ll call him OD for old douche. OD is the typical guy in his late 30s who, for some reason, always end up at every uni party despite having finished studying more than ten years ago. Obviously single, sporting a dad bod worthy of the dictionary, there trying to catch some vibe from his golden days, and hitting on every girl that he sees. I had seen him at other party before, but that night, it seems I was his target. Despite my best effort of eluding him; going into the bathroom, another apartment, or outside to get some air, he would always find me somehow and insert himself in my conversations.

I know part of the challenge was not to say no, but there’s a limit to what this tired, drunken slut will endure. I simply didn’t want to hook up with OD. I tried to tell him off calmly at first, but he wouldn’t understand, so after a while, I got more aggressive, but he never got the message.

In the end, I was able to talk to a guy long enough to propose we go to his place, we did and we proceeded to have very disappointing drunken sex. So disappointing we didn’t even finish before he nodded off. Took a taxi home, got myself off in the shower and got into bed.

Thanks OD! 

In conclusion: 10 person total and 3 new acts for a total of 13/20, 65% which is above the passing grade in most cases. I hope that’s enough to keep my slut title?

Also, fuck OD. Don’t be like OD. He ruined what should have been the highlight of this week.

As a side note, that threesome was the most fun I had in awhile, so doing that again!"

Well other than your own of course, another squeal passing through your lips as another spurt shot out of your tiny dicklet, as if anything so small could be called manhood. You told yourself once again, you weren't gay, this wasn't you it was all the drug coursing through your system. You were just faking it in order to not upset your new daddy so other people didn't find out. This wasn't you. It wasn't you groaning as the feeling of his fingers digging into your thighs sent spider webs of pleasure throughout your cheeks and legs. It wasn't you when gargled and suckled on his balls after you got him alone. It wasn't you when you began grinding against his cock when you saw him in the club. It wasn't you tightening your grip into the unwashed sheets of this backwater hotel. It wasn't you who curled your toes, shuddered and lost your breath at the sound of his balls clapping against your backside. It wasn't you who [Laid Yourself On Your Back](https://imgur.com/a/9SW7Izo) and begged your father's best friend to fill you up with all his virile seed. 

And it certainly wasn't you right now. Pleading ""M-More, God please give me...give me-me it all!"" Shrieking out in pleasure, your eyes glazing over as they flung themselves back, your tongue sticking out as you had the fourth bitch breaking orgasm of the session rock through you, covering yourself in sissy seed as he filled your ass with a real man's load. By the time you had come back from a high that not even meth could give, he had already gotten himself dressed and began walking out after using you like a piece of fuckmeat. All you could mutter out in time was. 

""Please don't...don't tell anyone."" This was only the end of the first week. 

*3 Months Later.* 

You couldn't imagine how things got so out of control, it was one 'mistake', one night. Yet here you were standing in front of mirror not even being able to recognize [Yourself](https://imgur.com/a/s7lCqmo), Not only that but you somehow had dragged your whole family into this mess and they were in the same position as you were. Your whole life completely turned upside down, from a young man with a bright future, to being a sex doll for any man within a two mile radius. How did this all happen? It was because of one man, a man who had been making your life a living hell ever since your first day in college. 

Jack Hordsteff was any manlet's worse nightmare and most women's filthiest wet dream, being the star quarterback of MU or Metamorphosis University, giving him all the strings to play you or anyone else like a puppeteer. So of course he was invited or at least found out about your best friend's party and of course you couldn't leave. At first things went as you expected...if not a little better, Jack mostly ignored you, even bought you a drink, it was honestly shocking to you, but of course that good will was misplaced as he laced your drink with a BM pill, or Bitch Maker Pill as it's known. That's not it's real name of course but it's what everyone began naming it once it came out six months ago. The pill effects your entire body, your senses, your mind and your body. Your senses are the first to be effected, touch especially, increasing pleasure ten times over to the degree no whore could ever fake something like it, smell and taste also changing to make you desire cock more, the delicious taste and hypnotic scent. Mentally you have full agency thankfully, but the temptation is greater than any other, like when Eve took the apple, it just looked too sweet. It would slowly change your mind however, making you crave more and more cock, making you hornier and slowly changing your personality, not entirely but to a degree. Whether it be towards a more submissive or bratty angle. Finally it changed your body, it would go from the androgynous if not feminine appearance to growing into a body a bimbo would be jealous of. It would take time of course, even a miracle drug like this doesn't work immediately and you'd need to take a dose every day. 

So why didn't you just stop taking it after it was spiked in a drink? Well Jack made sure to find you in the bathroom and fuck you like the toy you are, recording it on his phone while doing so. Sure he had to overpower you to do it at first(not that it was difficult.), but quickly during it you lost yourself to the addictive pleasure of Real Dick. Using it as black mail against you, so you would need to do everything he said, which would go from blowing him in the locker room, to blowing thirty men in a glory hole. You hated every second of it... or so you told yourself, but we both knew sooner or later you would break, not from just the need, the desire and pleasure, but overall. To accept who you are, who you were meant to be. This is you. 

He didn't stop with you however, your [Sister](https://imgur.com/a/gb2tP80) was next. An upstanding and quickly rising lawyer in her firm, she was also a dedicated advocate for feminism. Yet she was broken over time just like you, turned into a bimbo, being fucked in front of you as she moans as loudly as you do. Sucking on Jack's balls as he does it. Your mother, having a wild life when she was younger but settling down with your father over time. She'll probably be the easiest, having the taste of fat cock in only her memories, there's no such thing as a reformed slut after all. Your big brother would be the next, he was always the more athletic of the two of you, having taught you everything you knew about exercise, I'm sure we could put his stamina to **Very** good use. How about your father, the man you always saw as a bastion of strength and masculinity, when in reality he was just a small, limped dick man who only got with your mother because she was done with her glory days. Forcing him to kneel and suck on cock will certainly be heart breaking for you...or perhaps uplifting. 

Either way [Bringing The Family Together](https://imgur.com/a/fAYQXkr) is always heartwarming right?

Tell me all your kinks, favorite kinks and limits. I'm looking for a long term partner for this one, someone who doesn't mind playing as multiple characters as you'll be playing the family while I'm fucking them, though I don't mind sharing control over them outside of sexual encounters. I'll be mainly controlling all of the men who fuck your character including my main Jack. I like to use alot of pictures of reference during RPing, I only expect what I give and if you aren't used to doing so I can certainly help. Send your pictures of reference for how you see your character ending up looking throughout the different stages. My average response length is 3-5 paragraphs, they don't need to be massive seven liners, just enough to put in effort and detail. Though I can go higher, I prefer to stay at a level where we can both respond at steady rate when we have free time. 

Tell me about your character, like are you a part of a rich family or a poor one(I won't lie I lean toward your family having money as it will be all the more satisfying to bring them all down a peg)? What kind of slut will you become, a complete submissive or one that knows what she wants and takes it? A high class courtesan slut or a night on your back in the police car, or perhaps a porn star or dirty cosplayer? Do you have a day job like waiter, or an internship? What is your relationship with your family, are you the golden boy, the black sheep or something in between? Which family member are you closet to, do you idolize your father as a showing what you imagined masculinity was, are you a complete momma's boy, or do you have a better relationship with your sister/brother? It could be a mixture of a lot of them. Do you want to go full blown incest in this prompt, like seducing your father/older brother when he doesn't recognize you, making out over a cock with your sister/mother, ect. Do you have a girlfriend to be stolen away from you? Give me any ideas you may have, or some things you may want to twist. It can be anything whether incorporating a certain kink, fantasy elements or characters. 

I want to discuss this before we begin so having a love of world/character building is a huge bonus.  

**The more effort you put in the more likely you'll get a response. Effort is prioritized over speed of response, and any response with a significant amount of effort will be responded to no matter how long it has been. Use PM's not chats.** 

Kinks-mindbreak, redheads, non/dubcon, cock and ball worship, blowjobs, deep throating, cumflation/pleasureflation, forced bimbofication/feminization, corruption, cumplay, raceplay, sub/dom. spanking, heavy dirty talk, orgasm control/forced, multiple orgasm, big tits/ass, dry grinding/lapdance, obsession/affection, chokers/collars. maid/leather outfits, stockings, humiliation/degrading, Bitchy but Enthusiastic sluts. Power Bottoms. Seduction. incest, rough, ahegao, cucking And more.

If you want kinks like raceplay, cucking, being a switch or romance/affection, we'll need to discuss these especially considering how much they can change in the story.

These are my plans to try and improve my SMV, while pushing myself. I'd like insight from you guys. These are the 10 main things I'm focusing on for this year. If I fully committed to these, I would have 10 hours left in a week to ""waste time""/""have fun"" while still sleeping 9h/day. Some of these 10 things would be considered fun anyways though.

**(1) Lifting 3 times a week &amp; eating healthy** (spaced out for recovery, intense full body workout for 30 min to 1 hour, quick cardio warm-up and cool-down, chewing food slowly, more veggies and protein &amp; little to no over-eating)

**(2) Meditation 3 times a week** (short 15 minute sessions, right now I'm getting into a kuru meditation class so I can pick up the basics, being mindful in daily life)

**(3) 3 approaches, 3 times a week** (total of 9 approaches a week, 15m max per approach to leave them wanting, spaced out so I can digest the experiences)

**(4) Going out to 2 events a week minimum** (practising social theory to have fun &amp; meet people who I vibe with, the two events are to socialise while still focusing on my goals ex. networking event, computer science event, marketing club event, or a music event, SOMETHING RELATED TO MY PURPOSE SO I'M FOCUSED)

**(6) Therapy once a month** (my therapist told me I don't have any problems that stand out, so I use the sessions for meditation advice and an emotional outlet, and insight from someone older who has more emotional awareness)

**(5) Studying 3-4 hours a day. 1 hour a day on a business hobby** (LINKEDIN + WEBSITE RIGHT NOW, making sure my college grades are up to par, and either building up my linked-in page, making a website, or executing a business side-project and slowly building a team through the people I meet at events for my business hobby. I have two other hobbies (music and writing) which I've put to the side for now because I've noticed that doing too much at once will lead to paralysis and getting nothing done. The time for those will come I feel, as I build more life experience and have more mental bandwidth.

**(6) 1h30 a day on chores.** (haircut, renewing cards or paying bills/fees, dealing with tax forms/cheques, buying things/clothes on amazon, cleaning up the room &amp; throwing out trash, washing clothes, refreshing on driving before my driver's test or even treating that as a break, checking emails &amp; signing up for activities to add to my calendar, checking my network and setting up meet-ups etc.)

**(7) If dates don't flop, then I'm going to invite chicks to events/places I'm already planning on going to** (if I'm already planning on going somewhere or doing something fun, I'll invite the chick to that. If they fuck up my good vibes, they can fuck off tbh because as you can see from the stuff I put up, my time is limited anyways. This whole chick thing is more for self-improvement, but if I get a chance to escalate I'll go for it, no rationalizing.)

**(8) Self-help videos and pdfs while I take the bus to class** (listening to ToddV, RSDTyler, CharismaOnCommand, Eckhart Tolle, Book Summaries etc. with my earphones on or reading self-help pdfs, but I'll take the earphones off when outside of the bus, so I can notice opportunities to speak to people and just be present. If I see a rare opportunity on the bus, I'll go for it though.)

**(9) Hygiene &amp; Fashion 45m a day** (this already became a habit and doesn't really feel like a chore. Showering feels good. It feels nice to feel and look fresh. Cutting nails or trimming hairs takes 20 mins at most. I put on my contacts after showering, and I'm starting to develop some styles that fit my look and my significant drop in weight since lifting).

**(10) Meeting up with mentors/partners 2 times a week, 2h at a time** (this isn't likely happening anytime soon, only until I start building up my business side project and linkedin network. But it's going to happen eventually and I'd like to account for it.

**Logistics:** BUSING TO SCHOOL (KNOWING WHEN BEST TO USE EARPHONES), UBER WHEN IT'S LATE, STAYING AROUND IN PLACES WITH PEOPLE, AND NOT STAYING UP TOO LATE BECAUSE I'LL ISOLATE MYSELF.

**Goals:** website/linkedin and finding a business idea (a niche problem that's scalable), being present/grounded, can manoeuvre myself in social groups, GPA over 80%, 180 pounds and close to ripped, 50 approaches, better fashion and more fitting, one programming project

Wasting time or having fun (outside of fun events, lifting, meditation, or the business hobby):

(1) Allowing myself only 2 days/week to spend a 2-3h reading self-help articles, the news, or posting on reddit.

(2) Skimming through interesting movie clips, documentaries, podcasts (ex. joe rogan), or comedians (ex. dave chappelle, bill burr) or shows (curb your enthusiasm, black mirror, rick and morty).

(3) Taking walks to ground myself and self-reflect

(4) Taking naps in the middle of the day

(5) Making a song for fun as an emotional outlet. Nothing serious, I don't do this much because I'm busy.

(6) Talking to friends on discord or facebook or texting people, mostly logistics  (I barely have friends these days that are close).

(7) Checking up on family and showing that I care so they feel good. It doesn't really do much for me but I do it so I don't feel guilty. Also good social and empathy practice.

(8) Maybe travelling this summer.

(9) Getting a full-time internship job in the summer. Maybe a good opportunity to travel and live alone."

I recently upgraded my desktop and was going to install my GTX 750ti in my server to speed up the image stitching I do on it, but I ran into problems.  I bought a gpu psu cord (10 pin --&gt; 8(6+2) pin) and plugged that into my gpu and the only 10 pin motherboard slot I saw (didn't know if there was a specific gpu 10 pin slot but I couldn't find that info online). Then I plugged the gpu into the PCI-e 2.0, 8 x 16 slot on my riser. I've read that you should see no display from your integrated graphicsanymore and would have to plug your monitor into your gpu instead. I had no visuals coming out from my gpu, but when I plugged my monitor in my server's integrated graphics it had visuals. I also checked the system devices and didn't see the gtx 750ti. 

Here are the specs If it helps:

* dual AMD Opteron 6238 (2.60 GHz/12-core/16MB/115 W TDP) Processors."

I legitimately feel like every facet of my life is ruined, and I don’t know what to do. So far, my 2019 has consisted of:

1. Losing my job. I worked there for 2.5 months when my pay stopped coming. I continued working for another month, being told each week that I’ll get paid, and never seeing a dime. I tried calling lawyers for consultations, but I can’t afford any of the fees. 

2. Moving into the hood. We literally live in one of the most dangerous cities in the US, so it’s rough. There’s constantly gun shots everywhere, drunk/high people meandering down the streets who yell at me to get out of their neighborhood, trash everywhere, and 2 of my neighbors have died in the last couple months. The house is roach infested and falling apart and disgusting no matter how much I clean it. I literally came home a week ago to a neighbor pacing the front yard with an automatic rifle in his hand. We also haven’t been able to get enough money together to buy any furniture, so we sleep on a mattress on the floor, which doubles as our table to eat at as it’s literally the only thing in the house. This makes it really embarrassing to invite people over, so we don’t
 
3. Applying to every job I have the slightest qualification for week after week, and getting rejection email after rejection email. I finally got an internship offer that begins in January, but now I can’t find anything I can do for the next 2 months

4. Becoming completely financially dependent on my husband. He was supposed to be making $600-700/wk at his new job and has only been getting $260/wk, which we can’t live off of. However, he’s struggling to find work because he didn’t finish high school, and he can’t get his GED until we’re more stable. Meanwhile as someone who used to work 2 jobs and go to school full time, I feel useless and I’m going crazy sitting in our little empty room all day and night

5. Losing 20+ lbs each, constantly feeling nauseous and irritable, getting chronic migraines and diarrhea, etc. as a result of being so hungry all the time. Losing my mind scraping nickels out of the floorboards to buy stuff off the dollar menu. Making his mother cry when she video called us from home for the first time in a while because we ‘look like skeletons’

6. Always being out of necessities like toothpaste, toilet paper, and shampoo. Wearing dirty clothes because I can’t afford to get to the laundromat half the time, let alone pay for the soap/machines. Not being able to shave or get a haircut or buy new bras (old ones too big now from weight loss) or replace worn out clothes or just ANYTHING that makes you feel like a human being

7. Being in a car accident that completely totaled our only car. Our insurance paid off the car and we were left with no money at all for a new down payment, so now our monthly payments are ridiculously high and someone’s probably going to come take the new car from all the missed/late payments

8. My husband breaking multiple bones in his hand. Watching and listening to him in pain, seeing him go through multiple surgeries, and trying to help him face the fact that he may be permanently disabled and lose full control over his dominant hand. Going $15k (and counting) into debt as he has no insurance

9. Being disowned and shunned by hateful family members who don’t like my husbands racial/religious background 

10. Watching my marriage deteriorate because no human being can go through all of this without becoming someone they don’t recognize. Yelling, fighting, blaming each other even though we’re all we have

11. Feeling helpless as my family falls apart and parents inch towards divorce. Feeling helpless when my tough guy husband cries because both of his parents are slowly and painfully dying overseas and we can’t afford to help them. Feeling helpless as my baby sister calls over and over again, wanting to see her and help her with my dysfunctional/toxic family because I know exactly what she’s going through, but not being able to explain that I don’t even have the gas to make it to her house, or anywhere else. Feeling helpless as friends call and call and call and finally stop calling. Feeling helpless as we take turns having mental breakdowns, then take turns consoling each other. Knowing that I’m lying through my teeth when I tell him everything will be okay. Knowing that he’s lying when he says the same and trying to believe him anyway. Isolating myself more and more, never doing any of my old hobbies, and not knowing what to do as I see the same happen to my husband. Wanting to save each other from the same thing, alternating between blaming ourselves and blaming each other

12. Coming home yesterday to two windows busted in, our house destroyed, and almost everything we owned gone. The microwave, AC window units, TV and xbox/games (literally the only material pleasure we still had, we spent years building up our game collection before going broke), my beloved electric bass and amp from high school, all of our jewelry (including my wedding ring, the beautiful ring my father-who I have a very strained relationship with-gave me when I graduated, a bracelet my childhood best friend gave me, and more), all of my purses, some of our clothes and shoes, and probably more I haven’t noticed since I can’t make myself go back and start cleaning up

I’ve tried therapy, but I could only do a few sessions until I couldn’t afford it anymore. I already have a really bad history of mental illness (depression, anxiety, PTSD) from a history of abuse. All of this feels like a joke. I’ve been suffering for my entire life—toxic family, abusive exes, childhood sexual trauma, etc. I thought that getting out on my own would fix everything. Now I’m already thousands in debt, about to flunk out of college and lose my scholarships, overdue on $1.5k of bills for this month alone, starving and sick, and on the verge of killing myself. I’m so mentally unstable I feel like anything can set me off into complete hysterics. Now everything I owned that had even the slightest value is gone too, plus a lot of other stuff that wasnt that valuable but priceless to me in sentiment. And of course there were no fingerprints, and none of the neighbors will talk to the police, and my city doesn’t even care because this happens to people in my type of neighborhood all the time. I’m a good person dammit, I do my best. I am religious so I try to tell myself that it’s all a test and it’ll be over soon, but I’ve been telling myself that for a really long time now. 

But I guess that’s it. I know no one here can help me. Just wanted to get this out somewhere."

I’m not too sure how to go about building that confidence. 
Right now, I’m feeling pretty blue to be perfectly honest. I have SAD and I’m pretty lonely on top of that (we have no face to face classes and I’m painfully shy, so the other interns and I don’t really get too many chances to see each other). I’m just not mentally feeling the best, and I’ve had struggles with self confidence to begin with. I know I can “fake it till I make it” with confidence, but that can only get me so far without genuine confidence. I think I’m also too fixated on not making any mistakes, but at the same time I know the internship is the time to make mistakes and learn.
I guess I’m too much of a perfectionist with little confidence looking for any advice? I really want to feel comfortable during counseling."

“Straight” Guys is a mostly gay series featuring closeted or secretive males who act as heterosexuals who turn out to be gay or bi. This story may or may not be fictional and does not use aesthetic names whatsoever. Thus, I, the author, uses Alan to refer myself. For better experience I suggest reading the series from the beginning starting with the [Pilot](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/cq80k5/me_and_the_three_straight_guys_part_1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) episode, thank you!

*{Character(s)’ Backstory}*

My elder brother is 5 years older than me. At the time when I was 17, he was 22. He was going through his internship and he befriended a colleague. That colleague of his was named Zane. They became close, and Zane used to visit us a lot to hang out with my brother. 

Zane was semi-muscular. He had this thick black hair and a little facial hair under his chin. He was attractive all on his own without looking at his body. He looked as if John Cena and Marilyn Monroe had a son. 

We actually got to know each other every time the three of us play video games together on weekends. Sometimes, my mother would ask my brother to run some errands, leaving me and him to play games like FIFA and PES. Thus, the topic of sports became a conversation.

For a fact, he was actually a professional football (known as soccer for you Americans) player in school. I had to tell him that I wasn’t quite athletic, but was quite good in tennis. When he was gone, I’d take the chance to stalk his social media profiles and I spotted various hot pictures of him in tight jerseys and shorts. Since his Twitter was private and he accepted me to Follow, I was able to save a photo of him in his underwear, and it turned me on so much to know that the sexy man was often beside me.

However, he wasn’t any good in the video game. Sometimes my brother would get jealous of how close I would get with Zane, and how I rarely had brotherly moments with him anymore. Little did he know that I didn’t only want to get close to Zane in a brotherly way, but in a sexual way instead.

But I sort of dropped that feeling. Even if I find out he was gay, I didn’t wanna accidentally get in the way of my brother’s friendship and I didn’t want it to be awkward between us. That still didn’t stop me from thinking about him when I’m masturbating. The important thing was that I had the picture of him shirtless in bed after he had fucked his girl of which he posted on twitter for odd reasons.

Other than that, it was because he told me that he knew one of my friends, Graham. He had said that the both of them works out at the same gym and are sometimes gym partners. At that very moment, I started fantasising about how amazing their sex would be. Just two sexy boys on top of each other. 

*{Story}*

One day, the three of us were in our room; yes, _our_ room. Me and my brother were roommates. The three of us including Zane had just finished playing a game when my mother called my brother from downstairs to run some errands for her. Zane had followed him because he wanted to buy some things too. Thus, I was alone in the room and was playing FIFA on my own. 

A few minutes went by, and I went into the bathroom which was in my room for a piss. Right after I flushed, I heard the door open and close. They were back, I thought, yet it sounded like there were only one person’s footsteps entering the room. 

I opened the bathroom door very slowly only to see Zane, sitting on the foot of my bed, with, his pants off. You see, the positions of our beds were simple, there were two. My brother’s bed was against the wall that had a window, and mine was beside the door whereas in front of it was the bathroom door. I had spotted that the door was locked, so no one could barge in while his lower body was in the way of it.

He was in fact, wanking, probably thinking I went out for a few minutes or simply thought nobody was in the room. My jaw just dropped as I stare at Zane, stroking his 7 inch cock slowly. It extremely aroused me to see the hot man rubbing his cock slowly in front of my eyes. His right hand was on his penis and the other was holding his phone horizontally.

I began to receive an erection as I kept the bathroom door open with a small gap which allowed me to see enough of it. Seeing how Zane was so focused on masturbating to something on his phone, I decided that it was not very visible for him if I whip my knob out. I started jacking off to my brother’s friend, whose bare ass was on the foot of my bed. 

It had occurred to me that it was my first time being turned on by someone who had not even took off their shirt. Zane was special. I was just attracted to his lower body after all. His hairy legs and his meaty thighs. His veiny arms which supported his hand to stroke his massive cock. I was pumping my own rhythmically with his pumps as he started to moan lightly. 

A few minutes later, he started to jack off faster, and was moaning louder. At last, he came. However, right before he ejaculated his semen all over the floor, he had yelled a name that triggered my brain.

“Graham!” he had moaned before launching his thick load. 

Graham? My friend, Graham? His gym partner? I thought he proved the point that he was straight? Then it struck me. Graham was Zane’s gym partner. They’re both attractive and charming. Especially his post on Twitter itself was related to it. The photo I saved of him shirtless in bed whereas his caption was, “Had a good time banging my G.”

I simply thought that he meant his G as in, ‘his girl’ but that wasn’t the case. He was fucking my muscular friend and the thought of the concept itself made me cum all over the bathroom walls. I had waited in there for almost an hour, not knowing what to do other than wait for him to leave. It was cute, seeing him clean his mess and lying down on MY bed, half naked. 

When he left to go downstairs, I had followed him 5 minutes after. He asked where I was, worried if I had snooped on him but my excuse was that I was in my parents’ room, helping my father with a problem on his phone. 

It has been years ever since it happened, and I’ve kept it to myself without telling anybody, not even Graham himself. Now, Zane and my brother parted ways as they work in different companies but they still keep in contact occasionally. The memory of watching him masturbate still lies in my head."
dqnjba,1,2019-11-02,Is it ethical to leverage a job offer for a promotion?,therealconjon,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dqnjba/is_it_ethical_to_leverage_a_job_offer_for_a/,"So, to explain my entire situation I have a decently long story to tell. I hope you'll stick with it and help me to know if I can use a job offer for a promotion.

So, first, I am 20 years old and have a year and a half left in college. I am graduating in early 2020 with a bachelor's in Cyber Security.  I work full time for my company and also take full-time online classes. 

I started working for this mid-size company in late 2017 as an intern for the IT department. This company has about a thousand employees and is a healthcare facility. Before I was hired the Directory was a Network Administrator and she was promoted to Director when the previous Director retired, let's call this new directory Susan. Not long after I started as an Intern Susan, as the new director, hired a friend of hers to fill her previous position, his name is Dominic.

Within a few months of working as an intern, I was asked to work full time as an IT Help Desk Technician by Susan. I would be working with one other Technician that I was helping as the intern. They showed me a decent pay rate of $16.78/hr. I accepted and started to work full time. At first it was great, I was making decent money for my age and I enjoyed my job. A month later, the Director fired my co-worker for no really good reason. He messed up an on-call call and made an issue last slightly longer than it would have. In all hindsight talking to the companies COO a while ago, he shouldn't have been let go. 

At this point, I am doing the work of what should be two people and it was awful. I was given a 40 cent raise for the yearly review at this time as well. But Susan started to show her true colors. She was very arrogant and callous. She constantly micromanaged my every move. She would call me and ask what I am doing. I would answer and she would tell me what to do, even though it was the incorrect way to fix the current issue. She would tell me to shut up and to do what she says because she was smarter than I was. I was the only Help Desk Technician for 2 and a half months. And those two and a half months were some of the worst in my life, I wanted to quit, but I decided to stick with it. After this amount of time, they hired another person to help me and he's still here today. 

This other technician and I made a good team. Since he was new, he often asked me for help on the more advanced issues. Since we were both handling separate tickets I would often trade his tickets and take the more difficult time-consuming ones and give him easier ones. Once I figured out what was wrong I would then show him how to fix it in the future. 

A month after Susan hired the new help desk technician, she brought me into her office and showed me a chart of ticket closings. I was at 248 for the month while Jon was at 350. I explained to her that I was taking more of the time-consuming tickets and that is the reason for the discrepancy. She didn't care and wrote me up telling me to catch up to him or I would be let go. 

At this point, I was applying to other positions at other companies. One of these companies IT Directors I guess knew Susan, and told her of my application. She confronted me, I explained I wasn't happy at this company. She said she wished me the best and said she thought it was best and then encouraged me to leave saying ""I think you should leave, if you are unhappy here then you should go somewhere else"". She also took this information and announced it at our IT meeting in front of all the other employees. 

However, I was never given any callbacks. I suspect to this day that she put the word out to many of her friends and colleagues and to anyone who called in that I was a terrible employee and that is why I never received a single callback. 

As a help desk technician, I was required to take an on-call week every few weeks. And we would get paid our hours by submitting an excel sheet to the directory. I found out that she NEVER entered any of my on-call hours I submitted and I asked her about it. She said she did and that I am mistaken. But clearly she didn't know how on-call worked or she was withholding. I then showed her the pay stubs and the excel documents submitted and explained how I have never been completely compensated for my name, and I know this is partially my fault for not catching these mistakes when the timecards came around for review. She then tells me to find all my excel sheets and resubmit them, even though she should have them all in her own email. 

I send her the sheets and she brings it to HR and asks to compensate me for only about 50% of the hours I sent her. I ask her and she says that she thinks this is fair. I live in the USA, and I know this is illegal, I was about to quit but a co-worker convinced me to go talk to HR before I do. I type up a two-page list of things that Susan had done and take it to the HR director. I have a meeting with the director of HR and tell her everything that Susan has done and other things I suspect she has done. The HR director thanks me for my time and tells me she would look into this. She talks to other co-workers of mine and other directors who have experience around Susan. 2 weeks later the IT department is informed that she was let go. Apparently, they found she was also abusing her company credit card. 

Now her friend, the one I told you about earlier, who was now the Network Administrator, stepped up to the interim director.  And he gave me most of his duties, I was taking care of issues that should never have been given to a Help Desk Technician, but I am grateful he did because it gave me good experience and understanding of the system at this company. A few months after this, we are informed that he was fired because he was pawning company laptops, about 35k worth. He was arrested and is going through court hearings still. 

My Help Desk co-worker and I were then promoted to IT Specialists to fulfill his position AND fulfill all helpdesk requests. They essentially got rid of a position and just gave me and my co-worker slightly more pay (was bumped to $20.23/hr and my co-worker was bumped to $21.20 even though I had more experience at the current company) to split a total of 3 jobs. 

I started taking over projects and massively increasing my experience and understanding of IT. A new director was hired and he is one of my previous college professors. I really like him and I really like my job now. 5 months later I am contacted by a recruiter for a Systems Admin position. I say I am willing to interview for it just to see if I could land it. And it sounds like I will be given an offer here soon. The HR rep said they would probably give me about 50k a year (about 8k more than I get now) unlimited PTO, and cover insurance (which my current employer does not do) and I would participate in a much less frequent on-call. A System Admin position would also be a role promotion. I am wondering if it is unethical to use this offer to get myself another promotion at my current company and get more money and maybe more PTO accrual. 

If it is ethical to ask for a promotion with this offer, should I even take it? Should I just leave?

I am 20 years old and still in college but have about 5.5 years of IT experience. 

Thanks for reading this what seems to be a novel and helping me out. Have a great day Redditors!"
dqnqpp,2,2019-11-02,WIBTA If I rescind an offer of help due to sudden stop in communication,ElectricalFlow2,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dqnqpp/wibta_if_i_rescind_an_offer_of_help_due_to_sudden/,"A old friend of mine from college is very unhappy in her career: she's being doing countability/financial work since we left college but that wasn't her first (web design), second (web development) or third pick (anything IT related).

The company she very recently started working for has been a big disappointment, she mostly took the job with them because they promised they would train her and let her do programming as well (they're an IT firm), that was a lie.

And the job requires that she do a very long commute by car.

So about 2 and half weeks ago I proposed to her that she come to the next internship my company will be organizing for web developers  which will tentatively be in April of the next year.

She was interested with lots of questions about the start date, curriculum, how it will be run, what will be her compensation etc.

I just want to point out that I got her the information she asked (about the salary) even if it's theoretically I shouldn't know these aspects.

She was not very thrilled about the and I completely understand:

It's not a very wow salary, but at the end you get a salary bump as you get hired for real and rate at which your salary rises in IT does not compare to her current field.

So she said she will think this over, it was unsaid but from the context she wanted to reach out to her family to see if they could help her for the internships' duration.

I didn't press on the finance, the only thing I asked her was for us to meet up and see how far she is knowledge-wise from where she needs to be accepted in the internship.

For me that is something separate from the money entirely, once we know what she doesn't know we can plot out a learning plan until April that has the least amount of stress and the most benefits for her.

It should be just 2 hours.

Since then she hasn't gotten back to me at all about it.

It seems very unfair to me, I know the money is a issue I'm just asking for 2 hours to see where we stand in terms of stuff she needs to learn or for her to answer that she's decided not to go.

It feels very unfair to me because I got her all the information she asked of me, exactly when I said I would.

As I know her for a lot of time, my best guess is drama in her love life:

On the one hand I feel really rotten to place demands on her if she really is going through something bad.

On the other hand she keeps on doing this, common friends have gotten sick of her shutting us out and just ghosting out on common plans and then randomly opening up as if nothing has happened."

For the longest time I have loved the idea of office sex, I love the idea of professionally dressed woman acting like sluts, being bent over tables or under tables for their bosses. Here are some ideas for an office based roleplay. Enjoy.

1. **Assistant Affair:** You'll play as my assistant and I will have bought my wife something sexy or expensive jewelry, you are so jealous you decide to slide it on and seduce me with it in my marital bed, or in the stationary cupboard. 
2. **Stationary Boy:** I will play the young 18 year old intern whose job it is to get stationary for people, so maybe your character could slide into 'my office' and we could have some fun, or maybe there is a hole leading into the toilet where I was able to slide my cock into.
3. **Glory Hole:** There is unisex toilets in out office and I am made to slide my cock through one in the stall
4. **Distract the boss:** I am the CEO of the company and I am about to come and meet your boss for an important document, which isn't ready, you decide to distract me the best way you know how
5. **IT Guy:** (MY fave): I am the nerdy IT guy who comes and fixers your computer, I am under your desk while you're away and you come back and sit down with no time for me to get away
6. **Caught Watching Porn:** You're my boss and you catch me watching porn, maybe I am taken for a disciplinary meeting
7. **Delivery Guy/Cleaner:** I am a delivery guy or cleaner who is there late at night and I find out it's all a front for a sex line and that's how they are making their money, there is only one way they're keeping me quiet."

I've often read that C++11 is basically a new language versus C++98. Bjarne Stroustup's Programming Principles book pretty much says don't learn C++98 in the preface. I'm debating this internship versus a few others in Java where I feel like I'd gain more practical experience.  

How much of a hurdle would it be to learn C++11 and up after using 98?"

I really want to put 110% into internship applications to make sure I can get the best possible experience.


The last two summers I've used LinkedIn to find internships but it seems like ChemE internships are rare. Most of the postings I see are CS/ME/EE. Consequently my last two internships were more mechanical and not really ChemE related. They were still great experiences, but for my last summer I really would like to land something ChemE, since that's what I ultimately want to be doing.

Any insight would help!"
dqrcxz,6,2019-11-02,Dilemma for GitHub Project,Hackerman1000,github,https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/dqrcxz/dilemma_for_github_project/,"I worked on a programming project in a team of 4, and we used Github for the project. The repository was created by one of the members of the team (not me), and it is presently private.

I am presently applying for internships, and I would like to have that project public for viewing on my profile. I worked on about half of it, while my teammates worked on the other half of it. I am not in contact with the team member who created the project, so I am not able to get the profile online on his account.

I would like to have the project on my Github account and was thinking of taking the code we worked on, creating a new repository on my Github profile, and making it public. Is this the correct and right way to go about this? If so, then what is an alternative route I can take to get the project to show on my profile? I'm a basic user of GitHub, so I'm not too experienced with all the different functions available and I didn't get anything on Google (wrong search term possibly?)

EDIT: Also, not sure if this makes a difference but his rep only has a single code file, with no license, copyright, or README.md either. Also, his code file is incomplete; Since I worked on the latter half of the project, I have the final version of the code file with me on my machine. 

Any help, input would be greatly appreciated."
dqrohr,12,2019-11-02,Importance of failure,WhyISucks,DeepThoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/dqrohr/importance_of_failure/,"When I was a student at the university I got my first job. It was quite simple. I was looking for an internship. I went through the interview and thanks to my good teacher at the university and his teaching I passed. I got an internship as a Database Developer. I didn't know sh\*t about programming but I knew a lot about SQL and databases. After 3 months they gave me a real job offer. I was really proud of myself. I got a job so easily. I was so naive :D

Six months later I started to realize that this job was a trap. We were using old unpopular and custom technologies. There was a lot of stress at work and the way of working was completely wrong. It was the best example of how to not make software. And there was no way to get a better salary or even develop myself. So I started to learn new technology at home and looking for a better job.

Another six months passed. I got some skills, made a simple app to show my skills and started sending a CV. Then I got my first interview. But it wasn't really an interview. They just sent me a link to the online test with a time limit. And a week later they just sent me an email that unfortunately they are not going to hire me. I failed. My half-year of learning was useless. I wasted my time. It killed my motivation. But after a couple of days of dark thoughts, I decided to write a response. I made a really nice and polite email with one simple but important questions at the end. ""Could you please send me a list of things I made wrong so I can improve my skills?"". And they replayed.

I forced myself to go through this list and learned everything I could about this. And then I started again. I created a new better app, updated my CV and started sending it again. Then in a couple of weeks, I got another interview. This time I was invited to the office to talk face to face. I want to the office and talked with this guy. He was the owner of this small company. He asked me lots of questions. Some of them were checking my knowledge, some of them my intelligence. I tried my best to answer them. A week later he called me and offered a Job. For 60% of my current salary... It made me so angry that I didn't even care to ask what went wrong. It was a salary that anyone without any skills could get... I politely said ""No"", wend back home, met with a friend and started complaining about this guy. It was really frustrating.

But I didn't give up. I learned more again. updated my CV. Updated my app. Got another interview. And I failed again. This time I asked this guy about feedback. He answered honestly. I wrote it in my notebook. Went back home and started learning again. Then I got another interview. And failed again. I asked about feedback and continued my learning. And again, and again. After the sixth failed interview I started to understand that it won't be as easy as I thought. It was quite depressing. Being in a job without a future and failing all those interviews. But I didn't give up.

On my 12th interview didn't get an answer at all. But I didn't give up again. I called them. Email from them was in my spam box. It surprised me a bit. They wanted to hire me. ""Hell Yeah!!!!"". It made me really really happy. It was a good job with a decent salary and a really smart boss. I loved it.

It took me 11 failed interviews and 1.5 year of learning to get a good job. I met guys from almost all companies working in technology I wanted to work in my City. A year later a couple of them wanted to hire me because they remembered me from the interview and I made a good impression on them. I learned a lot in this 1.5 year. But the most important thing I learned was that failure is just an opportunity to learn.

Thank you for reading through everything! I hope you enjoyed it!

I appreciate your feedback!"

I.e Indeed puts a software engineer as median of $105,000, while payscale lists $78,000 for the title ""Computer Scientist"", and a reddit thread of RCG's would have you believe that a computer scientist with a bachelor's degree and an internship should scoff at less than $120,000.

What is an accurate salary that someone who studied computer science can expect?

I work at a company and get paid healthily and for the most part find satisfaction and fulfillment in what I do, but the idea that I could study computer science for a few years and get bumped up $30,000 in pay drives me a little crazy."

(long),WeirdFsh,Wellthatsucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/dqu9y7/i_got_fired_for_the_first_time_ever_long/,"So this happened last week, thought I should vent it here to clear my mind as it's 1:30am and I can't sleep due to constantly thinking about it.

I'm a 21 y/o student in my third and last year of university, in the midst of my dissertation and working this now ex-part-time job.. I started it last December of 2018 (2nd year) as an internship as advertised by my university. To explain some things this company was a post-house, they handled post-production (editing/restoration/scanning etc) which was the exact related field to my degree. The MD was.. alright- he had a short fuse and managed his time poorly by the opinion of the other employees and I can safely say the same myself now. 

I worked there for a year as an intern and maybe a month during the summer they paid me £50 a day which I know isn't really great but what could I do in my position of non-superiority. Within the internship periods however they covered my travel and lunch so it wasn't really costing me anything to work there apart from time that I could have spent possibly freelancing and building a clientele because I was hoping they would notice the effort I was putting in, I essentially put all my eggs in one basket which, yes I know, is an awful thing to do to myself.

Due to my dissertation now going full throttle I had to cut my days of work down to focus on it. 
Roll back a bit and I had been suspended due to constant failures of my ""common sense"" as my MD put it, which I won't argue with. They ask me to come in again once the suspension was up and I basically worked one day, they said they had the other days covered and I wasn't needed; so I keep them updated on my uni's schedule and notify them of my free days - nothing, I soon noticed all the staff and even the student that had been officially hired by them which I knew personally were ignoring my emails/messages, when finally I receive a reply simply asking ""come in for 15:00"" which immediately raised a red flag for me as it's always a 10am-6pm shift.

I'm a massive worrier and sadly it doesn't help me when trying to think positively. I arrive at the office about 20 minutes early which I always do for my regular shifts so that I can tidy rooms, offer coffees etc, I do all of this and finally see the MD to which I ask if he wanted me to get him a coffee, he said no and to wait for him with another colleague for 5 minutes and then he'll come see me... 
Me thinking positively, try to assume he just wants me to sit in during an edit while also at the back of my mind is understanding everything that's going on.
He comes in and says that there's no improvement in my lack of common sense and that the mistakes I made on certain tasks didn't save them any time as if they were to do it themselves, as well as due to my mistakes the next three interns that are joining won't be allowed any technical tasks due to my lack of ability. 
They said I wasn't honest about mistakes I made and when I challenged it the MD threatens they won't even think about giving me another chance to come back once I've finished my dissertation.
He tells me to focus on my studies and as I leave I'm asked to handover my key to which I fiddle with for 20+ seconds, grab my coat and bag infront of two colleagues that say nothing as I imagine they understood what was going to happen to me, break down in the lower corridor for a bit, suck it up and leave.

I have no idea now what to do with myself, I have no clientele/contacts, they wouldn't refer me to another post house to help me move on which is understandable as me screwing up again could affect their reputation for referring me.
I have no time to try and get contacts due to my dissertation work and two other units along side it, and my girlfriend has another year after this which means after this year I need to find a job that pays enough to cover my rent since we live together.

That's basically it, thanks for reading.."
dquxg6,7,2019-11-02,"Per my psychologist, I told my mom how I feel and she gaslighted me. I am heartbroken and I am done. [TW: Assault]",petriepie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dquxg6/per_my_psychologist_i_told_my_mom_how_i_feel_and/,"Background: I was sexually assaulted in December 2018 during a mandatory internship. My lecturer, his friend, my psychiatrist told me to report the incident to the police, and bring a lawyer with me so the police will not embarrass me further (some of them have a victim blaming attitude and I was already fragile as it is). I told my mom and she kept on downplaying the importance of it, and kept on delaying it, telling me she's busy and that she doesn't want to make a hassle, and I'm already going back to university for the new year and I wouldn't want that to bring me down when I'm away trying to find a fresh start. 

So I ended up not making a police report and went back to university.

Recently, I've had recurring dreams of sexual assault and screaming for help to my mom and sometimes my dad. All of them would end with them not even helping me (in my dad's case), or getting mad at me for making a big deal out of it (my mom).

This has been going on for over a month and I was *exhausted* over the sleepless nights, nightmares, and how much I keep on waking up throughout the night. I tried sleeping tablets from the GP, increased my antidepressant dosage, drank chamomile tea, and talked to my psychologist.

During my recent appointment with my psychologist, it surfaced that I felt betrayed by my mom for not being more supportive of it and dismissing the assault. I keep on getting flashbacks of her saying **""Ew, that guy wasn't even good looking!""** and ""**Did you drink alcohol?**"" the night I came back late and told her what happened, and **""Are you crying again?""** when I was lying down on the sofa a few days later next to a box of tissues. When I told her of the nightmares, she said that she dreamt of sex too, and she just yelled ""Go away!"" to the devil. I didn't bother telling her sex is not equal to sexual assault.

After talking about that to my psychologist, my psychologist recommended that we try a behavioural experiment where I try saying what I feel to my mom and maybe it would get rid of the nightmares. We discussed ways to make it sound like I'm not blaming her or putting her on the spot. So this morning, I sent the text. 

It went like this

*""Hey mom, the other day I dreamt about getting assaulted again but I managed to scream no. But then in the dream you told me not to make a big deal out of it. So I told my psychologist about it and she says I should tell you that when you didn’t want me to make the police report, I felt sort of betrayed. I know you’ve helped a lot, and I’m really thankful. But I couldn’t help the feeling of betrayal of some sorts.""*

I was very anxious about her reply. I felt like it would ruin everything. My mom is not the type to empathise with people, so I obviously did not expect an apology and her saying she will do better. Hell, even when she was yelling at me for her being upset at her husband, and I asked her ""Why are you raising your voice at me?"", she yelled back **""I'm not raising my voice!!""**. So, obviously, not a caring mom who will hug you and kiss you when you're upset. Another backstory: she gave up the custody of me and my sister (8 and 4 at the time) to my dad when they got divorced over her cheating. 

Back to the story, I waited for hours for her reply. Then I got one reply, *""Huh?""*

I was exhausted. I didn't want to explain because I knew if I tried to elaborate it would backfire on me. So I just decided to calm myself down by taking a bath. 

After my bath, I got this monster.

*“Didn't we agree on not making a police report because it’s too much of a hassle? And your lecturer also said you don't have to? And his friend also said not to? Tell your psychologist don't just easily say a mom betrayed her own flesh and blood. Anyway if you think I betrayed you, I'm fine. Your call.”*

And oh dear god was I heartbroken. She basically gaslighted me into saying my lecturer and his friend said not to, when they did ask to, but bring someone with me for support. 

I used to put family over everything, even friends. Even when I was a kid, I resigned myself to working only for my mother and to make her happy and seek her approval. I told myself that I would just live with her and support her, content with not having a partner. I would say ""Sorry, not available"" on weekends to friends to spend time with my family.

And now, I have no one in my family to turn to. Mom? Self explanatory. Dad? Last text he sent me was for my birthday in May. Sister? She's got her own issues. Half-brother? Too young to understand and would probably be influenced by mom.

I'm just tired. On one hand, I wish I would die and have her remember her last words were those. I want her to carry the guilt to her grave that she killed her own child. On the other hand, I've got people who care for me and love me so I don't want to die, not really."

dqvvwt,4,2019-11-03,[SP] The fateful journey - Part I,fortissimo_piano,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/dqvvwt/sp_the_fateful_journey_part_i/,"Andrey suddenly woke up in the middle of the night, soaked in sweat, with beads of perspiration on his forehead, his pulse quickening with each passing minute.

It couldn't have been just an ordinary dream, could it? He felt distinctly shaken about what has just transpired in his head,which could have felt like a nightmare had it not been too realistic. The throbbing pang within his head and heart persist without subsiding, and trying as he could, he would not shake off the feeling of profound sorrow and gravity engraved within his subconsciousness. What has going on within his brain during these last hours? Gradually, his memories began to return, and he could recall the events leading to his current state. 

Andrey now remembered himself as the leader of a software conglomerate on the cusp of becoming a worldwide brand. Everything appeared to be looking up in his life: whatever he touched in business turned to gold, and there was no shortage in ambition or opportunities to expand his horizons. However, there has always been a sense of forlornness and desperation deeply beneath his radiant and confident veneer. In the end, this long suppressed feeling of dread has grown so overwhelming that he needed to  consult several leading specialists in psychotherapy, who managed to diagnose a deep-rooted teenage romance trauma as the principle cause of his malaise. He silently concurred with their analysis, as he subconsciously always suspected that events on \*that\* fateful day of his high school graduation ceremony has been shaping his subsequent life.  On that date, as he could vividly recall even years later, he had, in his boyish awkwardness, let the last chance pass by to declare his passionate admiration for the one person he silently cared about during the greater part of his teenage years and with whom he only had a few cursory, polite exchanges. Julie, as he would often envision in his mind, was in radiant mood that day, chatting incessantly with friends and admirers with a charming smile, putting her in even greater contrast with himself who happened to be in one of the more depressive periods. As much as he would try, on that day he wasn't able to overcome that gulf in confidence to approach her for even a short talk; and when the ceremony was over, their paths would predictably diverge. Julie went to a nearby private college to study law, whereas he moved hundred miles away for an internship and his first job in software engineering.  Even though they never contacted each other again, he would recurrently relive the grasp of her mesmerizing influence on him, without any fading.  After that separation, his professional career would first take off, then skyrocket; his material fortunes quickly flourished as a result. But this deeply engraved sorrow and regret would still not vanish, and would continue to torment his soul. Thus, he decided to sell all his belongings to pay for a travel back to exactly this fateful day to fix what he had failed to accomplish the last time.

""I hope you are aware of the gravity of your decision, Sir."" These were the warning words of the elderly time machine operator when he received Andrey's commission. ""Once on your way back, your present self will be extinguished, that is you will forever disappear from the world as we know, only to re-appear in a parallel universe of whose destiny we know nothing. And I literally mean \*nothing\*, because from the moment of your arrival, the alternate world will evolve in a totally unknown fashion. This implies that everything that has gone right for you in this world, all your lucky breaks and successes, may no longer happen there. So even if you believe you will be able to fix something by traveling back, chances are you are far more likely to succumb to an unforeseen misfortune and will never reach your present potential.""

Andrey, of course, knew that the operator was right. He himself has run this very same scenario multiple times through his head: By reshuffling the deck in his past, he might very well miss the fortunes he has enjoyed in his present life. Such as his unlikely encounter with the guru-investor who happened to be in good spirits to grant him a substantial loan for his startup business, or meeting his genius assistant who was capable of implementing each of his bold plans, or the collapse of his fiercest rival just when his business was losing market share. However, he himself knows too well that material wealth and success was no substitute for happiness, especially when one was constantly seized by anxieties related to self-doubt, loneliness and depression. In the end, he convinced himself that all his possessions were worth giving up as long as he could fix that one fatal flaw in his past. He chose to arrive on that fateful day of his high school graduation ceremony, and to at last reveal his proper feelings to Julie. Though far from certain whether this would achieve anything further, he believed that the act of speaking out would at least help relieve some of his anguish and regrets due to unrequited passion. In his view, he had to let fate herself decide how his life should progress, having at least put the proper question to her.

""Well, to briefly summarize how the trip would feel:"", the operator began to explain in his mechanical voice. ""You will be transported back to your teenage self at your specified date, keeping all your current memories. To make the transition as smooth as possible, the time of your arrival would be deep at night, such that you, now back to your younger years, would feel as waking up in a dream. Obviously some additional side effects such as acute headache or pain in the limbs may be involved,but it would not be too different from a bad  nightmare. At first, you will feel very dazzled, but after some time you will regain the memories of your future self, and be able to relive your past with all that knowledge. However-"", the operator suddenly raised his monotone voice. ""I have to re-iterate: the past as you will find will evolve differently than what you have hitherto experienced. At first, the deviation from your memories may be small, but they will eventually grow to such an extent that you will be unable to recognize it from your recollections, which may be to your detriment.""

Andrey didn't pay much attention to these last warning words, too big was his resolve and suspense to finally embark on his journey. With a long sigh, the operator instructed Andrey to go into the high-energy chamber which would teleport him to the specified spacetime location. After numbly following the orders, Andrey was sitting a dark room, and hearing the countdown that prepares him for the impending trip. Then everything suddenly went dark, he felt swirling motions around him, accompanied by subdued alto sounds. Shortly thereafter, his consciousness blanked out, and he would forever vanish in the present world, to commence his fateful journey in an alternate past."

(Pretty graphic and long),Mentallyundisturbed2,abuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/dqwd37/my_personal_story_pretty_graphic_and_long/,"I am a 17 year old boy, and live a pretty good life. I was born with Aspergers Syndrome. I was raised by my mom and my stepdad that she married a few years ago in a upper-middle class family. I was a high school football player for one of the best high school teams in the state. I sing in my church choir, and am the Youth intern there too. I am even joining the Military. By almost all accounts I am pretty average. Except when you dig into my personal life. I was raped well over a thousand times. When I was 5 I had a babysitter and lets call her Val (Who is a Pediatric ICU RN) , Val started off nice, even baked me cookies the first time. However the second time I went there I saw her true side. She belittled me by making me clean her dog's poop and verbally abused me. I, of course didn't say anything since she scared me. She even locked me in a dark closet while my mom was at work, when I refused. Around the first month I was there, she started making me bathe at her house and ""clean and dry me off"" and told me not to tell. After a couple weeks she started making me touch her and have  overtly sexual encounters. This went on for around 2 years. Me and my mom moved. The day we moved  I told her the abuse that ""Val"" did, other than the sexual abuse. I felt very ashamed. We moved and there I was reunited with a old friend lets call her L and her younger sister and I'll call her V. I was VERY excited to finally hang out with L (around a year younger) and V (around 2 at the time). Her stepdad was a very sketchy guy, I never liked him. After about 2 or 3 months there, I caught him raping L and V. He threatened me. He also raped me that day. He continued to do so for as long as I was there. He was very violent and rough. Eventually L's stepdad was caught red-handed and sentenced to 1,000 years in prison. I moved, and to this point no one knew my secret. I was a very depressed kid after that. L's stepdad and Val broke my innocence and I felt outcasted. I couldn't let anyone else know. My mom married a guy who was physically abusive when I was 10. And 7 months later my cousin showed up, lets call her J. She is around 5 years older. She came after school ended for her (around late April) and stayed until late August. She raped me every day, multiple times a day. She was by far, the most aggressive and violent. There were sometimes I would be bleeding afterwords. She would assault me if I said no or stop and make me make up excuses like ""fell down stairs"" or ""ran into the door"", etc. My mom divorced the guy. And we moved across the country (for the 3rd time) She came back when I was 12 and she eventually moved in for 2 years. You can guess what happened for 2 years. She progressively got more violent. When I was 16, and after she left. I planned my suicide. I didn't want want my mom to find me. I was determined to go ""missing"". But I stopped and eventually saw how stupid it was for me to consider Suicide. It is a very selfish way to go. I couldn't bear the thought. For the longest time, I had PTSD. I had nightmares. I was acting out in school. I got into fights and often went WAY TOO FAR. My mom married my current stepdad when I was 14, right when J moved out. My current stepdad (former Cop) knew there was something off. He talked to me and I told him mostly everything. I was in therapy for 6 months. I haven't met the criteria for PTSD for about 2 years and have felt so much better. I have helped around 20 other male sexual abuse victims. Including 1 on 1 mentorship of one that is in my youth group. Today I have finally filed charges against L's stepdad and J and Val (in 4 states). Sorry for my long post. I just thought I'd finally tell my complete story.  

Tl;dr: I was raped over a thousand times by 3 seperate people over the course of my life, and today, I live a somewhat normal life. And have since gone on to help others and today I have pressed charges against them."

dqxerv,9,2019-11-03,Bojack Horseman is the father of one or several of PC’s miscarriages,CapriciousSalmon,FanTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/dqxerv/bojack_horseman_is_the_father_of_one_or_several/,"Yes this is an out there theory but it makes sense. 

We know that PC said she’s had five miscarriages and it’s an obvious fact you can’t reproduce by budding. 

If you do the math, you’d know that PC had five miscarriages: Cooper for the first one when she was a senior in high school, and Ralph twice. That’s three. 

We are missing two more. 

Now we don’t know when she had the other two beyond they happened before Ralph and after she was a senior. Cooper you can rule out as she likely didn’t speak to him after she left for ucla. You can assume that perhaps she had a miscarriage when she was marv’s intern during the 90s or early 2000s or when she was at UCLA but we never get a mention of any boyfriend when she’s marv’s intern beyond Bojack and at UCLA I doubt she’d do such a mistake again (ie without protection) considering what’s at stake. 

We know her and Bojack were on again and off again since 2007. Yes there’s a chance that one of those miscarriages aren’t Bojack’s but it does make sense in terms of timeframe for him to potentially be the father. 

Now why doesn’t PC ever bring this up? Well for one, Bojack doesn’t want kids. Perhaps he got her pregnant at one point but unfortunately, we know PC can’t stay pregnant for longer than a trimester at most, and so lost it early enough that why even bother telling him or making it his problem? Heck it could’ve even been a chemical pregnancy (ie a super early miscarriage) or she took the test and confirmed she was pregnant but the next time she went to the doctor there was no baby and no reason to tell Bojack. 

Second, Bojack not wanting to have a baby with PC is why she and Bojack broke up in the first place. Perhaps when she was pregnant with his child(ren) she might’ve joked about it and he responded in typical Bojack fashion, thereby confirming her ideas. It could’ve even been in 2013 when she decided to break up with him in the pilot."

That said, I guess I'll jump into it.

For some background, My fiance and I have been together since high school. He's well aware that I'm pursuing my ""dream job,"" which eventually requires a PhD. My parents and my fiance have been extremely supportive in this, and we've been working together to plan out the financial aspect of my education.

In the last year, I finished my bachelor's and moved with my fiance across the country to pursue a master's degree. I had never done a big move like this before, and it was expensive in ways I didn't expect. We tried to cut costs as much as possible by only taking what we could fit in our cars, but between gas and furnishing a new apartment, all the progress I had made on paying off my credit card was lost. On top of that, tuition, textbooks, and other fees made things even worse. My fiance and I both dove right into the job search, but unfortunately my field is one of the ""useless bachelor's"" fields, and the only paid experience I have is three years in customer service/retail. My fiance quickly found a job, but in three months I haven't been able to. I gave up on my chosen field, but still haven't had any luck with retail or anything else.

To help with all this, my parents decided to gift me some of their stock as well as send me money whenever they think I need it. They have access to my checking account, so they usually know even when I say nothing. My fiance has been covering the about 2/3 of the groceries, but we split rent and bills as evenly as we can.

My issue is that I feel like I'm taking advantage of the people who love me. So far, I'm doing very well in my new program, but have nothing else to show. My parents are relatively well off, and not at all concerned with what they're giving me. They keep saying they're investing in me, and they know I'll make it worth it, but it doesn't make me feel any less guilty. I keep trying to tell myself that once I finish my Master's, and eventually earn a doctorate, I'll be making enough to pay them all back. But it's such a long road. It'll likely be 6+ years before I have those degrees, and longer before I'm making the kind of money that pays off student loans. My credit card debt alone is causing me immense dread, but I'm terrified to ask for help because I've already accepted so much generosity. My fiance and family keep reassuring me, but I'm afraid that the longer this goes on the more they'll resent me, and that by the time I'm able to pay them back they'll have realized what a burden I am to them. I want so desperately to make them proud, but at the same time I feel like I'm drowning in debt. My program is only going to get more intense, and I don't even know if I'll have the time for a part-time job once my internships start (unpaid internships, naturally).

Even if they all say they're willing and able to help, I feel physically sick every time I see that my parents made a deposit or my fiance picked up groceries. I feel like I'm doing everything I can to not be an ""entitled millennial,"" but I still have no income of my own. I feel awful depending on them and don't know what else I can do to ease the burden on those I love."

dr08fr,2,2019-11-03,This is going to be long - I just would like some perspective about co-parent when BM is explosive and grandparents have pretty much taken over all responsibilities. It’s long so I’m sorry.,emveg91,stepparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/dr08fr/this_is_going_to_be_long_i_just_would_like_some/,"Hello, I’ve always lurked around here but did not want to join or post from my main account.
I have been with my SO for 2 and half years and the entire length of this relationship — his daughter’s BM has tried her hardest to spend as little time as possible with their daughter and is completely absent during the week. A little background story: their child is a result of a one-night stand and she had lied about being on birth control while then proceeding to sleep with 3 other men (no judgment, her sexual history is her business) so for a whole year of their daughter’s life she had decided that the latest guy she had been seeing more regularly would be the dad figure and once he left her, she posted on Instagram that she was unsure of who the father really was and one of my SO’s friends made him aware of it and he took a paternity test and the rest is history aka the moment there was confirmed paternity she became almost completely uninvolved, only seeing her child on Saturday while expecting my SO and his parents to take over full parental responsibility, pay half of her rent and provide HER with groceries. She also made it a point to take furniture from their home, have them drive her to appointments, etc — my SO protested but his parents wanted to maintain a good relationship with BM (who was otherwise threatening to move away - truly an empty threat since she clearly wanted nothing to do with her daughter) and took full advantage of them and even went as far to say that eventually my SO would have to be with her because no one else could deal with raising someone else’s child...My SO’s mom told me this a few weeks into our dating and how she had to explain to her that unfortunately that was most never going to happen. The reason why she said that wasn’t because she had any understanding or compassion for how difficult of a role being a step figure is but rather because she has made this relationship a living hell and has 1) completely ignored me any time I’ve attempted to be pleasant or greet her right in front of everyone 1) she used to just walk in on Saturday (for pick up) invite herself for dinner at my SO parents’ house while me and my SO were there and continue to ignore both of us 3) she made up rumors that my SO was cheating on me with her (which is the most pathetic thing she’s done since my SO truly cannot stand to be in the same room with her for more than a few minutes after how she’s behaved). Things sort of changed for her once my SO and I’s relationship grew because I talked to my boyfriend about boundaries and about not caving into her threats and while helping to provide for their daughter is obviously his responsibility just as much as hers— the child was only there once a week so there was no reason pay for rent (which she had afforded fine up until then and also refused to provide any sort of paperwork stating the terms and the amount due monthly - used to just for an arbitrary number that was way too high for the area she lived in) and that it was also not necessary for her to waltz in without announcing herself at the door or via text and act like we were all invisible except for my SO’s parents who she sucked up to. 

This all sort of worked okay (a lot of resentment on my SO’s end) until he had to move for a three months internship an hour and a half away and would come back to see his daughter on Saturdays. Now instead of stepping up since my SO was gone during the week she decided to get a new job that had her working 11 to 9 leaving my SO’s parents (who are completely shouldering their responsibility at this point) to take her to pre-school, do everything during the week while she supposedly works...we found out recently — the joys of social media — that she wasn’t actually working as late or on Saturdays — which she states she had done since my SO has her on that day  (which is only fair since he too doesn’t see her during the week) and that Friday when she is supposed to have her she is actually having random men over from tinder (I know we can’t control what she does during her parenting time but this is worrisome because we don’t know what kind of weirdos could be going over at night while she’s there or asleep).
Now my boyfriend’s internship is coming to an end and he’ll be coming back and he has expressed to me how he feels like he and his parents have completely taken over raising this child and he feels burn out coming because it has been going on at this pace for the past 2 and half years and that talking to her won’t make things better and he’s simply going to have to do this on his own with my help and his parents help (which actually means not on his own and I pointed it out). 
Now that he’s coming back my anxieties and fears are coming back as well because the routine before -where BM was completely was “working” and then needed time to herself - was the most taxing thing on our relationship, he would have expectations that I step in and be a mom - not a step figure but an actual mom - 1) bathe her, change her diapers, potty train her, put her to sleep, help her wake up, feed her breakfast, dress her, brush her teeth, etc and it ended up being too much for me and I grew incredibly resentful of BM and just had to disengage.  He helped but was in school and I was supporting him while he finished his degree but I could tell he was expecting me to be more than involved and truly be “the mother of the child” which I’m simply not. 
Now once he’s back he’ll be working,  not just be in school and I will be returning to work as well (after several surgeries and months off from my own work) and he’s told me to last night that he doesn’t think he can keep up 6 days a week and he loves his daughter but he had no idea she was even coming and then let alone come to stay 6 out of 7 days instead of co-parenting and sharing her equally. I will be honest but I don’t think I can handle 6 days a week either and I am tired of her mom’s scenes and screaming every time he tries to mention mediation or having to stick to a firm schedule but it’s not my place to join the conversation and tell her to stop acting like she’s the child and that her daughter misses her and needs to see her mom as well. 
Has anyone else experienced something like this? Is a CO the best thing? Which my boyfriend seems too scared of because he doesn’t want full custody to go to her under any circumstance he just wants her to help more. Should we see a couple’s therapist? I’m open to any suggestions and sorry for the length of this"
dr1i4l,3,2019-11-03,I don’t know what to do,Pepperspray24,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dr1i4l/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I keep feeling depressed, as in getting more of the typical depressive symptoms: I’m having a harder time getting up, harder time getting myself to go to bed, sad more often than not, tired more often than not, I don’t really want to do anything but be on my phone. What’s fun about this: I’m a cognitive science and psychology major, I’m also getting my masters in social work and learning about the effects of toxic stress (isn’t life cool like that??). I’m overworked and under compensated for said work. As I mentioned I’m in grad school (15 credit hours/week) with grad school comes an internship (18 hours/week), my school pays me $1k/ semester for the internship or 1
$1K for 294 internship hours + 6 professional development hours (300 hours of work), because school pays us our internships are not allowed to (this is what I’ve gathered, I have proof that they’re at least not allowed to pay us). So because of this, I work 10 hours/week for $15.5/hour which is super nice but even with the stipend my school gives me is not enough for my $720 rent, food, gas and general living expenses. I had to take out a school loan to help me with living expenses. I’m on the exec board for a school group that goes to a men’s shelter each Friday to offer info about local resources and provide a support group. Not all of us go every Friday, we have a schedule. And my friends and I have a stream. I know I’m doing a lot. I’ve been told I’m doing a lot. I kind of count myself among the moderate functioning depressive people. I’m able to do all of this but barely. My grades are okay for the most part but I keep forgetting about assignments and turning stuff in late. On top of this, I’d broken up with my boyfriend of three years, we used to live together and now I have my own place. We tried being in an open relationship but it didn’t work out. Fun fact: he is one of the friends I do the stream with. We still love each other, but I feel like he loves me more than I love him. He’s ready for us to get married but hasn’t asked me because I’m not ready. When we first met I wanted to date around but he wanted to be exclusive. When I told him I wanted to date around he told me that he really liked me and started crying, I caved. Since then we’d developed a really great relationship (I know it may not seem like it for obvious reasons) but he was and is one of my best friends. I can literally talk to him about anything and he’s always there for me. I feel like shit because one of  the main reasons I wanted things to end is because after three years I still felt the need to date around. In my earlier years (for reference, I’m 25 and talking about “my earlier years” jeez!) I was super nice in relationships. I cared more about not hurting the other person than what I wanted, and as a result, I tolerated and ignored red flags, I’ve been in toxic relationships, sexually assaulted and just fucked over. I’ve never had a normal sexual and romantic relationship with someone. I know there technically isn’t a “normal” but here’s what I mean, first guy I ever had sex with coerced me into my first time. We were messing around in my dorm room and he kept asking me to go in just a little bit. I’d say no but he kept asking until I caved and then of course he started going in a little until he kept going deeper. I was like “are we having sex?” He said “yeah pretty much” so I said “well fine let’s get a condom because I don’t want to get pregnant”... I look back on that and I’m pissed the fuck off. We didn’t talk for a bit after that but he apologized and we wound up dating for that school year. He was supportive and seemed caring and we could talk about a lot but that relationship was toxic. He had his own mental health issues and would tell me that me and our relationship were the only things keeping him from killing himself. That relationship ended with him telling me his voices wanted him to hurt me because I was in the way of him hurting himself. I told my school therapist and he wound up getting kicked out of school. There were no contact orders and all sorts of fun shit in that. Since then I’ve been raped, and abused and all of this ended with the boyfriend I just broke up with who has erectile dysfunction.... just...why??? I wanted to just have sex with people just normal sex, and I have and it’s been great and now I’m trying ( kind of unsuccessfully) to slow it down to focus on school. I keep telling people that I don’t want a relationship nor do I need one, so of course there are people that I like but I have to restrain myself. I’ve done my best to upfront and honest with people. I feel like I always have something negative to say and I’m trying not to but it just comes out now. My symptoms have changed recently, I used to get anxiety and panic attacks (I have officially been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADD) now I just don’t want to do anything. Sometimes I’m happy and bubbly and then others I’m just down. My friend asked me if I was bipolar and I just don’t fucking know. I have a therapist but since school and everything I’ve only been able to see her twice since school started, once in August and once in October. I was supposed to see her last Friday but my grandfather died and I have to go to his celebration of life ceremony this Friday. I was set to go to the shelter this Friday but changed it to last Friday (forgetting that I had my therapy appointment) to compensate. I’m all over the place and last Friday I freaked out and started crying because I’m overwhelmed. I rarely if ever cry. People have asked me about dropping school but I’ve already dropped other huge stuff in my life due to my mental health and I’m so close to ending school. I won’t officially graduate until next fall but I can walk at commencement in the spring and there’s only 5 weeks left of this semester. I don’t want to leave school and keep putting my life on hold, I want to be tough and strong and keep pushing but I’m tired and stressed the fuck out and scared of what my stress is doing to my physical health especially since one of my stress responses is to eat junk. I have been trying to buy more fruits and eating salads and exercising a little when I wake up. My mom has tried to help and be understanding. Little things in my life seem too large to tackle and I don’t know what to do. I feel awful because I do have friends who aren’t my ex who have offered to let me vent and stuff but I keep relying on old things I’ve done to cope because that’s how I operate, and that’s what I fall back on when I’m stressed. I feel dumb because I have friends and teachers trying to help me but I don’t know what to tell them or how to make anything better. I’m trying to push through this semester and while I feel completely inadequate I know I’m doing some things right. I’m not doing super poorly in school, I love what I’m learning and I’m getting more reinforcement that I’m going into the right field. There’s just so much."

Hi there, I am Michael 26 from London England. My kik is mjd931

For the longest time I have loved the idea of office sex, I love the idea of professionally dressed woman acting like sluts, being bent over tables or under tables for their bosses. Here are some ideas for an office based roleplay. Enjoy.

1. **Assistant Affair:** You'll play as my assistant and I will have bought my wife something sexy or expensive jewelry, you are so jealous you decide to slide it on and seduce me with it in my marital bed, or in the stationary cupboard. 
2. **Stationary Boy:** I will play the young 18 year old intern whose job it is to get stationary for people, so maybe your character could slide into 'my office' and we could have some fun, or maybe there is a hole leading into the toilet where I was able to slide my cock into.
3. **Glory Hole:** There is unisex toilets in out office and I am made to slide my cock through one in the stall
4. **Distract the boss:** I am the CEO of the company and I am about to come and meet your boss for an important document, which isn't ready, you decide to distract me the best way you know how
5. **IT Guy:** (MY fave): I am the nerdy IT guy who comes and fixers your computer, I am under your desk while you're away and you come back and sit down with no time for me to get away
6. **Caught Watching Porn:** You're my boss and you catch me watching porn, maybe I am taken for a disciplinary meeting
7. **Delivery Guy/Cleaner:** I am a delivery guy or cleaner who is there late at night and I find out it's all a front for a sex line and that's how they are making their money, there is only one way they're keeping me quiet."

The housing is nice if a little small, and I live with four other company interns. 


One of the interns has often described himself as “devoutly religious” and likes to talk about Jesus and Christianity often. I understand that we all have the right to practice religion as we please, but I have a complicated relationship with Christianity due to some family trauma. My family was very religious when I was growing up, and when I came out as gay in high school, there was a very rocky period of my life where the church and everything that my life was based on as a kid was thrown back in my face. I’m very wary of Christianity and evangelicals in general now, but I haven’t really said anything to him about my relationship with religion beyond stating that I’m not religious. 


This morning, I was sitting in our living room drinking coffee with one of my roommates when the religious roommate got up to take a shower and get ready for church. He closed the door to the bathroom and basically immediately I heard contemporary Christian music blaring from a speaker in the bathroom. Specifically, the songs that he was playing are ones that I often sung in church growing up. I found myself very much on edge listening to this music, and it brought up some intense feelings of anxiety and rejection. 


I understand that we’re all in close quarters, but I’m considering asking him to use headphones if he wants to listen to music like that in the future. It seems like a small thing, but it puts me back in a period of my life that contains a lot of trauma that I haven’t totally worked through. I’m worried that he will feel like I’m attacking his religious beliefs or will spin it into me being hostile toward Christians, or worse, use it as an opportunity to try to convert me. So WIBTA?"
dr2g5v,1,2019-11-03,WIBTA if I continued trying to reconnect with a friend after we drifted apart?,InspiredHeresy,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dr2g5v/wibta_if_i_continued_trying_to_reconnect_with_a/,"Four years ago I (M now graduate) started hanging out with C (F still undergrad) and another one of my friends J (M, all the same age). C is from the west coast and uni is in the midwest. The three of us met up occasionally for two years, and I generally tried to invite her to anything going on. She's the type of person to sacrifice her mental health for school/work and I wanted to offer any opportunity for her to take a break. Last year she studied abroad and I only messaged her once or twice, so we've become distant.

I invited her to 10-20 things between Fall and Spring semester each year, and she maybe joined 5. She hung out more before/after each term. It's always been a little confusing where we stand as friends, and we don't have a lot in common.

From the couple times C opened up, I learned that she suffers anxiety attacks, was emotionally abused &amp; manipulated by her ex-boyfriend in the first year of college (I actually first met her through him, but barely talked to either at the time) which I got to see firsthand as he tried hard to spite her after separating, and doesn't know/practice much self care (once she casually mentioned her deli cheese went bad because she felt sick after eating a sandwich. J and I were kind of puzzled, eventually telling her it was more likely the month-old sliced ham she used). 

Durring her internship last summer in Texas she had a hard time and one of her hometown friends actually moved to her city in order to help her get through it. Meanwhile, most intimate C and I ever were was sharing personal details about high school and venting about her current bf once.

C is also in a coed frat and seemed fairly engaged in it. She mentioned gatherings/events as reasons she couldn't come to things a few times and she brought her (presumptive) bestfriend to a party I hosted, so it's not like J and I are her only friends here. J actually felt like he was getting the cold shoulder from C and doesn't really count her as a friend anymore.

*Now*

Since she got back to uni I haven't seen her once. I invited her to catch up, and other small gatherings, but she's been busy or unresponsive.

Starting conversations via message has been unfruitful as they barely get past a few messages before she left them on read. Yet her replies are honest and reciprocal when they come - so it doesn't feel like she's trying to blow me off. 

C has admitted that she's struggling this semester and feeling unwell, but I don't want to be an asshole and keep pestering her when we're barely friends anymore.

Most of my invites have been from convenience, like having a couple people over and inviting C to join (though she doesn't really know my other friends) but I guess I'm going to switch things up going forward and ask if she wants to do anything like grabbing coffee/tea.

dr3397,4,2019-11-03,Do you have meaningful friendships? What about those of you after 25?,vcardthrow1,ForeverAloneWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneWomen/comments/dr3397/do_you_have_meaningful_friendships_what_about/,"edit: sorry for the book. 

I've never had close friends. If I had regular friends...there was always something of an imbalance in experience and it made the friendship toxic.

For years and years I lived across the street from the polar opposite of me, a petite white blond girl who was bookish yet popular, the baby of the family to my middle child in six kids (thank Christ there aren't more of us - I don't envy that part), snotty parents (to this day my mother holds a bit of resentment..), small. Pretty enough. That was the most active friendship I ever had, with someone that made me feel inadequate as a friend and jealous and competitive at the same time. I think of it now because those horrible feelings poison EVERY adult friendship and social setting I can think of now, whether you're competing with members of a circle or regarding the ""friend"" themselves. 

At the time, through high school, I was a socially awkward dork in ways that make me now in adulthood, but the friendship ended in 7th grade as I was being bullied. I left my elementary school in 8th grade.

 I still saw this woman frequently after that as a teenager - we used the same subway stop. She went to the same university as me, in our city. She lived across the street, even after I left that school.  I saw her once on my college campus during freshman orientation. The look she gave me still makes me think about strangling her for the arrogance - she looked like she was seeing a hideous ex she couldn't believe she dated. Disgust and shock. As if I wanted to go over and talk to someone that had treated me the way she did, with such contempt. 

But I was never so close to someone ever again, and it was my first taste of jealousy I didn't conceal well enough (and yet she never knew the full extent - I probably bawled my eyes out by myself more than once over it, as she pulled away)...

Today, despite her going to an all girls' school like I did, being hyper-religious, and seemingly aimless - being one of those people who is good at everything she tries - she taught for a while in Catholic schools despite not having a childhood ed degree, and then married a square jawed, blue-eyed consultant from a religious think tank who makes enough or comes from enough money that she doesn't need to work full-time. She had a child. It's unfathomable to me I was ever in the same place as her. It's unfathomable to me, I'll always think of as 11 years old or a petite teenager, bearing and raising a baby, being a 30 year old mother. (All her sisters, similarly hyper-religious, got PhDs and are now raising 6-8 children. Shocking, they're all pretty white women - prettiness and being socially typical can rescue you from dying a spinster with no college sexual experience. I think their religiosity is silly and repulsive but I digress.) 

I had nightmares about her - meeting up with her and picking up where we left off - all through college and through grad school, despite having had heard a kind word from her for over a decade. Like my brain was mocking me.

I left college with no friends. The ""best friends"" I had in high school remained close to one another and discarded me. These women I loved dearly and admired. 

All of them have had academic careers and internships I couldn't have scored if I went back in time. They all are in long term relationships or married. They're lawyers working for reproductive rights, biologists, or at a minimum, did well enough in fields like marketing to...buy a house. Have adult vacations every year. See the world - with friends from high school

All of them stayed in touch and travel together. All of them went to each other's weddings. All of them, the women of the various cliques I floated on the outer edges of in high school, stayed close to one another. I don't really have that and have never been comfortable enough or had the emotional/physical stamina to maintain a relationship with anyone one on one in person, as opposed to online.

I have two groups I see infrequently to do what they decide to do and that's about it. It's a HUGE strain. I realize I won't get to see the one loose group unless I have a birthday dinner this year and I just can't afford to.  Lack of income and - as I realize it - unrelenting shame, fatigue and weariness of people at the end of a workday makes it easy to think of them as distant memories only. 

It brings me to something shitty and revelatory this year; I have one other friend from a web community I've been part of for ten years and have met members from. He's no longer part of it, but he lives in my city, we went to the same school (different years and programs). 

He was nice in the beginning of the relationship but he is the archetypical Brooklyn hipster. Every house party I attended surrounded by strangers...well, picture being the dowdy, lumpy, acne-faced Normcore basic bitch in the room with no career, no accomplishments, no cool bartending or writing gig, no artistic talents or accomplishments, nothing of interest to people for whom ""edge"" is both a calling and something to be bored by. 

It's ironic - because he is barely attractive enough, well read, highly literate, and witty, despite barely eking out of a living as a copy writer at 35...he has never had a shortage of people who will literally let him live with them for free, even if they've moved 3,000 miles away from us. Invite him to weddings. Move in with him, so he can stay in the city paying 500-600/month and live with friends.

Because he is interested in sociology himself, he finds inceldom fascinating - and naturally, only thinks of it as an unfortunate experience for socially alienated men, weirdos and geeks languishing in small towns across America. He has at least one vaguely FA friend he pities. 

This guy has no friendships with women unless they are fuckable looking. It includes 22 year old coeds and grad students. Perhaps I'm not better and have grown as unwittingly shallow about men. It makes me paranoid. 

Whenever he mopes about his failures people pity him or offer him help find gigs (and did recently). 



I argued with a close friend of his on facebook (something I apologized to him for and deleted the comments - his half-crazy male friends have said worse) and he told me I was a loser and my complaints about fears of the future/inability to move past it due to age (the same things he complains about, actually, to scores of women and their sadface and heart emoji - new and old friends - and sensitive male friends reassuring him how loved he is) are ""obsessive."" My favorite part about the ""dig"" -""I'm telling you as a longtime acquaintance.""

An ""acquaintance"", after ten years. I probably saw him once a year or two but talked to him often online. *Imagine telling someone you've known a decade they have just enough authority to call you a piece of shit, and demure friendship in one breath.*


Time and time again this same man left in babbling, embarrassed tears at my keyboard with his utter distaste; I never saw him when he was sober. I don't think he knows my last name (I use a web moniker for web friends). Or first, actually. 

It's been three or four months since he said that to me I can't imagine him having the gall to say to another woman he knows, this underachiever doted upon and seen as such a pitiful, lovable seedling of unfulfilled potential by his hipster ""friends"", and I still think of it in fury but more than that - deep hurt. I think of him often. I have no other ""very online"" friends. 

 It makes me realize that I don't think anyone who has ever hurt me, insulted me, or made me feel small and worthless has ever experienced a pang of guilt. *Imagine that.* I imagine most of this crowd thinks of themselves as desperate, needy, sensitive. Imagine being a magnet for those sentiments in people - for contempt, or disgust, or worst of all, predation. The few times in life someone has apologized to me for a misjudgment and apologized without qualification, it's always shocked me because it's so unusual. Who apologizes to the FA type, the classic doormat or object of contempt? 

I have been sorry for something, to someone - to everyone - my *entire fucking life*, sorry for my existence or taking up shared space no one else feels obligation to share, to an extent adults used to tell me to ""stop apologizing"" reflexively (now, thank God, I'm old enough to realize what they were telling me is, your anxiety is obnoxious and making *us* anxious and it's unattractive!). 

Do you know what it's like trying to be a friend to someone, expressing admiration for someone, wanting to talk to people about your life, about ideas, or dumb memes - whatever - and they just don't like you? Again and again? Some of you might?

""Make new friends"" people say - as an FA, the whole point is - you can't. You're lucky if people are basically polite to you. And if your life is defined by problems you'll never fix that you expect others to blame you for, you are a burden if you actually tell people what you think or how you feel every time you see them. The most you'll get is a friendship where you're tolerated; if you're lucky people will be nice and non-judgmental because of their rare generous natures. (One to three of my friends are FAs - we don't discuss it. But I'm thinking of one or two in particular. Even then I can't talk to them about being 30 and being a complete loser professionally, enduring indignities and terrors about my financial future they left behind in their 20s.)

I'm in my 30s and a rejection hurts as much in childhood as in the present - because it's final. Isn't it?

Some of you must know what I'm talking about. That combination of bone-deep weariness, all the time; the **physical** strain of being around people, and having to be amusing when your life as an FA is punctuated only with petty horrors and humiliations at work, with your shitty families, or out in the world that nobody will comfort you through; the financial obligations or requirement to do what others want; the fact that others reflect back your own failures, limitations, and shittiness, even when they're nice...that's enough. It makes ""friendship"" and its pursuit a torture, not something life-affirming. 

I realized something a year or two ago - I'm disposable to people. 

What I feel for people, I feel intensely. But when I'm with people it's tortured conversations asking them about their lives, and I rarely have anything based on experience to add. They're so fluid with each other, whatever group I'm with.


I'm babbling but I realized something - *normies* see their friendships dwindle after college, as jobs, relationships, geography and children pull people apart. But FAs?

My birthday is coming up and the dwindling or loss of an ""acquaintanceship"" to the realest things in my life - pure, white hot, choking bitterness, and rejection of affections - is its own horrible living death. The root of a tree poisoned to the soil and rotting at the base, sickening the stock as a whole.

I have been lonely and felt...**off**...and exhausted by people simultaneously since childhood, but nothing could have prepared me for the heart-sickening combination of humiliation, anger, and pain for this part of FA life - friendlessness, and inability to form or main friendships; for the foulness of your affection and desire to engage others. It's made me paranoid about times in my life I simply can't muster the energy to like or engage people myself. Nothing could have prepared me for the ending of even a poisonous shallow friendship. 

I would mourn the lack of sex and romance but that lack of real friendship that characterizes FA life and, to me, clearly, *clearly* is something most normies cannot imagine, even into their thirties...its infernal.

When I look back on the past what I there is to measure is moments like that - meaninglessness, loss, and rejection, experienced alone, until it all blends into a foul flat gray of nothingness of your broken personhood and body. What a blessing it is when nerves die, under those circumstances. But as you naturally suppress emotions about *anything*, because the most distinct sentiments that stir inside of you drive people away - anger, sadness, shame, alienation...how can you talk about yourself when people ask you who you are, or what you've done with your life? 

My mother has lived like this. I think of it often - that this is one of many terrible curses she handed down to me, a bad sign she bore me under. She's a horrible and hyper-religious woman, but she held onto one dear friend, her childhood friend from age 9. 50 years of friendship, multiple states apart - they talk on the phone at least once a month. Maybe once a week.

 I don't even have that. 

If you relate I'm listening.  

I could hang myself tomorrow and nobody but kin would know. I knew that at 18, maybe even earlier. It's as hard then, during the worst, most excruciatingly lonely years of my life (college, naturally) as now. 

I don't know anybody like me, rebuked again and again by life as I watch the richness of others' and how much they have, how much they've done, how much they are, and what the world gives them. How wanted they are by their employers and coworkers, how often *their* friendship and favor is sought out, by their partners. After a while it's as shameful as harboring a crime, even knowing ultimately from day to day, the average person might be no different from me - they just want to go home, put on lounge wear and fall asleep in front their television after eating takeout.

But I don't think so. They still have companionship as something they can *choose*."
dr3dta,0,2019-11-03,I (25M) love my ex (24F) but she slept with someone else 1.5 months after we broke up,HopelessFinancial,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dr3dta/i_25m_love_my_ex_24f_but_she_slept_with_someone/,"My ex girlfriend and I had dated for 3 years. We met in an internship our junior year of college and did long distance for our senior year. She moved to where I was going to live and she moved for me. We were so happy together and our bond was very strong. She was my best friend. She would always mention that I am the one she will marry and have kids with and everyone that knew us thought we were the icon for a perfect couple. We had a highly functional relationship. 

Around a few months after year 2 of our relationship, I got my dream job working in high finance. I was also studying for an excruciating tough exam called the CFA while working around 60-65hrs a week. 

My ex started to become depressed as I was her best friend and only friend in the city that she moved to, for me. She started to get worried and would get lots of anxiety because she was alone and her SO was always working. 

After my exam got closer, I started to see her less and less and she became more and more distant. She eventually said that we need to break up 2 months before my exam because she feels like she is just supporting me through my goals and not going after her own and that I was never around. She mentioned that when I was around, I was the best possible boyfriend anyone could imagine. I’m kind of a softy and I care a lot about people and especially someone I’m in a relationship with 

This was obviously devastating to me and I started to feel horrible. After she broke up with me, I reached out to her on several occasions to try to win her back and everytime she seemed like she had the same feelings toward me but would say that she can’t explain why but she just can’t see me right now. I recently started seeing her again and I really miss her and felt like I neglected giving time to her. I felt like I prioritized the wrong things in my life, but at the time I felt that I was working hard to become successful and start a family with her.

Prior to her dating me, she dated an extremely abusive boyfriend for three years that she mentions really scarred her psychologically. After I got back in contact after being broken up for 5 months, she confessed to me that she started talking to her ex 1.5 months after we broke up. This lead to my understanding that those several times where I would reach out to her and she said she couldn’t see me is because she was seeing her ex who was also manipulating her to not contact me. 

She mentioned that he became extremely abusive to her and that after she first saw him, he started threatening her and also threatened her with a knife. She said that she felt so lost and depressed and so lonely in this city that she knows nobody in that she caved and went to her ex. She mentioned it was horrible and it became really traumatic and that he was controlling her and ruining her psychologically because he is insane 

She mentioned to me that she has fucked up really bad and will never forgive herself for hurting me and that she wants to try again. I still love her, she was my soul mate, but I feel so betrayed. I only treated her with the upmost care and feel so betrayed. It hurts me so much too that while I was so hurt and wanting her back and reaching out several times, the reason why she wasn’t response was because she was seeing him 

However, we were not together, but the fact that she let her ex come back into her life after three years of abuse only 1.5 months after our 3 year relationship really hurts. I want to work to build trust, and I really do think she is worth it, but she was so alone, depressed and in a dark place that she would not be able to get out of bed she felt so horrible. I have a lot of anxiety about the whole situation and I still care so much for her, but I am so hurt. I’m not sure how to process this and correctly think about this rationally without an emotional bias. 

tl;dr - my ex who I dated for three years and have been broken up with for five months just told me she wants to get back together, but also told me she started seeing her ex 1.5 months after she broke up with me. I’m devastated "

THANK YOU FOR READING THIS!!


I met him spontaneously in SC before my planned move to FL. Ironically, he was moving to FL around the same time for an internship. We had instant chemistry and I felt so comfortable around him! 

(To note, we got out of long term relationships 6+ months before meeting one another. His relationship was rather healthy, but mine was an extremely toxic relationship that took time to rebuild from.)


Fast forward four months, we practically act like a couple. We even text every day! He said “I love you” after a few weeks and tells me things he never tells his best friends. I’ve met his family and they even invited me over to spend a weekend! Him and I made so many memories in just 7 months of knowing each other. 

However,  he started experiencing severe side effects to a medication. It left him mentally unstable. He wanted to fight it and stay in FL, but his friend and I suggested that he needed to put his health first. It was the hardest thing to do but I knew I needed to let him go. He decided to move back home until he gets back on track. Mind you, we are still dating and not in an exclusive relationship.

He visited me several times since then and we always have a blast! When he first left, he reassured me that he’ll be back by December unless he got a good job offer back home. He’s noted that he wants to pursue a relationship but wants to make sure he’s 100% mentally stable so we can have a healthy relationship. I’ve seen improvement in his health, however, it’s almost December and he’s still stagnant with his decision-making. 

How can I be supportive and remain patient during this time? I know you can’t put a deadline on getting better mentally, but what if it ends up being a year and he still hasn’t gotten better or moved back to FL? I worry about him often and want him to be happy, even if that means he moves to another state for his health and career."
dr4i7l,6,2019-11-03,Industrial/Systems Engineering Major with Computer Science Minor?,Endolithic,industrialengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/industrialengineering/comments/dr4i7l/industrialsystems_engineering_major_with_computer/," Hi all,

I'm a CS major but my girlfriend is in ISE. She wants to do something along the lines of quantitative analysis/data analytics/data science/supply chain management, but noticed while searching for internships that almost all applications in these areas asked about programming experience. Our school (NC State) offers a very comprehensive Computer Programming minor, which involves honestly most of the core classes of the major (definitely beyond just 'programming'). When I think of the things she wants to do for her career, I imagine that the topics learned in classes such as Data Structures &amp; Algorithms particularly would provide lucrative skills. She currently has a second major in History (just for fun) and a minor in Stats (since it shares many classes with the ISE major), both of which she would probably drop to complete the CS minor.

Do you guys have any thoughts on this? Would the skills picked up from significant CS coursework provide benefit to her career?"

""Congratulations! We'd like to extend you an offer for the AMWF summer internship program! Please find your offer letter attached. Reply to this email with your start date and end date and please fill out the relocation form!""

You were ecstatic when you got that email. AMWF was one of the leading technology companies in the cloud computing space. Their position in their space, coupled with their San Francisco high rise office, insane perks (massage room, library) and high pay made their internship program one of the most competitive in the world. And you got in.
______

You got out of the elevator to the 50th floor office of AMWF, ready for your first day. You headed to the receptionist, a pretty blonde lady wearing a tight, revealing dress, and told you who you were.

""Ah, yes! One of the interns!"" she exclaimed, handing you a guest pass and instructing you to head to a meeting room called Cybertron, where your mentor would be meeting you shortly.

On the way, you noticed a few things. One, the office seemed to be composed of two distinct types of people, tall, fit, handsome Asian men and white women dressed in revealing clothes. You wondered who your mentor would be as you sat inside Cybertron, a meeting room with an expansive view of the city's financial district.

_______

A few minutes later, a [pale, blonde woman walked in, clutching a laptop and a coffee cup. She was dressed in a tight skirt, heels, and a black crop top. She looked more like a whore than a professional.](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg) 

""Hi! You must be *your name*!"" she beamed, sitting down next to you at the conference table. 

""I'm Rosie, and I'm going to be your mentor here at AMWF, "" she opened her laptop, typing away for a few seconds before turning her attention to you.

""Since you're my intern, it's my job to make sure you're getting all the support and help you need, "" she giggles, scooching a bit closer to you. You notice she's booked two hours for this meeting room.

""So, first things first, which one of my holes do you want me to service you with first, *daddy*?"" she purred.

_____

Hi! I'm Rosie and I kind of look like [this](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg). I'm looking to play your mentor/cum dump during your internship at AMWF. I like dirty talk, name calling, raceplay (Asian dominance &lt;3), big cocks, lots of cum, impregnation, and cheating.

DM me your name, description and continuation (no dick pics and be aggressive!) and expect to write around 3+ paragraphs per response."

For the longest time I have loved the idea of office sex, I love the idea of professionally dressed woman acting like sluts, being bent over tables or under tables for their bosses. Here are some ideas for an office based roleplay. Enjoy.

1. **Assistant Affair:** You'll play as my assistant and I will have bought my wife something sexy or expensive jewelry, you are so jealous you decide to slide it on and seduce me with it in my marital bed, or in the stationary cupboard.
2. **Stationary Boy:** I will play the young 18 year old intern whose job it is to get stationary for people, so maybe your character could slide into 'my office' and we could have some fun, or maybe there is a hole leading into the toilet where I was able to slide my cock into.
3. **Glory Hole:** There is unisex toilets in out office and I am made to slide my cock through one in the stall
4. **Distract the boss:** I am the CEO of the company and I am about to come and meet your boss for an important document, which isn't ready, you decide to distract me the best way you know how
5. **IT Guy:** (MY fave): I am the nerdy IT guy who comes and fixers your computer, I am under your desk while you're away and you come back and sit down with no time for me to get away
6. **Caught Watching Porn:** You're my boss and you catch me watching porn, maybe I am taken for a disciplinary meeting
7. **Delivery Guy/Cleaner:** I am a delivery guy or cleaner who is there late at night and I find out it's all a front for a sex line and that's how they are making their money, there is only one way they're keeping me quiet."

dr6yjx,96,2019-11-03,Entitled intern who is an influencer thinks she doesn't have to work,larilalie,EntitledPeople,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/dr6yjx/entitled_intern_who_is_an_influencer_thinks_she/,"This story happened a few months ago at work and I think it fits here pretty good. Also english is my second language so I'm sorry for mistakes. 

Some backstory: I work in a online communication company. We sell things like websites or Adwords to our clients. I work for a year there now and it is really my dream job. My coworkers are very kind and respect me although I'm only an intern. I had a two months pause because my study courses just started but now I'm back working for one day a week. The time the story happened I worked full 40 hours a week. 

So onto the story:

A few months back my boss announced we are getting an intern for a month. Everything okay with that but after we heard she is the daughter from one of our clients we weren't so happy about it. This client is a big one and we don't want to lose him and that means if that daughter is not pleased, she will probably tell her father. My team leader told me I have to explain her the task she has to do for the time she was here. Normally I have no problem with something like that but I was a little nervous about it.

The day Olivia (obviously not her real name) arrived she fulfilled every criteria of an entitled influencer (expensive clothes, blond, really thin, and tanned) but I didn't want to judge too quickly. I helped her getting the PC ready and explained the task to her. This task was really an easy one, you don't need special knowledge for it. The only thing is it costs some time. I prepared some templates for her and I tried to explain it by doing the steps together. I told her if she had problem or a question she can come to me and I will help her. After that I left her on her own. 

After a few days I realized she gets later to work and also goes earlier (her working ours were from 8am to 4:30pm but she came around 9am and left at 4pm or even earlier). Also I checked her progress on my computer and saw that she basically did nothing. I was mad because she didn't stick to her working hours but she also thought she does not have to work. I mean she got paid for the job and did nothing. I explained the task again and she asked me ""*why can't you do the task?*"" and I thought umm if I have to do the task I wouldn't explain it to you would I?? We talked a little and I told her that I'm leaving at the end of the month for some time because my courses are starting. She asked me ""*you will be happy to get out of this company are you? I will be.*"" and I was like ""*no.. I really like my job and I will start here again after I got my timetable*"" after I said that she looked really confused at my like how can you like a job like this. I wanted to roll my eyes because not everyone can earn their money with instagram. 

Olivias next strike was one day she sent an e-mail that she is so ""sick"" she can't come in today. Here in Germany you need a doctor's certificate after 3 days not showing up at work. We all new about her instagram account and we checked it out that day for fun only to see that she is now in Berlin for an ""important influencer event"". We just thought what the heck?? She said in her story that she is ""*soo sick but she couldn't let her dear followers down*"". Of course we showed this our boss and we could just laugh about her stupidity, like did she really think we wouldn't notice? The day she came back to work (late again) and without an doctor's certificate (what a surprise) our boss wanted a talk with Olivia. She was told to not do something like this again and she got her first warning letter.

There was only about a week left of her internship and we were glad that she will be gone soon. Olivias attitude was really annoying. She never greeted us in the morning or said goodbye after work. I did a little smalltalk with her because I wanted to be nice and she just told me stuff like her next travel destination or that her hotel is not that great (yeah she lived in a hotel - a really expensive one -  the month she worked with us) and she wants to earn even more money with a ""innovative"" shower gel. I said nothing to the things she told me because I really didn't give a f\*ck.

What annoys me most about this whole story is that if I had pulled stunts like this I would have been fired. I work very hard for that job and this behavior made my blood boil. She took full advantage of her status being a clients daughter and at the end she still got the job reference because my boss didn't want to have any trouble and that was the easiest way to get rid of her. 

Sorry if this wasn't so exiting but this makes me still mad when I think about it. But the best thing is she is gone and I never have to see her again. 

One funny thing my coworker told me the photo in her application was one from her instagram and we thought how could you think a selfie (half naked) is an appropriate photo for a document like this lol.

Thanks for reading! :) 

TLDR: New intern thinks work rules like working hours or a doctor's certificate doesn't apply to her because she is an influencer and only do this job because her daddy got it for her."
dr8i0a,79,2019-11-03,I Used to Work in Politics and Jed is in Way Over His Head. Possible AMA?,CriminalVixen,DuggarsSnark,https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/dr8i0a/i_used_to_work_in_politics_and_jed_is_in_way_over/,"Mods, if you want some proof, just let me know!

TL;DR Unless Jed is the only Republican candidate in his conservative district, he will get eaten alive.

Disclaimer: I've just browsed on here, seeing that he's running. I don't have all of the information, so feel free to correct me/fill me in. I'm partially writing this with an inkling that other Duggars might try to get into politics. First there was JB, then Michelle's robo-calls, Josh in DC, the picketing outside of Planned Parenthood, JD is a Constable, and now Jed is running for political office.

Yes, I know JB has some experience in running for office, and that the family tries to be politically active, but Jed is too young and dumb to start a true, successful campaign. Granted, it's at a very local level and he might have help from fame and religious connections. I have more political experience than this bro, though, and still don't feel like I have enough experience to run my own successful campaign. He doesn't even have a proper education, and no secondary education. However, Arkansas might be like a different country compared to the greater DC area that I worked in. It truly takes a certain kind of person to run for office, and he doesn't have that ""it"" factor, other than being a Duggar. His family's fame is likely boosting his ego and confidence. The stress of campaigning can be quite overwhelming, which is why I switched fields. I now work 12 hour shifts at a hospital, and that's less stressful lol. What I've always wanted to do with my life is help people, which got me into politics to start with, and is why I'm in the medical field now. Jed is going to crumble if he has real competition. Side note: I think it's crazy that I had to go to school and get certified for my job, but to run for office in this country all you have to be is a certain age in most cases.

Here's my basic background: I've worked on campaigns at a district, county, state, and national level. I've been an Intern, Fellow, Deputy Field Organizer, Chapter Lead, and Vice Campaign Manager for various campaigns. For those who are curious, I'm a Democrat. In 2013 I worked on the Virginia Coordinated Campaign, working for the candidates who were running for Governor, Attorney General, and Lt. Governor. In 2014 I worked for Organizing for Action, which was Obama's ongoing campaign. It started as a fellowship, but I moved up to Chapter Lead for the Stand With Women Initiative for all of Northern Virginia (the greater DC area). Later in 2014, I campaigned for a delegate in Maryland. Finally, in 2015 I helped run a campaign for a candidate running for a sector of the Young Democrats of America. I've also worked two politically motivated jobs that weren't tied to campaigns. In 2013, I attended the Restore the Fourth protest in DC, a rally done in response to the NSA's data collecting. It was a non-partisan event to protect the 4th amendment, which is our right to privacy (I doubt Jed even knows any amendment past the first two). From people I met there, we started a group and I would write newsletters for them. It was pretty cool, a lot of hackers and dark web dudes. Then, for a short while in 2014, I worked in DC for a non-profit, Clean Water Action. Some of the things I did overlapped each other (secretly), and regular campaigning has shorter timelines, in general (hence multiple things in the same year). I also left a couple campaigns early, for my own reasons.

Not to brag, but I've had some ""prestigious"" opportunities through my political work that I'm quite proud of, that I can hardly see Jed being able to achieve with his piss-poor educational background. He would be like a fish out of water for most of it. I have been in a campaign commercial, and in a social media video for another campaign-Jed would probably do okay in front of the camera. I'll give him that. I've conducted social media training for voters, and did volunteer recruitment and training. I've attended political meetings as a rep, even acting as a surrogate speaker for a country club on behalf of the governor candidate, so I have experience as a speech writer and public speaker. I've attended private dinners with political speakers. I've attended debates. I've hosted events for special groups who wanted to learn more and get involved. For example, a women's business club, and a Muslim women's group (women's issues are kinda my forte). I've attended climate change seminars. I've been flown out to Chicago to the Organizing For Action's former headquarters, after being picked to attend a national women's political leadership conference. I've been invited (and attended) a job fair at the DNC headquarters in DC. My favorite experience, though, was being invited to the White House for an Executive Signing. It was for when Obama raised the federal minimum wage to $10.10. I still get a kick seeing the back of my head in the news clips that were filmed. Does Jed even know how to give a proper handshake if he met the president? Granted current Mr. Tiny Hands president might suck at firm handshakes lol. Jed would probably love that ladies who are attending alone are escorted to and from the press room by military personnel, though.

If he were to go to the White House, he'd probably be okay with news crews outside the entrance, and all of the security measures, but I'm not sure if he could handle some smaller events where the focus is on him/his campaign. It's not just talking and people clapping. On the VA Coordinated Campaign we hosted an ""office opening"", and it was just held in our normal looking office space that was part of a larger complex. It wasn't extravagant, but it was enough for some shit to go down. People who worked for the opposing campaigns tried to fake their way in to the event, and one guy slipped through. He started yelling during a speech, and security had to escort him out. We had special people delegated to just watch for infiltrators. Then, outside the office (which was literally just across from a shopping center and grocery store), opposing campaign workers swarmed near the door, trying to yell more crap. One dude threw his iced coffee at one of our interns trying who was trying to de-escalate the situation, and another dude whipped out his phone and tried to record the ordeal. During that same event, which was filled with politicians at different levels, a delegate gave me and (apparently) some other girl a book of poems he published. I didn't think much of it. Later that night I got a call from ""campaign space"", it was a Richmond phone number, so like 2 hours away from our location. Somehow it got reported that the delegate gave out only two books to ""attractive"" young women. I had to give a verbal report to confirm if there was any inappropriate behavior. I have no idea how they knew about the book giving, and I thought it was totally innocent. However, the campaign world is a crazy place.

I doubt Jed has the work effort to even put together a true campaign. Does he have a lot of start up money? Does he have a campaign manager? Has he rented an office? Does he have interns and/or Field Organizers (which are paid employees)? Does he know how to manage employees and volunteers? Does he even know how to recruit and train volunteers (or his interns and employees)? Has he planned events? Does he have connections to local politicians (it's good to have others vouch for you)? Is he completely informed on who he's running against? Does he know the rules about things like yard signs? Does he know what GOTV is/stands for? Does he know how to utilize the voter database to phone bank? Does he know how to canvass neighborhoods? Does he know how to register people to vote? Is he prepared to set up and pay for booths at fairs and other events? Can he write a speech with his dining room education? Does he know how to professionally deal with angry people with opposing views? Does he know how to connect with voters on other issues other than ""hot button"" (2nd amend, pro-life, etc) issues? Does he know how to separate church and state? Does he know ""freedom of religion"" includes ALL religions? Does he even know the Constitution? I doubt he knows anything past the first two amendments. His parents certainly don't know it, in my opinion. They've violated the 4th by exploiting their children's personal lives on TV for years without their consent. Also, arguably, they've violated the 13th by their whole ""sister mom"" set up.

I think Jed is totally stupid for trying to get into the political game. If you have any political questions, feel free to ask! I have a feeling that this is all JB's idea, and he'll keep pushing his sons to get into politics to fulfill his own failed dreams. I doubt JB realizes how the insular environment he's kept his kids in, and the lack of proper education he's provided, has made them all out of touch with the real world. How can you be a politician without knowing the the world around you? Will he even be able to connect and relate to any non- religious zealot voters?

Edit: I doubt he knows much about the narcotic epidemic our country is facing, let alone has any ideas on fixing it. I live 45 mins outside of Baltimore, which is a Heroin hot spot. People drive in from surrounding states (mostly WV) to buy dope. Has he seen a junkie passed out on a bench with a needle on the ground? Because I have. I seriously question his knowledge on Methadone and Suboxone programs/clinics, and the existence/idea of clean needle clinics. Does he know about the risks of Hep C, Aids, abscesses, and necrosis? Does he know what Narcan is, and how to use it if someone were to overdose? Does he know the methods of administering the drug,  beyond shooting up? Does he know how many people have died in his own town this year from overdoses? Sadly, 48 have lost their lives in my town so far in 2019. Has he interacted with any true addicts, or known anyone who lost their life? Does he even see addicts as good people, and acknowledge that it's a disease that you can't just pray away? Does he believe in psychotherapy and psych meds, considering a lot of addicts start using when coping with other issues? Does he know how the ""War on Drugs"" has lead to overcrowded prisons? These are all things he'd need to address if it's part of his platform."

My internship started and its not going well due to the really toxic work environment.  So there's even more stress added into my life and I feel drained.  The worst thing is that I can't quit because its needed for my graduation.  At least,  since its November,  I only have 3 months left.  I hope it passes by really quickly.  

After this experience I know that I do not want to work under anyone,  but my father is trying to control what I do,  telling me to do a degree or some courses even though I want to take a complete break after this (No working, no school, no nothing).  He wouldn't sound happy when I say no to his ideas.  Sometimes,  I feel trapped as I am always forced to do what people want me to do or else i'll get into trouble with my parents (can't change what I study and not quitting intership because it would delay my graduation). 

My mood hasn't improved as well because my dog was recently diagnosed with arthritis due to her old age and my father was talking about putting her down.  The sad part is that he didn't sound sad st all when he said it and claim that he would be sad if it came down to it.  He even sounded cheerful when he said that I should say goodbye to her because he might put her down there and then at the vet. 

My fish has also been dying because of him.  The water temperature has dropped and my fish are all getting sick and dying.  I told him that I want to get a heat and test kit to improve the health of my fish,  but he said that it's a waste of money. I bought a heater for them once but it spoiled really quickly and my father shit talked me behind my back to my brother.  It happened a few times regarding other things as well and it just sucks...  He's also trying to get me time to quit fishkeeping so that he can use my tank to keep this own fish...  

I don't feel like a human now because I feel like I can't do anything I want to do or I feel like I have no say at all regarding things regarding me... Its always about others and never about me... when my parents found out that I was getting treatment in secret with my grandmother funding it,  they got upset because I never thought about what they think.  I told her that they have never thought about me and how I felt,  she said she will change but she never did.  

Rent is really expensive where I live here so moving out is not an option at the moment 😞."
dr905c,2,2019-11-03,How do you do life stuff?,fuckvocera,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/dr905c/how_do_you_do_life_stuff/,"PGY-1, currently on medicine rotation.  I'm sure it's actually very ""chill"" compared to many other people's hospitals/attendings/hours but on short call days we're here like 630 - 5, long call 630-7 but may end up being 8 or later depending on time of admissions.  This isn't our main hospital so it's anywhere from a 25 -45 minute drive depending on traffic.

Anyway, cleaning is one of the things that I easily ignore when I'm working long hours and only have 1 day off a week.  My partner who lives with me has asked me multiple times to do a better job of picking up, dishes, laundry etc.  I do chores intermittently but I'm definitely not great about it.  Dishes especially tend to pile up.

Last week my partner got really frustrated with the cleaning situation.  I apologized, did all the dishes and had a mini meltdown about how all the chores feel extremely overwhelming on top of work but that I would try to do better.

Partner was out of town this weekend and I was off a random weekday.  I did all the laundry in the house and put all mine away, and also cleaned one of our bathrooms which hadn't been done in months and really needed doing.  I also had to drive around town trying to take care of vehicle maintenance/DMV stuff which I still hadn't done since moving here since we never have days off during the week.  I worked 14 hours on Saturday and got home and basically went straight to bed.

Partner got back in town today and was unhappy because there are still dishes in the sink and clutter/crap all over the living room.  Also they left some of their stuff behind at a restaurant we went to last week before they went out of town and they asked me to pick it up multiple times which I didn't do.  I did try to contact the restaurant but I didn't drive out there to get it.  I'm still at work which is why I'm not doing this stuff right now

I just don't know what to do.  I know being a resident doesn't mean your partner has to pick up 100% of your life slack but I also don't feel like I could have made more time this weekend to clean.  I know it sucks to come back in town to a messy house but I really did try to do some cleaning last week, I just wasn't home very much because of work.

In case it comes up, I am not being expected to do 100% of the cleaning but I am easily falling short of 50%.

How have yall handled basic things like housework when you're working an intern's schedule?  My partner works too, so it's not like they should be expected to do all the housework for 2 people.  and I know some people would suggest hiring a cleaner, but the main problems are everyday things like dishes, cooking, laundry etc and less so deep cleaning that a cleaning service would do.

Please don't roast me too hard, feeling very stuck today."
dr9bgc,4,2019-11-03,Relationship tipping point: I (m23) don't know if I love her (f23) but she feels the complete opposite. Should I keep going?,veryfatcat,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dr9bgc/relationship_tipping_point_i_m23_dont_know_if_i/,"Hi Reddit,

Thank you for taking your time and reading my story. I have been dating my gf for almost 3 years. We first met through her brother, which was my classmate at the time. I thought she was cute. A year later I invited her to a party of mine, in which she agreed. We met and initiated a lot from there.

We were moving fast- had sex on 3rd date and I was stupid enough to say ""I love you"" right after that. I did not have any serious relationship experience before that, so I was pretty desperate and naive. Our attachment styles fall into the dreaded category ""avoidant and anxious"" (this is the most common relationship that has an abusive cycle), in which I am the avoidant partner, and she is the other. She gladly accepted my ""love"". I never knew if I ever love her, nor I know what love truly feels like. I feel like it's mostly lust. I kept blurting these intimate words without knowing what they really mean or feel like. I got her hopes up and further plunge her deeper into her issues. So, we never got the chance to explore each other pre-relationship. All of this becomes official in a week.

Fast forward 3 months, I am to leave for my internship for the whole summer. I ran into some disagreement with my roommates and moved out of my place. Conveniently, she and her mom suggested that we should move in together. ""Sure, I love her, why not?"" was my thinking. Her mom wasn't the best person I would go to for relationship advice- she got into an abusive marriage with her first husband and got married after 1 night with her current husband- seems like a familial pattern. Anyway, we moved in together after my internship. I started to become more and more unhappy as the years go by. I moved too fast with her-- we got engaged after 6 months of dating, mostly because she wanted to, and I wanted to please her. I knew that marrying goes against my personal philosophy. I hate conformity and social norms. I hate the idea of having to be fixated on your life choices. I want my freedom to choose. So, I didn't feel good about it.

I started to resent her because I had no personal space and time anymore. We couldn't find common interest. We had different life goals. Her personality is very fragile and weak, and it bothers me. I grew up in a narcissistic, emotionally abusive household so I learned to grow strong and self sufficient over the years, but she wasn't as how I expect resiliency in other people would be. It also doesn't help that because of my childhood, I am emotionally numb- I tend to build walls to avoid myself from being vulnerable. That was why with each of her emotional expression, I got bothered and annoyed. Furthermore, even though her childhood was harsh, she was very sheltered. She couldn't do anything that involves adult responsibilities without me. Eventually, my respect for her didn't develop. Please note that I am not here to put the blame on her. My issues are just as big if not more than hers. In a way, one could say that she did not meet my standards, which I didn't know I had one. We both dive into this relationship knowing too little about ourselves.

Her weaknesses got to me. I wasn't growing, but instead, I backed down from my life goals as well as motivations because I don't have any time for me anymore. Seeing myself stop growing is very disheartening for me. I feel like I deserve better, as she deserves someone who can truly love her. So I started looking around, but I didn't cheat nor even talk to any new girls romantically. I was just searching for alternatives.  I finally broke off the engagement, and told her that I wasn't ready. I checked in with her a couple times a month about our feelings. To be honest, I don't know if I want to take care of her for the rest of my life, because I don't want a liability.  I felt that I can do better and find someone who is better. She knows that. I know this is selfishness, but I have no better way of explaining it. I'm not here to make myself look good either.

I know that I still care for and attracted to her sexually. She loves me dearly, but I don't know if I feel the same. Yesterday, we had a conversation about the relationship. I told her that we had the option of breaking up OR taking a break. We came to the decision of taking a break. I feel that I don't want to waste her time, because she already sacrificed so much for my indecisiveness. I don't want to hurt her anymore, but she insist that we work on this, as we have been working on for a year with no improvements. I would be very sad if we were to break up, but then I also see that maybe the grass is greener for both of us on the other sides. I felt like it would be humane to stop making her suffer to wait to me until I am sure that I love her. What if that time never comes?  I suggested that we should just break it, but she wants to keep trying. She also knows that she might be wasting her time on me as well.

Reddit, please advise me on what to do. I know I deserve to be shamed, but please do so with some consideration of kindness if you absolutely have to."
dr9dc3,18,2019-11-03,When Disney got too real,Naterdave,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/dr9dc3/when_disney_got_too_real/,"I used to work at Disneyland in California in the late 90s. I didn’t put much thought into it, I just thought it would be a cool job to have during school. However, the months turned into years, and when I graduated I still worked there. Next thing I knew, I was a sophomore in college and still worked at the theme park. It wasn’t much, but it was decent. I don’t know if anyone else’s experience at Disney as a employee is different, but for me my job was to maintain rides, get the characters ready, and take care of an angry costumer every once and a while. One day, I wanna say it was about 1995, a manager walked up to me and said that we got a new employee and that it was my job to show him around. Great. Just what I needed. I was going through rough times at the time, like my roommate moving out and my grandma becoming ill, so you could guess I wasn’t in the mood to showing anyone around. The manager took me to the back room, where this really strange guy was sitting in a chair. I couldn’t described him. He had dark brown hair, he was really tall and thin, and looked to be about my age. He was wearing a black and white shirt and with jeans. The guy didn’t even speak yet, and already something about him gave me the creeps. When I saw him, I thought that I was dealing with an emo loner kid, with the dark hair and colorless choice of fashion, but when he saw me he sprang up from his chair and eagerly shook my hand. Appearances can be misleading I guess. He introduced himself as simply “Mark” and told me he moved here about a week ago. The second he started talking I noticed that he sounded really strange. I couldn’t describe it. It wasn’t creepy per say, in fact it was kind of cute, but still weird. He had what sounded like an accent, even though he insisted that he was born in LA. I can only describe it as a British accent fused together with Scottish and Irish, with maybe a hint of Indian or Russian in there. It was strange to say the least. Anyway, I gave Mark a tour of the place. In case you didn’t know, Disneyland has these really cool tunnels under the park so that characters can go to assigned places quickly without pushing through the crowd, so we started down there. While we were walking, I noticed that Mark was doing something with his hands. Looking back now, he probably had autism or some sort of mental condition, and that “accent” was probably some sort of speech impediment or something. As we were walking, this guy was giving me his entire backstory, about how he was born in California, moved to Arizona when he was three, moved to Texas when he was about 4, moved to Utah when he was about 8, moved to Oregon when he was 11, and then moved to Kansas when he was 16. He said that he worked at a theme park called “worlds of fun”or something like that, and mainly dressed up as characters. When he had to move back to California for college, he decided to get a job at Disney. He just went on and on and on and on. I mean, I was just giving him a tour of the tunnels, it’s not like this was his internship or something. At the end of the tour, he asked when he could start. I told him he could come back around 4 pm tomorrow, and that was that. He just left without saying thank you or goodbye. I went back to my dorm at the end of the day. I didn’t want to be rude, but I though Mark was a freak. He just kept going on about his job as a walk around character at that theme park. It was boring but weird. It was like he was obsessed about being inside those costumes. What? Why? Those things are the worst, and I always HATED the days I would have to get into those costumes. However, he described it as if it was a fun and thrilling experience. Whatever, I thought. I wouldn’t have to worry about it until the next day.

The next day, I got to the park around 3:30 pm. My manager, Paul, told me that Mark was supposed to be in the costumes all day, and that I supposed to check in on him to see how he was doing. Great. Now I have to babysit this guy. But, all day? He’s going to be inside those things all day? Why would he do that? Anyway, even though I told Mark to come at 4, he showed up around 3:45. He said something about not wanting to be late on his first day. I got him inside a suit, which was Donald Duck. I told him that his meet and greet area would be in Main Street from 4:05 til 5:15pm. I worked in space mountain and splash mountain until around 5:10, because I had to check on him. I went to Main Street, and found his meet and greet, and sort of watched him. He was doing a good job. It kind of amazed me. He gave every single child a hug, signed autographs, and wouldn’t move on to another child until he hugged or interacted with the child he was with. He was more determined to meet the children than the children were to meet him. At 5:15, I brought him back into the dressing rooms. But it was really weird. The costume actually looked kind of dirty, and the legs were more detailed than I remembered it being. I tried to get the head off, but it was like it was stuck. What was really weird was the fact that the head felt softer than usual. After about 20 seconds of trying to get the head off, it finally did. Mark didn’t even look phased. He didn’t look hot, he didn’t look miserable, he didn’t even look discomforted. He eagerly put on his next suit, which was Goofy. I asked him why the head was stuck, and he just told me to not worry about it. His next meet and greet was in Toon Town, from 5:40 to 7:45pm. Damn. Two hours in that thing? He had to be miserable. I worked at splash mountain and it’s a small world, and left about 20 minutes early to watch Mark. It was like he was a completely different person. He jumped around and acted, well, goofy. He hugged all the kids and signed autographs, and even played with the children. It was a amazing but weird sight. There had to be like 5 families up there at a time, and he wouldn’t let them leave until every child was hugged or interacted with. After about 10 minutes of this, I pulled him aside. He was actually struggling to get back to the kids. I eventually had to take his arm like a little kid, and he was pulling so hard that I thought that his arm would come clean off. Great. Now people were staring. He was making a scene, some families even left the area. I finally managed to pull him aside. I told him how unprofessional he was acting, and tried to explain to him that he couldn’t keep families there because they just want to enjoy their day. He just nodded goofily. He didn’t even say something or acknowledged that he was listening. He walked back to the kids and, what a surprise, he kept the families there. What was he doing? I mean, I know that actors have to keep character, but this was almost too in character. I know that he probably just didn’t want children to feel left out, but there’s a difference between being inclusive and straight up keeping families hostage. At the end of his shift, we went back to the dressing rooms. I asked him what happened up there, but he didn’t even say anything. I tried to take off the head so that I knew he was listening to me. Again, it was stuck. This was getting really weird. After about a minute, it finally came off. Once again, Mark wasn’t even sweating or looked any way discomforted. He just looked like he did before he got the costume on. I asked him what happened, and he just said that he wanted to be interactive. I tried to explain to him that he can be interactive without holding families against their will. I also explained to him that if an employee tells him to do something, don’t make a scene because that’s just embarrassing for him and the employee. He agreed, and put on his next suit. Minnie. I chuckled a bit. I didn’t mean the guy any harm, but he has just been way too happy about theses costumes. This HAD to get him to be a little discomforted. I told him to be in Fantasyland from 8:25 till 9:00pm, then he could leave for the day. I worked concessions in Tomorrowland and then walked to Fantasyland around 8:15. This time, I was a bit creeped out. He was still hugging kids and giving autographs, but he was moving way to realistically. I mean, of coarse it was realistic, he was in a costume, but he was acting a little too feminine. He was curtsying, he was clapping like a little girl, he was jumping up and down. What the fuck? This was way too real, even in acting standards. I tried to tell myself to just go back to concessions and come back later, but I couldn’t look away. What was he doing? Even the girls don’t act like this when they’re in that suit. This wasn’t a stage show. He didn’t have to be acting like this. At 8:25, we walked back to the dressing rooms together. This took a little bit longer, because he kept waving at people and hugging children. “You can stop now, you know” I told him, but he just kept blowing kisses and waving. We finally made it back to the fitting rooms. Finally he could stop. But, he was still acting feminine. “Dude, it’s fine, we’re in an employees only room, you can stop” I said. He just wouldn’t. I couldn’t take it anymore, and tried to remove the costume. The head, once again, wouldn’t come off. After a while, it still wouldn’t come off. It was 9:15 at this point. I was supposed to be on my way to my next shift. Finally I just tugged really hard, but Mark just fell back. I was shocked when I saw a small dark spot on the mouth of the mask. It was strange. It looked like a bruise. I finally tried to pull it off one last time, and it finally did. “Ow” Mark said. He just got kind of mad and asked what I did that for. I then explained to him the times and places that he did and didn’t have to be in character. He just told me that he chooses to be in character when he wants to. “Dude, calm down, it’s just a act” I said. “It’s not an act to me” he replied. He then left. What the fuck? What did that supposed to mean? 

I clocked out of work around 10:00pm. On my way home, I couldn’t get what Mark said out of my head. What did he mean? Of course it’s an act, what else would it be? That night, when I got to my dorm room, I was still thinking about it. In fact, that whole day was weird. How Donald’s legs were more detailed than usual, how he was acting when he was in the Goofy and Minnie suits, how the Minnie mask bruised when it fell. What was all of that? I heard of good acting, but this was almost too good. It would make Heath Ledger shake in his boots. If he wants to act like that, he should just keep it on broadway or something. Curious, I looked at his schedule. It was a Saturday, so me and him would be showing up to work early. He had Minnie first thing in the morning, he had Pooh at around 9:30, he had Dopey around 12:15, a lunch break at 2:45, and would end the day with Pluto at 3:30. Geez, he was going home early. What pained me was the fact that I had to check in on him during those times. I just went to sleep after that.

I got there at 7:00am the next day. When I got into the employee room, the manager came up to me. He told me that parents had complaints about Mark. He told me that Mark was whispering into kid’s ears, and at times refused to let the kids leave. That kind of creeped me out a bit. But, I was just an employee. Why was he telling me this? Then what he said next made me want to scream in anger. He told me that I had to watch Mark that ENTIRE DAY. Great. Just great. My job went from mediocre theme park shifts to watching characters dance. I told the manager that I wasn’t interested in babysitting this guy, but he told me I had to. I asked him when I could stop, and he told me to stop watching him when instructed. He then left. What? What did my job just become? Stop watching him when instructed? What, is he a pedophile in disguise? That wouldn’t surprise me, since he has that uncanny obsession with suits. Mark came around 7:15. I told him I would be watching him all day, and he got really excited. I asked him why. He just told me that it’s great to have an audience. I told him that I knew what he was doing, and to stop whispering into kid’s ears, and that if a kid wants to leave then they can leave. He just nodded. That kind of pissed me off. Nodding doesn’t tell me shit. I got him into the Minnie costume. Great. I have to watch his uncanny performance again. We got to Main Street and, as expected, he started acting all feminine again. I didn’t understand it. I couldn’t. Watching him in that Minnie suit was like watching a mistake that keeps piling up. I just couldn’t look away. At around 9:15, we went back to the fitting room. I didn’t even try to take the head off again. Mark kept pointing to his head, but I just shook mine. He then just sat and waited for me. Really? You’re that much in character? You can’t be bothered to take your own mask off? I finally gave in and just tried to get it off. Of coarse, it gave me the same bullshit as last time. He was sitting down the whole time, so he didn’t even help. I just put my foot between his legs and continued to pull. However, my foot slipped into his groin and I fell. I was kind of sorry for him, but hopefully a good kick in the balls would get him to come back to reality. Nope. Nothing. He didn’t even react. I tried kicking him again. I didn’t even feel anything down there. Again, nothing. I just gave up and tried pulling the mask off again. It came off. While he was getting out of the suit, I kicked him in the balls one last time. He actually yelped and fell to the floor. He was not happy. He started cussing at me and asked why I did that. We just put him in the Pooh suit and we continued the day. I watched him until 12:00, got him into the dopey suit, and watched him again until 2:35. We went down to the cafeteria and I had lunch with him. I asked him what the deal was with the Minnie suit. That’s when he got mad again and asked me why I kicked him in the groin. I told him I kicked him because I kicked him 2 times before and he wasn’t giving a reaction. He just told me that he was too in character. I mentioned how when I kicked him the second time, I didn’t feel anything near his groin. He just told me that it comes and goes, and then left. What the fuck? Comes and goes? I had enough at that point. What was he smoking to act like that? 

Finally, it was the end of the day. At least for Mark. I still had about 7 more hours of my shift. This time, he was Pluto. That didn’t seem to bad. It was just Pluto after all. Surprisingly, Mark kind of looked upset. He said that he didn’t do well in animal costumes. I laughed. Almost all of the costumes he was in were animals. He said that Pluto was pure dog. Not anthro, a pure, wild dog. I told him not to worry and just deal with it. He nodded and got in the suit. That’s when I noticed that when we walked, he was waving his arms in front of him, as if he was walking on all fours. Nothing really surprised me at that point. He was probably “too into character” or some bullshit like that. But, he was acting kind of weird. I mean, weirder than before. He was chasing birds and barking like a dog. He wasn’t supposed to talk, and he didn’t talk before, but he was doing it anyway. I just couldn’t understand it. He wasn’t interacting with kids. He just laid on his back and sat like a dog. It was kind of unnerving. He was actually scaring kids, and parents definitely looked concerned. It was weird until he started barking at this little girl. He just kept barking, and it sounded so real too. The mom was trying to take the girl away, but Mark had an iron tight grip on the girl. I finally went up to Mark and told him to stop. He just barked at me and wouldn’t let go. I tried prying them apart, but he just wouldn’t let go. “Stop!” I yelled. He just growled and started pulling the girl away. Me and the mom chased after him. The girl was sobbing at this point, and everyone watched and pointed. Great. Now we have an Goofy repeat on our hands. I finally ran up to him and pushed him away. “Stop man! Can’t you see you’re scaring her? stop!” I yelled. I pushed him away even farther, only this time, something was off. It didn’t feel like a person was underneath the costume. It felt like I was pushing an actual giant dog. I watched the terrified girl and her mom walk away, when I felt something push me. Hard. I turned around and saw mark looking down. No way. He wasn’t trying to start a fight was he? “Dude! Stop the act! Your just embarrassing yourself!” I yelled. That’s when Mark did something that will haunt me forever. The irises on the Pluto costume, actually moved. I didn’t even know they could do that. The irises looked up at me. I heard faint growling. Mark swiped at me, and it felt like something scratched me. I was bleeding. “This isn’t an act is it?” I asked in a terrifying manner. Mark just growled at me. That’s when I realized what was going on. He literally became one with the character. I wasn’t watching Mark act feminine, I was watching Minnie. I wasn’t pulling Mark away from those families, I was pulling Goofy away. It wasn’t Mark who was standing in front of me. It was Pluto. Pluto started to walk slowly towards me. This has to be a prank. I had to be on one of those reality prank shows. But where were the cameras? How were they filming us? “Mark?” I asked in a hopeful manner, wanting, no, hoping that he would give it up and say it was all a act and that he was really a host of some new prank show. But no. Pluto started barking at me, and I ran. I pushed through the crowds, trying to find an entrance to the tunnels. I looked behind me. Pluto was on my tail, moving faster than I ever thought possible. I thought that he would actually catch up to me. I entered the tunnels and entered the employee break room. Fuck! I put myself in a really dangerous position. Pluto entered the room, and I crouched in the corner. What was I doing? I just trapped myself! I’m supposed to be defending myself! I had a reputation as the tough guy, and now look at me, crouched in the corner like a toddler in timeout. Pluto opened his mouth, wider than I ever thought possible. I looked inside. There was no sign of Mark or any human in there. I was staring into the void of Pluto’s throat. This is it. This is how it ends. I’m going to die. At that moment, a bunch of cops busted in and my manager followed. They put Pluto in handcuffs, and pulled on the head with such force that it revealed Mark underneath. They arrested him. I didn’t understand what the hell I just witnessed. I told the manager what happened, and he just laughed at me. He told me that Mark was getting arrested for harassment of guests and employees. Great. No one believed me. Was I going crazy? There was no way that no one saw what I did. He scratched and growled and looked at me in front of hundreds of people. Someone had to have seen what I saw. But nope. No one.

Mark was arrested and fired on the spot. I quit my job the day after his trial. I just couldn’t believe what I saw. How was he able to do that? Was he just that good at acting or did he physically become all of those characters? It was strange. Was it just harmless trolling before it’s time? Or something supernatural or more sinister? I will probably never understand it."
dr9jc9,3,2019-11-03,"Top Ten DuckTales Characters(WARNING: Fans who hate the reboot, this is about the reboot. Please give it a chance, but just letting you know)",DuckTalesReeeee,ducktales2017,https://www.reddit.com/r/ducktales2017/comments/dr9jc9/top_ten_ducktales_characterswarning_fans_who_hate/,"#10-Lena
Lena is a sarcastic yet funny character added to the reboot in 2017. She calls Magica De Spell her aunt, although she is actually Magica’s shadow. She is not, however, evil and is actually Webby’s best friend and cares for her dearly.
#9-Violet
Violet was introduced in Season 2 in the episode “Friendship Hates Magic”. She is very smart and is a huge nerd, and many ship her with boy nerd Huey. She is another one of Webby’s best friends, but is not as protective of her as Lena.
#9-Fenton
Fenton Crackshell Calbelela used to be an intern working for Gyro Gearloose, but is now paid by Scrooge McDuck to be GizmoDuck, the city of Duckburg’s finest hero. Fenton is not in many episodes, but when he is in the show, he is quite a funny character.
#8-Magica
Magica De Spell is Scrooge’s greatest enemy, but is extremely hilarious when she tries to be evil. It is very funny how she can switch from being really petty to vile and cruel. She can get worked up over small things, and she is funny at first, but sometimes goes on an evil rampage.
#7-Beakly
Bentina Beakly is Scrooge’s housekeeper and Webby’s grandmother. My question is, if Webby is Shrooges honorary great niece, is Beakly technically his honorary sister? Whatever. Beakly is very overprotective of Webby and kept her in the mansion her whole life. Unlike her character in the original DuckTales, she is a good fighter and used to be a spy working for an agency called S.H.U.S.H. I have literally no idea what it stands for.
#6-Big Time Beagle
Big Time is probably the funniest Beagle Boy of all time. He is extremely stupid and has the stupidest plans. His greatest feat was most likely when Ma Beagle kicked him out of the gang, so he teamed up with hundreds of spiders. He was accepted back in the Beagle Boys after that crazy stunt.
#5-Donald
Donald is hilarious and he’s a huge klutz. When he gets mad, he can be a mess. But when someone tries to hurt his boys, he will unleash the power of a thousand suns upon them and they will regret even existing.
#4-Webby
Webby is much more of an important character in the new DuckTales. In the old one she seemed kind of baby-like, but now she is an amazing adventurer. She is in many ships, including her best friend Lena, but I personally ship her with Dewey. Growing up with her granny and living Scrooge’s mansion, she learned to be an amazing fighter and can get out of almost any situation. She can be socially awkward, but Dewey is helping her get better at making friends.
#3-Louie
Louie is literally me, minus the scheming. He tries to find any way he can to work around, well, work and still get rich. He bonds specially with Scrooge, maybe because of their similar love for money. Louie is also very lazy, unlike his uncle, and would rather sit on the couch on his phone than go out on an adventure, unless he gets lot of money from it!
#2-Dewey
Dewey is my literal idol. He is everything I wish I was. He is extremely brave and not at all scared to jump into danger, especially to help his family. He spends lots of time looking for his mom, mostly because he has no adult to bond with without her. When they are reunited, they bond with each other almost instantly, as they are so much like each other.
#1-HUEY
Huey is my FAVORITE character of all time. He is such a nerd, and that is adorable! He is extremely responsible and helps keep his family safe. He loves party planning, and I personally think he’s really good at it. He bonds personally with his Uncle Donald, maybe because they are both responsible and keep his twin brothers- Louie and Dewey- from getting themselves killed. Okay, you caught me. I have a HUGE crush on him. He’s just an adorable little dork, who couldn’t fall for him? Sorry for wasting your time with my fangirling. Bai!!"
drcizk,2,2019-11-03,The Facade,HeadbangingSiren,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/drcizk/the_facade/,"I'm in grad school and have to dress in business casual clothing to be allowed into class every day. I have a paid internship in my field of study. I'm physically beautiful. Strangers tell me I'm ""stunning"" or ""gorgeous"", or tell me they like my hair. I've gotten multiple comments on my skin. MY FUCKING SKIN FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. Let's face it, I'm hot. And I have some great tattoos people constantly ask about. Lovers tell me that I smell amazing, taste amazing.. no matter if I just got out of the shower or came home from the gym. They stare at me naked, smile, and say lovely things, and keep staring. People readily tell me their problems and most private thoughts; they say I'm easy to talk to. I live in my own apartment in a great part of town. Both of my parents are alive and well, my dad's girlfriend is amazing, I'm super close with my sister and I adore her. I have tight friends that would do anything for me if I asked. I have 2 snakes and a pet cat that loves me. My car is a beautiful piece of machinery that I adore. My hands knit beautiful garments, sew beautiful quilts, draw enticing mandalas, and give great massages.

I struggle to get out of bed every morning and want to peel my skin off instead of putting on clothes. My grades are terrible and I'm just barely scraping by in all my classes. My peer reviews at work said my knowledge-base was up to par, but ""she lacks initiative"" and ""she doesn't seem like she's listening"" and ""always in a pleasant mood, but standoffish"". I don't like going in public places because I feel stared at and awkward. Having passing conversations wigs me out and I don't want to say something too weird. I love other people's stories because it makes me feel less alone drifting in my sea of grey, if just for a moment. Going to the gym doesn't happen often enough because of one reason or another. My place is a mess from putting things down and having no motivation to get them in order. There's food in my fridge from 3-nope-5 months ago that I don't dare try to clean up. I either under or over eat and haven't cooked for myself in weeks. I need to get an inspection and an oil change but can't do that because I need to go home and crawl in bed before I start tearing up where people can see. I have a pile of parking tickets because I was too busy sobbing to remember to switch sides of the street. Gum, altoids, and old spice are the only reason people around me probably think I clean any part of myself. My hair is in a bun because I wanted to change up my style (but really I just haven't washed it in 2 weeks).

Sometimes I ask myself why I'm so bad at life. Other times I ask myself why I'm so good at hiding that I'm so bad at life. I've never called in sick, missed a day of class or work because I was too disabled to get up. I suck at being depressed too.

I have everything going for me. Everything. Except this thing in my head constantly telling me that I'm not enough, I'll never be enough, and if I ever were, it would be a lie. I don't deserve my life and someone who can actually enjoy it fully should take over. I'm not worth the effort. That I should just fade away."
drckda,4,2019-11-03,I'm going insane as a college grad who can't find a well paying job while living at home with my parents with little to no friends to have fun with on a regular basis.,offmychest1418,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/drckda/im_going_insane_as_a_college_grad_who_cant_find_a/," A few notes to start:

* **Yes, before anyone says it, I realize how lucky I am to have a place to live rent free with parents willing to let stay as long as needed. I'm just very frustrated with things right now.**
* **My major was Professional Writing/English and a minor in public relations. I'm really dumb for not actively joining writing clubs/publishing anything. My ultimate goal has always been to publish a book series that I've been slowly working on for a few years**
* **The reason I don't write is like I should is that I can't focus when I'm stressed and anxious all the time. These feelings have been endless for the past year.**

**My Job Situation:**

I left school in May 2018 to return home and finish an internship to fully graduate in August 2018. Through May 2018 - September 2018, I struggled in getting a job. Let alone even any interviews. While I still retained my part-time restaurant job that I had for years, the pay and hours and setting just wasn't cutting it. I eventually landed a job scanning and archiving records. While not what I wanted, it was fine for the time being. I was eventually fired after about a month. I admit mistakes were made on my end, but I also never felt very welcomed, and work atmosphere and co-workers just didn't help the situation. I began searching anew for literally anything and wound back at my hold part time job. Eventually I got another part time job. I was working shit hours and never having a full Friday night- Sunday weekend which made making rare plans impossible over the summer with friends.

Finally in July of 2019, through a job agency, I finally got a full time position making decent pay, but working in call center. Something I learned wasn't easy, even after 5 weeks of training. While I personally felt I struggled here and there, I felt I was doing ok as well. The hours weren't horrible, but not great. I didn't know I had to work every single Saturday 8-5 until after training. I was very unhappy over this. Eventually my hours were cut to 30 and about 3 weeks ago, I was laid off because of the slow season. I began searching for jobs AGAIN, and absolutely nothing got back to me that I was remotely interested in. My job agency though was able to get me a job at another call center for lower pay, but full time. My training starts in December. This job still isn't enough to for me to move out and live on. In the mean time, I'm once again back at my awful high school restaurant job working nights and weekends.

I live in a really terrible area for writing based jobs. I live in the middle of nowhere where I need to drive 20+ minutes to get to anywhere with actual business. The bigger cities I could reach out to range between 40 min - 2 hr+ commutes. And so far, entry level based positions in what I'm looking for aren't really worth it if I have to pay to live in bigger cities. There are absolutely no publishing houses in my local area.

I've been striving to make my way into a content marketing/

**Living at Home Situation**

Living at home for the past year with my parents after being completely independent and doing things my way, on my own time when I choose to for the past 4 years, has been driving me insane.

* At school, my room would turn into a disorganized mess due to stress. The same is happening at home and bothers my mom (she has slowly grown to understand why at least).
* I have reverted into my high school self where my Mom just does everything from doing my laundry (even though I told I would to mine, she insisted she would just do it, even though I hear her complain on occasion to herself how much laundry I have some weeks)
   * I don't like losing this independence that I had, but my Mom makes it so easy, if anyone can relate to that at all
* My Mom just barges into my room when my door is closed, and simply doesn't shut it all the way sometimes. At school, my friends knocked.
* My parents refuse to upgrade to a better internet package (they have been grandfathered in to  the same plan they have had for YEARS) , meaning I can't even play my games online with friends without a disgusting amount of lag. I have even told them that I would pay for it, but they don't care because ""it works just fine for them"".
* My Mom just nags me in general about things. She is also anxious as well about things, and just makes me more anxious on certain things as well.
* I'm often in my room, and when I finally leave, I'm met with the sarcastic ""you've finally left your cave"" joke. Or ""you need to get out of this cave"" comments...even though aside from work, I have no where else to be
* My Dad is horrible when it comes to trying to have empathy and understanding. He complains all the time and can be a bit judgmental about people. I'm personally struggling with life right now, and my Dad just isn't making things easier.
* I'm a bisexual male who did things in college, but now that I'm at home, I can't get out to meet guys (it's waaaay to many questions/lies that I would get myself caught up in). My parents have no idea and I have desire to tell them until I move out, but I can't move out until I get well paying job that allows me to do so.
* I have 0 friends in this area. All my friends from college are really spread out between 40min - 2hrs, making weekend get together really hard on a normal basis, on top of everyone's own schedules. There's next to nothing to do where I live, and given my work hours, it's hard to pursue a weekly club activity or something. I'm very lonely.
* I'm 24. My parents are in there 50's. There is a lot that we don't have in common and they look at the world in a much different way that I do. I hate being around them so often. It's destroying my relationship with them. I love them, but I desperately need my own apartment to escape to. But the my job search blows and I feel insanely hopeless in my current situation.

With crushing anxiety and stress, it scares me and depresses me that I'm simply not living while I'm young enough to enjoy it. I never had a friend group until college, but now all my college friends are separated. I don't have a sex life/dating life because I can't deal with that with the questions and accusations from my parents while living at home.

**Thank you so much to anyone who has chosen to read this and made comment to help me, or at least reassure me things will get better. I really needed to get this off my chest to a big group.**"

On XC/Track team. Girlfriend of one year. Just had excellent internship for a research faculty that I could land a job at this spring. History of depression.

Issue: I have a very long list of things that I don’t like about myself. Very clearly, I can write them down, talk about them, and even discuss solutions to my problems. And even though I consider myself to be emotionally aware and a good problem solver... I can’t seem to really address issues in my life head on. I feel as though since the internship and seeing a proper and high quality job/pay(26 for a 40hr/wk 12 wk research assistant) has caused me to self sabotage because I don’t want to move on to bigger things in my life.

Recently I’ve seen myself spiral down to bad grades, inconsistent and embarrassing performances in running, and frequently causing arguments between my girlfriend and I.

I made a huge list of things I don’t like about myself and at the top of the list in no particular order are:

1. Victimizing myself in arguments/flipping situations so that I am right.
2. Bad friend/teammate/family member.
3. Ignoring big issues and focusing on minute details.

At times I feel like I’m too smart too be depressed... I see the problems I have and I can layout a plan to solve them... but ultimately I just ignore them.

I’m asking for advice on how to get through and onto a more stable life."

YOGI TRACY  


by  


Joe Doe  


Part 2  


""Coffle up!  Turn Left!  Door!""  


Naked, her ankles chained to the girls in front and behind, her  
wrists cuffed behind her back, Tracy scampered naked down the  
hallway and into the back alley, her chain jingling like sleigh  
bells, her breasts and bottom bouncing.  


Two grinning garbage men were outside, and she had no choice but  
to jiggle and jangle past them.  


She scooted up to a wooden ramp, which led up to a wire mesh cage  
on the back of an open-air flatbed truck, which would be used to  
transport the slaves back to the slave processing center.  


As each girl reached the bottom of the ramp, a college intern with  
a barcode reader scanned the back of the girl's collar, or the code  
lasered onto her arm or hand.  


PING!  The smiling intern slapped the girl hard on her bare ass,  
and she scampered up the ramp.  


PING!  Slap!  A cute little redhead jiggled up the ramp.  


PING!  Slap!  Run, Goldilocks, run!  


PING!  Slap!  ""Nice butt!"" the intern chuckled.  Up the ramp!  


\#5.  Tracy swallowed.  One more to go.  PING!  SLAP!  Up the ramp!  


When Tracy's collar was scanned, there was no PING!  Instead, there  
was a loud BUZZ!    


Tracy was a bad egg.  


""Why is your number not in my system?"" the confused young man asked.  


""Because I'm not a slave girl,"" Tracy explained.  ""I was taking a  
shower and got mixed in with the other girls.  The trainer inside  
put me in a collar, but said I should talk to Mr. Chambers.  My  
name is Tracy Smith.  I know Mr. Chambers.""  


""Miss Smith?"" the young man said.  ""I know you.  My name is Kevin  
O'Reiley.  You taught me English.""  


Tracy tugged at her cuffs in a desperate -- and entirely futile --  
effort to cover herself, as her former student eyed her naked body.    


Damn!  Did every boy she ever taught have to get a job with the  
slave authority?  


The young man looked a bit puzzled, but dutifully waved over his  
boss, Mr. Chambers.  ""No, Kevin,"" she said.  ""You don't have to  
call him over.  Just tell him, and you can....""  


Too late!  To her horror, Kevin disappeared for a moment, then  
brought back not only Mr. Chambers, but John, too.    


Tracy swallowed.  Mr. Chambers had a mean-looking slave crop in his  
right hand.  


Tracy, blushing furiously, re-explained things.  Chambers was all  
smiles, as his eyes danced up and down her naked, squirming body.    


""So, poor little Tracy lost her clothes!"" Chambers snickered.    
""That wasn't very bright of you, now was it?""  


""No, sir,"" Tracy said, looking down.  


Tracy felt a surge of fear as Mr. Chambers, displeased with her  
answer, lifted her chin with the tip of his crop.  


""No, MASTER,"" she said, correcting herself.  


""So what is she, John?"" Chambers said.  ""Free or slave?""  


""She is a free woman,"" John said quietly.  ""She must be released.""    


Tracy's heart surged with joy.  She was free!  She was free!  


""It's your decision, of course, but let's not be too hasty,""  
Chambers purred.  ""If she is a free woman masquerading as a  
slave, her punishment should be the collar.  And if she is a  
slave masquerading as a free woman, her punishment should be  
the whip.  Which are you, Tracy?""  


Tracy looked at him, dumbfounded.  What sort of choice was that?  


""See?"" Chambers said.  ""Even the girl does not know.  We must  
examine this matter more closely.""  


Tracy blushed, for both men were already looking at her naked body  
very closely indeed.  


""She is slave hot, Master,"" the girl next to Tracy sing-songed,  
causing the other girls in the coffle to titter.    


""Silence!"" John barked, causing the slaves to fall silent.  ""This  
woman must be released.  Binding position.""  


Each of the girls in the coffle, Tracy included, fell to their  
bellies, with their ankles raised in the air.  Tracy gasped as  
she felt John free her wrist and ankle fetters.  


""I'm free!"" she gasped.  


""Yes,"" John replied.  ""You are free.""  


""For the moment,"" Chambers said tersely.  ""Step forward for  
examination, so we that we may keep loading your sisters!""  


The word ""examination"" scared Tracy, as did the reference to the  
naked slave girls as ""sisters.""    


Covering herself with her hands, she stepped away from the coffle.    


Behind her, Kevin continued his work.  


Ping!  Slap!    


Ping! Slap!  


""Display!"" Chambers said.  Tracy hesitated, but then he snapped his  
fingers.  Humiliated beyond words, Tracy spread her legs and put  
her hands atop her head.  


""Before you free her, John, let's see what she can do,"" Chambers  
suggested, his voice a model of reasonableness.  ""You put her  
through slave paces in class, but she was clothed, and the  
merchandise was difficult to see.  How about putting her through  
the paces properly, the way a slave girl should be: naked, except  
for her collar?""  


John hesitated.    


""Consider this part of your performance evaluation, John,"" Chambers  
said, prodding.  ""Show me what the girl...and you...can do.""  


""I'm sorry, Tracy,"" John said. ""Mr. Chambers is my boss, and this  
is my profession.  In English class, you were strict with me.  Now  
I must be strict with you.""  


John's apology gave Tracy the gumption to glare at the smiling Mr.  
Chambers.  She was about to speak to him, but her rebellion was  
short-lived.  
   
""Bara!"" John snapped.  


Tracy twirled gracefully, spinning onto her belly, crossing her  
arms and legs behind her.  


""Belly!"" John said.  


Tracy put her arms at her sides and spread her legs.  


""Now that's Grade A slave pussy!"" Chambers enthused, as Tracy  
blushed.  


""Bracelets!""  


Tracy knelt, legs spread, arms behind her back, looking up at John  
with desperate, longing eyes.  But he merely smiled at the  
gracefulness of Tracy's transition.  


""Crawl!""  


Tracy dropped to all fours, lowered her head, and slowly crawled  
to John's feet.  


""She crawls well,"" Chambers said.  ""It is natural for her.""  


""Obeisance!"" John snapped.  


Tracy extended her tongue out of her mouth, licking the dust and  
dirt off the toe of John's boot.  


""Punishment!""  


Tracy did not hesitate.  She rose, turned, and bent over, placing  
her hands flat on the ground, and raising her bottom high for  
John's crop.  


""Check her out, John,"" Chambers urged.  ""See if she is slave-wet.""  


Tracy gasped as she felt John's fingers slide down her spine, into  
the crack of her bottom, then deep between her legs.    


Chambers chuckled as John worked his fingers in and out of the  
gasping Tracy.  


""She is wet,"" John said.  ""She juices my hand, like a ripe and  
tasty peach.""  


It was true!  Tracy nearly fell over, groaning and moaning through  
her first-ever slave orgasm.  


""You are hot,"" John said.    


""Yes, feel her hot, wet slave meat in your fingers,"" Chambers  
chuckled.  ""Think of the fun you'll have, John, putting the  
little slut through her paces on the block.  Help me out here,  
and I think there may be a auctioneer's commission in it for you.""  


Tracy gasped as John continued to stroke her.  ""But I am free,  
Master,"" she whimpered.  


Behind her, the last of the girls was being led onto the truck.    


""Me, too, master!"" one of the girls mocked.  ""I am free.  I was  
just showering, and someone took my leotard.""    


Tracy felt a surge of helpless frustration as the other slave girls  
laughed at her.    


Turning, another slave girl in the coffle showed John a small but  
lovely cursive ""K"" on her left bottom cheek.  ""I lost my clothes,  
I don't know how.  Then some master branded his mark on my bottom.""  


Soon, all the girls joined in on the mockery.  


""I am free, too, Master.""  


""Yes, free me.  It is a terrible mistake.  I lost my clothes, and  
now I am chained like a slave.""  


Chambers joined in the laughter.  ""You see, John, what happens when  
you're weak?  The slave girls laugh at you.  No slave girl loves a  
weak master.  If we let this one out of her collar, we'll have to  
free all of them.  When word gets out that you're a weak master,  
you'll be finished.  Finished!""  


John bristled.  ""Word will not get out.  Perhaps I was mistaken  
about this one.""  


""Master!"" Tracy gasped, shuddering through her second orgasm on  
John's hand, as Chambers and the girls laughed at her.  


Amidst the laughter, John tapped his riding crop against Tracy's  
bare bottom.  


""I am free,"" Tracy whimpered, sounding much less definite than  
before.  


""Pretending to be free is a serious offense,"" John said.  ""I do not  
have time to deal with you, for I must get you back in coffle.  But  
this very day your bottom will feel my crop.""  


Tracy shivered as John tapped her bottom with his crop.  


""Rise, and join your sisters, slave girl,"" he said.  


""She's not in the system, sir,"" Kevin said.  


""What is your National Insurance Number, Tracy?"" Chambers asked.  


Tracy answered.  Confused, she watched as he typed it in.  ""See  
here, lad?  They simply haven't done the paperwork on her yet.    
But, if you type in her NIN, then drop her picture on the auction  
block icon....""  


A pleasant chime, known as a slave gong, sounded.    


""Collar!""  John barked.    


Without really thinking, Tracy lowered her head for the young man's  
scanning gun.  


Ping!  


""Congratulations, Slave Tracy!"" one of the girls on the truck  
shouted.  You are now one of us!""  


""Is it really that easy, sir?"" Kevin asked.  


""It is,"" Chambers replied.  ""At the processing center I will  
personally brand that big ass of hers.  There will be no  
further confusion of her status after that.""  


""But what if someone -- a friend, perhaps -- objects?"" Kevin asked.  


""Display!"" Chambers barked out.  Tracy, lifting her head, placed  
her hands on her head and spread her legs.  


She shuddered as Chambers reached between her widely splayed legs  
and began a slow, humiliating massage.  ""We will put her display  
video on the Internet, so everyone may enjoy watching John putting  
her through her paces.  If someone comes to inquire, I will simply  
refer them to her link in our online catalog, so they may see for  
themselves how juicy the little slave slut is.  It will be obvious  
that she is nothing more than collar meat, and, in her video, she  
will say as much.  Watch.""  


""What are you?"" he barked.  


In rote, without thinking, Tracy replied.  ""I am a slave, Master.""  


""Are your slave juices flowing?"" he asked.  


Again, the conditioning kicked in; Tracy was surprised that a few  
of her sisters shuffling along in the coffle behind her joined in.    


""YES, WE ARE SLAVE-JUICY AND YEARN FOR OUR MASTER'S TOUCH.""  


Chambers laughed.  ""Trust me; none of her female friends will vouch  
for the little slut after I show them how randy and slave hot she  
is.  For any woman associated with such a such slut might throw  
herself under suspicion as well.  As for her male friends, I may  
get their names off her cell phone, refer them to her video, and  
invite them down for inspections, so they can decide if they wish  
to bid on the merchandise.""  


Tears flowed down Tracy's cheeks even as the juices flowed down her  
legs.  He was right; a few of her female friends would feel sad for  
her, but all would forsake her.    


She wondered how many of the men she knew would come down to see  
her wiggle under her touch, a helpless, naked slave.  Most,  
probably.  And when her former students heard....  


Tracy hoped that Mr. Chambers was simply trying to scare her with  
his claim that he was going to brand her ""personally.""  But it was  
a well-known adage that ""slaves should never be threatened; slaves  
should be punished.""  There was no need to threaten a slave girl.    


John, not unkind, but not smiling, handed Tracy her wrist cuffs.    
""Take your wrist shackles, slave girl, and find your place in the  
coffle.  You do not need me, for you know what you are.  Find  
where you belong, and bind yourself.""  


Tracy tried to say something, but John snapped his crop across her  
bare bottom, hard.    


Before she knew what was happening, she was scampering up the  
wooden ramp and into the cage.  


""Slave girl Tracy!"" a girl shouted.  ""Welcome!""  


""I hope you like your collar, Tracy.  Because it's never coming  
off.""  


""Look at the lovely red welt on her bottom!""  


""The first of many, I'm sure.""  


""What's wrong, can't find your ankle shackles, slave girl?""  


""First she lost her clothes, and now she's lost her place!""  


The slave girls laughed and tittered, but John cut their revelry  
short.  ""Silence, slave wenches,"" he said.  ""Help her get into  
position, so the truck may leave.""  


At the command of their master, the other girl's helped Tracy to  
the middle of the crowded pack.  When she saw her ankle shackles  
waiting, she gasped.  


""Hurry, #6,"" John said.  ""Do not keep your master waiting.""  


Tracy quickly shackled her ankles.  Then, putting her wrists  
behind, she managed, with the help of the other slave girls,  
to click the cuffs closed.     


The girls pressed forward as the back of the slave cage was slid  
closed, then the cage was compressed, packing the slave girls  
tightly together.  Tracy was in the center of the gaggle of girls,  
sandwiched in tightly, her breasts pushing on the back of the girl  
in front of her.  It was uncomfortable, but at least she was warmer  
than the shivering girls who had to stand against the wire mesh,  
speeding down the highway naked and dripping from the showers as  
passing motorists honked their horns and shouted out their lewd  
comments.  


The truck jerked forward.  The mass of girls swayed slightly, but,  
packed in like sardines, did not fall.    


Slave Tracy, naked and chained, stood, bouncing up and down as the  
truck pulled onto the busy city street and rolled toward the slave  
center.  


Drivers honked and hooted, but Tracy's mind was elsewhere.  


She hoped her branding would be quick.    


Ever vain, Tracy hoped that Mr. Chambers would choose a flower  
brand, or a cursive letter, or something pretty and feminine.  


She hoped that John would not whip her more than she needed.  


But mostly she hoped that, when John displayed her on the auction  
block, she would perform her moves to perfection and make her  
masters proud.

I've completed two IT internships (8 months experience) and currently work full-time as a IT Support Analyst (2 months). My company has a Business Solutions team with two Business Solutions Analysts, with the potential to create an addition analyst role in the near future. I would like to grow into an analyst role, however I have no experience in the field.

I am researching certifications to help grow my knowledge and experience to gaining responsibilities of an entry level SAP business analyst. I currently communicate and document SAP related issues with end users and work with business analysts and programmers to provide solutions as one of my job responsibities. I do not have any experience with SAP, however I learned requirements analysis, design, and implementation of information systems in college and small project work.

Is the IIBA association a good place to start? Particularly, the Entry Certificate in Business Analysis (ECBA)?

What other certifications are relevant towards becoming a SAP Business Analyst?"

drdr1r,24,2019-11-04,My type is never interested in me,wemadethemachine,FemaleDatingStrategy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/drdr1r/my_type_is_never_interested_in_me/,"I really need to please speak about this honestly.  In the nearly two decades that this has been happening to me absolutely no one has ever allowed me to talk about it without getting angry or acting like I'm making it up.  As a result I have been entirely alone with this painful experience.  I almost started hanging out at RPW because I thought they were the only ones who would accept what I have to say, but I felt like I couldn't hack it with a lot of their practices.

It seems that I am attractive enough to use for sex, but too ugly to have a relationship with the men that I feel are on my level.

This brings up the question of whether I am wrong about my value and who is my equal match.  I'm genuinely not trying to punch above my weight, I truly want an equal.  But there aren't a lot of men who feel like they are on my level -- it's mostly boring, barely-employed, unattractive guys and maybe a few good-looking successful ones whom I almost never approach -- but when I find someone who I think is compatible with me he wants nothing to do with me.

So I must be wrong about myself, which considering that I am pursuing men will primarily mean that I am wrong about my appearance.  I've lived a very confusing life about where I stand in this regard.  The first experiences I had with men consisted of being used for sex and then having them make fun of my body/weight behind my back and refuse to acknowledge me when they saw me in person.  The confusing thing was that they would say both good and bad things about my appearance.  It was once reported to me by a guy that another guy had said about me ""she's hot"" and then in the same conversation made fun of me by placing his hands over his face and pushing on his cheeks to make them look fat, and then pantomiming giving a blow job.  (I wasn't even that fat I just wasn't stick thin like a lot of teenage girls.) 
 Anyone who hears me talk about this will say ""I'm so sorry that happened to you"" but I'm not sorry and I'm actually glad for it.  It's the only honesty I got in a situation that was clearly happening to me but no one would have admitted it if I had said something out loud, and if I had tried to discuss it with other people in my life I would have been treated like I was crazy and that it was my fault for being ""underconfident.""

This has happened to me in many different environments and in different cities.  A few years after the above incident, I moved to the city and thought I would finally have a normal pool of people in which to find my match.  I met a man on OkCupid (I was 21 and he was 30, if it matters) and he strung me along a lot and felt very manipulative even though I can't exactly name for you what he did wrong.  Anyway, there was one time, months later, when he came to the bar I was working at and I spoke to him for a few minutes even though we were not involved at that time.  A girl I worked with said to me, ""Is that your boyfriend?"" and I said no, and she said, ""Oh, because he looks like your boyfriend.""  How much above my own value could I be aiming if other people can see it too?  And yet, he didn't want me.

To be clear, I don't work at a bar now, and didn't work at one for very long, and even when I did I was also doing an unpaid internship.  I have a bachelor's degree and currently do office work (I don't want to give too many details here but I make more money than the majority of men I have managed to get dates with in the past couple of years).  I go to the gym 3-4 times per week and when I do I wear nicer, form-fitting workout clothes.  I'm currently 5'3"" 130 lbs.  A few years ago I was 118-120 lbs and I don't know that my experience was any better.  Maybe I have to be 110 lbs or less in order to be dateable?

I receive such confusing feedback.  Men my age think I'm too fat to date but I constantly receive comments from female coworkers about how skinny they think I am.  Even gay men tell me how cute they think I am and I even had one gay guy get absolutely furious that I did not want to hang out and ""be seen"" with him.  If I try to talk to anyone about this -- therapists, my mother, acquaintances, strangers on advice forums -- they act like I'm making it up, get angry, or cry like I hurt THEIR feelings about it.  That reaction weighs on me far more than one man's lack of interest.

I moved to a different city, which I am living in currently, and it's no different.  I don't like to do the pursuing for reasons that I know this forum understands, but in spite of that I recently have tried to softly initiate with a few men.  There was a man I introduced myself to about a year ago because we used to work at the same organization.  A month or two ago I was at a bar in my neighborhood and saw him working there.  Initially, he approached me by asking whether I worked at that organization and showing that he remembered me.  We talked about how his band was playing at that same bar the next day so I attended the show.  When I was walking in I walked by him and did not even see him there, but he greeted me, by name.  The next day I followed his bands Instagram and sent a quick message to say I liked the show.  He wrote back.  I then asked if he was going to another show the next day.  He said no.  I haven't heard from him again.

I know we could talk about whether I came on too strong.  But I also get criticism for not being open enough and for seeming like I don't want to talk to anyone.  My own father criticizes me for ""sitting there with a frown on [my] face"" and is convinced that the only reason I don't have a partner is because I have a bad attitude.  I made myself available to this guy, he knows where to contact me, and yet, he does not.  (I'm tired of the criticism of technology because it really could not be easier for him to contact me.  Do people really expect me to believe that it would be considered LESS demanding if he had to pick up the phone and make a call?  Texting is the least demanding thing.)

If he was interested, it wouldn't matter if I came on too strong or too weak or if I didn't do something perfectly.  When we want men to leave us alone, they won't even if we beg them!  If he didn't talk to me it's because he didn't want to, plain and simple.

The only approaches I ever get are from men who are wildly inappropriate for me.  Men who are 20 years older than me.  Men who are 10 years younger than me.  Men who can't dress themselves, who don't brush their teeth or wash their hands.  Men whom I have nothing in common with and erase everything I care about when they fill space by talking to me about nothing.  It makes me feel dirtied, like after all my hard work and depth and feeling I should give it up to any idiot that asks.  It feels polluting even when I'm not reproducing their genes.  If I also received a decent approach some of the time I might not feel that way but at this point I feel like a well-kept garbage receptacle.  Like if you raised and slaughtered an animal in order to eat it and instead of eating it you just gave it to the rodents.  This is what my family wishes for me, too.  Sometimes I think that this is what nature wishes for me, and why doesn't mother earth love me very much?  Because we are whole, just like nature, and they are not.  But here I am at the exact point of ""sex object,"" no more and no less either.

I usually don't do this, but I once swiped right on a man who was out of my league after seeing him on dating websites for like a year.  He asked me out, and on the date we talked all night.  After we finished our drinks I very well expected him to go right home and not be interested in meeting again.  But he asked me to continue on to a second bar.  He specifically said that he wanted to keep talking because he thought I was interesting.  That seems like a euphemism but he also chose to share with me that he liked my facial features and we had a conversation about how people have a facial ""type.""  After the date he told me that he was not interested in hanging out again.  Actually, there was a second guy after him who did the same thing, asking me to a second bar and not wanting to go out again.  Sure, maybe I end up doing something wrong at the second bar, but there have been plenty of people who bailed on me before they even got to the bar at all.  When I told my therapist about it she said ""maybe he just likes to go on dates with interesting women.""  Yeah right.  Why does she have to treat me like a fool?  The ""with you"" is silent and I can't have a productive conversation with someone who won't acknowledge that.

I see couples around and they ""look like a couple.""  And I think, where is my match?  And then I remember all the times in my life I have attempted to talk about this with people who were supposed to be on my side or who were supposed to be neutral, and they shut me down every time.  That's really the worst part.  Sometimes I just want to talk about my feelings, and sometimes I want to work through it and try to see if there are any solutions that I am missing.  But I am disallowed.  I'm not sure if that's because they know deep down that I am undesirable and don't want to admit it, or if they think I'm crazy, or what it is.  But it has been extremely isolating and fraught.  So, thank you for listening."
drds6v,0,2019-11-04,I love being Bipolar,yairof,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/drds6v/i_love_being_bipolar/,"I followed this subreddit in the hopes of finding like-minded individuals who could relate to me, unfortunately I have yet to find that here. I seem to always be a black sheep in almost everything in life. In my family, work and well life. This is a great subreddit though, people are passionate about helping each other out. I have learned of resources like Daylio to see how erratic my behavior has been. I have learned a lot from other people's experience here and this is just a post to kinda vent out my own experience. I have dealt with this condition for all my life and I did not even know I had it until pretty recently. About 2 or 3 years ago. **If you want the tldr just skip all this and you'll be surprised at how I managed to make such a simple thing into this very long post. I like to talk a lot as you'll find out.**

Everything started to make sense, at first I was in denial, but as I read the symptoms and my psychiatrist broke things down for me, it really started to click why I was the way I was. I'm not going to lie, it ain't easy. I have many days where I will blurt out negative and dangerous words about myself. Due to the verbal abuse of my childhood from my uncle and school bullies. I learned those words aren't really me talking and just remnants of the demons of my past. 

* I usually clench my fists and counter with ""No I am a great person and have a lot to live for. Never has there been someone like me. I am a loving soul who is on this Earth to do good."" 

I knew there was something wrong with me since my first psychiatrist visit in the Dominican Republic. I am American, but my mother and father were born there. I was about 17 I'd say. Maybe younger. I told the psychiatrist that I'm always depressed, I was shy, quiet and always in my own world playing video games for far too long. I told him as well under no circumstances will I take any medication. As my father had suffered a stroke recently that we would later find out accelerated his Alzheimer which he now has. I thought at the time the pills were the reason his mental faculties were waning. And that's why I was so against medication at that time. He instead wrote me a prescription for a book... the 7 habits of highly effective people. And this is where my obsession for knowledge began.

* I figured that whatever it is that I had, the solution to curing myself was hidden somewhere in books. If I read enough books maybe I could fix myself. Maybe I could stop being so pathetic and sad. Maybe I could live a happy life.

Fast forward 2 or 3 years I had my first real life-threatening manic episode. I couldn't land a job and my dad's condition worsened. I was so desperate to find a way to help my family that I started hitting up every single family member asking for wisdom or help in getting a job or some incoherent request for salvation from this hell I was living in. I was not eating and was about 98 pounds (I'm 5'7). I went outside and went to a cop and blurted some more incoherent shit. Next thing I know I'm in the hospital. I knew they were going to put me in a mental hospital and I begged my mom to take me away from there because all that they would do is drug me. 

* That is exactly what happened. It was by far the most dehumanizing experience of my entire life. And it only lasted a couple days but for me it felt like an eternity. My best friends and immediate family were the only people who visited me. My reputation from then on was completely in the gutter and people treated me differently. This is when I began to blurt out the most negative thoughts. To this day after 7 years, I still cannot control this impulse. I will say things like ""Kill myself"" or ""I'm a faggot"" or ""I'm such an idiot"". Either under my breath or in my mind or if I'm home I'll say it out loud. The system in place for mental health care is disgusting in this country. To think it use to be so much worse in the past. 

This is why I do not take medication. I do not trust doctors. I will only take medication under certain circumstances. It really only applies to sleep. But these are the reasons I prioritize sleep above all else.

1. If I cannot fall asleep.
   1. If an overwhelming sensation of what I call ""The weight of existence"" hits me where I fear not for my life but my loved one's lives. The thought that anyone I love can die at any minute. It has only happened a handful of times but this fear is so intense I cannot stand it and just want to sleep to reset my mind and go back to my normal self which is the only solution I find to this.
   2. If I am having an intense manic episode. (Hasn't happened in a long time). Only sleep will return me to my senses.

I also during my manic episode became unable to lie and worse yet unable to sleep, which is by far what I grew to hate the most about being Bipolar. I told my best friend's mother that we smoke weed. My Best friend was not too happy about that as he never wanted his mom to find out. We had a falling out and he said he never wanted to see me in his life. I tried to do things like bring him a case of beers. I apologized to no end. I do everything I can to make amends. To no avail. I come to the conclusion that the only way we can be friends again is if I become a better person and show him that I can change.

My mother then takes me to the Dominican Republic where we meet with a doctor who gives me the first medication I take for this disorder (I still had no idea I'm Bipolar). I gain a whopping 40 pounds within a month of taking this new medication. Something I really needed but within a month, thats pretty dangerous I imagine. It shows you the dangers of the medication they give us. I don't advocate for people to get off medication because it is an essential tool for living a productive life. It is simply just something that I have learned to live without. I get back to my city where I'm from and I go visit my friend. He sees me and takes a step back and is dumbfounded at how much weight I've gained. He still wants nothing to do with me, but he can tolerate my presence. His little brother is also my best friend and never got mad at me for any of the stupid stunts I pulled during my manic episodes. His friendship I cherish above all else and is a good reason I'm probably still alive today. Love is a powerful medicine.

I then get my first real job. My millionaire cousin took pity and gave me a job as a bag boy in his store. For a whopping 8 dollars an hour I would kill myself working for him carrying all types of heavy groceries down the conveyor belt and bagging groceries and helping people get it to their car. It was by far the worst job in my life and I got fired from it due to always showing up a bit late. I thank him to this day for teaching me the value of a dollar. I use to respect him, but have come to see him as a money hungry fake family member. He survived a brain tumor which shows how resilient he is but the way he treats some of his employees, I just can't respect a man like that. Many of my family members are rich. I am dirt poor and I can't lie I do not like them. I consider myself in that position, I would prioritize in helping rise all my family from poverty who showed the drive to do so like myself. Not through handouts but IDK, being treated like a crazy person by these people leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Kinda like how Thomas treated Joker. Most people will grow to fester a deep hatred. But I still love these people, I just wish they'd give me the opportunity to show them my skills.

Well after I got fired it was during the same week I got accepted into a career training program for inner city youth. Knowing now that if I do not do something and fast I will be destined to work shit jobs the rest of my life. Working with my cousin I would always tell them we'd work together one day as associates. This is where my current obsession with becoming a millionaire by 30 began. I came in and stated my objectives and why I chose to do this program. I want to retire my mom and dad so they no longer need to work. They spent all their money on me and my constant fuck ups. It became clear that the only way they are going to retire is if I pay them back by becoming successful.

I put my heart and soul into this program. I read two books that were key to my success in completing the program with the best internship they had to offer. The 48 Laws of Power. Think and Grow Rich. The combination of the two is what I consider to be the reason I managed to come out of the program with an Internship at Google. Before this however I had no idea of how great Google was or it's reputation for the work environment they had established. I reconnected with my best friend a month before I had to choose my internship and pitch to the class why I want to work there. I only had Harvard and Microsoft in mind, but it was my best friend who told me to do everything in my power to get the Google Internship. And now I get to the point where I say why I love being Bipolar. I was filled with so much positive energy and a strong and impeccable faith that I was going to succeed. And that determination got me to experience some of the best months of my life. 

However once I reached this new level of success, I began to get imposter syndrome. It was hard connecting with my bosses. Me being of Dominican descent, and still having an inferiority complex from my verbal abuse growing up. I gradually started to under perform. I mean I landed consecutive internships from 2014 to 2016. But being forced to go to college to continue the internship was draining me. My father had a tendency to go missing every time finals week came around. I failed every single class and my GPA was in the gutter. Just like High School. By 2016 I found no point in continuing my schooling. It was painfully clear college was not for me. I hate school and I hate learning things that have nothing to do with the work I want to do. I want to learn not study. Where learning I do with passion and studying is more of a chore to memorize and regurgitate information onto a piece of paper. 

So I try to just go for a full-time position as one of the other interns was able to land one without even needing to do an Interview. But then I get the news that I need to do an interview. By then I'm well aware there's no way I'm getting the job. I use to get very nervous during interviews and had little to no experience doing them. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. The invitation for hangouts wouldn't show up on my email. That already wasted 15 min. Then they called me on my damaged iPhone 6. The internal speaker would produce muffled sounds. I knew that my career in Google was over. And I was right. It was only in this year 2019 that I finally mastered the art of interviewing. After failing constantly in many interviews, I learned what to say, how to say it and what questions to ask to differentiate myself from the herd.

Today I still struggle to stay stable. Sometimes I let my emotions best me. Sometimes I say things that end up hurting me in some form. Sometimes I feel very sad. But something that this condition has gifted me is unrivaled positivity and happiness that infects everyone I meet. Through all the books I've read and all the random information I learned because of not being able to sleep. I've gained a power to make friends. Like Naruto my talk-no-jutsu is overpowered. I can make almost anyone like me if I try hard enough. I focus on things that they may like and try to understand them.

I'm now married. I have a wife that believes in me and my potential. I also work as a concierge at a luxury apartment complex. Most of the residents love me. Even the ones who didn't like me at first can't help but like me. I try so hard to pinpoint a way to connect with everyone. My friends are mostly all musicians, insanely talented individuals. My best friend is a programmer whos a certified genius. My other best friends are also talented in music, business and wise beyond their years. A trait we all share due to our collective experience being brought up in the warzone that is the hood and our understanding in the power books have. That's probably a subject for another post in another subreddit though. One of my friends in our mastermind group actually spent time with Bad Bunny recently. Had a private conversation and managed to show him his music. 

Now to finish this incredibly long post which I apologize to anyone who had the attention span to follow this crazy life of mine. While this may just be a symptom of my bipolar disorder to believe I am greater than I actually am. A delusion as most doctors have told me, I've been told by many people growing up that there is greatness in me. Even my former coding professor who is also bipolar told me this recently last month. He worries a lot about me because he knows what we deal with. I will do everything in my power to increase my power so that I can leave this world a better place in one form or the other. I refuse to see myself as a victim and will not make excuses. Action will be the food and drink that will nourish the success I crave so obsessively!

**TLDR: I love being Bipolar because I am filled with a happiness that is as bright and warm as the sun. I love deeply. I care deeply. It will be the reason I will one day fulfill my dreams.**"

Why is she so quick to hate Meredith every time she screws up? Some examples:

1. First seasons she was constantly shooting her down for sleeping with Derek. But when Cristina did it with Burke, Bailey didn't say a word. George married Callie, she was also above him and Bailey's reaction? Nothing at all...
2. When Meredith tampered with clinical trial, Bailey was furious and refused to work with her. But when Bailey did something similar (bubble kid, the HIV virus), it was totally OK. When Cristina covered for Burke's hand, Bailey, AGAIN got over it like that. And when stupid Izzie cut the LVAD wire, Bailey even came to her, persuading her to go back....
3. When Meredith and others sued the hospital, Bailey was bitter as hell about it. But when Bailey herself made half the staff leave, nothing, no remorse at all.
4. When Meredith commited insurance fraud, Bailey fired her and treats her like crap. But when she did the.exact.same.thing herself, again, no problem at all.

Why do you think that is? Is Bailey really that hypocritical and petty?"

He diligently goes through his tasks before the sirens start blaring, filling his office with blue and red flashing lights.*

LLROfficial: What on earth this time?

*An intern rushes into the office, slamming the door behind which silences the screams and mad dashing and running.*

Intern: It's Delilah and Veronica! They spotted each other in the canteen and they are fighting!

*Immediately, LLRofficial gets up and slides over his desk Starsky and Hutch style, only to fall onto his face on the other side. He gets up and dusts himself off like nothing happened and runs out.*

*In the canteen, all the humans are on the tables or at the edges of the walls as Veronica and Delilah are going at it. They keep lunging at eachother, occasionally taking chunks out of each other. They have bloodlust in their eyes and when not biting eachother, they pace around the room with their eyes never shifting away.*

*LLROfficial runs in and manages to get in between the fighting crocodiles.*

LLROfficial: Stop it! I know things are rough between you two, Delilah shouldn't have seduced Snappy but Veronica you were always so hot and cold with him, he didn't really know if you were ever in a relationship or not.

*The two crocodiles lunge forward and each bite off both of LLROfficial's hands.*

LLROfficial: AGH WHAT THE FUCK NO! RIGHT THAT'S IT, I'M SENDING YOU TO THE MOST REVILED YET WATCHED SHOW THERE IS!

*THREE DAYS LATER*

*In a TV studio, a crowd cheers as the slimy Keremy Jyle Show comes out.*

Keremy Jyle: Hello and welcome to the Keremy Jyle Show, we've not got a guest deliberately drunk to make him angrier in three months!

*The crowd cheers*

KJ: We've got a fantastic show today but first, two crocodile sisters feuding over the famous Snappy! Let's bring Veronica out!

*The crowd cheers as Veronica comes out and plomps herself on the ground.*

KJ: So Veronica, please explain what happened with your sister Delilah.

*Veronica makes some grunts which tell an exaggerated sob story on what happened with Delilah and Snapp while KJ nods understandably. A camera feed shows Delilah in the back who is getting agitated and is snapping at the camera.*

KJ: That's terrible, I can't believe your own sister would do that to you. Anywhere, let's bring Delilah out to shame...I mean hear her side of the story!

*Delilah comes out to a torrent of boos. She makes a rush to Veronica and is only stopped by a burly security guard wearing crocodile proof armour. She is eventually settled down.*

KJ: So Delilah, why would you seduce Snappy, have his eggs and do it on the 2nd anniversairy of the time Veronica had her third goat with Snappy?

*Delilah angrily opposes this and makes lots of loud grunting sounds.*

KJ: It seems like you are defending the indefensible here! How horrid you are, you evil crocodile scum! And to think I pay your wages with my taxes!

*Delilah is confused.*

KJ: All of this led to a fight you instigated which led to a member of the LLR staff being horrible maimed!

*The TV feed shows LLR Official, staring at his new shiny chrome hands.*

LLROfficial: I'M NOT HUMAN ANYMORE!

*Delilah opposes this and is getting even more agitated so the security force her to the ground.*

KJ: But let's get thee true villain out here, the one whose been playing these tow for fools, Snappy!

*Snappy rushes out to booes from the audience and also makes a beeline for Keremy Jyle before being stopped by security.*

KJ: Before you do this, we need to do the lie detector test on if Snappy knew he was cheating! And guess what, you failed all of it!

*Snappy makes grunting noises pointing out he never took a lie detector test and lunges again.*

KJ: Hey, this is not the Snappy show! It's my name on the set, it's the Keremy Jyle show!

*The crowd cheers! However Snappy has had enough and he barges over the security guard and starts to eat Keremy Jyle.*

KJ: No! Don't eat me scum! I pay for your lifestyle!

*Snappy ignores Keremy Jyle and continues to eat him.The crowd cheers wildly and then Veronica and Delilah start fighting too. The crowd then also start a mass riot with fires being started all across the studio.*

*LLROfficial walks out onto the main studio*

LLROfficial: SOMEONE HELP ME THEY MADE ME A CYBORG WITH METAL NON-HUMAN HANDS!

*LLROfficial collapses and starts crying in the corner while the studio goes up in flames.*"

I'm seeking to recreate some of those crude, obscene moments in roleplay with you wonderful, sleazy, perverse men. Whether it's Tinder, sliding into my DM's on Insta even though I'm not looking, retweeting my bikini pictures on Twitter or god knows what, I'm looking for fun scenarios based on how social media ends up with me getting my pretty little bald cunt jammed full of heavy cockmeat.

Maybe one of us matches with you across the room at a party, maybe [**I'm**](https://external-preview.redd.it/lsRgFdepwRHzn8DHGY0Mr2KYQAv0qRpC9pf24hcw4ps.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a4ecb49c66058c72bd791043d595cf363f8e2937) the little fittie who comes through your regular coffee shop every morning with my yoga pants **buried in the crack of my taut young backside**, and you can't help but notice the fact my thong is always neon bright.

Maybe you convinced [**me**](https://i.redd.it/rgn5padvflj31.jpg) to give you a handjob at Halloween in that **totally quiet corner of a party, babe** while I was hopped up on Molly, and you just happened to match with me on Tinder, but can't remember anything about me. Except that smeared into that blood stain on my pretty little Halloween outfit is a pinkish tint of your cum, as you took that photograph after I **swallowed your load.**

Maybe I'm your brother's little girlfriend, and you can see me online when I'm meant to be sick as opposed to seeing him at college. Maybe [I'm](https://i.redd.it/01zio494rtm31.jpg)your **son's ex** who you can't help but imagine throat-fucking while you lay in bed next to your bloated wife, your mammoth cock leaking precum all over the phone screen at my photograph, mentally pondering how you're planning to **nut in my underwear** that I left at your son's and I'm coming to collect tomorrow.

Maybe I'm your new, coquettish young intern, straight out of college, and the moment you see me in my little leather skirt (as opposed to the drab ones I wear to the office), you book me onto your next business trip. With a selection of little outfits for me to be more **professional** in while I'm on my knees. You'll work out how you get me there later.

Maybe **I'm** your sister who you took along to your festival with your buddies, and you can see the light on in my tent as I **hunt some cock on Tinder** after I left you with a raging boner all day. Maybe [I'm](https://i.redd.it/kd3cz1lgexr31.jpg) that dweeb at school's girlfriend that you have no idea how he got such a catch, and you just want to **stretch my tight little nerd arsehole** over your heavy jock-cock.

Maybe I'm your wife's younger sister on a family vacation, **who keeps forgetting to put panties on**. And posts \*so\* many photos of her round, thick backside that you can't resist saying something crude. Maybe I'm your wife's mother, **posting nudes around my husband's back on a private Instagram**, but you recognise my porch in the background.

***Kinks:*** **Detailed responses,** age differences, **all things anal** (I'm a little buttslut), **interracial (BBC &lt;3),** outfit play (dress up, **please send prompts**), oral (particularly with **heavy, huge cocks**), messy facials and cumplay, **dirty talk**, titfucking, **crude scenarios and creativity**, CHEATING, **sleazy men**

Try your luck - sketch out a scenario and a girl, and let me know how you try to get into their pants. Some of them are sluttier and easier, some of them are harder to get. Some of them are secretly on Tinder, some of them will be shocked when you try send a Dick Pic. If you fail once, try again. The more detail the better.  There's a version of this post with way more links on my profile, too.

Happy to create together, but if you want the best response please hit me up with a detailed idea for a scene you would like to take forward! I'm quite picky and spelling/grammar, but please take the time to give me a little detail, tell me about your favourite kinks (and what you like), and give me something to go from and respond to! My preferred medium is \*reddit chat\*.

**List of some of the girls linked above and some silly ideas - all interchangeable.**

**Maria** **- Selfie obsessed,** has an ass that could break the internet, dating your best friend.

**Natasha** **- Spends all of her time at the gym pulling squats**, wears the tightest little shorts you've ever seen, **renowned as being a bit of a prude**

**Caitlin** **- Bit of a drunken mess, super easy, might have dated your best friend**. Sucks a mean dick.

**Sarah &amp; Olivia** **- Best of friends, meaning you can play them off against each other**

**Laura** **- your tarted up, chavvy little intern.** Likes it rough.

**Melissa** **- Dances around in anything skintight,** super shy in reality, **accidentally uploads a snap with a buttplug behind her yogapants**

**Sasha** **- Slightly frustrated as all of her girlfriend's think her boyfriend is too dweeby for her.** Has a bit of an obsession with musclejocks

**Leila** **- horny, underappreciated housewife.** Has a thing for the pizza boy."

In August, I had some free time and nothing do so just wanted to put my CV out to the biggest names in the industries a few them of gave me an interview but that was it but today I got my second offer. The details about the offers are below I’d appreciate any advice! 

First Offer:
- Spent an insight week at the company. 
- roughly 10k for the summer. 
- going through a major change this year so might be less likely to offer a graduate job.
- However, this summer 85-90% intern in my division converted to graduate scheme. 

Second Offer:
- A bit bigger name than the first one. 
- roughly 9k plus relocation money for the summer. 
- last year from what I have heard is almost 70% interns in my division converted to graduate scheme."

I'm currently a student completing my masters in public health with a concentration in biostatistics. I have been applying for part-time/internship positions and just recently received the opportunity to go in for an interview for a **Data Science Internship** position. The position type is an internship (as you may have caught on hah), meaning I can either get paid or I can use it as school credit (depends on my preference). I thankfully do not need the additional credits for my program so I am more interested in getting paid.

My interview is coming up this Thursday and I did not discuss with the person in contact if I want to receive credit or get paid. Meaning, the pay rate has not been brought up. When is a good time to bring that up and how? Should I ask over email or wait to ask in person during the interview? I know sometimes people say to wait until you even get the job offer but personally, I don't want to consider a job that is not in my expected pay range. If the the pay is not in my range, how do you negotiate for a higher rate? I would appreciate your guy's input on this because I truly do not know how to bring up these type of things but I know it is CRUCIAL!

Thank you guys in advance !!"

I unfortunately also have bad knees which make standing for too very painful as well. So when working a desk job, my best option for minimal pain is transitioning every so often between a sitting and standing desk position (or taking breaks from a standing desk to rest my knees). 
I work part time in research, and will be graduating soon from undergrad and working full time instead. The last full time research job I had was a summer internshIp, and I had to quit because they just couldn't make accommodations for a temporary position.
I'm scared about applying to jobs because I know at some point I'll have to ask about accommodations, and I think it will jeopardize my acceptance, even if I'll already been offered the job. I would only be a research assistant and since I live in a large city, there's loads of other very qualified people applying for the same jobs, so I don't think they'd even bother making accommodations and would just move on to another applicant.
At what point do I talk about the accommodations I need? Do I do it after I've been offered the job? Do I check beforehand if they are even able to make accommodations at all?"

Hi All,

X-posting to cscareerquestions and personalfinance for a range of perspectives

Background:

\- M, 26

\- Undergrad: Mechanical Engineering class of 2016. 

o GPA: 3.0

\- Started career as an IT consultant after graduation, been moving up the ladder but still in the same role

\- TCC start: $70k, now $96k after 3 years

\- Currently enrolled in an online Master’s in Computer Science program- completing the prerequisite courses this year

o GPA is a 4.0, but small data set (2 classes).

o Option to go in person or online

\- Considering going all in and completing my Master’s in order to grow technical skills and adjust my career trajectory

&amp;#x200B;

Motivation:

\- I travel a LOT for work. Which while it is ok for now (I love the points/ CC churning aspects), I do want to move to a career with no (or minimal) travel when I get married (in 1 year or so- just recently proposed) and have children (in 4-5 years at the earliest).

\- Moved from East Coast to California for work- looking to move back to be closer to friends and family.

\- Within my current role I am not as specialized as I would like to be (which is on me)- I would like to move to a role that involved technical problem-solving elements as part of the day to day work.

&amp;#x200B;

My initial Thoughts:

\- Program is 10 classes in total, with the prereqs completed (which will be the case by end of the year)

\- Continue part-time model through 2020, completing 1 course/ semester, reducing workload to 8 courses for 2021

o 4 courses in Spring 2021, Summer job/ internship, 4 courses in Fall 2021

Finances:

\- I lurk on personalfinance regularly and like to think I am in good shape

\- Debt: $0

\- Cash savings: $17k (5k in CD, 12k in High Yield savings)

\- Max 401k match + Roth  (about 55k saved between both)

\- Personal investments: 24k in Vanguard mutual funds

\- Income (after tax): about $4k/ month, $1k in stock options

\- Expenses now: fairly minimal- I travel for work during the week so do not have to work about food or transportation (I do not own a car)

o  Rent: $1k / month

o Utilities: about $100/ month

o Misc.: $2-300 / month (travel, gifts for family, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

\- Assuming I am doing Grad school in 2021 full time, what is the best way to prepare financially? Should I open a 529 for short term investments? (maybe bonds)

\- How do I begin with applying to scholarships, loans, etc? 

\- Should I double down on savings and pay for the programs in full, in cash? Since interest rates are on the decline, would it make more financial sense to leverage my money?

&amp;#x200B;

Main Concern:

\- If I look for another job now (while I am gainfully employed) I am coming from a position of leverage. Applying from grad school I may have more technical skills but will be lacking that leverage.

\- How do I leave my current company amicably, so my current manager (and prior manager, who is also like a mentor) still think highly of me and may be references if I reapply within the same company?

\- My finances now are fairly minimal (phone is paid for by company, no car, I pay for food only on weekends). How do I best prepare to manage these expenses in the future? Is part time driving for Uber/ Lyft a reasonable way to make income part time while in class?

&amp;#x200B;

Questions to Reddit:

\- Is there anything I am missing/ overlooking? Is this plan feasible, and if so, is it a good idea? Or are there alternative paths worth pursuing?

\- Has anyone here quit to do school full time for a year? If so, what has been your experience?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"
drl5dh,0,2019-11-04,Neighborhood and Apartment Complex Recommendations - 1000+ sqft 2/3 bedroom for under 2300 + utilities?,Marbleman60,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/drl5dh/neighborhood_and_apartment_complex/,"**Thanks in advance for the help!**

**My fiancee and I are looking into moving to the DC area next year, and are looking for a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment under \~$2300 somewhere within the inner MD or VA suburbs.** **Budget can stretch if utilities are included.** **Paying to park is alright if its at least a garage...**

She will be working in the L'Enfant Plaza area, and I am unsure of where I will be working but Rockville/Bethesda, MD is a possibility if my current company can find me a position there. I work in broadcasting if that gives you any idea of where I may find a job, area wise. We consider ourselves young professionals.

Moving to the area for work, coming from Philadelphia, and my fiancee from another city. Here's what we are looking for:

* **Transportation:** Ideally we would like flexible commute options, so an area with a walkable metro station, or one with monthly parking, would be ideal. A bus that runs to Metro stations also works fine. We both have cars, and would need to park somewhere. Street parking is fine. We could consider giving up one of the cars entirely if we found a place near multiple Metro lines with lots of amenities, but it probably won't happen on our budget.
* **The apartment itself:** I don't need a whole lot of amenities…right now I live in a lightly renovated apartment in a home built in 1915. I just need a clean space to do laundry inside my unit (a huge plus) or inside my building. Aside from that, we would really like a 3 bedroom as we want one room to keep hobbies in and one for a guest room/office. A large 2 bedroom would also be a possible option. I know 3 bedrooms come at a premium. A kitchen large enough for 2 people to cook together in would be a big plus, but not a necessity. Current apartment has a comically small kitchen. It would be nice to not have to deal with major pest problems or noisy neighbors, but I do realize that this is a risk anywhere. Ability to have a dog, even with pet rent, would also be a plus.
* **Surrounding area:** it would be nice to find a place in a walkable area, but would happily consider a more suburban area too. Ideally i'd have at least a little shopping/recreation within walking distance (grocery store, places to eat/drink, a park, etc), but that isn't completely necessary on my budget. I am not opposed at all to driving everywhere, but need easy to find parking. I have memberships to wholesale clubs (costco, sams club) if that matters. Being within 30 minutes of expansive outdoor areas (such as state parks) would be great.
* **Safety:** I'm not super-particular about crime rates. FWIW we've lived in some tougher urban areas (West Philly, etc) and feel very comfortable with typical area awareness and street smarts. Nonetheless, we would want to live somewhere where we could walk to/from our place at night and where the odds of our cars/apartment being broken into are relatively low. But of course, I realize that it's a risk anywhere I live. Always carry insurance.

We do not want to live in DC proper. Here are some areas that I've been considering, and have found apartments in my price range:

* **Hyattsville (MD):** there are some apartments within walking distance of West Hyattsville and Prince George's Plaza stations that are in my budget. I've been told that the area behind PG Plaza (where the inexpensive apartments are) isn't the safest. Is this true?
* **University Park (MD):** my fiancee lived here for an internship in DC and it seemed quite nice, while within driving distance to PG Plaza and other metro stations
* **Silver Spring (MD):** seems like a few older complex options around here. Any areas to avoid?
* **Suitland (MD):** seems nice with a few options. How's transportation and crime?
* **Penrose/Columbia Heights (VA):** A few good options here it seems, with easy transportation to DC. Any suggestions?

**Any comment on these areas, or suggestion for other places that might be suitable? Or should I increase my budget? Just trying to stay more affordable to help quickly pay down student debt and save for other things. We eventually plan on getting a home in a more rural area with a longer commute. Probably want to stay in the apartment 4 to 5 years.**

I know we have a lot more research to do, but here are some places that seem to fit my ideals so far.

**Properties of Interest So Far:**

* 3350 at Alterra (PG Plaza)
* The Plaza (PG Plaza)
* Dorchester Apartments (Columbia Pike)
* Dorchester Towers (Columbia Pike)
* Oakland Apartments (Columbia Pike)

Any recommended property management groups to rent from?

**Thanks all!**"
drl9kc,5,2019-11-04,Should I[20F] tell my good friend/crush[20M] how I feel before he leaves for a semester?,throwingawaysad,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/drl9kc/should_i20f_tell_my_good_friendcrush20m_how_i/,"Hi redditors,

I’m a college junior that has been good friends with this guy (same major, junior) since Feb of last year, and I have been romantically interested for a while, but he had a girlfriend until March of this year, so I didn’t do anything about it, except this one time I embarrassed myself by asking him why he had a girlfriend, but tbh I was not in a sober state. I didn’t talk to him for months because I was embarrassed by that. 

Five months went by without talking, and he texted me asking what my spring break plans were around mid march. We kept texting since then, nothing much.  Then he told me in May the day before I left that he broke up with his girlfriend of (presumed) 2 years, which was right before he hit me up in march. We texted a lot during the summer, just as friends. We mostly talk about our classes (we are both computer engineering majors), and internships. I don’t think we talk about our dating life (or the lack thereof for me) that much.

We got back to campus and hung out couple times, and I just really started developing intense feelings for him. I would ask him to get bubble tea or come over and play video games, and he would. Our physical distance is always sort of a 12-inch ruler, idk what it is, but maybe I am scared of getting closer, because of that one night we drank, I tried a lot of embarrassing tactics of flirting and none of them obviously worked because he had a girlfriend. (Totally my fault) Anyways, we started being actually good friends. He even told me that my apartment complex looks really nice and he was planning on leasing a unit in the same complex as me. 

This last weekend, I asked him to go play badminton with me and my roommates, and he came even though it was really early in the morning (he barely gets up for our 10am physics lecture). After we played for a while, we started talking about next semester plans, and he just drops the fact that he got multiple offers for winter semester for an internship, and he’s going to take next semester off from school. He said it in terms of something like “One thing I won’t miss being away is the cold” (we live in a pretty cold place in winter). It was a pretty big shock for me because I was so determined of building enough confidence over winter break and tell him how I feel when we get back from break. 

So, that’s where I am at, technically I don’t have that much to lose even if I tell him I like him and started developing feelings a while ago. If he says no, and is weird about it, then he’s not worth it to me anymore. Even if it gets a little awkward, we have a semester before he comes back and things could fizzle out and we could still continue being friends. I wouldn’t mind long distance either, because it’s only for a semester. I’m still really scared for that chance he would be weird about it, and lose that friendship because it matters a lot to me too. But, I literally cannot keep it in any longer, otherwise I would be regretting it too much, that I never told him while he was around. 

So, should I tell him that I’ve been having romantic feelings for him, and when should I tell him? We made thanksgiving plans (couple weeks before winter break) of playing video games and hanging out, would that be the best? Or should I tell him right before he leaves?

TL;DR: A good guy friend I like romantically is leaving for an internship for a semester, in the peak of our friendship, should I tell him about my feelings towards him? Or would I regret it after he doesn’t reciprocate it and comes back in the fall of 2020?

update: I’ll tell him tonight after his last midterm! Wish me luck"
drlohe,7,2019-11-04,Got a crazy position opportunity,wertwert2000,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/drlohe/got_a_crazy_position_opportunity/,"Hey all. I've been wanting to cook and work in restaurants since I was very young. Got an internship at a local fine dining establishment 3 years ago, became a line cook at another good place, learned a fuck ton from a michelin star chef. 

My mom has always been very good friends w the president/owner of an influential California winery. They also have a winery on the coast of the Mediterranean in Croatia, where they are originally from. So I hit her up to see what was possible. She sent out my resumé along with a good recommendation to a bunch of her contacts in Croatia.

Next thing I know, I get an email from the owner of a few fantastic and highly rated places right on the coast of the Mediterranean. I'm 19, and am eager to move out of my parents house. I figure this is a great opportunity for that.

I have a phone conversation with the owner in a couple of hours, and I'm very very eager to learn and expand my culinary vocabulary. Wish me luck chefs!"

drly5d,0,2019-11-04,"(M4A playing F) The ultimate open prompt list, i'm indecisive and have a lot of ideas so come and pick your poison! (Chat or RP) (Multiple/open prompts) (Vanilla or dark)",Soapydopey69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/drly5d/m4a_playing_f_the_ultimate_open_prompt_list_im/,"Hey people of DPP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

(In no particular order, and feel free to mix and match!)

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**Outercourse:** Lap dances, tittyfucking, handjobs, assjobs, pussyjobs.. You name it and it can happen! Maybe you're a concerned friend or a professional dancer that just can't help make me cum but something is stopping you from having full on sex with me!

This RP can be played in the nude or with some over the clothes fun! Think of a tittyfuck in a bikini, or an assjob in a pair of leggings!

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Living with HyperSpermia:** This is a prompt that is a little more far fetched. The premise is that I have a 'condition' called HyperSpermia that causes my balls to produce semen at a faster rate than most people which means I have to empty them a lot more often. Side effects include no refractory period and very large loads.

We can have a concerned sibling, doctor or friend that finds out about my condition and 'helps' me. But there's a lot that could happen so go nuts.

**Tight clothing, CFNM with outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Futa Fun:** (I play Futa you play Female) Pretty self explanatory, wanna fuck a chick with a dick? Wanna see a pair of bouncing tits while your holes get filled with warm cum?

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Bonus points for Anna Kendrick in a Indy jones costume!

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**Pornstar encounters:** Similar to the celebrity prompt above, this one includes famous pornstars instead. If you interested I can tell you a few of my favorites over PM (Or you can send yours) I don't tend to enjoy asian, black or indian though, just to clarify.

This prompt can be explored in a cheesy porno styled scenario or maybe i'm a fan that 'wins' a day with you or maybe just a fan that comes across you in everyday life.

**Ball play:** As a guy there’s sometimes nothing better than to get a hot girl to get on her knees and play with your balls.. if you’re into ballplay as much as me you’ll love this prompt!

**Oh shit you’re stuck!:** have you tried to climb out a window And you’ve gotten yourself stuck from your big rear getting caught in the window? Lost an item down a hole and you’re now stuck in the face down ass up position? Any scenario where you could get ‘stuck’ stopping you from being able to move/escape apart from wiggle a bit is welcome!

**Sneaky sex:** We all know those videos.. where the pornstars are going at it with their apparent friends/spouses/family members either asleep or in the other room. It’s hardly believable when they’re screaming and begging for cum only a short distance away. What can we come up with?

**Trading/Rp'ing about our dirty stories:** This one is more aimed at those of you who want to chat instead of RP and it revolves around dirty stories that you have about yourself. For examples sake I will include a true story about myself, feel free to ask any questions, share your own or just about anything:

*(This happened around a year ago)

I was at university at the time (In England) and one of my good friends (female) had just gotten out of a long-term relationship with her boyfriend.

She was renting out a two-person apartment with her boyfriend turned ex at the time and I was staying over one night. (I suppose they chose a two-person apartment incase they fought? Or for privacy, I'm not too sure)

To give a little backstory, me and her were very good friends and often went out to drink/party etc. and this night wasn't any different. That night was a fairly flirty one which was odd for us. She was definitely attractive and everything but we never got to 'that point' where we went the whole way. But that night was light groping, dirty talk and puns you name it.

I offered to take her home just out of courtesy and she said I could take the now spare room now that her boyfriend had split up with her and moved out.

I went straight to sleep and thought nothing of it. I woke up a few hours later pretty thirsty which is when I heard it.

A very slight moan coming from her room. The rooms were right next to eachother so there was no doubt that it was her. It almost sounded like she was in pain? Little small grunts of pleasure. I almost shouted out of she was okay but then I could faintly hear the bed moving at a pace.

I felt very flustered all of a sudden, she must of been craving an orgasm since she hadn't got her boyfriend to sleep with. I couldn't help but keep listening, I was already getting hard and stroking myself above my clothes involuntarily to the thought.

I didn't know if she was using a toy, her fingers or what but she definitely was pleasuring herself mere feet away from me. Of course I couldn't help myself but pull my cock out. I tried to stroke in unison with the bed moving, like we were masturbating together. Maybe she heard me, maybe she didn't but I got very horny just at the thought of the situation.

I moved closer to the wall to hear her whimpering. It didn't sound like over the top porn moaning. Almost like she was trying to hold the moan. And like I said before, it sounded like she was in pain due to her trying to stay quiet. Her breathing got heavier soon after that, I was close to cumming too.

Her orgasm approached soon after. Her grunting and quiet moaning became quicker and I could hear the bed moving even more.

Her stealthy orgasm made me unload probably one of the biggest loads i've done. Luckily (And quite shamefully) she had a pile of clothes in this spare bedroom. I was quick to find a pair of leggings as I felt my balls tense up. I must of been cumming for about 20-30 seconds which felt like a life time. My balls tensed up and were so tight as I was throbbing into a pair of her leggings. The ropes of cum were huge and had some velocity. It was a tad on the watery side as the precum and semen was shooting out like a fire hose. The leggings were completely soiled with streaks of white cum and the smell of cum filled the air

She still doesn't know about this.


**Huge balls, blue balls:** The throbbing veiny shaft, the swollen, angry purple head that is oozing sticky translucent precum. That's not all, the normal sight of the low hanging soft balls underneath the shaft is nowhere to be seen. Instead, they are close to my body. Tight by both sight and feel, they are no longer soft but practically rock solid from being full to the brim with bubbling hot cum. Cum that has been sitting there for days, weeks, months and perhaps even years.

The reason? It could be a lack of losing virginity, it could be an insanely long dry spell, it could be a bitch girlfriend or perhaps I just don't know/want to cum.

Who are you to me? A co-worker? Sibling? Medical professional? Stripper? Pornstar? Massage therapist? It's down to you. But for one reason or another you notice that I am severely backed up and need a release. Maybe I'm being fidgety, overly flirty or simply admit to you that my balls are aching and hurting from the built up pressure.

Another optional symptom of this could be insane amounts of cum. Maybe I produce a lot by standard or a side effect of waiting this long is large cumloads.

I left this prompt open on purpose just to give the scenario some wiggle room. Let me know what your ideas are or if there's a prompt you want to explore at any point.



**The threesome with the two sisters:** (Major bonus points for this one) It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister (All 18+).

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D (22) C (20) [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with D over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy:** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

**Others:** Free use, throat fucking, breeding, public stuff. Literally anything. Message me with your ideas!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me. Mixing up multiple prompts is also very welcome :)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, asian characters, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, raceplay, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes.."

Hi there, I am Michael 26 from London England. My kik is mjd931

For the longest time I have loved the idea of office sex, I love the idea of professionally dressed woman acting like sluts, being bent over tables or under tables for their bosses. Here are some ideas for an office based roleplay. Enjoy.

1. **Assistant Affair:** You'll play as my assistant and I will have bought my wife something sexy or expensive jewelry, you are so jealous you decide to slide it on and seduce me with it in my marital bed, or in the stationary cupboard.
2. **Stationary Boy:** I will play the young 18 year old intern whose job it is to get stationary for people, so maybe your character could slide into 'my office' and we could have some fun, or maybe there is a hole leading into the toilet where I was able to slide my cock into.
3. **Glory Hole:** There is unisex toilets in out office and I am made to slide my cock through one in the stall
4. **Distract the boss:** I am the CEO of the company and I am about to come and meet your boss for an important document, which isn't ready, you decide to distract me the best way you know how
5. **IT Guy:** (MY fave): I am the nerdy IT guy who comes and fixers your computer, I am under your desk while you're away and you come back and sit down with no time for me to get away
6. **Caught Watching Porn:** You're my boss and you catch me watching porn, maybe I am taken for a disciplinary meeting
7. **Delivery Guy/Cleaner:** I am a delivery guy or cleaner who is there late at night and I find out it's all a front for a sex line and that's how they are making their money, there is only one way they're keeping me quiet."

dro82t,5,2019-11-04,Just had a great 45min chat with my (Dem!) VA Senator's Chief of Staff on gun rights! -- contact your reps! They listen!,Eldrake,VAGuns,https://www.reddit.com/r/VAGuns/comments/dro82t/just_had_a_great_45min_chat_with_my_dem_va/,"Hey folks. Wanted to share a personal story that proves that your reps listen, if you show up. 

As a firearm enthusiast on the Left, I just emailed and phoned [my State Senator's office](https://www.facebook.com/pg/BoyskoForSenate/about/?ref=page_internal) and had a fantastic 45 minute conversation with her Chief of Staff.  It wasn't some intern handwaving me off, she actually took my suggestions, asked for more information, and asked me for more follow-up articles &amp; info to aggregate into a report for the Senator. We're going to continue our conversation.

* I told her the concerns of the firearm community on the sweeping proposed legislation, and the inner conflict I feel as an enthusiastic voter on the Left that's worried my candidates will vote ""Yes"" on the 10rd limits, Assault weapon definitions, etc. 

* I showed her[ a New York Legal AR-15](https://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-xl685/products/111/images/302/windham_today__20008.1435857160.1280.1280.jpg?c=2), demonstrating how determined firearm owners immediately find legal ways to circumvent the legal frameworks. It's a huge inconvenience that doesn't actually reduce mass shootings or firearm violence

* I told her my feelings of being ""adrift without a receptive leadership"" as a firearm enthusiast on the Left, and how difficult it is for me to encourage others to support their side with support of this big bill.

* I also suggested checking out /r/liberalgunowners  and /r/VAGuns for additional feedback on the ""pulse"" of the conversation and everybody's concerns, she pulled both up and started looking right there

She listened and responded, and we had a long, productive back and forth conversation. I suggested alternatives, innovative approaches (European countries regulating kinetic energy out of the barrel rather than meaningless ""features"" like a vertical foregrip). Turns out their office had training from  ATF agents on firearm science &amp; features so they wouldn't just be ""uninformed liberals"" legislating on things they knew nothing about! That's great to hear. I hope that happens more often.

------------------------------------
The biggest takeaways for me:

1. The bill isn't monolithic, EACH PROVISION IS VOTED ON SEPARATELY. Meaning my Senator might vote ""Yes"" on the background checks if enough people tell her they support that, and vote ""No"" on the 10rd magazine ban if enough people don't support that! So get out there and talk to them! 

2. Interestingly, the ban on suppressors is a DIRECT REQUEST FROM VIRGINIA LAW ENFORCEMENT. They want to be able to ""hear shots"". I never knew they were the big source of that. (Though I don't agree with their reasoning -- suppressors are exceedingly rare and expensive due to existing processes). -- I suggested that current 8month waiting periods and fingerprinting / direct requests from local sheriff's departments just like the existing CCW process ALREADY a good middle ground, providing a legal path to ownership (if clunky), and preventing quick and easy criminal usage of suppressors (if that's what LEO's are most worried about). Registration of suppressor ownership seems reasonable to me, since those aren't protected like firearms are. Then that addresses LEO concerns while allowing legal ownership.


I was really pleasantly surprised at her receptiveness and willingness to engage in a long productive back and forth, and she directly invited me to speak at one of their upcoming town halls and provide these viewpoints and others to inform their legislative priorities/stances. 

It's easy to consider your reps as off in the clouds, and maybe they are at the Federal level. But at the state level, they really do listen sometimes! Find the phone numbers &amp; emails and reach out and have a productive chat! Have your facts ready and come with an open mind. :)"

Note: This post is created by a Public Relation Intern from The Borgen Project. 

Helping the world's poor sounds like a huge and distant topic for ordinary people, since there are already enough troubles in our life. Although it's human nature to be sympathetic when seeing people struggling, most of us prefer to solve our troubles first before reaching out to others. However, thanks to our great democracy, helping the world's poor is not that difficult and troublesome. And you don't have to be a political leader or a billionaire to help poor people around the world. Here is an easy way to help the world's poor from your home. 

Every person who has a legal identity in the U.S, citizens or legal residents, have three congressional leaders. One representative and two senators. These three people will vote on different bills on your behalf, and it's their duty to listen to your voice. You can find your congressional leaders by type in your street address and ZIP code on U.S Congress’s official websites (“https://www.house.gov/leadership” for representatives and “http://www.senate.gov/

senators/leadership.htm” for senators) 

After you find your leaders, you can google their website, send them an email to let them know that you support the International Affairs Budget, which is the budget for foreign aids. The email can be as simple as “Hi, I am \[Your name\]. I live at \[Your address\]. I would like you to support the Foreign Affairs Budget. Thank you.” 

 Many NGOs also provide email templates for those who want to contact their leaders to support certain issues. For example, The Borgen Project has a convenient emailing system. You can enter its websites (https://borgenproject.org/action-center/), click on the bill you’d like to support, type in your ZIP and your address. The system will automatically find your leader’s email address and generate an email for you. The whole process won’t take you more than five minutes. 

 Some people might think it's just a waste of time for they don't believe their voice will be seriously considered. The fact is, although your leaders may not view your email personally, their staff will send them weekly reports on how many people contacted their office for what reason. In the real world, two or three emails might get your issue on your leader's desk. And there is a chance that your leaders will then decide to support the International Affairs Budget, which will bring benefits to the world's poor.

 I hope you find this article useful. May our God bless those who are suffering and people who dedicate their energy to them."

It's never crossed my mind to post about this on reddit anonymously since I feel like I cant tell anyone about it. I currently feel trapped in the life I'm living and I'm not telling anyone because I dont think I wanna hear the obvious advice.

 I've been dating a girl I started dating at the end of high school and I'm currently at my 3rd year of college taking a full year internship at a place an hour away from my college. The girl I'm dating also went to that college. There has been a lot of changing for both of us going to college: I dropped my severe lack of confidence due to a few different factors, and she had her fair share of growth herself. 

She has had a very traumatizing past and her life has only really been stable for the past 7 years. I can tell she has grown a lot, but the trauma still haunts her for sure. She gets bizarre paranoid thoughts, she binge eats(not as much as she used to but still a problem), and she is always hurting. Like always. One day it's her back, next it's her neck, next it's her eyes, next it's a UTI, next it's her stomach, and now it's a mix of stomach/back/nausea. I try to care for her as much as I can, but I am a young man and she is my girlfroend. I'm not her guardian. Maybe that's selfish of me to say, but you really get burnt out when she is constantly hurting somewhere and when she isnt saying anything you still know she is hurting.

 A couple months ago we talked about how her constant pain, anxiety and paranoia caused me to develop anxiety myself that was related to the relationship( its more so a general anxiety now but that's undiagnosed, just what I experience). She dramatically got less anxious, I think she realized she shouldnt be banking on me to be invincible because I'm really not, I feel like my mental has been broken a lot thru this relationship. But I just want to see it out because I really like her and her personality. I would like her body if she did, but she never feels sexy and sex will feel forced a lot of the time. I hate that this is something she has to struggle with at this age, but the selfish egotistical side of my hates that I have to struggle as well. 

She doesnt come from money so therapy isnt really an option. Her mom barely owns an apartment and she wouldnt get that kind of support from her father most likely. Plus she doesnt feel like she needs therapy obviously because she just wants to work thru her life herself and she has enough going on. 

I hate that it feels like our relationship is bent over external things that feel so out of my control, and I hate that I have to feel like some money will be all ot takes to fix her problems. Speaking realistically shes probably always gonna have these problems when with me.

I feel like the ultimate thing here anyone would tell me is to break up. 

And I'm sure that a what reddit would say by my biased description of everything because I didnt paint a positive picture of my girlfriend. But that's just how I feel about the relationship at this point and how I have felt for a while now. The lack of sexual charge and the constant paranoia and pain and body negativity really weighed on my mental and I become rude to her now when she hurts and goes to me for comfort. That's so bad. I wish I wasnt that way and I wasnt always which is why it feels extra bad. But I feel like I've coped with everything wrong and I feel like I'm trapped at the moment because of all the friend and family connections between us as well as the deep emotional connection we share. We just click so well, but theres so much on the surface that prevents this from getting better in an instant.

 It feels like time and therapy are needed, but those resources just feel so futile. And I hate feeling like I've checked out because I really do care about her I just cant handle the stress it puts on my body. I've always felt a relationship should be about wanting someone, not needing them. And I feel like a lot of times she needs me more than she wants me (possibly due to the lack of sex charge or her unconscious coldness). And anytime my friends or family ask me how were doing I just say it's good. Even my closest friends in the world. I just bottle it up and say gooit's good. And I feel that that's been weighing on me now as well and causing me anxiety that I cant ever share the way I feel with anyone. 

I dont know if I'm looking for advice or just someone to hear me and understand and help me develop my thoughts. I just need to put my thoughts down and not be afraid of hearing ""just break up"". That is an option but I dont know if it's the one I truly will benefit from.and we have broken up before and it wasnt pretty for me I was a mess for a while. So please critique me and ask questions and help me develop these thoughts instead if letting them fester inside me giving me anxiety and negativity

TLDR girl I like and have a deep emotional connection with is recovering from childhood trauma and its really hard for me to deal with some aspects of therelationship. I like her and i guess I'm afraid of breaking up which is why I bottled this stuff up bc that's the obvious answer. I need to put my words down and hear words back to know how exactly I should feel about this because I tell nobody about these thoughts. Looking for discussion and advice. Love you all"
drrx92,4,2019-11-04,Contract Work - Help,mstamnitz,LandscapeArchitecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/LandscapeArchitecture/comments/drrx92/contract_work_help/,"I'm seeking some advice/guidance on the process of design/oversight as a contract Landscape Designer. 

Background - I just graduated w/ a BLA, have only worked as an intern before. It's a very informal setup (quite literally I know someone who knows someone who needed a landscape plan), and being a recent graduate I have zero experience or practical knowledge about the process/technicalities of working as a contracted landscape designer. The project is simple, a planting plan focusing mostly on large trees (its on active ag land), and some inclusion of erosion control. The site is quite large (\~20 acres including a 15 acre body of water).

A Few questions - 

\- How do you estimate the amount of time it takes to complete designs? (based on size, components, etc.)

\- Is there a standard charge rate for both design and construction oversight/facilitating contractors, or are they usually charged separately?

\- What aspects of planting are covered by the contracted designer vs. the contracted landscape company providing the plants?

drt3fu,5,2019-11-04,Couple of questions for those on probation in Colorado,Swagnite,probation,https://www.reddit.com/r/probation/comments/drt3fu/couple_of_questions_for_those_on_probation_in/,"So I was put on probation for a first offense DUI back at the end of September. I was put under supervision by a third party (RMOMS) as I was deemed a ""low risk offender"" and I got some alcohol classes (despite the blood test proving I didn't drink and only had THC in my system, but whatever I guess), and 96 hours of community service. I'm going to be all done with all the classes and fines by the end of the week, so it's just a long grind of CS hours after that but I should be done by the end of the year hopefully. Went into RMOMS for the first time today, was told I should be getting unsupervised probation at the halfway mark of my term (18 months, halfway in June). So overall it's going alright so far, but I could do without all the stress and money it's cost me, not to mention I'm constantly skipping work and school just to do all of this shit. Anyway as for the questions,

* What exactly can I do after I'm done with all the requirements to push for an early termination? The way they described it when I brought it up today made it seem I'll just get unsupervised in June which I'll definitely take, but then still remain on that until the end (March 2021). I was hoping to take a summer internship out of state this summer, and last thing I want to do is go through the hassle of a transfer for what is ultimately a pointless probation. If I can somehow get on unsupervised probation earlier, I'll do whatever it takes for that as well. I know it's early still and I will wait a while before I try, but AFAIK it's not actually law to even do half the term here in CO, so I will jump on it even if it's a slim chance. I'm serious when I say I need off probation ASAP and I'll do anything, if that involves dropping a couple grand on another attorney, so be it. 
* I get random UA's and am prohibited from alcohol and both recreation and medical marijuana (don't have a card). Is there anything stopping me from getting a card, and then going into RMOMS and then trying to get a medical exemption? Might be making myself sound like an addict here, but weed does help me a lot medicinally and I'm kicking myself for being lazy and putting off getting a card (I can easily qualify). Hasn't been all that hard going without but I know many others on probation do get this privilege, and although having THC in my system lead me here, the case is all built on alcohol for some reason; so I think I do have a chance at convincing them especially as I would like to believe I've been a model probationer so far. I would obviously get all this cleared up with them first before buying and using as to not piss hot and get a violation. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated whether you're from CO or not, I know for my 2nd question that does greatly vary state to state though."

I don't know much about cars and am panicking at the moment. I can't tell if I'm acting hastily or not. I am currently in graduate school and travel about 1 hour mainly on the highway (\~40 miles one-way) to an internship three days each week. Public transportation to this internship placement is not feasible. Uber would cost $100 each way. I could also rent a car but am looking to buy a used car ASAP to avoid accumulating monetary/time costs.

My current car (Mercury Mountaineer 2005) broke down this weekend and was pronounced dead (transmission + many other small repairs were just too expensive for the value of the car as a whole). I found several cars today, mainly Honda CRV's and Toyota Rav4s. I was actually able to see one today which was a Honda CRV 2007 EX at $6k and I really liked it.

The couple is selling it so that they can get a newer car. No accidents, AWD, 120k miles. The man outlined various items that have been recently replaced and noted that he imagines that the rear breaks will need replacing soon. I was able to drive it this afternoon and would like to bring it to my mechanic (who I trust) on Wednesday to check it out.

What do y'all think? Is this a good plan? Should I wait? Is this potentially a good car to purchase?"

drttic,2,2019-11-04,Plan,We_Broke_Up,u_We_Broke_Up,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_We_Broke_Up/comments/drttic/plan/,"**(1) Lifting 3 times a week &amp; eating healthy** (spaced out for recovery, intense full body workout for 30 min to 1 hour, quick cardio warm-up and cool-down, chewing food slowly, more veggies and protein &amp; little to no over-eating)

**(2) Mindfulness Meditation every day**  (short 10 minute sessions while on the bus or on my bed or walking, right now I'm getting into a kuru meditation class so I can pick up the basics, also being mindful in daily life, noticing thoughts &amp; therapy pdf on meditation)

**(3) Gradual every day progression of approaching &amp; group discussions** (exposure to more stressful things so I can digest the experiences, 1 hour per session to get rid of social anxiety, finish book that helps with group discussions,  [https://www.goodlookingloser.com/anxiety/program-index/approach-anxiety-program-week-1-1](https://www.goodlookingloser.com/anxiety/program-index/approach-anxiety-program-week-1-1) &amp; group pdf)

**(4) Going out to 2 events a week minimum** (practising social theory to have fun &amp; meet people who I vibe with, the two events are to socialise while still focusing on my goals &amp; having fun ex. networking event, computer science event, marketing club event, or a music event, SOMETHING RELATED TO MY PURPOSE SO I'M FOCUSED, being GENUINE the whole time)

**(6) Therapy once a month** (my therapist told me I don't have any problems that stand out, so I use the sessions for meditation advice and an emotional outlet, and insight from someone older who has more emotional awareness)

**(5) Studying 3 hours a day. 1 hour a day on a business hobby** (LINKEDIN + WEBSITE RIGHT NOW, making sure my college grades are up to par, and either building up my linked-in page, making a website, or executing a business side-project and slowly building a team through the people I meet at events for my business hobby. I have two other hobbies (music and writing) which I've put to the side for now because I've noticed that doing too much at once will lead to paralysis and getting nothing done. The time for those will come I feel, as I build more life experience and have more mental bandwidth.

**(6) 1h30 a day on chores.** (haircut, renewing cards or paying bills/fees, dealing with tax forms/cheques, buying things/clothes on amazon, cleaning up the room &amp; throwing out trash, washing clothes, refreshing on driving before my driver's test or even treating that as a break, checking emails &amp; signing up for activities to add to my calendar, checking my network and setting up meet-ups etc.)

**(7) If dates don't flop, then I'm going to invite them to events/places I'm already planning on going to** (if I'm already planning on going somewhere or doing something fun, I'll invite her to that. If they ruin my good vibes, they can leave because my time is limited anyways. This whole approach thing is more for self-improvement, but if I get a chance to escalate I'll go for it, no rationalising. I need to know I can conquer my anxiety when I need to.)

**(8) Self-help videos and pdfs while I take the bus to class** (listening to ToddV, CharismaOnCommand, Eckhart Tolle, Book Summaries, Books on Social Dynamics etc. with my earphones on or reading self-help pdfs, but I'll take the earphones off when outside of the bus, so I can notice opportunities to speak to people and just be present. If I see a rare opportunity on the bus, I'll go for it though.)

**(9) Hygiene &amp; Fashion 45m a day** (this already became a habit and doesn't really feel like a chore. Showering feels good. It feels nice to feel and look fresh. Cutting nails or trimming hairs takes 20 mins at most. I put on my contacts after showering, and I'm starting to develop some styles that fit my look and my significant drop in weight since lifting).

**(10) Meeting up with mentors/partners 2 times a week, 2h at a time** (this isn't likely happening anytime soon, only until I start building up my business side project and linkedin network. But it's going to happen eventually and I'd like to account for it.

**Logistics:** BUSING TO SCHOOL (KNOWING WHEN BEST TO USE EARPHONES), UBER WHEN IT'S LATE, STAYING AROUND IN PLACES WITH PEOPLE, AND NOT STAYING UP TOO LATE BECAUSE I'LL ISOLATE MYSELF.

**Goals:** website/linkedin and finding a business idea (a niche problem that's scalable), being present/grounded, can manoeuvre myself socially (can be genuine in conversations, can approach ANYONE while being comfortable, can manoeuvre myself in a social group/circle) , GPA over 80%, 180 pounds and close to ripped, no approach anxiety, better fashion and more fitting, one programming project.

Wasting time or having fun (outside of fun events, lifting, meditation, or the business hobby):

(1) Allowing myself only 2 days/week to spend a 2-3h reading self-help articles, the news, or posting on reddit.

(2) Skimming through interesting movie clips, documentaries, podcasts (ex. joe rogan), or comedians (ex. dave chappelle, bill burr) or shows (curb your enthusiasm, black mirror, rick and morty).

(3) Taking walks to ground myself and self-reflect

(4) Taking naps in the middle of the day

(5) Making a song for fun as an emotional outlet. Nothing serious, I don't do this much because I'm busy.

(6) Talking to friends on discord or facebook or texting people, mostly logistics (I barely have friends these days that are close).

(7) Checking up on family and showing that I care so they feel good. It doesn't really do much for me but I do it so I don't feel guilty. Also good social and empathy practice.

(8) Maybe travelling this summer.

(9) Getting a full-time internship job in the summer. Maybe a good opportunity to travel and live alone."

This isn’t how I found the one. This is how I saw a friend end a 6 year relationship and saw the beginning of the rest of her life play out in the best way. It gives me hope and I hope it can give you some hope too.


In 2016, my friend broke up with her boyfriend of 6 years. She felt like they were moving in different directions in their lives after trying to make things work for a long time. She was really sad, because she was letting go of someone that had meant the world to her at one point and that she thought she might marry.

That same semester of college she changed her major from business management to aviation management. She was really passionate about her new major and ended up getting an internship in Washington, D.C. for the summer. When she got back, we all went out for drinks. She invited some people that had also been a part of the internship program and she pointed out this guy to me: “We kind of flirted this summer. I really like him, but I don’t know if he likes me.” Honestly, that night I couldn’t tell so I understand why she felt that way.

Fast forward, a few months and he literally asked her to be his girlfriend via carrier pigeon which stemmed from some inside joke between the two of them. I remember how excited she was. 

Last night, they got married. 


It just gives me hope that the person meant for you is on the other side of this break up that’s causing you so much pain right now. Like how one small decision you make can lead you to the person meant for you. Tomorrow you decide to try a new coffee shop and meet. You join a book club and meet someone who invites you to a family gathering where you meet their cousin and voila. 

There is a life after this break up. You just have to be willing to experience it. You never know what’s coming."

Hi everyone; I’m hoping for some guidance. Way back in high school, I either wanted to be a nurse or a teacher, but I chose teaching (still bitter that at a mere 17 years old, we are told to pick a career and sign our life away to loans, but I digress). I’ve since felt that I probably should have chosen nursing (I love working with students but hate instructing, and am still super interested in healthcare), and am now seriously considering an ABSN program. I’d love some insight, as I just discovered this community recently, and it’s already been extremely helpful. 

My background: I have a degree (BA) in English Literature and Education. While I was in school, I had an internship with a non-profit organization housed a large, well-known hospital system in my hometown (working with events and patient services, pretty administrative). When I graduated, I moved to Europe to work at a boarding school in Residence Life, and taught a lot of healthy lifestyle programming as well as PE. When I returned to the United States, I was hired at the same hospital system where I worked for three years in Patient Services, one with the non-profit and two of those years in the Patient Resource Library in the Cancer Center. I navigated patients and their families to appropriate resources (diagnosis-specific literature, financial aid, social work, non-profits, support groups, etc.), and often supported nurses and social workers in the process. After this, I joined the Peace Corps, and was placed in the education sector (unfortunately, as I was hoping for some more health experience). 

I’m currently serving my second and final year in Peace Corps and will be returning to the U.S. in the summer. When I return, I want to get a job and get started on these prerequisites, but as I’m looking into admissions criteria, I’m wondering how relevant my experience will be as it’s very non-clinical, and because of my variance in professional experience. Is there something else I should be doing in the meantime to make myself a competitive candidate? My plate is and will be rather full, so I’m a little overwhelmed as I’m currently living in a….rather remote location while I try to do some research. I hope my questions aren’t too repetitive with other posts, I’ve been trying to read other threads similar. 

Thanks in advance for any and all advice/insight/expertise—keep doing what you do; I hope to be someday!"

This is my first time doing this on reddit. I have just recently joined reddit and in need of help about my anxiety. I know I can go to a therapist, but I do not have the time right now. Online therapy like 7cups also sounds sketchy, so I am trying this out.

Um.. Right now I am very anxious about everything. I know everyone gets anxious, but I am feeling very overwhelmed, and I feel like venting to my friends wouldn't really help because they are dealing with the same situation but better, and I am ashamed to admit I am not doing that well. Especially since I have just moved out this September and I want to show my parents I am doing well.

Moving out surprisingly feels lonely, despite all the freedom I have gained. I am having trouble time managing school, work, and housework. I know it takes time to get used to all of it, but I am getting depressed that I am not doing well because I think by this time I should be doing well, if that makes sense. 

My room is a mess, and I am having trouble keeping up with my current program because I am not as inspired anymore. This leads to the current anxiety with it. In addition, I need an internship to graduate. I still haven't found one, despite applying since summer. My friends already had theirs, and I am afraid something is wrong with me and I am being left behind. I feel inadequate because of this and think my skills aren't good enough for anything. 

I am also in my first real relationship, and I am thankful for that. I am afraid I am becoming needy and clingy though, since its my first relationship. I have finally found someone wonderful, and I am afraid that whenever he doesn't respond for a long time, that he is getting bored of me. I am paranoid that I am not good enough. I know these are just thoughts, but my low self confidence is affecting both school, work, and personal aspects in my life. I try to distract myself by doing schoolwork and pursuing hobbies, but I still miss him a lot it's bothering me.

I am having a hard time getting stuff done. How do I stop these thoughts from getting too destructive?"

Recently I graduated and landed a full time job at the same institution where we were interns. I’m highly overqualified for the position I’m currently in but I don’t mind because it’s definitely a stepping stone for greater things and our place of employment is hard to get into so I took whatever I could get. Recently, one of the senior staff members who had a highly coveted position retired. Our department VP has taken noticed of me and personally approached me with the offer to be promoted into this job, if I want it.

I recently found out that this friend also heard about this position opening up and is hopeful of applying and getting the position once she graduates this winter. She has worked closely with the VP on a few projects and is betting that the VP will put in a good word for her. I was going to tell my friend that I had actually been offered this position when she dropped the bomb on me that she is pregnant, I was shocked and couldn’t muster the courage to tell her because I felt really bad. I WILL tell her and soon, but would I be the asshole if I accept this job knowing she wants it too, has a child on the way and no job offers lined up after graduation?"

I have been in the program since January 2017 and will be finishing my internship in April. It's hard to believe that I've made it to this point, but here I am! The last 3 years have been a whirlwind of growth, uncertainty and stress. I love my program and I love this field and I am SO excited to commit myself fully to this profession. I have been working full-time in communications/marketing while attending grad school, so one can imagine how stressful and taxing it has been. Internship has been an entirely different beast. I am working 40 hours a week, while also clocking in about 20 direct/indirect hours. Not including a weekly and bi-weekly class, studying for the NCE and maintaining a household, a husband with bipolar disorder and multiple pets. LIFE IS NUTTY RIGHT NOW, but surprisingly enough I feel like I've been handling it all fairly well. I've always thrived under deadlines and pressure, however that's not to say that I don't experience burn out because I'm pretty sure I'm burnt out right now, but I'm so close that I just keep pushing myself. I feel like I'm riding a wave that is beyond me and just carrying me to the finish line. Things are moving so rapidly that I don't have time to think about much other than being present with clients, eating, sleeping and trying to keep up on my workload at work and my workload at my internship site.

Now that I'm coming to the end of this journey and will eventually be downshifting into a slower paced environment, I am terrified that I'm going to crash. Transitioning between semesters was always difficult for me, I don't do well with the downtime and I'm afraid of what life will be like after this incredibly fast-paced existence I've been living in. What is life like after grad school? I'm afraid my lingering anxiety/depression is going to creep back in and take over the available space in my mind, even though I attend my own therapy and have coping tools in my toolbox. I am afraid of what life will look like after grad school. I'm afraid of what I'm going to be like after grad school. It doesn't help that I'm pretty unsure of where I want to go or who I want to work with once I graduate. I'm open to almost any experience, but I'm concerned that I should have a better idea of where I want to go and who I want to work with.

What is life like after graduate school? How did you handle the sudden downshift in workload and lifestyle? What type of job did you take after graduating?"

It's Tuesday, we're 36 hours from a new episode, and we have the results for episode ten's Player of the Week! Let's get to it.

1. Leroy Garrett - 68

1 Tori Deal - 68

2. Kayleigh Morris - 61

3. Cara Maria Sorbello - 9

4. Joss Mooney - 6

4. Nany Gonzalez - 6

5. Georgia Harrison - 5

5. Kam Williams - 5

6. Chris ""C.T."" Tamburello - 4

6. Jordan Wisely - 4

7. Turabi ""Turbo"" Camkiran - 3

8. Ashley Mitchell - 2

8. Jenny West - 2

8. Zach Nichols - 2

9. Theo Campbell - 1

And that leaves Dee, Josh, Ninja, Paulie, and Rogan with nothing. Tragic.

SO. We went from no two-time winners to TWO! This marks the second win for both Tori and Leroy, in our first tie ever. Champagne! Confetti! This has been my obligatory ""pretend to be positive for ten seconds"" paragraph, and it's over now.

Y'all, I am halfway to becoming a Leroy stan account, and even I can see that he didn't deserve to win this week. I won't complain TOO loudly, because at least Tori got the tie, but in what world did she and Leroy compete the same? Leroy sold out his friends hoping to coast to the final, and while I can't fault him for that strat, I also don't see a valid reason to vote for him. He had some great one-liners against Josh, Zach, and Jordan, but at the end of the day, I'm not even convinced Leroy made the right move. Putting aside his verbal beatdown, Leroy is now faced with several sizable threats. And to be fair, I think Nany probably is the weakest U.S. girl left (though I think she could stack up with Ninja in a final). But she has the right to be upset. She's clearly the next on the totem pole, and while Leroy didn't say her name (yet), she's the most obvious candidate to face Tori in the next elimination. It really doesn't matter which team wins tomorrow's challenge. Team U.K. is basically working for team U.S. at this point.

The biggest problem with Cara's alliance plan is that eventually, they'll run out of people to throw in against Tori and Jordan and have to take them out themselves. And who does Leroy think is getting that job? It's not like Paulie or Cara are going to volunteer themselves. I'm all for Leroy screentime, especially without Bananas, but this was not a good move for him. The way I see it, he has actual friends on the Jordan/Tori alliance in Nany and Zach, and there are fewer people in that alliance to compete for a spot in the finals. I'm just perplexed at the endgame for these people. If Cara got her way, the final U.S. lineup would be Paulie, Leroy, Ashley, Ninja, Kam, and Cara, and U.K. would have Rogan, Joss, C.T., Dee, and Kayleigh. That leaves Theo, Tori, Jenny, Jordan, and Zach who need to be eliminated - hardly a small order. And even if they're forced to cannibalize each other, which they likely will, you're still faced with either Tori or Jenny for the girls and Zach, Theo, or Jordan for the guys. I like all of their chances to beat ANY of the U.S. alliance people. 

What this episode exposed for me is my only frustration with the season so far. I like formats where people at least have the chance to save themselves. In WOTW, if you competed the best, you were safe. Or in the past few seasons, competitors have had the chance to call out their opponents. In big team formats, all you need to do is get the numbers, and you're guaranteed to never see an elimination. The season has still been enjoyable, and I don't think Cara and Paulie are locked in for a final just yet, but I'd prefer a format where the person voted in just got to choose their opponent, U.S. or U.K. Give the underdogs a chance, T.J.! Do it for the kids!!

Kayleigh very nearly beat both Tori and Leroy this week, and while I wasn't initially convinced, on the rewatch I respect her move more and more. I think it's silly for U.K. to throw in one of their strongest girls (though I think Georgia's strength has been overstated this season), but Kayleigh at least demonstrated some political prowess this week. She got Joss to vote for Georgia, even in the face of Georgia and Jenny crying. With Tori turncoating, U.K. traded in a donkey for a workhorse, as Zach might say. We didn't see any longterm thinking from Leroy. As he said, he's simply trying for self-preservation. He's safe for now, but he's clearly the bottom of the Cara alliance, and they'll sacrifice him as soon as necessary.

Which brings me to Tori, who was a total badass this episode. She didn't whine about being voted in, she didn't freak out when Georgia was thrown in instead of Ashley, she stayed cool during the elimination, and then she became the first person to turncoat, to the relief of the poor MTV intern who dreamed up that twist. It's hard to say if she's the strongest U.S. girl - I think I'd still take Cara in a daily challenge or elimination - but I'd say she's the best suited for a final, and if Jordan really does switch too, they're going to be a dominant force. It's looking more and more likely every week that the final of this season is going to be four U.S. players against four U.S. players. I don't like Dee's chances in an elim, U.K. actually should hope that Kayleigh gets voted in because she will drag their asses down in a final, and we haven't seen enough from Rogan to determine whether or not he'll help or hinder. 

Jesus Christ. I've never done so much analyzing in a writeup before. I know my niche is just to talk shit about everyone, but without Esther Fucking Falana around, there's nothing left in me. To summarize this writeup: all hail Tori Deal, y'all fucked up voting for Lee, and there are other votes here that just don't make sense. What are we voting Georgia for? Managing to get voted in when her team won? Losing 2-0? Claiming she loves Josh ""to death"" (how hyperbolized do we think that statement is? Why do we think that's a cute thing to say)? And four people voted for C.T. Someone literally commented they were voting him for being brave enough to take off his shirt. Bitch, I don't come to your house and fuck up YOUR survey, so don't fuck up mine. 

That analogy doesn't REALLY hold up over time, but we'll just move along. 

[Here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7SUeLwtbVE9y1PBWsPVndyD85DjrugSTrHOmHSOLWM/edit?usp=sharing) a pretty spreadsheet I made with all the votes so far. Let's review some fun facts:

- EFF has the most cumulative votes, with 364. Almost one for every day that I'll spend in the next year contemplating taking my own life because of this fact. The next closest is Laurel with 305 (which she got in just FOUR WEEKS), and then in third we have Leroy with 171. So basically what I'm saying is we've got a snowball's chance in hell for any of these people to get enough votes to pass Esther, and y'all are fucking around with votes for C.T. Can we just FOCUS? HUDDLE UP, TEAM! EYES ON THE BALL! OTHER SPORTS ANALOGIES!

- Tori has 155 votes, and three weeks ago she had just one (1). You a real one, O.G. Tori fan. You knew before the rest of us did. This girl was going to be a STAR.

- Nany, who for a quick reminder is still in the game, has fewer votes than: Big T., eliminated in week 2; Wes, eliminated in week 3; Laurel, eliminated in week 4; Bananas, eliminated in week 6; and Kyle, Idris, Bear, and Turbo. She has 18 votes. That is an average of 1.8 votes per week. She only has more votes than Zahida, Sean, and Faith, all gone after episode one. Jenna, come get your girl. She isn't long for this world, anyway, but she can't go out with fewer votes than Big T. It just isn't right.

- C.T. has the highest average placement of everyone still in the game, with 6.7. Our top three highest placers have never even won a week. I don't know that's possible - oh, wait, it's because y'all are out here voting for C.T. because HE'S BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE OFF HIS FUCKING SHIRT. The mind games. They're too much.

- As stated above, Leroy and Tori are now the only ones to win two weeks. Our other winners are Laurel (week 1), Georgia (week 2), Bear (week 3, and I'm still not over this bullshit), Ninja (week 4, RIP Laurel), Paulie (week 5), Leroy (week 6), Tori (week 7), EFF (week 8 - what do we think is the cleanest way to go? I'm afraid of guns so that can't be it. Pills? A good ole run into the ocean? Base jumping off Angels Landing? Let me know.), and Ashley (week 9). Somehow, even after dominating most of the storylines this season, Jordan and Cara have never won. Less shockingly, neither has Kayleigh, who needed this week to remind viewers she was competing on this show.

We're heading into week eleven, with 18 people still in the game. Unless these finals have seven people on each team, we're due for some Final Reckoning-style purges, folks. Or maybe more double elims. How sick would it be to watch Jordan and Tori both win an elimination on the same night? I'm not saying I'm actively looking to throuple up, I'm just saying I'd do it with them. Okay?

I always stumble my way into awkward exits here. I'll see y'all again on Thursday, where I'll camp in front of my computer to watch garbage votes come through with excuses like ""I'M VOTING FOR KAYLEIGH BECAUSE SHE LOOKED PRETTY!!!"" Bitch, Joss always looks fucking flawless, but you don't see me out on the street campaigning for him, do you?

(Please ignore weeks 2-4 when I let my weakness for Joss overcome logical thinking. Thank you.)"

Now, my father got put in jail 4 years ago, when I was 15. Without going into detail, I had a terrible childhood and I wouldn't relive it if someone offered me a billion dollars and a free ticket to LCS Worlds to do so.

The moment I got my senior internship at the age of 17, I found my bills going towards our house. My mother was still jobless and decided to use my father's awful, unprofitable company as income. How we survived, I still don't know. 2 years later, I haven't been able to go to college, all my checks have gone towards my mother and siblings, and I have to play mother to my siblings because my actual mother has the maternal instincts of a stick.

I've gotten not a single sign of gratitude ever since I began. My mother and my sister always trash talk me behind my back, calling me lazy despite being the main source of income. My sister disrespects me and my mother has never given me an unprovoked ""thank you"" or ""I love you."" I suppose the thousands of dollars I've poured into giving you people a roof doesn't matter, nor the free babysitting I provided when you went out to your broken down office so you can get away from us and watch TV for the entire day.

She is 10k in debt because she's been abusing our landlord's kindness and he finally got fed up with it. I'm helping her keep a roof over her head. And still, I'm the black sheep of the family who is only ever used as an ATM. I get no affection, no familial love, no respect, nothing. Unless they're short on money, of course. That's the only time they need me.

My sister is my biggest bully. She only uses me when she needs something or she wants to rant. She is responsible for my low self esteem, a part of my depression, and my bad relationship with my mother since she's such a kiss up. I've had suicide attempts and she encouraged my disappearing at one point. I fucking hate her. I tried to fix our relationship and she threw it out the window. She's only 15 yet she dresses and acts like a corner worker. She won't get very far in life, and when she's gone, I won't miss her.

I wish they'd all burn in hell. They don't deserve to be happy. My abusive mother, my corner worker sister, my jailbird father. I love my brother and my brother alone. My mother goes out at night and doesn't tell us where she is, sometimes leaving him without food. My brother has behavioral problems and she refuses to take him to therapy. He's a bad kid to everyone except me because they treat him like a dog. And the moment I leave this godforsaken place, I'm taking him with me. If life doesn't work out the way I'm hoping it will though, I have no qualms against just ending it all. I'm not scared of death, I only crave it.

And still, we struggle to pay rent. Our infested basement home with mice and cockroaches, it's disgusting. My bank account is at a consistent &lt;$50. I myself, am in debt from an attempt to keep these people fed. And I'm suffering.

It sounds harsh. Being treated as worthless for years has it's adverse effects, though. And the greatest effect I've experienced is a growing, profound hatred for the people I used to consider my family.

You're not my family anymore.

EDIT: Thank you guys for listening. If I wasn't broke and planning to go back to college, I would move in a heartbeat. Everyone tells me to do that. My friends, you guys...But I can't, I physically cannot work a minimum wage job and go to school at the same time, support myself and still be able to come home and take care of my brother. I'll leave one day and I'll come back here to brag about my accomplishments when I do. I can't wait to be happy and share it."

I spent more time in a fucking literature course this semester than any on my core courses than will help me in my career and still i am not doing well in the course. We have to read long abstract poems and write massive essays on these shitty ""art works"". Maybe we should require english majors to take advanced quantum physics courses to show them how we feel about taking their fucked up literature courses. 

I get that ecomonics and technical writing are important, but we shouldnt be required to take more than 2 courses (1 econ and 1 technical writing/communication). Requiring 6 arts credits + 6 humanities credits + IL + US history, etc is just insane. Instead they could require us to do one semester internship or take more advanced classes in engineering or physics or similar fields that will help us further our careers."
ds2oqt,2,2019-11-05,F4M - A Multitude of MILF prompts,MarriedMILFMischief,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ds2oqt/f4m_a_multitude_of_milf_prompts/,"**Important disclaimer:** Although differences in age are kind of the crux of most of these prompts, everyone involved is to be **strictly** over eighteen. Also, please don't use reddit chat to message me, I'll *always* decline.

Okay, onto introductions. Hello, everybody! I'm Gwen, I'm a teacher from England (at least until we sink into the sea considering the way things are going) and for my summer break, I'm looking to get into some deep, detailed roleplay with someone intelligent and creative. Also, I love the taboo! Incest, infidelity, rough sex, humiliation, age differences and lots of dirty talk. I'm looking for someone to play a younger man, or maybe my son himself.  

I have a few prompts listed below, although none of those are set in stone and I'm eager to hear your ideas.

Also, since it sometimes helps, I occasionally like to put a celeb face to the character I'm playing. Amy Adams, Bryce Dallas Howard, Christina Hendricks, Halle Berry, Monica Bellucci, Rachel Weisz, Salma Hayek...but I'm open and easy with the other faces listed on my profile, as well as any suggestions you might have. Anyway, the prompts!

**Regular MILF Prompts**

*Camp Counsellor*

You'd been planning to spend your last summer before the start of college hanging with friends, getting laid, and making copious use of your fake ID. Instead, your parents forced you to take a job at a damn summer camp! As a counsellor, no less! Zero internet access, zero alcohol...but still, maybe this place has its upsides. You find you're naturally gifted at this kind of work, the kids are actually a lot of fun, and a few of your fellow counsellors are serious cuties. In fact, one night you and the other counsellors decide to have a secret party out in the woods. *You're* given the job of sneaking out and smuggling beer in...but *I* catch you in the act. Me, the head counsellor, the one in charge, the woman whose husband the camp was named after. I'm fairly beloved by everyone in camp, even you, but I won't abide for breaking the rules. I confiscate the beer and tell you in no uncertain terms that this *will* be discussed at my cabin. You're to come by the next night.

Except, when you do, it's much later than you expect. And I'm dressed...uh, a little lighter than you expected. And I tell you my little routine with the counsellors every fresh summer, and you're the chosen one this time. I have beer, I have weed, and I have a wedding ring that comes right the fuck off.

*Negotiating with the Bully*

As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then *I* will. I might be an upper-class stay-at-home mom, but you? You're just a kid, and no amount of muscles will change that. I'm going to your house and we're going to settle this: the bullying stops now. Yet, when I actually get you your house or trailer park or wherever you lurk, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism. The tables are turned and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...

*Soccer Mom Shenanigans*

I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. It's a little flattering, to be honest. Maybe even kinda sexy, but I try not to think about it. Then, the game ends. My son's team loses, because they always do, and maybe my son himself suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) or maybe they just all go out for pizza, leaving underappreciated mom to pack up the minivan. Whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I do so, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into sudden temptation...

*Other Prompts in Progress*

* Your girlfriend's Mom
* Granny, what great big tits you have

**Incest Prompts**

*Your Mom, the Stripper*

Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...

*Halloween with Mom*

It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....or *does* she fail to recognize you?

*Back to the Future*

And just like that, you find out your professor's time machine works. You're shot back into a time period you were never alive for, and all you can do is wait to return to the present. In the meantime, you're in High School, and who do you bump into but your darling mother? The one you've always had sinful thoughts about? Except I'm not the uptight matriarch you know, *oh* no: I'm the school wild child, a slutty drug user who soon starts laying on the moves pretty damn thick..."

The scenario for this roleplay is:

The top talent agent offers me to be a personal assistant for a big female celebrity pop star! ( of your choice), during their world tour. 

I jump at the opportunity and say yes signing a contract without reading it. What I didn’t know was signing this contract employee contract actually sold my soul to the pop star for the entire time they are on tour!

The rest of this role play will consist of me travelling on long journeys on the tour bus with you. Where’re I am your toy to keep you amused.  Maybe you’ll decide to show me off to all your fans on stage who knows? I will be completely at your disposal.

I think a celebrity like cardi B or niki minaj could fit the profile well but any suggestions or questions please ask.
I’m also in to quite a few kinks so it would be easier to discuss on kik

I am very new to role play this in depth but I’m eager to try my hardest.

However, due to an unfortunate turn of events I find myself with a very limited budget until the end of my studies. After paying rent and utilities I can spend 5€ per day for everything else, which is not much considering the cost of living (Lyon). 

I will start working as an intern in February, but until then I have to survive on this budget. I should be able to subsist, but I'm vulnerable to any unexpected expense. I was thinking about getting some extra money by freelancing (I'm a programmer), but it just didn't cross my mind until now as this economic problem was very sudden. All this is very frustrating because I have no problems in finding companies that will hire my after my studies and I feel like I could use my skills instead of trying to find a local pub that will hire me next week (if that's even possible), but I'm kinda clueless for the moment.

I'm kinda new here but I hope this is a good place to have a fruitful discussion about starting one's own SEO/SEM campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently work as Google Ads rater and I would like to expand this into SEO/SEM area.

I've got a marketing degree and I worked as a intern in a marketing agency specializing in SEO. Since I've always wanted to create my own business, this feels like a right way to go.

The way I'm thinking about this is:

1. Complete seminars and get certified in the Google Skillshop;
2. Find a freelance web designer to partner with;
3. Create a website and Google Ads campaign at the same time (since I believe they go together) advertising my SEO/SEM services;
4. Practice managing the campaign until I get ranked #1 in Google Search results regularly;
5. With time, this should help me find my first client (possibly a small, local business);
6. If the partnership with the web designer has potential - continue to work with them and offer our services to the newly gained first client.

Can I ask you to comment on this (***very***) simplified business plan and would you be able to share with me any potential problems as well opportunities one potentially can face when starting such business?"

                      JUST LIKE OLD TIMES    


                              by  


                           Joe Doe  


*THE WIFE OF A UNITED STATES SENATOR RECEIVES AN UNWELCOME REMINDER*  
*OF A BOGUS ""POSTURE STUDY"" SHE PARTICIPATED IN YEARS AGO.*  


Susan was not having a good day.  Her husband, Tom, was running for  
re-election to the Senate on a platform of ""morale responsibility,  
morale management, and just plain old morals!""  It was an  
excruciatingly close race, but his relentless attacks on his  
opponent's character had finally narrowed the gap.  


It was definitely a bad time for Susan to be receiving nude  
photographs of herself in the mail.  


""THESE PICTURES WILL MAKE FABULOUS POSTERS, DON'T YOU THINK?  EVERY  
FRAT HOUSE IN THE STATE WILL HAVE ONE.""     


The note wasn't signed, but she immediately jumped into her Porsche  
and drove back to her Alma Mater.  


Susan's Ivy League scholarship had enabled her to escape crushing  
poverty and become the first member of her family to attend  
college.  It was only after she arrived that she found out that  
the terms of her scholarship required her to participate in a  
bogus ""posture study"" conducted by Coach Karl Letch.  


She blushed as she remembered the way the grinning instructor had  
slowly stripped her out of the clothes her parents had scrimped  
and saved to pay for.  At 18, she had been shy and awkward, but  
undeniably beautiful.  The coach had stripped her methodically,  
relishing his power and her tearful pleas as garment after garment  
fell casually to the floor.  


She had stupidly admitted to the coach that she had never had a  
pelvic exam, which gave him a free hand in every sense of the word.  
Her hour-long exam had been detailed, intimate, and pornographic.     


And then Coach Letch had produced his camera....     


The photo session started out with ""mug shots"" of Susan facing  
front, side, and back.  But then she was ordered to squat, to  
bend over and put her palms flat on the floor, to get up on the  
coach's desk on all fours....    


After all these years, she still trembled slightly when flashbulbs  
went off.  The press assumed she was camera shy, but the real  
reason for her skittishness would make a far juicier story.  


The photo session had been long and degrading, and he had  
photographed her from every angle.  By the time the leering  
coach had finally unzipped his pants and ordered the flustered  
coed to her knees, she was too dazed to resist....  


        \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  


Susan straightened her crisp blue jacket and checked her reflection  
in a window near the coach's office.  The frightened student was  
long gone, and a successful and self-confident woman had taken her  
place.  


Her entire life had been a struggle up the ladder, and she had  
finally arrived.  She had put herself through college and law  
school, eventually meeting and marrying a man whom many thought  
would be President one day.  She had, meanwhile, shed the  
awkwardness of her youth through sheer force of will and had  
used intelligence and hard work to transform herself into an  
entirely new person.  


As always, Susan's appearance was immaculate.  The confident and  
well-educated woman who stared back at her could handle any  
situation, and seeing her reflection restored her confidence.    
Her intelligence and experience allowed her to defuse any crisis,  
and this situation would be no different.     


She knocked confidently on the door and, without waiting for an  
answer, strode defiantly into the coach's office.  


The coach didn't bother to look up from the papers he was reading,  
or acknowledge her presence in any way.  It wasn't until she pulled  
up a chair that Coach Letch spoke.  


""I didn't give you permission to sit down, young lady,"" he said,  
curtly.  ""You'll stay on your feet until I say otherwise.""  


Susan felt her confidence ebb momentarily as she heard the coach's  
voice for the first time in years.  For a brief moment she was once  
again an awkward teenager, nervously standing in front of the man  
who controlled her scholarship.  


But her resolve returned as she remembered the way that this  
disgusting pervert had exploited her innocence for his twisted  
amusement.  Susan's temper flared as she recalled the coach  
complimenting her on her ""perky titties"" and ""snappy snatch.""     


How could anyone be so cruel to a sweet, innocent girl?  


""He's pretty good at batting around helpless, frightened  
teenagers,"" she thought.  ""Let's see how he does when they  
come a little bit older.""  


She had been so lost in her thoughts that she hadn't bothered to  
sit down, and she was still standing when the coach finally put  
aside his papers and began to speak.  


""It's nice to see you again, Susan,"" he said, cordially.  ""You have  
grown into a prosperous and successful young lady, haven't you?    
You have a successful law practice, a husband in the Senate, and a  
limitless future.""    


He smiled.  ""Pity about the pictures, isn't it?""  It will be a  
shame to watch your life go down the toilet.""  


""It's a pity that you're going to be gang-banged in jail FOREVER,""  
Susan replied, sarcastically.  


""I don't think so, he replied, calmly.  ""You're 33 now, which means  
I took these pictures 15 years ago.  The statute of limitations has  
expired, and, if you read the note carefully, legal eagle, you'll  
notice that I'm not blackmailing you.   Since there are no legal  
repercussions, and, since I'm tired of listening to your  
sanctimonious husband's blather about family values, I've  
decided to publish my research.""     


Smiling, he spread the pictures out on his desk as she looked on in  
horror.  ""You were so young and sweet-looking all those years ago,""  
he said.  She felt a chill as he ran his pudgy fingers lightly over  
her naked photos.     


""Your skin was so soft and smooth,"" the grinning coach continued.    
""And the look on your face as you slowly stripped for me was simply  
adorable.  Of all the girls I photographed, Susan, you were my  
favorite.  You were so innocent!""  


He stopped and pointed at one of the pictures.  ""Of course, you  
don't look so innocent in THIS picture, do you, Susan?  You look  
like a ""Hustler"" pictorial, spread out that way.  It really is  
quite shameful and indecent, especially considering how moral and  
proper your hubby is.  I can't believe he married a little whore  
like you,"" he said, shaking his head sadly.  


Susan, a good lawyer, bit her tongue and weighed her options.  She  
could still go to the police, but she knew that it would cost her  
husband his re-election.  Tom's moral diatribes would become a joke  
when the pictures of her scrumptious naked body began appearing  
everywhere.  Everyone would be too busy laughing or leering to hear  
her side of the story.  


Her image, accomplishments, and achievements would be instantly  
washed away.  She cringed as she imagined her male colleagues,  
interns, and neighbors secretly downloading the disgusting photos  
from the Internet.  


She would become the punch line for a national dirty joke.     


Although the note hadn't mentioned money, she had put $25,000 in  
her purse, just in case.  She was wise and wealthy enough not to  
sabotage a million dollar Senate campaign over a few thousand  
dollars.  


She reached into her purse and contemptuously threw the money on  
the desk.  ""There's $25,000 now, and $25,000 more when I get the  
photos and negatives, creep.  And I will draw up a purchase  
contract that will mean jail time if you try to pull a fast one,  
you sleaze ball,"" she said, contemptuously.  


""My, you HAVE changed!"" he said, in a patronizing tone.  ""So brisk,  
so self-assured, so smart....  I'm really quite impressed.""  His  
voice dripped sarcasm.  


Coach Letch picked up the money and tossed it into the wastebasket  
next to his desk.  ""But I don't want your money, Susan.  I just  
want to see the look on your pretty face when the story breaks on  
Fox, CNN and MSNBC.   I'll use my VCR to record all 24 hours of the  
epic coverage,"" he sneered.  


""But, why?"" she wailed in frustration.  ""I'll be RUINED!  You have  
to listen to reason....""  


""I'm sorry, Susan, but my hands are tied,"" he said, sadly.  ""After  
all, my research is finished.""     


He paused as if considering the matter.  ""I was thinking of  
continuing my studies with a series of before and after  
photographs that would show how one of my students evolved  
from adolescence to full maturity.  If the study was ongoing,  
then I couldn't publish,"" he said, with a lewd smile.  


""Of course, that isn't very likely.  The women I photographed all  
those years ago are successful bankers, lawyers, and businesswomen.  
How could I make women like THAT strip down like frightened little  
bunny rabbits?     


""Take you for instance.  You're the wife of a United States  
Senator.  It's absurd to expect you to strip down BUTT naked,  
right here in my office, and spread your legs for the camera.    
You're professional, successful woman at the peak of her career.    
I can't expect you to cavort around naked like some feckless bimbo.""  


""I would have to pose you the same way as last time, which means  
that dignity and modesty would be impossible.  You would have to  
bend, and spread, and caper around while I relentlessly put you  
through your paces.""     


The coach smiled as Susan nervously clutched her elegant jacket  
tightly closed.  ""You know, I do still have my old camera and  
plenty of flashbulbs.""     


Susan shuddered as she imagined the flashbulbs illuminating her  
naked form.  This couldn't be happening to her!  


""But the photos would only be half the story,"" the coach continued.  
""I have detailed notes from your old pelvic exam, and I would need  
to examine you the EXACT same way for purposes of comparison.    
Imagine...the wife of a United States Senator spread out on my  
desk like a two-bit whore while I slid on my rubber glove.  Can  
you imagine anything more absurd?"" he asked, rhetorically.  


""I know you didn't like the enema bag 15 years ago, Susan, and I  
don't expect that you'd like it any better now, although I promise  
that I'll warm up the rectal thermometer this time,"" he chuckled.  


""But the water will still be chilly...oh, so dreadfully chilly.    
Poor Susan!  I'm afraid you're going to have to hold it for a full  
thirty minutes, despite the cramps.  But don't worry, Susan.  I'll  
stay here the whole time, and hold your hand, and mop your furrowed  
brow.  And, after half an hour, you can trot down the hall like a  
good little girl and use the potty.""     


He paused and toyed with the pen on his desk.  ""Of course, I would  
need you to use your awesome legal skills to draw up an affidavit  
that explained that you were doing this of your own free will and  
that you weren't coerced in any way.  I wouldn't want you strutting  
in here with the police shouting about 'blackmail' again, like  
Perry Mason with PMS.""    


Coach Letch looked approvingly at the nervous woman who was  
awkwardly shuffling from foot to foot in front of his desk.    
Susan was biting her lower lip and looking at the floor.  Her  
hands were behind her back, and her fingers twisted nervously  
while he looked her up and down.  


He smiled as she awkwardly fidgeted like a naughty girl standing  
in front of the principal's desk.  


In her frightened, doe-like eyes, he saw the tears of a young girl  
petrified that she would disappoint.  Susan couldn't lose her  
scholarship!  Susan had to get straight-As!  Susan couldn't cost  
her husband his re-election!     


After all these years, she would still do anything to maintain the  
image of perfection she had worked so relentlessly to build.  Susan  
was, after all, the perfect student and the perfect wife.  


Coach Letch smiled.  Susan was also the perfect victim.  


""Why don't you let down your hair, Susie...shake it loose for me?    
You used to wear your hair loose in the old days, and I think it  
was much softer that way.""  


Susan hated being called ""Susie,"" but she knew better than to  
argue.  With agonizing slowness, Susie unpinned her hair.  Coach  
Letch let out a small whistle as she shook her head, and her long  
blonde locks cascaded down her back.  


She swallowed hard as he took out his old camera and an ancient  
box of flashbulbs and set them on the desk.  It was hard for her  
to believe that the object of her nightmares was once again  
sitting, with his camera, just a few feet in front of her.    


""You know what comes next, don't you Susie?  Now, don't be shy.""  


He smiled as the frightened and awkward girl in front of him  
nervously began to remove her expensive jacket.  She was blushing  
furiously now, and her quivering fingers could barely undo the  
elegant buttons.  After she finally managed to remove the jacket,  
she began carefully folding the expensive garment.  


""No, Susie, don't bother with that,"" he chided.  ""Just drop your  
things on the floor -- the same way you did LAST time....""  


She reluctantly dropped the expensive jacket onto the dirty floor  
and began to awkwardly take off her shoes.  The chair was just a  
few inches away, and it would have been easier if she had been  
able to sit down, but she knew better than to ask permission.  


She hadn't been allowed to sit down when she took off her sneakers  
all those years ago.  Why should she be allowed to sit down to take  
off her Guccis now?  


""That certainly is a lovely silk blouse you have on, Susie,"" he  
said, admiringly.  ""It's a pity you're going to have to take it  
off.""  


She said nothing, but, once again with trembling fingers, struggled  
with her buttons.  He smiled as she removed the blouse, revealing  
the lacy pink slip underneath.     


She was wearing more clothes than she had in the past, but he knew  
it would be worth the wait.  


""Now the skirt, I think, Susie.  It's time to show me those pretty  
legs of yours once again.""  


Susan reached behind her, unzipped her skirt, and let it drop in a  
pool around her ankles.  She awkwardly stepped out of it and moved  
slightly to one side to avoid standing directly on the small pile  
of luxurious clothing that was quickly forming at her feet.  


She decided not to wait for the next command.  Grabbing the hem of  
her slip, she pulled the delicate garment over her head and stood  
in only her bra, panties, garter belt, and stockings.  


Coach Letch let out a small whistle.  ""That sure is some getup,  
Susie.  Maybe later I'll let you slip on some of those fancy  
frillies, and we can do some Victoria's Secret shots, too.  Won't  
that be fun, Susie?"" he snickered.  


She remained silent, but awkwardly crossed her hands in front of  
her crotch.  ""I'm NOT a bimbo!"" she desperately said to herself.    
""No matter what this man makes me do, I'm still the same person.    
I'm still an intelligent, successful, independent career woman --  
NOT a bimbo.""  


""Why don't you slide those expensive stockings down those long,  
pretty legs, Susie?  You can sit in the chair, if that makes it  
easier.  But I want you to put your feet in the air like a model,  
so I can watch you roll the stockings down those beautiful stems  
of yours.""  


Susan awkwardly obeyed, putting her foot on the edge of his desk as  
she rolled first one and then the other stocking down her shapely  
legs.  She casually tossed the carefully rolled stockings into the  
heap of discarded clothes on the floor, stood up, and removed her  
garter belt.  


She once again nervously crossed her hands in front of her as she  
stood before her tormentor in just her lacy pink bra and panties.    
He said nothing, but leaned back in his chair and smiled, relishing  
his absolute authority over his squirming victim.  


""Could I keep my bra and panties on, sir?  You can still s-see  
my...posture if I keep my underwear on.  Please, sir!"" she whined.    
Please don't strip me bare naked!""  


The coach smiled indulgently.  ""We went all through this last time,  
Susie.  The pictures I'm going to take of you require you to remove  
ALL of your clothes.   And that means 'top AND bottom,' young  
lady!""  


His tone was wonderfully patronizing.  


""I'm surprised that you seriously thought I might let you keep your  
cute little undies, Susie.  They're much fancier than they were  
last time, and I'm sure that they are much more expensive.  But you  
had to hand them over THEN, and you have to hand them over NOW.     


""You were never the brightest bulb on the tree, Susie, and I can  
see THAT hasn't changed,"" he chuckled.  ""Now, quit stalling, and  
show nice Coach Letch those pretty little country girl jugs of  
yours.""  


""I'm not a bimbo...I'm not a bimbo!"" she repeated to herself,  
trying desperately to use the positive reaffirmations she had  
employed for years.  She reluctantly turned her back and  
unclasped her bra.     


""Still modest after all these years, Susie?  I would think you  
wouldn't have any modesty left after those pictures I took.    
Remember, I've seen every square inch of you.""     


Silent, she shrugged her bra off and dropped it onto the floor, her  
face crimson with shame.  


""And I'm going to see every square inch of you again,"" he added.  


Even though her back was turned, Susan stood hunched over in  
humiliation, with her arms across her bare chest.  Coach Letch  
smiled as he recalled seeing the frightened, tearful teenager  
in exactly the same pose years ago.  


""Now comes the moment of truth, Susie.  I know girls hate having to  
drop their underpants in front of the doctor, but this is for your  
own good.  Pull down your undies and throw them on the pile.""  


She nervously brushed away a tear as she inserted her fingers into  
the waistband of her expensive pink panties.  Down, down, down they  
went, until at last they lay in a discarded heap at her feet.  She  
swallowed and then reluctantly stepped out of her last shred of  
clothing.  


""I'm NAKED!"" she told herself.  ""I'm absolutely, stark NAKED!  I'm  
one of the most successful lawyers in the country, and the wife of  
a United States Senator....  And I'm standing stark NAKED in some  
flunky gym coach's office.""  


Naked as the day she was born!  Coach Letch took a moment to admire  
what he laughingly referred to as the ""Congressional Moon"" before  
issuing his next command.  


""You know what comes next, don't you, Susie?"" he taunted.  ""Don't  
make me say it.  Just be a good girl, and do what you're supposed  
to.""  


Swallowing hard, she closed her eyes, stretched her arms out in a  
""T,"" and slowly turned around....  


He whistled as her nakedness came fully into view.  ""You keep  
yourself in excellent shape, young lady.  Your hips are a tad  
fuller, and your face is a bit wiser-looking.  And it seems that  
you've trimmed your pubic hair a bit.  But, otherwise, you are as  
hot as you were 15 years ago.""  


The humiliated woman closed her eyes and clenched her teeth as he  
issued his humiliating appraisal.  She was proud of her figure, but  
he was grading her like a slab of well-aged beef.  


Her education, experience, and sophistication had been stripped  
away.  In just a few brief minutes in front of his desk, she had  
been transformed into the epitome of everything she hated.    


After all of these years, Susie was once again nothing but a hot,  
helpless little bimbo.     


He circled the naked, blushing woman in a slow circle and looked her  
over critically.     


""Very nice...very nice indeed,"" he said, as she blushed helplessly  
in front of him.  


He carefully adjusted her hair on her shoulders.  Then he teasingly  
ran his hand down her back and over her shapely bottom.  


She gasped as she felt his fingers work their way into the wetness  
between her legs.  


""My, you are all hot and sticky down there, aren't you, Susie?    
After all these years, stripping for me still makes you frisky,  
doesn't it?""  


He leaned in close and whispered into her ear as he continued to  
work his fingers in and out of her.   ""I have lots of women I could  
have called back, Susan.  One of my former students is a network  
news anchor, a couple of others models or movie actresses.  I will  
get to them eventually, but you're the first one I called.""  


He paused and smiled.  ""You were always my favorite, Susie.""  


Then he pushed her a few feet forward and unceremoniously bent her  
over the desk.  She gasped as she felt him roughly kick her feet  
apart.  


And she flinched when she saw him unzip his pants....  


""Please, Coach, please use a condom!  Tom had a vasectomy three  
years ago!  I'm not on birth control, and, with his political  
views, there's just no way I can go to an abortion clinic.""  


""Then I guess you'll just have to carry the little bastard to term,  
Susie,"" he sneered, as he teased her moistness with the head of his  
prick.  


Her hands formed helpless fists of frustration as her nemesis  
entered her from behind.  ""I'm not a bimbo; I'm not a bimbo,"" she  
said softly to herself, as her orgasm began to wash over her.  


""Oh, but you ARE a bimbo, Susie,"" he said, correcting her.  ""Forget  
about your fancy degrees and expensive house; you're nothing but a  
helpless little bimbo for me to enjoy, Susie.  And enjoy you I  
shall.""  He pushed himself deep inside her.  


Susie looked back over her shoulder at Coach Letch with an  
expression that told him she knew it was true.  In her large,  
frightened eyes, he saw a lifetime of confusion, helplessness,  
desperation, and humiliation.  Susie WAS just another bimbo....     


Coach smiled.  The French were correct, in this at least: the more  
things changed, the more they stayed the same....

ds4pzi,9,2019-11-05,"Rachel, please don't put your faith in _ _ _.",i_love_bananas___,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/ds4pzi/rachel_please_dont_put_your_faith_in/,"When I first met \_\_\_, he was still the first person his ex called when she was going through something or having a bad day. He ran to her every time she needed help, and bitterly complained about it afterward. I resented her for this. I should have resented him for it instead, but I didn’t. He would tell me that I was so strong and he was so relieved to be with someone that he didn’t have to fix. 

Then a few months later, I was blindsided by a death in my family. Mere weeks into my grief, \_\_\_ tried to break it off and told me he didn’t want another “project.” I begged him to stay. He did. I found out later that he began cheating on me at that point. When I found out he cheated, I grieved, lost 30 lbs, obsessed over the other woman, lost all my sex drive, my self esteem. He begged me to stay. I did. I defended him to friends. I lost my identity and became fully wrapped up in his. 

For many years, we tried to “rebuild.” He wanted sex every single time we were alone. Sex became painful and difficult for me. I never wanted it anymore. When I did relent, it was only to keep him from cheating or leaving. If I left him I would be completely alone. I built my entire life around him and his dreams. My family loved him. He was incredibly charming and I kept his terrible secrets from them. He lived with my parents rent free and was able to go from part time to full time at the job he loved because of that. 

Even though sex was always an issue, our life became stable and it seemed that we had matured. We married. I started to work on my depression and finding a better job. I did not become a new person overnight. It was a long process with trying out different medications, for instance.

I remember meeting you around this time. You were an intern at  \_\_\_’s work and were with a sort of socially inept guy. \_\_\_ and I laughed later about how the two of you only seemed to have stories from college and it was in situations like those where we both felt really old. I distinctly remember feeling like you were side-eying me the whole time. It’s funny, when I get big vibes from someone like that I’m almost never wrong.

We had talked about moving for years and there was a job opportunity for me in a city we loved. I took it and moved, he stayed behind and looked for work. Actually, now that I think about it I did most of the looking for him. We visited every weekend but it was extremely difficult to be apart. I was really lonely. He barely made an effort. I was alone for most of our shared holiday break, on my birthday and our anniversary.

I started to get anonymous messages on social media about how my husband was a cheat. No details or conversation, the person would delete their account almost immediately. Although I had mostly gotten over the sting of his cheating from the long ago past, this brought it all back. Why would someone do this? Was it new cheating or did someone find out about what had happened before? 

\_\_\_ got extremely distressed too, but mostly he was just mad at me for indulging the thought that it could be real. The person would show up every few months. I started to feel like maybe it was someone who was in love with him or someone that he actually was cheating with. If it was a concerned party or someone who wanted to warn me, they might have said who they were or given evidence rather than just cruelly tell me that my husband was a cheat and expect that alone would make our relationship implode.

When \_\_\_ did find a job here, it seemed like everything was finally falling into place. But then he showed me a picture on his phone and I saw the next pic was a nude. I asked him who it was for and he flew into a rage. I am pretty sure he gave me almost every excuse in the book to leave. He had a bad first day at his new job. He gave up a job that he loved for me. Was tired of my depression. Knew I would find new ways to be unhappy. That he had never been single for very long and needed to be alone. Find himself. The list could go on and on.

So he left me. After 12 years, he completely shut me off. No closure. Pressured me to divorce immediately without a lawyer, within days. Which is sort of comical, as you probably know by now he is literally allergic to anything that includes paperwork or paying bills. He took his things from my parent’s house where he had been living rent free and threw them all away. People stopped to pick through the bags and bags of our lives together. My mother with dementia went through all of them for fear of there being recyclables in the mix. I feel so incredibly guilty for shielding my family from his true nature for so long. This has hit them really hard. My niece and nephew knew him from birth and one day he was simply just gone. It was like he died.

The reason I will never send this letter to you is that I know I will just be seen as crazy. I am sure there are details in this letter that you already knew. However, I know that you’re always getting his spin. I am sure that you have bought into it all, already. It’s part of the deal with him. I bet you (and others) reading this would think I am naive or stupid after reading about the things he did. I saw them all. I just hated myself that much. 

Remember when I liked your photo on IG? Yup...I was scrolling through my discovery feed, saw a painting of his and clicked on what turned out to be your photo. And literally almost died when I accidentally thumb-liked it. Then you blocked me and my public facing photography account. The fact that you knew that was my other account and I had previously received the anonymous messages on it made me wonder. That was only a few months after \_\_\_ left. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I checked your page again and the two of you were obviously together.

I’ve learned from your feed that your “anniversary” with him was two weeks after he left me. I guess his needing to be single was either a lie or did not last long. Then a few weeks later, apparently you guys got matching tattoos. Several of my friends have pointed out that you seem to have entirely new interests and seem to have been SWFing me. 

I know that you are young...just out of college. I don’t hate you for being with him or copying a girl that you thought was cool. For a long time I did not feel any ill will towards you, no matter how much people around me tried to get me to focus on you (thanks, patriarchy). If there is anything I’m hurt by, it’s that you might have been the person who was sending me anonymous messages. That you might have had the chance to give me the full truth and didn’t. Or that you purposely inserted yourself into a situation that was easy to fuck up. Which is particularly jarring, considering your IG is filled with Pinterest platitudes about being kind to others. Most days I don’t let myself go too far down that path. \_\_\_ is the real piece of shit here.

I am worried about you, though. If you are anything like I was, you are already under his spell. I was one in a long line and you are too. Do not make the mistake of thinking you are different or will change him. Although he seems younger than he is, (let that sink in...is that really a positive trait?) it's a little concerning that he ended up with a former intern. You both work in a profession where image is really important. What happens when you don’t fit for him anymore or he makes dating women 12 years younger a habit? 

I saw that you quit your job and moved to be with him, so that already means it’s too late. Fuck."

ds64ri,94,2019-11-05,"What are your favorite and least favorite chapters in FE3H, and why?",HowDoI-Internet,fireemblem,https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/ds64ri/what_are_your_favorite_and_least_favorite/,"So, now that the game has been out for more than three months, I think it's safe to assume that quite a few people have cleared the game in its entirety.

I've seen quite a few favorite route/ending/character/support threads go around, but have yet to see a discussion on the best and maybe worst chapters in the game (if it has *actually* been done already, I apologize).

So here it is! A small thread to discuss which were your favorite and least favorite chapters in 3H, whether in terms of gameplay, story, tone, sheer *awesomeness*, anything really. 

And if you haven't cleared the whole game yet, well, *stealthily* dodge potential spoilers and share your favorite from the path(s) you've completed! Or don't and just, uh, observe? ~~Idk~~

In any event, I'll start with my own:

* Favorite:

It would be a tie between **Ch10 of White Clouds and Ch17 of Crimson Flower**. On my first run, the sudden change of tone in Ch10 left a big impression on me. Be it the music, or all of the character lines and scenes acknowledging Jeralt's death and Byleth's grief, it was enough to make me tear up, as silly as it may sound. 

It actually made me feel like someone important had just been lost, and I absolutely loved the change in atmosphere. *Dat revenge* map was awesome and the ""awakening"" cutscene with its epic track is one of my favorite in the whole game. I often think that White Clouds as a whole was better than any branching paths, and this was probably when it reached its peak for me.

As for Ch17 of CF, that was probably the most epic chapter in the whole game for me, and it being followed by an equally fun last map made it even better. The Tailtean Plains map is absolutely awesome and so fun to beat, especially the first time with Seiros pulling those s*urprise, motherfucker* reinforcements that got me a little panicky. 

Quite a few moments in that chapter were deserving of a cutscene if I'm being completely honest, be it what qualifies as a properly *epic* face-off between Seiros (in her best form let's be honest) and Edelgard, or Dimitri's death scene. Not to mention my personal biggest 3H sob moment with Annette and Mercedes facing each other on the battlefield. As a sucker for tragedies, Mercedes' lines hit me so hard I had to put down the console for a little while.

* Least favorite:

As hyped as the E3 trailer had me for the three way post-timeskip battle, I have to say that **Gronder Field** is most *definitely* my least favorite chapter in the entire game, particularly in Azure Moon where the plot unfortunately makes it even messier. 

That one may be beating a dead horse so I won't go into too much detail, but it overall felt like a very forced reunion to me whether in AM or VW. The map is messy, the characters' battle dialogue is contradicted by the gameplay (*chaotic battlefield* isn't chaotic at all, Claude's dialogue implies that Dimitri is the aggressor but the gameplay apparently didn't get the memo in AM) and an IS intern may or may not have forgotten to turn on the fog of war.

And of course, the plot building up to and following the map itself is a proper *mess* and what I personally consider to be 3H's lowest low from a story standpoint.

~~Gronder Field deserved better or maybe it didn't idk~~

That's it for me, please share your own preferences if you like, and remember that this is about ***personal*** opinions (please don't let it get unnecessarily heated)."

I got a rejection from Google after I took the assessment test. However, I did not get any specific feedback to act upon.

Little more about myself - I am actually interested in pursuing a systems internship with a focus on research, but I am not a PhD student, so am trying out the waters on what is my worth in the job market. At the same time I am pursuing systems project with a research bent with one of the professors in our college. Not really sure how to show what I am capable of, if I don't get a chance to show it.

ds6ypt,0,2019-11-05,"Ex BF, FWB, and Best Friend (20M) is a SEX GOD but extremely unhealthy for me (20F)",sus_tea,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds6ypt/ex_bf_fwb_and_best_friend_20m_is_a_sex_god_but/,"Background:

We met in the begining of my freshman, his sophomore year. We have been fucking, making love, him dominating me since we laid eyes on one another. It's simply electric. The best sex. He's my dom, my first, and I'm his sub, his first. We were FWB, then dating, then dating didn't work out. I am sure he has his reasons as he is extremely pessimistic (he knows this and states it frequently when talking about his own character, but doesn't care to change it. I, on the other hand, am very optimistic. When we had our first disagreement EVER- which took over two months at least to get to- he came over, hugged and kissed me, and said ""Hey \_\_\_\_ I am breaking up with you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then tears

&amp;#x200B;

Then me reaching out to him

&amp;#x200B;

Then amazing AMAZING sex. It repeated and repeated.

&amp;#x200B;

I cut him off in spring of last year, moved on, dated someone new. Thought about him every moment. Eventually got back together with him, and he- through his deepest emotions I think he has- visited me back at our State School ( I was taking summer courses) and apologized to me with tears in his eyes. We didnt start a relationship but damn. It was the best 'thing' I have ever had. My best friend. Such a beautiful, funny but in the worst ways, understanding, empathetic Jewish Asshole that (even now) I adore. Even better that he chokes me out and uses toys.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways- during the summer, he worked such long hours, and he was home for this. Not many friends in Tampa (where his internship is). Although the summer was the best, in the back of my mind I wondered if he had this whole revelation to apologize because he was lonely. A part of me, the small, condescending part of me supports that train of thought, while the other remembers him giving me tours of tampa, driving all the way to my hometown and staying with me... Also, during this time, I was sexually assaulted by a mutual friend and he cut those people out (... to an extent) and comforted me extensively.

&amp;#x200B;

Fall Semester: We are both at Uni, we happened to live doors down from one another in the same appt, and we are both busy. I always make time for him and invite him out. He appreciates it but hardly obliges. Sex is still great... but eventually, he changes again. Exactly what I feared, he was the same as the year before. A simple 'disagreement' (me asking him to give me more affirmed dates and times of hanging out bc I have A SCHEDULE TOO) and he shut me out.

The last time he did this, he literally called off all contact over text and I was balling, he came over, and after a couple minutes of me crying and him saying that leaving was the only option, he looked at me in the eyes and said, 'You have baggage.""

I was raped a year ago.

The man I loved left me over text, came over to only say, ""you have baggage"" to my face. I will never forget that.

Not the best decision, but we ended up not talking to each other for a couple days. Then contact. No sex, but kissing. I didnt and dont want his body or sex anymore, and I am sleeping with other people. At this point, I am detattched. I told him this and he seemed to be sad, but for some reason didnt freak out and leave like he usually does. Was this part of Summer Personality or..? Who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

My birthday passes and he barely sends me a good bday message. I am further hurt. Then, two nights ago, after plannig on seeing him and him cancelling for over a week and a half, he calls off the meeting yet again. At this point, I just wanted to tell him face to face that I was seeing someone else seriously. He cancels so... I go off ( I may have done this once before in the past year and a half). No cussing, just me saying I am hurt and I am seeing someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

He responds with, "" I am sorry BUT- it's really on both ends etc etc"". This is usually his form of apologizing. Never genuine. He tells me that if I am seeing someone else, we shouldnt have sex, which is another manipulating ish text since I am the one that's denied him sex the last three weeks.

I just texted him saying I cant do it anymore, and deleted and blocked his number. I a so broken. And.. This one is different. Ive never been sexually compatible with anyone like him, didn't think it was possible. But moreover, he is my absolute best friend. I have promise to always be there for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to unblock and talk to him in person... maybe wait? I am not sure. Also, I am not sure how to emotionally move on. I have a guy in my life who I am seeing seriously (no labels yet) and when I am with him, I forget all about the other guy.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you move on?

Am I cheating this new prospect?"

Ideally looking for someone to play a dominant female but could be persuaded if you want to play a submissive female. I’m also open to dom males but the role would have to be something I really like. If you have ideas in mind then feel free to suggest them but I’ll list a few below I enjoy:

Celebrity roleplay- variety of options here but would ideally be you playing the domme celeb. My personal favourite is to play your personal assistant but again I’m open.

Someone I know- again a few options but the premise is you play someone from my personal life and we have an encounter and build from there.

WWE roleplay- you play one or several of the women from the WWE and I, a new intern am inexperienced and easy to boss around.

Superhero/villain- mainly into the girls from batman but happy for marvel characters to. The idea is either you save me and I owe you or you capture me and have your way with me.

Teacher/student- basic but you play the teacher and I play the student 

MHA- you play one of the girls from my hero academia, open minded with ideas for this

If you have your own suggestions please feel free to pitch them but if you like one of mine then let me know.

Message me your asl and what your interested in, bonus for anyone that will play more than one character."

dsazyk,25,2019-11-05,I wanted to go over my exit plan. I am leaving US and never coming back.,[deleted],studentloandefaulters,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentloandefaulters/comments/dsazyk/i_wanted_to_go_over_my_exit_plan_i_am_leaving_us/,"I am a US citizen. Over 40. $150,000 in student loan debt. Just recently went through bankruptcy. Divorced. Convicted violent felon....

My life was on track and I had no problem paying off the student loan. I made a lot of money doing something I loved. Then I was screwed over by my ex-wife. I cheated on her and she ruined my life. If you have read the book or watched the movie Gone Girl, similar thing happened to me. I was wrong to cheat on her which fueled her hatred of me, but I am not sure I deserved to lose everything. Still, it was my fault.

It has been over two years and after 6 months in jail, I finalized my bankruptcy and I have about $10,000 left to restart my life. I can't get the jobs that I once had. I used to work in a mid-sized corporation making $80,000 a year and on my way to that six figures. My degree was unrelated to my previous line of work and it was in social work, so I can't use that for specialized jobs. My resume is filled with years of steady work and volunteering at charities for many many years, but that information is useless with my new label as an ex-convict.

I have worked as a server for a few months now to get by. Due to my good behavior, my 7-year probation will end in 3. I have never had a temper or violent tendencies or other criminal records. I was just pushed to the limit and my reaction was recorded on tape and used against me. In the past 40 years of my life, I had never gotten angry, but this one instance practically ruined my life. I was driven to a breaking limit and it was very obviously orchestrated, but I broke the law. At least I didn't have to go to prison for 5 years. I was given 9 months in jail, released in 6 for being good. I really enjoyed teaching other inmates GED materials and other life skills. Read a lot.

I am moving to one of the EU countries. I have a friend from college/work that can get me a visa in his country through his company for at least 10 years. He has seen me work and I am very professional when it comes to work ethics. It doesn't pay very well, but I should make about $30K a year to start. But without the $1500/month student loan payment, I don't see an issue.

I have a year left on my supervised probation. State of Iowa is tough on criminals, but the judge and the probation officer has been good to me as I have been a model inmate and probationer.

I am finalizing my bankruptcy. I owe over $60,000 in CC debt. Legal bills mostly. As I look at the Brunner Test, I seem like I could qualify, but I saw several attorneys who wanted the money upfront with no guarantees. They needed to charge 3-4 times more for the extra work to deal with student loan with my bankruptcy.

I have 2 undergraduate degrees (dual major). Most of my debt came from 2 years of masters degree program that I was getting ready to finish. I had 2 semesters left when this happened. I can't finish the degree because I can't get licensed or do the required internship because felony excludes any places I can go to volunteer.

Thought about taking on another graduate degree, but as I have no intention of paying back, it would be considered a fraud now. While I am a criminal now, I still am hesitant to break the law. I could rack up another $60K in student loans for another graduate degree I can't use in the US.

I make about $4 per hour plus tips now working as a server in a small restaurant that I was willing to overlook my past. I can't pay the $210,000 I owe. I am going to leave and never come back. There's nothing left for me here. I have 2 children that I can't see because of a court order for another 4 years. I can't afford the cost to visit the supervised visitation place allowed as I don't have a vehicle to get me that far and I can't really afford the $100+ taxi fare any more. No public transportation goes there and I have to work weekends so I can't do the 2 hour walk there and the court only allows visits at their mother's convenience. This place was intentionally picked out of my reach. It kills me that I can't see them, but what good is a father who can't give them anything but grief and look of failure. I used to live on revenge, but I love my children too much to hurt their mother. Besides, I am not sure I can do it anyway. I am way more depressed than angry.

What money I have left, I will use to resettle in another country. I can get by for another year working at this restaurant. Thank goodness that I could find that job. Most places don't hire violent felons. I understand that it is risky for their business. I have been violent once in my life. But it is what I am not to others.

I know it looks bleak for many and that's what drove you to search out this sub-reddit. It may seem like the bottom can't give out any further, but I wanted to share my story to let you know that maybe you have it better than I do. Not being able to vote today reminded me that I can no longer be a citizen in the country that I held dear. Being ripped away from my children out of spite made me really hate myself. Not being able to pay back what I owe made me feel even more worthless. This is my story of why I am defaulting on my loan. I hope you have a better luck with your plans. Don't become a failure like me. I will die in a foreign land somewhere with the long forgotten memories of my children whom I loved more than my life."

For example, I didn’t really know what I wanted to major in until about junior year which pushed me back a lot in college. I only completed internships towards the end, and am currently doing a recent grad paid internship now in the Bay Area.

Every day I feel like I shouldn’t be here because I’m not in tech even though I love the work environment so far. Everyone (online) just constantly reminds me of how poor I’ll be especially here. I’m all about experiencing things so I took it because I’m young and still have so much time to change my path if need be in the future but I feel like everyone thinks I’m dumb for doing this. 

Even now I look at my friends who are making more than me in similar entry level positions and wish I were like them. I’m constantly worried that I’m gonna be poor forever (especially since I didn’t have much growing up) so while I’m happy about this learning opportunity I just feel like I’m still not doing good enough. I wish I was smarter and good at tech and stuff that people thinks really matters in the industry. 

Most people in here say anything under 100k is pretty much useless so I feel bad about the work I’m doing even though I like it."

dscifs,1,2019-11-06,I [24F] am getting extremely annoyed at my classmate's [24M] attitude towards me but he's my only study buddy for that class,sasquatchgeorge,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dscifs/i_24f_am_getting_extremely_annoyed_at_my/,"Background (not sure if relevant): I'm in my last term of my master's program in engineering so I don't have to deal with guys like this anymore after this term. All throughout undergrad and my other classes, guys have always been pretty nice in helping me understand course material whether or not they were interested in me. They genuinely just wanted to see everyone do well because why not. I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing because he's not from here (I'm not sure if I can disclose the race), so maybe at home that's just normal how he talks and interacts with people. This school/program is also majorly composed of international students especially from his country, I am still the only local person I know in this program. 

This starts back at the beginning of the semester in like the 2nd lecture, I got to class just a tad late and all the seats at the front were taken so I sat at the back. Then a minute later this guy (let's call him B) comes in and sits next to me. This class was where I formed my first impression of him which was not great. He like a few others in the class loved to just speak and answer the prof's rhetorical questions just to be heard, or likes to finish the prof's equation as he's writing them on the board or just takes a slight pause so they can show off that they are ""smarter than the prof"". This annoys the heck out of me because they just sound like jerks because their comments only make them sound dumber or there are politer ways of correcting the prof. 

Then there was a social event for all graduate students in engineering, which I went with another friend (F) not taking this course, and another dude (Let's call him C) in this course who also invited another of his friend (M) not in this course. As we're just sitting there enjoying our drinks, B randomly comes up to me, which at the time I didn't really recognize him (it's like a class of 40 kids and 5 girls so harder for us to recognize all of them). He asks, ""Are you in XXX class?"" I hesitated cuz I was not sure what he wanted from me but eventually answered ""yes, and so is C"". Then he proceeded to ask if I had a group yet for the group project. I said no, the prof hasn't even announced the project yet. B proceeds to pull out a doc from some kid who has taken the course before and says it's a group of 3 and if he could be in my group. I said umm I haven't thought about it yet, but what's your name? So we learned each other's names at that was the end of that night. 

Fast forward to more recently, C no longer responds to my messages probably because I refused to send him my full solution assignments when he asked for them. I told him I could explain things to him, but personally I wasn't sure if he'd be able to really just look at it, understand it, then do it himself, or at the least word it differently so I wouldn't be accused of plagiarism in any way (C is also international). He also doesn't live close to campus so he has rejected studying or working together on the assignments at school.

B, on the other hand, is constantly asking to study with me. I was confused at first because he told me his GPA was around 4.0 (A) which is much higher than mine so why would he bother studying with me? Then he started complaining about how it was unfair that his GPA was higher but because he's not a PR, he hasn't gotten any interviews while I've already secured an internship for next term. I just responded that yeah that kinda sucks for international people if they want to do coop.

For the first assignment, we all did it alone, and despite me getting the second question wrong, the TA who marked it must have pitied all my hard work formatting it all nicely in Latex and also commented that I actually tried it unlike others who found the answer somewhere so he ended up giving me perfect marks for that assignment. B asked me what I got and i said 100%, you? and he responded, ""WHAT? I got 90. This is so unfair. It must be because you're a girl, that's why he pitied you. This is cheating. You shouldn't be getting marks for that just for trying or because you made a fancy report."" I don't remember all the things he says but he still brings it up from time to time and he's not even joking about it, he legit feels that it is unfair. Turns out, he actually got another part of question 1 wrong in the assignment and that's why he lost marks. 

For the second assignment, we studied together to compare our answers. It was good cuz it turns out I made a mistake in every single question so he saved me and I ended up getting perfect on it. And then we studied together for the midterm, he got perfect and I did worse than him which I expected but I was happy enough with my grade. So he asks me, what did your other friend (C) get? I said I didn't know because as soon as he got it, he didn't look pleased and just flipped it upside down on his desk, I only asked if it was good or bad and he responded bad. I didn't want to push it if he didn't want to say cuz I probably wouldn't have anything consoling to say if it was worse than mine. Then B flips out again and says (this was over text) ""Why won't B tell you what he got? it's just a number!"" And I had it with him so I told him, ""Well yes of course to you it's just a number cuz you got perfect, why does it even matter what other people got if you obviously did better than them? do you just want to know how badly they did? You won't ever know how it feels to be at the bottom of the class and to have someone who did way better constantly ask you for your marks just to see how bad you did."" He turned it around and responded ""Well actually I did fail a subject in class 7. Why are you trying to make me feel bad? That's not what I meant."" I about had it here and just stopped responding because it was enough and not going anywhere. It bothered me because he wanted to show he hasn't always been at the top of the class so he understands what it feels like to get bad marks. Yet his actions spoke differently with no such compassion.

In the last assignment, we met up again, he had time and started on it before we met up, but I hadn't started at all. He told me to bring my laptop so he could use Matlab on it because his laptop is too heavy and I was more familiar with it. While I was solving the questions and typing them into Matlab, I realized that I didn't put them in the proper form on my paper so I wanted to rewrite it out so it would be easier for me, and he just said, ""Why do you have to rewrite it?? It's so simple you can do the conversion in your head"" I got pissed and said okay you type it in, but I'm still gonna write it down so I remember what I did when I write my final report. And then he goes ""ooh, she's getting mad"" Like no duh. We basically solved everything and had a general code which I sent to him so he could format the graphs himself so ours wouldn't be the same. He asks if we're meeting again on the day it's due, and I was confused and said, no... why would we need to? It's just writing the final report, if we have any questions then we can just message. 

On the day it's due, he messages again and asks if I saw the prof's newest message clarifying the problems. He said, ""You're welcome, it's because I just went to talk to the prof and talked about the whole  problem that's why the prof sent out that message."" and i was just like ty. I read them but didn't quite understand how it affected my solution. And after a long time he was finally able to pin point what it was for one of the questions. I changed it and continued working on my final copy. He then says, ""well I have class this evening (the assignment was due at midnight) but I think I can finish the rest on my own. If I can't figure out the matlab this evening then you can help me."" I thought to myself, I already sent you our codes from last time so why would I have to do your Matlab part for you, especially in the last hours it's due. I have my own assignment to worry about. I can't remember if I responded, prolly just said good luck or sth. Then later that night he asks if I changed my answer for problem 3, and I was like ""No. because I told you, I don't see how what the prof said changes anything."" He didn't provide any help or clarification and at that point I had basically finished typing everything out. I also was kinda thankful for his earlier help and since he asked for my final report, I sent it to him cuz I knew he wouldn't copy it, plus he was writing it out by hand. He opens it and says ""I hate you. Who even does that? (I made some really nice drawings in Latex which took about an hour) but could have been drawn by hand in like 2 minutes) The TA isn't even marking you on the diagram and the presentation of the assignment."" Then he said, ""send me the Matlab for problem 2, quick."" So I sent it, whatever. He never responded on how to fix problem 3 so I went to make dinner and submitted my assignment soon after. When he finally finished his, he messaged, ""I'm finally done"" and had the guts to say ""I didn't even use your code"" except he just rudely asked for them and I sent it immediately. 

Oh I should also add, he's been constantly asking, when are you going to treat me?? I thought he was joking cuz like we barely knew each other and aren't that close just cuz we studied together a few times. I asked what for? and he said, for assignment 2, since he corrected all my mistakes, and also for the midterm, and because I got a job, I should treat as a celebration. I thought it was a joke so I was like sure. But more recently he's been seriously asking every other day, when am I getting my treat?? To me it's weird because he's the one who wanted to help me in the first place, why am I ""paying"" for this now? If I was that grateful for it, then yeah I would suggest treating but it's never been this explicit that someone demanded it. Plus I brought timbits one time and he was like noooo this doesn't count as a treat. As for getting a job, I understand that except, I would celebrate with my close friends not someone I just met for a month or 2 and literally only meet up for school related things. I know that he might be interested but I am definitely not interested in him. 

So TL:DR, This guy helps me with the assignments and studying in general which is great but the way he talks is quite derogatory towards females and I don't know what to do because I still want to do well in the course and since the prof hasn't given out the group project yet, it would be better to be in a group with people I know that at least understand the material than some randos in the class."

But my period was late, and we decided to take a test. I figured just to quiet my anxiety to prove to myself we weren’t pregnant. Turns out... we are! 

I started crying immediately because I got so freaked out. This was not our plan. My husband and I just got married six weeks ago. We wanted time to ourselves to grow together. I’m so scared about the responsibility and all the change that’s coming. We are in our late 20s and pretty stable, but my husband just started his intern year of residency as a doctor. His schedule will be insane for many more years, we’re far away from family, and we have debt we wanted to take care of. I’m mourning the time I thought we’d have alone and all of the fun plans we made for us as newlyweds. 

On the other hand, I know so many couples are trying so hard to be in our position. I feel guilty for being so upset and scared. I know that when the baby comes I will be in a completely different headspace and will be so thrilled and in love with the little person. But how do I cope until I get to that place?

This is my first year teaching, and I know the name of the game is that I’m not their friend. I am teaching in a fairly strange environment, socioeconomically, it is a very small school that is split from families who either make $300k a year in the oil and gas industry or are financially unstable. There is also a big ethnic/cultural mix in my school as it is a predominantly white population with about a 25% indigenous population who come from a reserve, the students unfortunately don’t mix very often and there is a big divide between them which we as a staff are trying to fix. Just trying to give as much of the background info as possible. 

I love teaching and have wanted to do this basically my entire life but thus far it has not been the dream I thought it would be. Which is a disappointment, because while I was on my internship for my education degree I did amazing. This was almost a year ago and only for a three month period and I still have kids writing me to see how I’m doing, emailing me telling me that I changed their lives. I experienced pure bliss every day of my internship which made me feel like I had nailed it.

In my new teaching job, I am outside of my comfort zone in what I am teaching, subject-wise. I am teaching grades 7–12, I struggle much less with the high school students but with the junior high students I struggle unimaginably. Particularly with the grade 9 class, which ironically I am teaching them science, they are one of the only classes I have where I am teaching my teachable area of expertise. They are very unacademic, not interested in school or any subject in it. This class is very tough, I could be choking and no one would bat an eye. I say good morning to every child by name every day and I have yet to receive a good morning back, same as when they leave. They do not smile, they do joke and they do not participate or engage in lessons. They do not respond to me talking about my life as many other classes do (I know I’m new but I’ve always found it a great way to make connections). They just simply don’t care and make zero effort to pretend they do or to try and change it. I know that they are not like this in other classes (although teachers agree they are the absolute toughest class) and one teacher basically came to me and told me they hated me. I just don’t know how to change this? I teach science, which I was told at the beginning of the year that this particular group of students has never liked science, and I get that it is not everyone’s cup of tea, but I am new to teaching and being loathed is something new to me as well. I had students on my internship question my marking or not enjoy every single lesson, but hey if I sneezed they said bless you and if I said good morning they’d say “good morning, sir” with a smile. I really don’t know how to relate to these kids who are unmotivated, unwilling and seemingly unhappy. I use humour, I am strict but fair, I give them their notes that are fill-in so they don’t have to write so much. I asked them all of their favourite music on the first day and I created a playlist that I put on for them while they do work. I’m certainly willing to accept that I may be the problem, but that’s why I am here, for advice so I don’t need to put a count down on until the end of the year to get the hell out of here. I’ve went to my principal who keeps asking me what I plan to do about it, and I’ve tried all that I know how but every day after school I spend a good few hours trying to re-plan or re-work but nothing I’ve came up with has gotten any kind of positive response from them. To give you perspective, one day I went an entire class where nobody said one word. Literally not one word spoken except by me. I want to enjoy this and I want them to at least say good morning to me, even if they hate the science curriculum I am teaching. I know everyone says you’re not in the game to be liked and that I’m fresh out and I need to grow a thick skin, but can’t we all agree teaching is way more easier when we are liked? It doesn’t have to be this way, and the ironic thing is I don’t think I’m like Satan or anything because my grade 8’s love me, my physics class and I have innumerable inside jokes with me, but I do struggle in other classes but this one is really taking a toll on me and my mental health.

Thank you."

I need to find a place to put this story, I have told many people in my close vicinity, friends and family, even total strangers:  
  
My youngest daughter has spots. Brown spots. They are not infectious, or harmfull to others. She had chicken-pox at 11 months, a bit early, at roughly the same time as her sister. When the red spots caused by the chicken pox dissapeared they turned brown. Our physician said they were likely remnants or scars and we should not worry. So we didn't....    
  
Our little girl went to daycare like any other kid, 2 times a week. 
We went to Parent and Kid gymnastics, and later to toddler gymnastics. I cound she was active for 10-12 minutes and then wanted a rest for 5 minutes or so. We noticed same with walking or playing in the yard, 10-12 minutes playing actively 5 minutes of sitting down. We still didn't notice something amiss. 
In winter when she went out into the yard she started stripping her clothes, eventually to a point where she removed everything except her undies. Still no real problems. 
We did notice her range in walking increased slowly, in forests the oldest one walked long stretches with us at 2,5 yrs old (2-4 km), and she well... didn't. We carried her in a carrying sling or cloth for quite some time. Actually I still do, but only now and then. 
  
We visited the consultation doctor (they give vaccination shots, keep track of growth and development in children) and found we had another doctor... Our new doctor noticed the spots and told us to consult a dermatologist. 
She said we should have our daughter blood tested and maybe get a biopt of one of the spots. At this time we were unsure what was going on, we asked the physician what she thought, maybe if she thought it was dangerous, or worse maybe cancerous.    
And she said: ""I cannot say anything for sure, but it would be wise to have it checked out.""   
So we did.   
  
We went to the local hospital talked to one of the pediatricians and she agreed there was enough cause to have a biopsy taken and check some blood values. Still no answer.   
  
2 weeks later we went for the biopsy, I remember I had to mark a spot on her back, use some contact anesthetic and when we arrived a dermatology intern further anesthetized the area with a syringe of local anesthetic and a few minutes later punched a hole in my kid, removing a small but deep biopt, 3-4 mm in diameter (say roughly 1/8th of an inch) and about 0.5 cm deep (1/5th inch). This tissue was sent to a pathologist, analyzed and studied.  
  
We were asked back. The pediatrician told us: ""We found something.""   
""What is it?"" we asked the pediatrician.  
Now we were pretty worried.  
She answered: ""Pigmentosa Urticaria"".      
We had no clue, and asked what this meant.    
She said: ""Well it's a disorder causing more then normal amounts of mast cells in the skin, clumped together like dots.""    
""And what is the prognosis?"" we asked.   
She answered us: ""It's mostly harmless, it means she's allergic to any things upsetting the skin.""  And we went home with a prescription for antihistamine, Levoceterizine. We tried this and our daughter felt itchy and uncomfortable. So we contacted our physician again, he swapped the medication to Desloratidine...    
   
Here our story really starts taking off....   
  
My youngest daughter has spots. Brown spots, to be more precise: My daughter has Cutaneous Mastocytosis, appearing as Pigmentosa Urticaria. Brown Spots.   
  
Kids around her noticed and accept it. P  
arents ask what it is when we are at swimming pools or when she's running around the camping site in just a legging. We try to explain:   
   
She has Mastocytosis, in general this means:  
She's allergic to    

* temperature changes     
* excertion and activity   
* emotions   

She's using antihistamine.   
It's not infectious, and no other person can get it from her.  
   
This seems understandable, but the small explanation doesn't change many things in our lives are different now: 
   
* We further insulated our house, removed all drafts as she reacts to cold bridges and drafts. We have blankets and considering changing our old wooden floor to tiles with floor heating.   

* We however do not have a warm house it's normally 17-18C where most people tend to make it 21-23C, in summer we do not actively cool during the day, we try to have the house change temps with the season. It lowers the difference between indoors and outdoors and my daughter tends to cope better with lower temperature differences between indoors and outdoors.  

* We (father and daughters, occasionally mama) are cycling regularly (I have Epilepsy and am not allowed to drive motorized means of transport in my country), but we have no bicycle for her as she cannot cycle for more then 10 minutes in temperate sunny weather. We however bought her a bicycle trailer to sit in for winter which was a good idea, we have a fleece blanket to wrap her in, it protects her from wind/draft. She also has a biketrailer to cycle on, with a seat instead of a saddle to preventy her falling of her bikesear when she passes out due to exertion or just the wind in her face on cold days.    
  
* We cook dinner seperate for her as the antihistamine medication is essential for her well being and certain foods seem to nullify their effectiveness. We have linked this to something called histamine intolerance, which she -doesn't have- BUT in her case exhibits itself due to histamine in food and histamine being produced by the body in reaction to certain foods and her noticing she doesn't feel well when medication levels drop.   
* We are trying to improve her muscle strength, she's very flexible to a point where she's nearly hyper mobile, which causes problems in running, cycling, swimming, putting on clothing (trying to put on shoes is complicated and requires a delicate and firm hand), sitting and doing simple things like drawing and using scissors. We work with a children's fysiotherapist to do this, as they are not aware of the dangers of overexerting my kid I am in the room and monitor my kid.   
  
* I accompany my kid when she's doing swimming lessons. Swimming is very dangerous. It's exertion, it's many temperature changes, it uses a lot of energy. I sit next to the bath (still toddler side, so walkable for me with clothes as it is 60-90 cm (2-3ft) deep) when she finishes this basic bath she'll progress to the actual swimming pool which is 1,20m to 2,40m deep (4-8 ft), with a diving corner 3,60 deep (12ft) and I'll have to sit there for 30 minutes in bathing gear, waiting for a moment which hopefully never comes. If stuff hit's the fan, she could black out, and potentially be in grave danger. I have done First Aid courses including resusitation for children, I have done basic and advanced training in rescue swimming, even before my kid was born, but brushed up on the courses and recertified myself. I mostly want her to learn how to swim so she can go to a pool , BUT actual outdoor swimming will likely be a problem, cause of big chances of a low water temperature and a faint in water can be fatal. In the Netherlands however are many waterways and Knowing how to swim will be vital knowledge.  
  
* I bring her to school daily, She's actively monitored during playtime. She's passed out on the swings before, and we hope it will not happen in the climbing rack as she'll likely fall down before people notice she's unconscious. Also physical education 2 times a week is supervised more closely. The teacher and the teacher's aid have been instructed on Epipen use and have a written permission to administer all medication provided by us without prior consultation. We made a special plan of action in case of faints, tiredness, loss of blood pressure  and actually asked our teacher to brush up on resuscitation for kids, she actually has had the complete first aid, also for kids and is one of the schools 3 emergency caregivers. Instructions for Epipen use have been given to all people who accompany our daughter, also to the parents who supervise lunch and parents who assist in day trips/school outings.  
  
* Our daughter cannot eat many things including chocolate, causing problems around Easter, Sinterklaas, Christmas and children's birthday's and parties or when kids give treats in school (sweets/cookies to the others in their class), in her class there is a kid with lactose intolerance and one with celeriac disease and one with nut allergies, and she herself cannot eat chocolate, and many flavorings including vanilla (cookies). In the class the favorite 2 choices of treats are potato chips (natural) and popcorn (sweet or salty) both intruding heavily on the school's wish of healthy treats, I have made fruit salad before and made a monkey platter for 35 ppl the time after, both very appreciated by the staff of the school, my daughter likes carrots, paprika (bell pepper), cucumber, water melon, apple, pear and banana, and occasionally a kiwi, she cannot tolerate tomatoes, citrus fruit (maybe an occasional mandarin or orange, lemon works well, but lime doesn't, nor does grapefruit, pomelo or kumquats, but in the end preferably she (tries to) ignore(s) them all), soft fruits and berries, pinapple is also a big no no. So food is an issue.  
  
* When we want to eat out we go to tapas restaurants, not because we like the concept or form, but because the dishes are small and if one is prepared in a way my daughter cannot eat it, we can always ask for something else. Things which tend to go wrong: vinegar, mushrooms, to much union, pickled foods, foods containing traces of alcohol, salads, smoked food, coal grilled food (BBQ?), fish or fishy products (oyster sauce, fishsauce), shellfish, dishes with red or other spicy peppers, ginger, things made with coffee or cocoa. She generally reacts adverse to things with high levels of umami. Regarding food it's simple she reacts to the heat of the restaurant and the excitement, and the foods will reduce medication effectiveness. Strangely enough she does like pizza, but only with salami (pepperoni without pepper)  
  
* She reacts adversely to air conditioning and heating, walking into a store with a hot blower thing can make her faint. In the summer taking the train (public transport) to her hospital in Rotterdam is dangerous, trains are air co-ed often 21-25C degrees and outside it has been 35C+ regularly in the past years. It will make her blood pressure drop and she'll go out if not placed horizontally asap, which can be awkward in a commuter train. The fact I try to administer more medication tends to freak people out, I've managed to cut short most calls to the emergency services and prevented a guy trying to pull the emergency brake before. I often no longer react to weird looks and such, and just say they need to ignore it and accept some things cannot be helped. Attendants in trains have tried to make it more comfortable for her a few times, we have been in the conductor's private space before and others have suggested additional stops be planned for emergency medical treatment, but with some explanation I tend to get where I'm travelling to.  
  
* We had several instances she blacked out on us, lost consciousness for shorter or longer times and/or exhibited shock symptoms. We tend to give more antihistamine, but we also carry EpiPens (for adults). I often feel like a field medic, trying to stabilize my girl in stupid places. I carry her often, my daughter being 5 years old and born of a 2m04 man and a 1m83 woman makes her big for her age, but not extremely heavy, she weighs 25 kg's now.
I still regularly use a oversized child carrier. Being 2m04 i can say it's unpleasant to have a 25 kg backpack for extensive excursions, but not impossible. Do remember my backpack moves of it's own accord and wants to see and experience everything like any 5 year old does.  
  
Each time my daughter hurts herself and new tissue grows she gets a few new brown spots generally on the scar tissue or directly adjacent. We dread any other children's diseases, rashes, (sun)burns or other trauma as there is a chance the trauma will multiply the amount of spots. Activity intensifies and worsens each time when new spots appear.  
  
We have noticed the 2,5ml of 0,5mg/ml desloratidine (0,125mg) worked to suppress her reactions at first. However that was compared to never using medication in the first place. Dosages have gone up to  4 to 8 times that amount.  

- 2,5 mg daily at breakfast  
- 2,5mg when training (swimming physiotherapist, cycling trip)  
- 2,5 mg when  I expect strange weather or big temperature changes (normally around 13:00 so at lunch)  
- 2,5 mg for unforeseen. This can be foods, incidents at school or on the playground with scrapes/scratches,  nettles or stings or just a moment of goosebumps or emotion. At the funeral for grandpa (my wife's dad) last year we gave additional medictaion cause she was heartbroken and was all red from crying , then nearly collapsed.
There were problems in delivery of medication. I had medication imported from an other country in the EU to make sure she could be medicated daily.  
  
We also no longer go to our local hospital. We go to the Mastocytosis consultations in the Sophia Children's Hospital now. The Sophia Children's Hospital is part of the Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam and specializes in care for kids under 18 and  it is roughly 80km form our home city. The Mastocytosis consultation are held once monthly, but we go 2-4 times a year now and visits are informative and beneficial to us as the level of knowledge is way higher and due to it's speciallized nature. My daughter is now seen by 5 doctors/professors, an allergist, and rheumatologist, an immunologist, a dermatologist and an internist often a professor who specializes in this field. We still have acces to a pediatrician on a direct line 24/7 via an emergency number at our local hospital. When we have any question, they'll prioritize it and answer it directly and/or phone back asap.  
  
I have been to Sophia recently so my daughter, now 5 yrs old, could get a bone density scan recently to rule out osteoporosis. No info yet.    

She'll get an exercise test soon, probably a stress test as she has had many intervals of extremely low bloodpressure lately. If she collapses it will probably cause problems and additional testing. I expect, when it happens I'll not be there for the 20 minutes of the test, but could be asked to stay for further study. Collaps from low bloodpressure is a very bad way to have an allergy manifest itself, and she often has little basic symptions like a shortness of breath, itches or nausea. We have blackouts, faints, collapse, unconsiousness and shock. 

 Seeing your kid losing consiousness is traumatic when it happens. I have had it happen to me over a half dozen times in 2 years. before we knew the actual extent of her problems we had been walking in the city center, went to sit and drink something, my oldest wanted chocolatemilk, HOT chocolate milk, so my youngest daughter wanted it as well. So far so good. bopthe drank the chocolate milk. It was spring but not very warm 15 C or so, and I had problems with hay fever and asked for a glass of tap water (generally ~2C to coolwash beerglasses) and I took my medication. I put the glass down after a sip, and my girl said I also want water. She drank the glass.. and it knocked her out. She was completely unresponsive, collapsed and remained unconsious for 40+ seconds, we laid her down , head lowest, put her legs up and I was already starting to dial the emergency phone number when she suddenly woke up. 


That was the day we demanded EpiPens. We got our 2 EpiPens 24 hours later  from the hospital apothecary... We will need to exchange them  soon, she's going to adult Epipens cause she's 25kg... It's needed cause of the dangers associated with blood pressure drops.    

It's a moment that scared me and my wife, my other daughter noticed it but as we didn't freak out, she was not traumatized.   
   
I have a daughter with brown spots, and I love her....    

---------
  EDIT: We've been to the exercise test/stress test, I saw my daughter of 5 years old walking on a treadmill, steeper and steeper, faster and faster...  We were waiting to see her fall... Luckily she didn't react, after 10 minutes we stopped the initial test. We (doctor, nurse and myself) extended the test a bit by continuing another 10 minutes. 

While being motivated by her doctor, a nurse and myself, she walked another 10 minutes in forced march... She was completely unaffected, not drops in blood pressure, no other symptoms. 

So this day we traveled 160 km, and she walked proudly and defiantly  in front of me and her doctor for the complete duration, everybody there waiting for the collapse that never happened. I feel so mean feeling it should have happened, the collapse. But we all, the nurse, the doctor, and myself included felt we should quit and try to get evidence from another moment.  
  
I carried her back to the station after we had lunch and drinks at the cafeteria at the hospital. She was exhausted and fell asleep soon after departing the hospital. I noticed myself  thinking she had become so much more by showing she could do this, It showed she has normal physical condition, she recovered normally, no problems with heart or otherwise...  
Then I noticed she's not 3 years old anymore and she's gained quite some weight since I last carried her. We have a custom carrying device resembling a mei-tai carrier which fits her pretty well, my wife made it when my daughter outgrew the previous one. I walked back the 2 miles with a backpack with stuff on the front and a kid on my back, took me 30 minutes or so.

She was still fast asleep when I arrived at the station and it took quite some time to unpack my daughterand get to the platform. Medically it was no succes, but I'm proud and happy. She went to bed early and slept through her alarm this morning, she woke an hour late and  she went to school today, she will assist the teacher today and have the day for herself she will be in the hallway where she can draw or build or create something at leisure. 

A big thank you for the reactions
-----------

We hope she'll be in the group who will lose the spots or their activity when she matures and reaches puberty in the coming dozen years. We really do."
dsgtfr,2,2019-11-06,[F4M] Corporate Cumslut and her Premature Ejaculating Intern. [CFNM] [Cumplay] [Short Term],JustAnotherDPPAccnt,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dsgtfr/f4m_corporate_cumslut_and_her_premature/,"""Yes, of course, I'm glad that you approve of the adjustments we made to the contract. I see amazing things in our future working together -- hm, what's that?"" The confidence in that sultry, feminine voice was only the sort of confidence a woman like [Kennedy Lane](https://i.imgur.com/rKVTnXn.jpg) could present. The 27 year old CEO was one of the most esteemed women in the corporate world, having shot to the top of the ladder in the largest Marketing Firm of today's age. She was a single, childless self made woman who was not just hardworking and career focused, but not afraid to flaunt her beauty.

But there was a side of the woman most didn't know -- including the man on the other end of the phone pressed to her ear. For the most part, it was like a stock photo for corporate America. She sat in that leather chair leaning back on its axis; those long, thigh-high covered legs crossed one over the other; one elbow on her desk and that hand holding the phone to her ear; chair facing the opposite wall, where a huge window offered a view of the city's skyline.

But one thing was out of place.

""Oh, absolutely. I'll send one of my guys over with a hardcopy version for you to sign later this afternoon."" As she spoke into the phone, nothing but professionalism, the man on the other line had no idea that her other hand was occupied. Standing beside her chair, doing his best to remain quiet, was that 19 year old college intern -- stark naked, his cock hard as a diamond and throbbing in Kennedy's grip as she stroked it ideally.

She looked from the window and up to the boy's face when he made a particularly noisy sound, only to see his face scrunching up as he tried to stop the inevitable. Well, he *almost* made it through the entire call this time. ""Mmhm, perfect, Mr. Dawson,"" she offered offhandedly as she began to speed up that pace of her stroking. Within mere seconds, she watched the boy's knees shake as his cock throbbed in her hand. She smirked slightly just before the first shot came; that thick, white rope shooting rather forcefully at the CEO and splattering across her busty chest, soaking into the fabric of that thin top. She continued to stroke him as each following throb of his cock fired another rope of baby batter, each weaker than the last -- some across her chest, the lap of her skirt, the small patch of expossed pantyhose on her thigh.

When the last bit began dribbling from that swollen head and onto her hand, she pulled it away and dropped to her lap. ""No, thank *you*! We'll speak soon! Caio!"" The phone was set back down atop the desktop set and she found herself bringing her hand to her face -- tongue stretching out to slide along the side of her palm and lick up that warm, salty cum. ""Mm...."" AS she closed her mouth to swallow, she looked up to the boy with a smoldering stare. ""Before we go again, would you grab me a glass of wine?"" She offered him a soft smile as her head gestured towards the table across the room, atop which sat a bottle of red wine, a little over half full, and a few glasses in a rack. She unfolded her legs and sat upright, turning the chair into the desk and her attention to her computer for a moment as she waited for him to do as she asked.

_______________________

Silly little one shot juping right into the action. Your character is Kennedy's favorite intern, who ""has a problem"" and cums too fast. Thankfully, that comes with a quick refractory period, and he happens to work for a giant cumslut. Lots of cumplay, obviously. Would love a lot more CFNM but we can definitely strip her down at some point. Detailed writers please. Just jump right in.

**NOTE:** If you'd like to play two, maybe even three, interns, I wouldn't complain!"

dshaub,29,2019-11-06,AITA for kind of hating the new family dog?,Fledster,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dshaub/aita_for_kind_of_hating_the_new_family_dog/,"Let me start by saying I don’t hate dogs, I just don’t want to own one.

So to make a long story short my dad decided that since we had build a house he would get a dog on top of our two cats. 
I told him this was a bad idea because everyone was either working or studying full time. 
He ignored anyone and got one anyway.

Now since I was living out of town because of university I didn’t really care because this wouldn’t be my job and I also made it clear beforehand that I didn’t want a dog because in my opinion they are far more work then cats and I’m not cut out for that. (I’m mostly responsible for the cats because I wanted them.)

To my surprise my mom and my brother managed to constantly watch him by either taking the dog to work or staying at home if his schedule allowed him to.

Well due to some bad circumstances I stopped studying my previous major and moved back home to study something different.
I decided on this study from home model for my new major and got a job to finance everything.

Since I was now staying at home except for Monday and Saturday because those are my work days the dog got dumped on me full time. (My brother can’t watch him because of his internship and my mom only takes him to work on Monday even though she previously was able to take him to work more often.)
I can’t go out or have friends over because he will either misbehave or bark the entire time if some stranger aka my friends are over.
My friends don’t even want to come over because they get scared of him. He is about hip height. I also can’t leave him at home because he will start destroying doors and shoes, been there and boy he’d done it.

I tried to talk with my family to arrange a new schedule for the dog or anything but I was told that this is what family is for and to basically suck it up.

I’m kind of starting to resent the dog for basically holding me hostage at home even though none of this is his fault and my relationship with my parents is also pretty strained right now. 
So AITA for not wanting to put up with the dog anymore or at least only watch after him in a lower capacity?
Edit:
So I feel like I should clarify something. The reason for only working two days in a week is because I literally can’t work more hours. In order for me to not lose my status as a full time student which means that I get to keep most of my pay except for paying my insurance I can only work 20h a week which I currently do. However that is not enough money to move out on my own and pay for everything I need. The cost for my education takes away over half of my paycheck. If I were to take a second job I would no longer classify as a student and would have to pay every single tax that a full time,normal employee pays and my insurance would go up since I no longer qualify as a student. So I wouldn’t get a lot more money if any so that is out of the question. If there was another way I would do it in a heartbeat. My current plan is to finish school and then move out as soon as possible."

But even though things are bad some amazing things have happened the last few days that really made me cry from happiness. For example:

1. I made a go fund me and got my first donation
2. I defended myself and stepped up at work which led to a small promotion
3. I took a chance and applied for a Disney internship and got it
4. I got 100% on a test I thought was going to fail and I will probably pass the class
5. Started dressing like I'm not depressed (putting a ***massive*** effort into my appearance)

All in all compared to last week, these things have really cheered me up these last few days. It feels like I'm slowing winning a battle that's gone on too long."

Really I am! But we already only saw eachother for a day or two on weekends and now he'll be in Germany for 8mos while I'm in the US. 

Is it bad that I'm sad? I mean, I knew he would do something like this and I want him to grow professionally but... 

I never got the chance to study abroad. I have hyper controlling parents that limited my finances and options for what I could do, and I had always wanted to live abroad. He gets to go see the world and I'm stuck here. I know, it's not his fault. The rational part of me would never blame him for that. 

But the irrational part of me is all full of doubt and sadness. I wish I didn't have these feelings. A lot of the time he forgets about me (not maliciously, it's ADHD) and I'm worried that he'll just forget me entirely and meet some beautiful German woman and forget all about me.

Idk. I just found out like ten minutes ago that he got the posistion and I'm really, really sad. Happy for him, but sad too.

Aside from normal intern stuff I slowly started doing more of their social media, writing posts gaining followers mostly on twitter. I got their account from 2k to 4k followers in a few weeks just by using follow for follow methods within the political ideology. I also had a few more popular posts that did very well for their account standards.

The thing is I don't know how this happened. I literally have never used twitter before I got this job and never really used my own social media that much. Now the person I work for is running for a bigger seat and since I doubled their following they have me doing most of their social media growth. 

I guess my question is, im 18, I have a really good opportunity to impact this campaign through social media and help my career, so what else can I do to grow their brand? I'm still very new to this but don't know where to start, blogs I should read, tools I should use? Any advice or direction would be appreciated!"

____________________

Lindsay Arsenal stood close to the bathroom mirror, fixing her lipstick.  Her stomach growled defiantly.  This was not good.  Luckily, she was alone in the small restroom.  Now was her chance to relieve some pressure spurred on by the appetizer she had earlier.  She pushed out a quiet, hissing fart.  It wasn’t everything, but she didn’t want to make too much noise.

Satisfied with her makeup and feeling slightly less bloated, Lindsay left the bathroom.  She walked into the dining room of Giovanni’s Bistro, an upscale italian restaurant.  Low instrumental music hummed along with the busy noises of the kitchen.  She returned to her booth, her food already on the table.  Sitting across the table was Zayn, who put his phone away when he saw her coming back.

“Don’t worry, I waited,” he said, flashing a smile.

“Thanks.  Looks really good,” Lindsay replied.  The food did look delicious, but she wasn’t sure what she’d be able to eat with her stomach acting up the way it was.
	
Zayn lifted his glass of wine in a toast.  Lindsay followed suit.

“To making connections,” he said, before taking a long drink.  Lindsay smiled and drank as well.  She thought Zayn was very cute, and he clearly had good taste.  Giovanni’s was supposedly one of the hidden gems in town, but still had a reputation for quality.

They both started on their food.  Lindsay ate her linguine tentatively, worried about agitating her stomach further.  Her efforts were futile.  About a third of the way into her dish, she felt a building pressure in her gut.  She frowned as her stomach bubbled.

“Are you alright?” Zayn asked, as he finished his wine.  He must have noticed the discomfort on her face.

“Oh, yes. I’m fine.  I just... ate a big piece of garlic.” Lindsay lied.  She hoped she didn’t sound like she was bullshitting too much.  She smiled awkwardly.

“Okay.  Excuse me for a minute.”  

“Of course,” Lindsay replied.  Zayn stood up from the booth and headed towards the bathroom.  Thank god.  As soon as he was a short distance away and looking in the other direction, Lindsay shifted to one side.  Another hissing fart escaped out from under her short dress.  The was quite possibly the most stressful situation she had ever been in.  The smell of her gas hit her nostrils and she frantically waved it away.  Nobody around her seemed to notice.

Lindsay had no idea what was happening to her.  For the past two months, she had been suffering terrible gas problems, coinciding with the start of her Summer internship.  She was a 21 year old Marketing Major.  Originally from Virginia, she was tall, tan, and easy on the eyes.  Well aware of her good looks, Lindsay took pride in her flat stomach, tight abs, curvy hips, big butt and C-cup boobs.  She stuck to her fitness regimen faithfully and watched what she ate for the most part.  She knew she was healthy.  So why did she suddenly have such a gas problem?  Research told her that she might have developed something related to IBS.  Of all times for it to happen, of course Lindsay had to deal with it during her entry into the professional world.

Again, Lindsay lifted up slightly to fart.  This one rushed out of her faster than she expected.  It rippled against the seat of the booth and made a low hum.  She coughed to try and cover it up, embarrassed.

“Sorry about that,” said Zayn, appearing out of nowhere.  Lindsay was horrified, watching as Zayn sat back down, immersed in her fart cloud.  There was nothing she could do.

“No problem,” Lindsay said, as her mind raced with every terrible way the rest of this date could play out.  Zayn seemed to notice nothing as he continued to eat his pasta, cool as ever.  Lindsay, meanwhile, was about to start sweating.  Another fart loaded up, ready to push its way out. She gritted her teeth and held it back.  One more misstep and she was done.  She gulped down her wine, wondering what she could have done to deserve this.

Zayn had asked her out a few days prior.  They worked in the same building on different floors, but they saw each other a few times a day at least, usually taking lunch around the same time.  She couldn’t bear the humiliation of farting her way out of this date and then having to see Zayn every day after embarrassing day until her internship ended.  She thought she already squandered any chance of getting to know Zayn better the day he asked her out.

She was struggling with her gas after lunch last Tuesday.  Despite her efforts to curb the stomach problems, her butt wouldn’t cool down.  After stinking up her car on her way back to the office, Lindsay barely made it to the elevator without letting one rip in the lobby.  The minute the doors closed and the lift started moving, she let it out.  It was a bad one.  It was loud, it smelled terrible and lasted about three seconds.  Then the doors opened and Zayn got in at level two.  Lindsay was mortified.

She suffered as her noxious fumes stung her nose while Zayn made smalltalk completely casually.  He was way too cool considering what he was being forced to breathe in.  Lindsay did her best to act natural, considering what could possibly be going through Zayn’s mind.  When they got to her floor, Lindsay left Zayn alone in the elevator with what remained of her rancid fart.  She considered leaving her job and going home to Florida, just to save herself from the embarrassment of what she had done.

Later that day, when Zayn caught her outside of her office and asked her to join him at Giovanni’s on Saturday, she thought he might just not have a sense of smell.  Of course this wasn’t true, but somehow, first in the elevator, then in the restaurant, he was unfazed by - possibly even unaware of- Lindsay’s farts.

Soon, Lindsay was in Zayn’s car, driving back to her apartment.  Zayn kept going, chatting about the meal.  Lindsay still found it hard to believe he wanted anything to do with her.  Fortunately for her, Zayn drove a 2008 Audi A4 convertible.  Of course he did, what else was he missing, Lindsay had thought when she first saw it.  Now they sped through town with the top down in the blustery evening air.  Lindsay, counting her lucky stars, took the opportunity to relieve more of her gas without worrying about the intrusive smell.  She was careful not to make any noise.  Her farts were hot as they leaked out of her anus in carefully controlled streams.  She could tell they stank even as they were carried away by the wind.  Lindsay almost worried the leather seats might be tainted with the smell forever.  

A short ride later, they were outside Lindsay’s apartment and finally she felt relieved of her gas.  She felt much better than when they left the restaurant, definitely tipsy after more than a few drinks.

“Here you are,” Zayn said.

“Thanks.  I had a great time tonight.  You’re super fun,” she said.  Lindsay just now realized how mellow she sounded.

“You too.  Thanks for... humoring me,” Zayn flashed his smile again.  Lindsay thought he looked like he knew something she didn’t.

Perhaps it was the drinks, but something emboldened Lindsay.  She was determined not to let Zayn slip through her fingers.  She was fun, she was cool, she could show him a good time, even if she did fart a bit at dinner.  With her gaseous episode seemingly passed, she went for it. Batting her eyelashes, she turned back to Zayn.

“Y’know, who says the night has to end now?  Why don’t you come in for another drink?”  She did it.  Zayn looked surprised for a split second, but played it cool.  Of course he couldn’t turn her down.

Soon, Lindsay poured them both more wine while Zayn waited on the balcony.  She joined him and they clinked their glasses together.  Both of them drank deeply.  Lindsay lowered her wine glass and looked Zayn in the eyes.  He did the same.  They kissed.

Zayn pulled Lindsay closer as they continued to kiss passionately.  Lindsay thought to herself, “Damn I’m good.”  She pulled away from Zayn, smiling, and sipped some more of her wine.  Zayn moved closer again, ready to get back into it, but Lindsay stopped him.  She took his hand and led him inside, seating him on the couch.

“I’m going to change into something more comfortable.”

“Works for me,” Zayn said.

Lindsay moved to the kitchen and refilled their glasses.  Then she went to her bedroom.  Slipping out of her dress, she stopped in front of her full-length mirror.  There she stood, tan skin, toned body, tight waist, ample breasts, and rocking butt, showcased in her smallest black thong.  She was going to blow Zayn away.  Before she could head back out, ready to knock her date dead, she felt a pang.  A bubble of gas was ready to get out.  Lindsay rolled her eyes in frustration and pushed the fart out.  It was small, just a quick pop.  She thought that would be the last of it.

Lindsay left her bedroom, walking slowly into Zayn’s field of view.  His jaw dropped at the beauty that was tall, tan, beautiful Lindsay strutting out, almost completely naked.  She was unstoppable at this moment.  She closed in on Zayn, who was still speechless, and started unbuttoning his shirt and kissing him softly on the lips.  Zayn let one hand cup her cheek while the other came to rest on her lower back.

Before Lindsay could really begin, her fears were realized.  Horrible, terrible gas stirred within her gut.  She forbade her body from doing this to her now.  For a nanosecond she hesitated, but pressed on, determined.  She was opening Zayn’s shirt, moving to his pants.  She fought off a wince and held back the gas.  It was risky, but she needed to take control here.  She bit Zayn’s lip and climbed onto the couch, straddling him as she unfastened his belt.  The pressure built up, ready to escape.  Lindsay started to feel pain, but she kept holding.  As she pulled apart his button fly and prepared to reach into his waistband, Zayn pulled back. 

Instant worry gripped Lindsay.  “No!” she thought.  She had gotten this far.  At this point, what could possibly cause him to stop?   As these thoughts rushed through her head, she locked eyes with Zayn, a wry smile forming on his face.  He looked her in the eyes and said coyly, “let it out.”"

I have read through some of the other threads on how to get a job in the industry threads and got some great ideas, but wanted to post one to get some more information.

I graduated in May 2019 with an emphasis in Finance and Accounting and recently moved to NYC for a Finance related job. I was planning on going into Financial advising and in order to do that it requires you pass 3 licensing exams over a certain time frame. Long story short after studying for a couple of hundred hours for these exams I passed the first two but fail the last one and unfortunately lost my job, which was extremely crushing. I Moved cross country knowing no one and losing my job after putting so much work in was a hard pill to swallow.

I choose to look at the positives of the situations and am more determined than ever to be successful. While at my previous job I would constantly think about wanting to be in the music industry. I was planning on working at the company I was at for a few years to get some experience and then try to pivot to the music industry.

Given my current situation, I figured now is as good as a time as any to follow my passion. Music is one of the central parts of my everyday life and I would love to be able to work with it in any capacity.

The main reason for the post is I planned for so long to be in Wealth Management and all my internship/work experience is in the realm. Can that work experience still be applicable to the music industry? Ideally, I would love to go into the business side of the industry which I know is extremely broad, but I just want to get my foot into the door. I have one friend back home who is now in the industry, but I watched him for many years work extremely hard and just finally got a full-time position that's paid (he went to college majoring in music industry).

\- What can I do to stand out in applications (especially with no background in the music industry)

\- Is it likely I will need to do unpaid internships initially? If so what do you recommend doing on the side to pay the bills?

\- Are there any companies that have rotational programs for business majors

\- Anything  I can do in the interim while applying to make myself a better candidate

\- Any companies that aren't the big ones such as AEG, Live Nation, Universal, Sony, etc that I should look at

\- Any advice in general to a recent college grad

I know I want to be in the music industry, music has meant so much to me and I will do whatever it takes to be successful.  I appreciate anyone taking the time to give some advice!"

Currently, I use Clio, and that has been okay when i bring on interns or seasonal clerks, but business is growing and and I want to start to streamline the work. 

In an ideal world, I want to have some sort of storage/server for documents so I can add/remove viewing/editing privileges for people I on-board, as well as create backups of the files (ideally backups of every version of file). Additionally, if I had some sort of software to do client intake, wherein they fill out a form and it populates an excel spreadsheet which is then used to automatically generate some documents would be great too. 

Does anyone use services like this? Anyone else out there with small-med shops using tools like this? I've been researching around and there are some services out there, but nothing quite like what I want/need. Is it worth finding developers and paying them to make this for me?"

dskq2u,2,2019-11-06,WIBTA if I don't pitch in for my parents' gift from the siblings?,cole_red,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dskq2u/wibta_if_i_dont_pitch_in_for_my_parents_gift_from/,"Background:

I (21M) am the youngest of 5 children (31F, 28M, 27F, 25F). I've always had a good family life. Once we grew older, my siblings started leaving home for college, and then work. I began my freshman year of high school as my last sibling moved off to college.

My siblings moved all over the country. We are very spread out across the US, which makes the holidays even more special since we're all together.

The last bit of information you need to know is that last July, I was offered an internship at a naval architecture firm. At this internship, I make a lot of money, for a college student at least. I actually have a savings account with money in it, and I was able to move out of the college dorms and rent a house with a few friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the WIBTA:

Christmas is coming up and every year all of my siblings pitch in for a gift for my parents ranging around the $300 mark. In the past, I've always been a broke high school/college kid with no money, so they have split the cost between the four of them, and let me put my name on the card.

This morning, I woke up to a text from my oldest sister asking if anyone had ideas as to what to get my parents this year. They've been discussing what to buy but I haven't responded yet.

Since I now have a steady source of actual income, and my siblings are aware of this, I am under the impression that they expect me to pitch in. The reason I'm hesitant is because, this is the first Christmas where I could actually afford to buy my parents something, and I would like to buy them my own gift, separate from the rest of my brothers and sisters.

I just want to buy my own gift this year to show my parents I really care about them since I've always been unable to afford a gift for them in the past.

Now you may be thinking that this is no big deal, but I'm worried because last year, my 27 year old sister bought them her own gift because there wasn't much planning or discussion up until the final days before the holiday. When my parents opened up a gift from my sister and from my sister only, my other siblings were furious with her and felt embarrassed since they only got them the one gift that they all split.

I don't want to upset my siblings and start tension over the holiday, but I also want to get my own gift for my parents to make up for all the years prior? WIBTA if I responded to the group message with something along the lines of, ""Hi guys, this year I'm going to buy them my own gift since it's the first time I can afford to do so. I'll make sure not to buy the same thing you guys decide on, and I'll gladly pitch in next year. Can't wait to see everyone at home!""

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I have never been able to afford a Christmas gift for my parents so my siblings cover my share of the sibling gift. This year I can afford one so I want to buy my own to make up for years past, but that could cause tension among my siblings during the holiday as it has before in the past."
dskt81,12,2019-11-06,My rehab experience with gaming,WompoTheBampo,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/dskt81/my_rehab_experience_with_gaming/,"       Hello! I'd like to start off saying that I am a recovering gaming addict practicing moderaton in my sobriety. I am five months sober and have never felt better in my life. I would also like to say that without the love and support that I have gained from both my friends before I went into rehab, and the friends I have gained in rehab, I wouldn't be where I am now. With that said, I'd like to share my experience from two rehab facilities, one by the name of Claudia Black Center for Young Adults at the Meadows (CBC), and the other by the name of reStart Life LLC (Restart).

     I'll begin with my experience from CBC. Honestly I have too many good things to say, while my experience there was rough, and at times I felt like the phasing system they implement was unfair, I realize now that most, if not all of it was my doing. I entered into CBC playing video games over 14 hours a day. My hygiene was non-existant and to state the worst of it I had a mountain of water bottles under my desk, all of them filled with urine, as I felt gaming was more important that even going to the bathroom. My mental state was horrible as well, I had been suffering from an undiagnosed depression and anxiety that was eating away at my life, and I had considered committing suicide multiple times, even went so far as to write multiple suicide notes. All of this, including my addiction, was the product of heavy childhood trauma I received when I was younger, totaling up in a loss of self worth, walls for boundaries, rage issues, and emotional numbness to any situation I was in. My first week in my month and a half stay at CBC was amazing. Dakota, the male dorms on the campus, felt like home because of the hospitality and welcoming nature of the other patients who stayed there, unfortunately I can't name them, but know they're good people, and I will forever be grateful to them. The schedule took some getting useful and some staff were more rigid than others, but all in all it was nice, during my first week I cried for the first time in years. The second week was where I got into the swing of things, we had new admits and everything was going very well. During the second week was also my ""Timeline"" presentation, this is where I basically gave my life story in preparation for Survivor's Week. The third week is when things really kicked off, I sifted through all of the trauma I had received as a child and did many different types of intense therapy. It was draining and after the sessions were done for the day, all I could manage to do was sleep, fortunately my friends, and the facility itself were very supportive in giving me the space I needed. The fourth week was preparation for Family Week, in which I took what I learned from Survivor's Week and put it into practice with my mother, who was my abuser as a child. This was harrowing but all in all good for me, as she and I worked on a lot of things and set up my aftercare plan, which, at the time I was not happy about, and looking back on now, see as a mistake. The last two weeks went by uneventfully and I gave a very somber goodbye to my friends in CBC, not forever, but for a while.

     The next day I was in reStart. And I will not be going through a week by week run through here as I spent about two and a half months there. However I will begin with reStart is a dedicated gaming rehab facility, and while it works, it only works if you fit their mold. I will continue on to say that the only good staff there, were the on-site supervisor for Heaven'sfield, the day and night staff at the same campus, my therapist, and the interns. Firstly. The clinical director of reStart Life: Hillary Cash is a joke. She pressures patients who aren't ready to admit they're addicts to admit that they are, not in a friendly and encouraging way, but in a bullying manner, the program itself is not flexible and provides hardly any education of the disease the patients are there to learn how to cope with. The only help and flexibility I was able to receive was from my absolutely amazing therapist. The company abuses, over works and under pays their interns although they charge $30,000 for Phase 1 treatment, and, while I can't recall the amount for the Phase 2 treatment which they call ""Open World"" because I didn't participate in it, it quickly accumulates over the *9 month* stay that they recommend to much more that $30,000. Stories from other patients there have informed me that they lie to parents and addicts during interventions to get them to enroll. I was involved with two other people there who heavily disliked another patient there who had a mental disorder. Mind you we did not hate him *because* of his disorder, but because he was disrespectful, snide, and mean whenever staff wasn't looking. We tried talking asking, going to staff, *everything* before we got fed up and stopped tolerating him. This quickly blew up overy the course of two or so weeks, and me and the other two patients were given the worst ultimatum to ever give to a recovering addict: ""Behave or we will send you to a homeless shelter until you convince us to let you back in."" The worst part? The only reason I knew this was because I got a call warning me that they were planning on kicking me out *without warning* unless I apologized to everybody I had even slightly wronged, and admitted I was an addict, which I was not ready to do at the time. Needless to say, I played their game and begrudgingly held my tongue during the rest of my arduous stay there. Please do not misunderstand, the facility is good if you fit what they're looking for, if you have the money and the support, and think that it'd be a good place for you to recover, *get the help you need.* This is simply my experience with both programs.

     Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have and I will try to respond to the best of my ability. Furthermore I apologize for any oddities in the post, as after finding this subreddit, I quickly made an account to share my experience and this is my first post.

    

TL;DR - CBC was a lot of fun and the program is world class, reStart has issues but can help those who fit the program."

My dad lives in the US and I'm a citizen so I came here for University. There wasn't a single university that would take me because of my low GPA.

Went to a local community college, got my GPA up to a 4.0, got a 33 on the ACT and got accepted into CS at UIUC as a transfer (I cried when I got the acceptance letter). Struggled through my courses while working on my startup. Couldn't find an internship during my junior year which was a big blow to my confidence.

This September I worked on my resume and went to every company at the career fair (2 days, 100+ companies). Applied on Handshake, Jumpstart and Linkedin (120 applications -&gt; 12 screens -&gt; 3 on-site / 2 phone -&gt; 3 offers).

I just accepted one of those offers from a top consulting company with a 90k salary + 10k signing in Chicago. I have 5k of student loans and couldn't be more excited. Its the most rewarding feeling I've ever felt knowing that all of this hard work will finally pay off. I couldn't be more excited to start working, I know it's not FAANG and it is consulting. But I'm really happy with what I got. 

Don't give up! If I can do it, so can you!

The camera cuts off at her face, but I don’t come to these to stare at eyes. I take my cock out to start jerking off when I notice that one of the posters on the wall looks really familiar. I look closer and notice the bed frame looks familiar too. I get out of my bed and walk down the hall. I go to my sisters room and place my ear to the door. Sure enough I can hear strained moans through the door. I slowly push the door open to watch.

And one extra that’s unrelated:

Competitive Threesomes: Two people competing for the attention and praise of another to see who is more worthy. I’d love to play one out, either with two girls competing for my attention or me and a girl competing for yours. I had some ideas in mind for scenes, maybe I two princesses are competing for the princes hand in marriage, two interns trying to get the next job, two college students after the same recommendation letter, but I’m open to other ideas. If this sounds interesting to you I’d love to work something out with someone!"

I'm seeking to recreate some of those crude, obscene moments in roleplay with you wonderful, sleazy, perverse men. Whether it's Tinder, sliding into my DM's on Insta even though I'm not looking, retweeting my bikini pictures on Twitter or god knows what, I'm looking for fun scenarios based on how social media ends up with me getting my pretty little bald cunt jammed full of heavy cockmeat.

Maybe one of us matches with you across the room at a party, maybe [**I'm**](https://external-preview.redd.it/lsRgFdepwRHzn8DHGY0Mr2KYQAv0qRpC9pf24hcw4ps.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a4ecb49c66058c72bd791043d595cf363f8e2937) the little fittie who comes through your regular coffee shop every morning with my yoga pants **buried in the crack of my taut young backside**, and you can't help but notice the fact my thong is always neon bright.

Maybe you convinced [**me**](https://i.redd.it/rgn5padvflj31.jpg) to give you a handjob at Halloween in that **totally quiet corner of a party, babe** while I was hopped up on Molly, and you just happened to match with me on Tinder, but can't remember anything about me. Except that smeared into that blood stain on my pretty little Halloween outfit is a pinkish tint of your cum, as you took that photograph after I **swallowed your load.**

Maybe I'm your brother's little girlfriend, and you can see me online when I'm meant to be sick as opposed to seeing him at college. Maybe [I'm](https://i.redd.it/01zio494rtm31.jpg)your **son's ex** who you can't help but imagine throat-fucking while you lay in bed next to your bloated wife, your mammoth cock leaking precum all over the phone screen at my photograph, mentally pondering how you're planning to **nut in my underwear** that I left at your son's and I'm coming to collect tomorrow.

Maybe I'm your new, coquettish young intern, straight out of college, and the moment you see me in my little leather skirt (as opposed to the drab ones I wear to the office), you book me onto your next business trip. With a selection of little outfits for me to be more **professional** in while I'm on my knees. You'll work out how you get me there later.

Maybe **I'm** your sister who you took along to your festival with your buddies, and you can see the light on in my tent as I **hunt some cock on Tinder** after I left you with a raging boner all day. Maybe [I'm](https://i.redd.it/kd3cz1lgexr31.jpg) that dweeb at school's girlfriend that you have no idea how he got such a catch, and you just want to **stretch my tight little nerd arsehole** over your heavy jock-cock.

Maybe I'm your wife's younger sister on a family vacation, **who keeps forgetting to put panties on**. And posts \*so\* many photos of her round, thick backside that you can't resist saying something crude. Maybe I'm your wife's mother, **posting nudes around my husband's back on a private Instagram**, but you recognise my porch in the background.

***Kinks:*** **Detailed responses,** age differences, **all things anal** (I'm a little buttslut), **interracial (BBC &lt;3),** outfit play (dress up, **please send prompts**), oral (particularly with **heavy, huge cocks**), messy facials and cumplay, **dirty talk**, titfucking, **crude scenarios and creativity**, CHEATING, **sleazy men**

Try your luck - sketch out a scenario and a girl, and let me know how you try to get into their pants. Some of them are sluttier and easier, some of them are harder to get. Some of them are secretly on Tinder, some of them will be shocked when you try send a Dick Pic. If you fail once, try again. The more detail the better.  There's a version of this post with way more links on my profile, too.

Happy to create together, but if you want the best response please hit me up with a detailed idea for a scene you would like to take forward! I'm quite picky and spelling/grammar, but please take the time to give me a little detail, tell me about your favourite kinks (and what you like), and give me something to go from and respond to!

dsm20t,51,2019-11-06,Opinion: Why Canadians View Chinese Influence and Immigration in Canada with Distrust.,Crauj,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dsm20t/opinion_why_canadians_view_chinese_influence_and/," I posted this previously as a comment on the post about how only 1/3 Canadian view China favourably. I thought it was worth describing part of the reasoning behind the chilling of the two nations from the Canadian perspective.

The opinions expressed here outline trends, rather than indicate the actions of all people who immigrate from China to Canada for a better life. The critique is intended to offer information on legitimate sources of domestic concern about foreign influence on Canadian life, not meant to attract wholesale attacks on Chinese people, or their culture, please don't bring that here. 

For many Canadians we feel that the Chinese (and specifically the most wealthy demographic on certain issues), but mostly the mainland Chinese offer a lot less in return for what is given to them.

The issues are complex but may be summed up however incompletely here:

\-**Massive, large scale, damaging money laundering** [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/money-laundering-public-inquiry-decision-1.5136952](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/money-laundering-public-inquiry-decision-1.5136952) that some academics have dubbed the **Vancouver model** as a textbook example of **transnational financial crime** [https://themobmuseum.org/blog/chinese-triads-launder-billions-through-vancouver-buying-luxury-real-estate-cars/](https://themobmuseum.org/blog/chinese-triads-launder-billions-through-vancouver-buying-luxury-real-estate-cars/) **,** the **sale of fentanyl** (which has personally taken the life of one of my friends), **front businesses** and **shadow banking**. This has prompted a public inquiry into money laundering by the provincial government who is aware this is destroying the financial future of its own citizens and undermining our democracy. **Greater Vancouver, and much of BC will die and become a hollow resort destination for the rich if nothing is done to address this is a timely manner.**

\-**Astronaut families** who use their wealth to buy up huge amounts of properties which drives the prices up, but also has other effects like **condo pre-sales where the Canadian public gets access AFTER the Chinese market**, loads of **empty houses which are used for investment purposes only**, their **rampant tax evasion** and general unwillingness to work in the Canadian workforce because **even though they own homes here, they do not work in Canada and instead derive their income primarily from China**. So their wives and children **live here in multi-million dollar homes declaring poverty income on taxes.**

\-**Incredible tribalism** on the part of the mainlanders, though this is also expressed to a lesser degree among less recent Cantonese speaking HKers or those from Taiwan. Chinese will buy up entire cities, like **Richmond** and **Vancouver**, and begin to transform it into something all but **unrecognizable as a Canadian city to the average Canadian**. Chinese signage only is a common sight there. This **failure to integrate**, learn English and operate within Canadian society as employees speaks volumes of the **unwillingness on the part of mainlanders to assimilate**. Instead, setting up separate **parallel societies**, with Chinese-only taxi services, and other various **ethnic economies** which serve, employ and benefit only the Chinese ethnicity at the expense of our culture, often our laws and way of life here. I believe this comes from the attitude that **Chinese who move to other countries, never become their host country's citizen, but forever remain Chinese**, culturally, racially and politically. They are simply Chinese living in Canada, never Canadian.

Additionally on the same point, **feelings of ethnic tribalism seeps into politics** where many Chinese would never consider voting for a local government candidate who is not Chinese, as they think only a Chinese person can represent Chinese people, again reiterating their commitment to never being Canadian, but occupying space and resources here. Not to mention the unfortunate scandal where **a liberal candidate suggested she was a superior candidate to her opposition Jaghmeet Singh due to her race in Burnaby:** [https://globalnews.ca/news/4853439/karen-wang-liberal-burnaby-south-candidate-wechat-message-controversy/](https://globalnews.ca/news/4853439/karen-wang-liberal-burnaby-south-candidate-wechat-message-controversy/) . From a large-scale point of view this is an attitude which will **deeply undermine our sovereignty** and democracy if left to grow unchecked.

**Their loyalty to the CCP is deeply concerning**, and concerns of spying in our universities, businesses and government are a large and growing concern as a result of this loyalty. Several institutions are reviewing the status of clubs and groups on campus following an incident at McMaster university where ""a speech by an activist critical of the Chinese government's treatment of Uighur Muslims was disrupted at McMaster in February. The activist, Rukiye Turdush, is herself a Uighur and previously told CBC News that students who filmed and shouted during her talk **did so under the direction of the Chinese government**"" ( [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/mcmaster-china-student-association-ban-1.5298882](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/mcmaster-china-student-association-ban-1.5298882) ).

This kind of political attitude is also reflected in the brash and aggressive counter-protests against pro-democracy Hong Kong related groups in Canada, but these are better described as **aggressive mobs who serve to encircle and intimidate the protests via their larger numbers**, shouting down and blocking their signs so no one can see them. Mainlanders also tear down Lennon walls here, and get verbally aggressive with other Chinese who disagree with them politically, best exemplified where a group of rich mainlanders harassed HKers and tore down this wall, clearly wearing expensive clothing and acting like thugs (a highly stereotyped example of the Fuerdai in Vancouver) [https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/pro-china-folks-clash-with-hong-kong-supporters-in-richmond](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/pro-china-folks-clash-with-hong-kong-supporters-in-richmond) . **It is extremely hard for the Canadian people to accept Chinese who are loyal to a regime which is objectively and materially fascist**, interns Muslims in concentration camps, is a dystopian Orwellian surveillance state, arbitrarily detains Canadians as political bargaining chips, ignores international laws and bilateral agreements between countries, engages in large scale IP theft, and indoctrinates its citizens from birth to be servants of the state until their death.

**The cultural attitudes of mainland immigrants** can be generally speaking distasteful. Like any developed country we have our share of brash, rude and condescending rich people who act poorly. However, we have never in our short time as a nation seen such a scale, and severity of ugliness as we have the Fuerdai, and their parents. Driving showy luxury vehicles with the CCP flag emblazoned on the hood. Relating to a previous point, mainlanders can go decades without ever learning English, and refuse to employ or do business with Canadians if they can help it, due to their 'family first' attitude at an ethnic level. Because of this, the Chinese feel less like other immigrants, and more like a foreign occupation. The CCP is representative of a deeply damaging political regime in China and those who support it should be criticized in countries like Canada who prize freedom.

Canadians to their credit seek to be seen as an accepting and open society. This is generally speaking positive and should continue. However, accusations of intolerance should not be brought down in such a widely cast net. Widespread social upheaval and distrust surrounding this issue is beginning to bubble and should be spoken about openly, or else we risk the conversation being dominated by xenophobic groups as more tolerant sections of society refuse to touch the issue."
dsm4ok,0,2019-11-06,Ex and I want to stay friends but I still have feelings?,netdawg8,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dsm4ok/ex_and_i_want_to_stay_friends_but_i_still_have/,"What do I do about my ex?

Were both 21, dated for 3 years, first time being in love for both of us. We were both each other’s best friends and texted all day every single day about literally everything for the entirety of our relationship. I took her for granted and treated her poorly for the first 2 years of our relationship, she finally realized that she didn’t deserve that and we took a one month break. I realized during that time how much I love her, changed my ways, and we got back together about 8 months ago. I treated her like royalty and when things were good they were the best it’s ever been in all 3 years, but 2 or 3 times after we got back together she would randomly get distant and kind of check out of the relationship. I would press her about what’s wrong and about 2 weeks later she would tell me she wasn’t sure if she had feelings for me anymore. This happened at the end of the summer in July, we talked for 6 hours about how she loves me but didn’t really have feelings for me anymore, and then she went out with her friends. She got drunk and that same night called me to come over saying she still loves me and wants to stay together almost as if nothing had happened. For the next 3 months our relationship was happier than ever before. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. She got some bad news about her brother, had a ton of school work, 2 jobs, and stressed about me leaving for my 2 month internship in a  couple months and her having to get a job within the next 6 months (were both seniors in college) she randomly got distant again. I should mention she struggles greatly with anxiety and tends to have emotional breakdowns when she has a lot going on. She had to go on antidepressants a couple years ago after one of her best friends transferred colleges. Anyways she started acting very weird over text barely talking to me and showing no affection even though when we hung out and talked on the phone she acted completely normal and affectionate. I pestered her about it and after a couple weeks she called me and said she was unsure about our future and questioning our relationship but that I was doing nothing wrong. I kept telling her she needed to communicate better and put in more effort and handle her anxiety better, and she told me she doesn’t know why she shuts me out and no one else when she gets stressed since i’m her biggest emotional support. I stupidly kept bringing up her feelings every 2 days and she kept telling me she was stressed and unsure. A week ago I was texting her and she was acting distant so I pestered her again about her feelings and she finally got mad and said she just thinks our relationship has run its course and she doesn’t have motivation to fix our communication problems and we broke up on the phone. I told her we could talk in person later about it since I was home for halloween and didn’t contact her for 3 days. Last night we finally met up and had an amazing talk about everything and I told her I’m worried about her anxiety but that neither of us were really happy since I got very stressed and unhappy every time she got distant. She said i’m still her best friend and I agreed and she said she’s hoping it’s not a mistake but she thinks this is best for us. I walked her to her car and told her I’ll always care about her and be there for her and she started crying and hugging me for 15 mins saying she loves me so much. She went out with her friends last night and texted me “I’m kinda drunk but you looked cute tonight sorry if that’s weird”. I’ve been texting her today and asked her about that text and she said she’s still allowed to think i’m cute. I definitely want to stay friends because I care about her so much but I realize our relationship was not healthy which is why i’ve been trying not to want her back but I can’t help it. I still have very strong feelings for her so it’s been tough, but I’ve been trying to not text her as much. I don’t want to ignore her because I still really care about her and don’t want my best friend out of my life. I’ve been keeping the mood light and happy and a little flirty to try to show her that we’re still more than just friends. She told me she would tell her mom about her anxiety issues which I think was the major issue in our relationship. How should I approach this? I know we can’t get back together for a decent bit since it’ll just be the same as it was before but ideally I want her back.

TL;DR!  Girlfriend broke up with me but we both are still best friends and have been talking. She called me cute last night while she was drunk after talking in person and I still have feelings for her and know ignoring her would be bad for both of us. What should I do?"
dsmeco,3,2019-11-06,21[F4A] Freshman 15,mburke2323,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dsmeco/21f4a_freshman_15/,"
In high school, I was one of the slim, fit, popular girls. My friend group consisted of the elite, cheerleaders, football players, soon to be fraternity and sorority members, you get the picture. We were so judgmental, we would bully those who we felt were inferior. I could get any guy I wanted and even any girl if that’s what I was looking for.

My body was picture perfect, slim and petite. My small tits were perky and firm. My stomach and waist were thin. My ass was a round, perky bubble butt. My face was like a goddess. My thighs were toned and had a considerable gap. My arms were thin with a slight hint of muscle.

However, college hasn’t been so good to me. I attend an elite university in one of their most difficult programs. Add to that I work a part-time job to help pay with my tuition. Add to that an internship and you can imagine the time constraints and the stress I have.
So, what did I do? I began to stress eat and choose the more convenient food options. Breakfast was at Dunkin Donuts every morning. A large iced-coffee with extra cream and sugar, a bagel with cream cheese, and a donut (maybe two). I usually skip lunch, but if I do eat its usually at a fast food restaurant. For dinner, I usually stop for take-out, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, you name it.  And of course, I snacked all the time.

The effects of my poor eating habits and lack of exercise quickly added up. My belly ballooned out falling over the waist band of all of pants and my panties. It’s a clear muffin top. My hips extended far out complimented by my pasty white thighs squeezed together, full thunder thighs. My back has back rolls and love handles. My face is a round moon face, complete with a double chin. I have officially become a chubby girl.

Some scenarios:

Greek life hazing. I’d like to be part of the rush process. Subjected to the harsh humiliation of the sorority and fraternity members.



A dystopian world where fat girls like me are subjected to weigh ins, imprisonment, and humiliation for our weight. .

Should I confront him?Me(22F) Him(23),theKayaKaya,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dsmh8z/what_is_our_relationship_should_i_confront/,"Long time ago we can pass that we had feelings for each other. But he didn't really want to start a relationship relationship until he was done with college.

Feels like we have been getting closer as friends and that really makes me happy. He is on his last year of college and he an internship in another state.

I really do like him but an insecure part of me feels like he will find someone else during his internship.
To do. I know he cares about me but I don't know if it's just a friendship level or a romantic level of caring.

I want to confess my feelings for him before he leaves for his internship but seriously afraid of getting my feeling stumped on.

I thought about getting him a gift to remind him of mebut a part of me feels like that would be a little too much. IDK what I should do.

Should I just hold on to my confession until after he gets back from his internship?? Should I just wait to tell him after graduation??

He's a really sweet and smart guy and it would kill me if our friendship became awkward because he doesn't feel that way about me anymore..."

Ideally looking for someone to play a dominant female but could be persuaded if you want to play a submissive female. I’m also open to dom males but the role would have to be something I really like. If you have ideas in mind then feel free to suggest them but I’ll list a few below I enjoy:

Celebrity roleplay- variety of options here but would ideally be you playing the domme celeb. My personal favourite is to play your personal assistant but again I’m open.

Someone I know- again a few options but the premise is you play someone from my personal life and we have an encounter and build from there.

WWE roleplay- you play one or several of the women from the WWE and I, a new intern am inexperienced and easy to boss around.

Superhero/villain- mainly into the girls from batman but happy for marvel characters to. The idea is either you save me and I owe you or you capture me and have your way with me.

Teacher/student- basic but you play the teacher and I play the student 

MHA- you play one of the girls from my hero academia, open minded with ideas for this

If you have your own suggestions please feel free to pitch them but if you like one of mine then let me know.

Message me your asl and what your interested in, bonus for anyone that will play more than one character."
dsor8a,8,2019-11-06,"""There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.""",DX1118-A,DebateAVegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAVegan/comments/dsor8a/there_is_no_ethical_consumption_under_capitalism/,"I'd like to preface this by acknowledging that, yes, this is a new account. I don't really do the whole ""participate on social media"" thing when it's easier to just read posts and comments to gain some degree of insight, plus I'd rather only involve myself in a discussion if I feel like I can contribute something more than a reference to a meme.

That being said, this was something I wanted to get some insight on, because it's not likely to come up much in a front page discussion, let alone the first five pages.

--------------------------------------------------

As the title says, there's a commonly quoted line of ""There is no ethical consumption under captialism."" The meaning, as I have come to understand it, is that under a capitalism system, there will inevitably be some degree of exploitation somewhere down the line of production and manufature of any goods or services in order to succeed under that capitalist system (For example, underpaid foreign (child, migrant, etc) labor for the manufacture of electronic goods or clothing, the increasingly-reported-upon ""crunch"" culture of the video games industry, unpaid overtime in a corporate setting, unpaid internships requiring college degrees, etc).

The reasons vary from saving costs, increasing profit margins or even putting in the work to start up/get a foot in the door, but the end result of exploitation remains the same.

Now, recognizing that base-level veganism seeks to reduce exploitation/suffering, not neccessarily end it, this raises a few questions:

- Does this mean support of a capitalist structure is, to a degree, non-vegan?

- Is all exploitation deemed equally bad (or, does all exploitation cause suffering)? If so, based on what reasoning? Why is the exploitation of a dog, pig or other non-human animal equal when compared to the exploitation of human children?

- If all exploitation is not equal in terms of ""badness"" (or causes suffering), what degree of human exploitation/suffering is considered ""reasonable""? Following this, what degree of non-human exploitation/suffering is ""reasonable""? Based on what reasoning?

- If there is no ethical consumption under capitalism, but there can be sustainable consumption, does this mean a sustainable capitalist model is considered more ethical than a non-sustainable one? Even if animals are still farmed for food and other products?

-----------------------------------------------------

The next topic I wanted to address links back somewhat to the first, namely sustainable consumption.

We are a growing population. Assuming for a moment that there really is no ethical consumption under capitalism, I feel it's also reasonable to claim that (given our current planet-locked situation and technology) there is less sustainable consumption under a growing population. As a result, there is also no ethical consumption under a growing population either.

More people equals more mouths to feed, requiring either concessions to be made, corners to be cut, etc. This is either in terms of exploiation, environmentally damaging practices and so on. It could be argued that any consumption that continues to march towards environmental collapse, resulting in the extinction of numerous species, is not only unsustainable by definition, but also unethical.

Base-level veganism does not address this issue, but at best (assuming the claims of environmental benefits are correct) only delays the problem. At best, veganism could be considered less unstainable than other diets/lifestyles. A steadily growing population continues to require more land for food, requires more water, shelter, resources, etc. Not to mention that a vegan diet is not inherently a waste-free diet. Plastic wrapped veggie burgers are still as bad for the environment as plastic wrapped beef burgers, but they're still vegan. It's not unreasonable to claim that no one will tell you that you aren't vegan if they see you littering.

So if a vegan diet/lifestyle remains unsustainable, continuing to march towards environmental collapse, is it still ""more ethical"" than meat consumption? If an animal is free of exploitation yet still dies from choking on plastic, dies from pollution, more land being cleared for food/housing, worsening droughts resulting from climate collapse, etc, is it really a more ""ethically sound/consistent"" existence?"

**1)** Working at a Fortune 500 company that is leading in the industry with lots of growth opportunities, almost infinite options of relocation and an almost certain job offer after then internship. I would be initially taking a slightly lower salary than average and will start in the lowest management position that would limit the scope to my job a lot.

**2)** Working at a smaller company that is leading in a very niche market with fewer options for relocating, and not guaranteed offer after the internship. However, the internship would be for a longer period, in a position that I would have to wait some time at the first company to attain, as well as start at a higher salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I am conflicted because both positions have pros and cons. I am wondering if for future positions will be better to have a big name in the resume as opposed to have a more prominent position."

My goal is to work in digital marketing, such as an associate, coordinator or even specialist and hopefully grow to a Digital Marketing Manager!

I graduated college with a degree in Marketing and mostly gained experience in social media marketing. 

I managed to get an internship in Marketing within a company that involves SEO strategy, Analytics, Social Media, Methodology, Media content development and Market Research. 

However, still struggling to land a job I decided to get a 2nd internship (more like an apprenticeship) at an agency as a “Hacker Growth” and will work on different clients, marketing projects, and will be well-trained over time. 

I thought it would be interesting, but really don’t know what to expect. I’ve had someone telling me not to continue that internship if I only want to pursue Digital Marketing, as it’s two different things. 

What do you guys think? What career path would I be able to go after that internship? Would I be able to achieve my goal? 

Thanks!"
dsrjv6,2,2019-11-06,Should I bother with the UCs? UPDATED INFO,BorgerKingLettuce,CollegeTransfer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/dsrjv6/should_i_bother_with_the_ucs_updated_info/,"Hey guys, so in my last post on here you suggested I try and transfer to Berkeley and UCLA even though I'm an out of state student at a 4 year public university.

However, the more I think about it the more worried I become. Here is more info:

My current GPA is 3.73. It will go up by the end of the semester (as I have As in all my classes and I'm not worried about them) but since the application is due November 30th, they won't see my updated transcript/GPA.

I only have 2 extracurriculars. I'm in a women's math org and a women's CS org. Unfortunately we don't really do much notable, we just meet and talk about internships and help each other with homework and occasionally go to seminars with guest lecturers. 

My letters of recommendation aren't from great sources. I'm getting one from my TA (grad student) because my class is of 400 people so the professor doesn't really know anyone, and the other is from a new professor who doesn't do research for the university, just teaches.

My SAT is incredibly low and I'm gonna retake it, but the scores will come out after the application is due (sometime in December).

I doubt they'll waive my application fee, since they asked for my parents' income to determine if the fee can be waived (and they make decent money).

What do you guys think? I'm not going to give up on transferring but I don't know if it worth spending $140 dollars on the UCs when it looks like I'll be given a definite no twice."

Pumpkin's Progress

Chapter I
Oh What a Night


""This is an out-of-state driver's license,"" said the campus cop holding 
her id.

Constance stood by the ticket booth with her arms crossed tapping her 
foot and trying to make eye contact.  She was in a hurry.  She was ten 
minutes late for her first public appearance in her new job.

""I just moved to town a week ago and haven't updated my license yet.""

""If you show me your student id, you won't have to buy a ticket.""

""I'm not a student here.  I'm Constance Snodgrass, the new anchor for 
Channel 9.  I'm here to help in the station's tent.""

""I don't remember seeing you on TV, but I always watch Channel 5.""

""I'm new.  I start on air with the Monday evening news.  I do hope that 
you will watch.""

She needed him to stamp her hand showing that she was over 21.  Without 
that, she couldn't have alcohol at the dinner later that evening.  The 
cop seemed deep in thought as he slowly turned her id back and forth.  
This would only take a second if he would actually look at the id instead 
of staring at her cleavage.

Her boss had told her to ""Get noticed.  Meet people.""  Her clothes 
ensured that she would get noticed.  She wore a crisp new pair of tight 
jeans and the nuclear option--a burnt orange halter top with a deeply 
plunging neck line.  It was obviously too much for that campus cop to 
ignore.

Still, since she needed to look professional, she also wore the wool 
blazer that the station had so generously bought her.  It had been 
expertly tailored to accent her large bust, narrow waist, and flaring 
hips.  Yes, she had all the curves that a girl could want.  Buttoning the 
blazer covered her midriff, and highlighted the station's call letters 
and the large numeral 9 emblazoned on the pocket.  The blazer's navy 
color worked well with her long, wavy, strawberry-blonde hair.  

""Are you sure that you want to do this . . . dressed like that?""

""Yes!""  What was wrong with the way she was dressed?

""Very well, good luck!""  He stamped her hand and she hurried onto the 
academic quad.  The college's fall festival, ""Pilgrim's Progress"", was in 
full swing.  Students were everywhere enjoying a carefree Saturday 
afternoon--fall classes would start on Monday.  

She had allowed enough time to reach the campus, but, at the ticket 
booth, she had been stuck behind a bus load of slowly moving retirees.  

Why had the cop commented on HER attire?  Those retirees were the ones 
that dressed strangely.  They could only be described as retro Puritan--
their clothes were mostly black with a little white and gray.  The men 
all wore hats, and the women covered their hair with linen caps.  Other 
than faces and hands, she didn't see any visible skin.  True, the 
college's mascot was the Pilgrims, but that seemed a bit excessive.  

Anyway, that was behind her.  She was finally here, in the middle of 
Mayflower College, in the middle of the Village of Mayflower, in the 
middle of nowhere.  OK!  This was about the smallest TV market in the 
country, but she was an anchor!  Only two years out of school and she had 
reached a level that many reporters never achieved.  Being an anchor so 
early, she might make it to the network someday.

Red brick buildings ringed the quad while tents, tables or booths filled 
the grassy areas.  Now where was her station's tent?

""Miss Snodgrass.  Miss Snodgrass,"" a male voice called out to her.

Turning around, she saw a tall, thin, acne covered boy with thick, black 
framed glasses.  Ah, Wesley.  Her cameraman/producer was waving at her.   
Actually, he was just a senior at the college who was interning at the 
station.  He was such a geek--those SLR cameras that he used for high-def 
video never left his side.  He had no self-confidence and a gawd awful 
laugh.  

If only he would get over her.  He followed her around like a puppy dog 
always ready to shoot footage.  He insisted on calling her ""Miss 
Snodgrass.""  That was creepy--she was only three years older than him.  
But at least he seemed to realize that she was out of his league.

As Constance hurried towards Wesley and the station's tent, she observed 
the college students.  They were dressed casually like, well, college 
students.  Only these were rich college students whose casual clothes 
screamed money.  Everything was top of the line.  She saw hand bags that 
cost more than she took home in a month.  These students weren't working 
their way through school like she had.  Even the t-shirts recounted trips 
to expensive destinations.  Maybe someday, after her student loans were 
repaid, Constance could think about trips like that.

""Hurry, Miss Snodgrass.  None of the students are stopping at our tent.  
You have to do something.""  

Wesley was clearly worried.  Channel 9 was losing the ratings battle to 
Channel 5.  The station was in some financial difficulty and was 
desperate to turn things around.  Her predecessor, Jenny, had been fired 
because she didn't have good ratings.  Channel 9 could be a big break for 
Constance, but it could be a disaster if she couldn't connect with the 
viewers. 

When Constance reached the station's tent, her co-anchor, Stewart, was 
there.  He was in his sixties but looked like an octogenarian.  Stewart 
stood at the back of the tent talking her boss, the station manager 'Gus' 
Gustafson.

Neither Stewart nor Gus was doing anything to meet people.  Both of them 
were dressed as pilgrims just like the retirees.  Why hadn't someone told 
her what to wear?  

She could hear Stewart's announcer voice.  He must have started in radio.  
He droned on: ""I see that the eye candy has finally arrived.  When I was 
growing up, people tried to be responsible.  They were interested in what 
was happening in the world and paid attention to the news.  Now, all they 
do is tweet about everything that they are doing and follow what some 
actor in Hollywood posts about the news.  They think that late night 
comedy shows are real news.""

Looking straight at her, he continued: ""When I was starting out, I would 
have never been late for an appearance, especially for my very first 
appearance.  A true journalist must be serious and prepared, but I guess 
some people just rely upon looks or diversity quotas.""

It was going to take a lot for Stewart to take her seriously.  He was so 
set in his ways that it might even be impossible.  But the people who 
really mattered were Gus and the viewers.  She needed to convince them.

Wesley had been right.  There weren't any visitors at the tent.  
Constance looked around the quad and verified that Channel 9 didn't 
bother to come.  They realized that college students had very little use 
for TV stations.

But Gus wanted her to meet people.  How could she attract visitors?  She 
looked at the swag that was offered on the table.  Pencils and mouse 
pads!  No wonder nobody stopped by.  Stewart probably thought that mouse 
pads were the latest thing.

If anything was going to happen, she would have to make it happen. There 
were plenty of people at the tent next to theirs.  It looked like Planned 
Parenthood was handing out free condoms.  Groups of obviously freshmen 
guys were scooping them up in handfuls.  Desperate to establish some 
street cred in their new environment, they were bragging about how many 
girls they had had and about their sexual prowess.  

Here were easy pickings.  Stepping out in front of the tent, she called 
to them.  ""Hey, Guys!  Can I talk with you for a minute?""  They didn't 
need to be asked twice.  Almost instantly, she was surrounding by guys 
who were practically salivating.  

""I'm Constance Snodgrass and I'm an anchor for Channel 9.  I'm new here 
in town and would really appreciate it if you would think of me whenever 
you watch TV.  Pease watch!""

It didn't take much--a smile, a side-ways glance, a flip of the hair, a 
gentle hand on an arm or shoulder.  One guy even rated a wink.  She 
offered them her card with her picture and the channel 9 logo ""so you 
will remember me and my station.""  Soon, they were walking away holding 
the business cards and looking at them as if they were something 
precious.

This worked for the guys, but she wasn't being very successful with the 
coeds.  Stewart certainly wasn't drawing them in either.  She needed a 
different approach.  ""Wesley, can you find me some poster board and a 
marker? Please!""  

Wesley was off and running while she entertained yet another group of 
guys.  When he returned, she quickly made a sign reading: ""Internships 
Available.  Inquire Here.""  She hung the sign up over the tent's entrance 
and retired inside for a break.  Soon, they were swamped with students.  
Even rich kids knew that they would eventually need to find jobs.  
Besides, their station could use all the cheap labor that they could get.

Gus had broken off from the rambling but precisely enunciating Stewart to 
answer questions about internships.  He looked at Constance and said 
""Great work!  The station hasn't had this much attention in years.  You 
aren't even on air yet and I can feel Channel 9's ratings improve.  
Now, I need you to meet some of the town's people as well as students.  
Visit some of the other tents and meet some of the important people, our 
sponsors.  They need to realize the fresh new approach at Channel 9.""

So Constance, with Wesley in tow, started making a circuit of the various 
booths.  

The atmosphere certainly was festive.  There were groups of upper class 
men and women greeting friends after a summer away; there were couples 
with very public displays of affection; and there were freshmen dealing 
with the uncertainty of a brand new environment.  

The Greek organizations were busily trying to meet potential pledges.  
Other campus organizations were looking for new members.  

All the businesses in town had booths offering coupons and credit cards 
to new students.  This little New England town thrived on the manna that 
flowed from rich parents through their college aged children.  The town's 
only other source of money was the newly constructed retirement community 
on the edge of town.  There, rich alums were living their last years 
recalling the years that they had spent on this campus.

Constance stopped at a few tents and introduced herself.  She soon 
confirmed that, other than students, everybody was dressed in Pilgrim 
attire.  Although out of place, her clothes were getting her noticed and 
she WAS meeting people.

One of the early tents they passed was the Delta something or other 
fraternity.  The brothers had set up a weight bench inside and were 
taking turns.  These were some good looking guys.  She paused to watch.

""Come on Miss Snodgrass,"" said Wes.  ""Those are just the Deltas.  They're 
nothing but jocks.  Mr. Gustafson said to meet important people.""

What was the hurry?  ""But Wes, doing stories on the college's athletics 
may help our ratings.  These guys need to know who to call with a story 
idea.""  She turned and wandered into the Delta tent.

Soon, she was surrounded by a bunch of athletic guys as she went through 
her spiel.  It was quite warm in here.  Who would expect heat this far 
north in late August.  Her face was actually flushing.  It must be the 
wool blazer.  

Constance unbuttoned the jacket and placed her hands on her hips to hold 
it open.  The air on her bare midriff felt good.  She saw approval in the 
guy's eyes and returned their smiles.  More and more of these nicely 
muscled young men were gathering around.  To be honest, she was started 
to get a little moist between her legs as well.  It had been a while.

""May we help you?"" said a female voice behind her.  Turning, Constance 
saw a group of girls coming from another tent.  The spoken words had been 
polite, but the tone said something else--a female territorial claim.

These girls had great clothes, matching accessories, real jewelry, 
carefully fixed hair, fresh manicures, and expensive perfume.  They 
looked like a million bucks.  But there are some things that money can't 
buy.  Constance removed her jacket and casually draped down her back.  
Turning her back to the girls, she replied, ""Thank you, but we're getting 
along just fine.  I'm the new Channel 9 anchor and I plan to do a lot of 
interviews with Mayflower College's athletes.  Say, do they allow 
reporters in your locker room after games?""  

She bent forward to give the guys a full cleavage view and then looked up 
slowly making eye contact with one guy after another.  She could see that 
she had their complete attention.  Then, she slowly turned and sashayed 
from the tent.

""I see that you met the Kappas,"" said Wes as she emerged.  ""The Kappas 
and the Deltas are pretty much always pair up.""

""We'll see,"" Constance said as she moved on to the next tent.  With her 
jacket off, she was getting looks from all over the quad.  

She introduced herself to as many people as she could.  At some tents, 
she was able to meet the owners of local companies.  Several of the men 
expressed interest in working with her to film new promotions for their 
businesses.  This day was going far better than she could have dreamed.

She felt a large hand land on her shoulder and heard a man ask, ""Excuse 
me, Miss.  Are you a student here?""

Constance turned to see another ""pilgrim"" and entered her spiel.  ""No, 
I'm not a student.  I'm Constance Snodgrass, the new anchor for Channel 
9.  Here's my card.  I do hope that you will watch.""

""I see.  I'm William Bradford, the president of Mayflower College.  Hmm, 
I see that they've given you the same phone number that Jenny had: 867-
5309.  That's convenient; I know that number by heart.  Since you're new 
in town, I'm sure that there are many people that you'd like to meet.  
You look like the kind of person who can make a big contribution here.  
It's almost time for the dinner to start, let me introduce you to some of 
our alumni and trustees.""

Constance smiled her best smile while thanking him, and let herself be 
led away.  As they walked toward the administration building, she 
signaled to Wes that he should do some filming.

Tables had been placed before the administration building and numerous 
Pilgrims were finding seats for dinner.  Constance could see buffet lines 
for the students in front of another building.

When they reached the administration building, she was surprised to see a 
set of stocks prominently placed in front of the entrance.  Apparently, 
that was another play on the college name.  

Constance couldn't believe her luck.  She was being introduced to the 
most important people in town: the mayor, John Alden; the bank president, 
Edward Tilley; the head of the hospital; the president of the Chamber of 
Commerce; a Judge Fuller; and the owners of several local businesses.  
Wes was carefully recording everything.  They could edit together some 
clips that showed her as part of the community.  It would be a great 
promo video to introduce her to the town.

President Bradford offered her a seat at his table for the dinner.  She 
looked around as she sat down and saw that Gus and Stewart were sitting 
at other tables.  She was setting at the head table--take that Stewart.

As dinner was winding down, President Bradford turned to her and asked 
""Connie, we have a bit of a program after dinner.  Would you mind helping 
me out?""

""Of course, I'd be glad to anything that I can to help.  I do prefer 
Constance though.""  After the way she had been treated, how could she 
refuse?  Her name was going to be a problem.  It was hard to have 
sufficient gravitas for an anchor if people thought of you as Connie.  
Perhaps, in her next job, she should use her middle name.  Marie 
Snodgrass did have a ring to it.

""Each year at this dinner, we try to raise money for a scholarship.  I 
know that you've seen the thermometer drawings that people use fund 
raising campaigns.  Frankly, they're boring and don't do much to motivate 
donors. Instead, each year, we place someone in the pillory over there 
and ask people to raise a ransom to free him.  I think that you would be 
a very effective fund raiser.  What do you say?""

What could she say?  Usually, she would be willing to try anything; but 
she did need to be professional; but these people had been so nice to 
her.  None of them really knew her.  If she went along, she would be seen 
as a good sport.  If she refused, well, she'd be a bitch.  Bitches don't 
get good ratings, she needed to be a good sport.

""I'd be glad to help President Bradford.""  After all, everybody would be 
looking at her.

""Here, if you wouldn't mind, please sign this release.  You know how 
lawyers are.  They insist that we do the paperwork before proceeding.""

Now, what to do?  She knew better than to sign something without reading 
it, but to sit here and read the contract first would not look like a 
good sport.  After a few drinks, she wasn't really up to reading a legal 
document anyway.  Besides, if she didn't like it, she really couldn't 
back out now.

Trying to be as gracious as possible, Constance turned to the back page 
and signed the contract with flair.  ""We must keep the lawyers happy, 
mustn't we?""

With that, President Bradford stood and rapped on his glass to get 
people's attention.  ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please continue with your 
desert and coffee while we begin our little program.  As most of you 
know, each year we raise funds at this event for a scholarship to award 
to deserving student here at Mayflower College.  With the ever increasing 
cost of college, our goal this year is $40,000 dollars.  The new anchor 
at Channel 9, Constance Snodgrass, has graciously agreed to help in this 
year's campaign.""

Constance looked around acknowledging the polite applause.  As she did 
that, she saw two campus policemen approach her.

""Constance Snodgrass,"" one said, ""you are under arrest for lascivious 
carriage and attire.  Come with us.""

They grabbed her arms and lifted her from her seat.  Next they dragged 
her to the pillory and forced her head down in the cutout on the lower 
bar.  Her hands were placed in the smaller notches on either side.  The 
top bar lowered.  She heard a padlock click and realized that they really 
had locked her in.  Cords were tied on each wrist.  The cords were then 
wrapped around the bars of the pillory and secured.  She couldn't pull 
her hands out.  Another cord was tied around her hair; pulled up; and 
fastened to something.  They hung her Channel 9 blazer over one end of 
the pillory.

She stood there, bent at the waist, head pulled up, looking out at the 
quad.  Nearby were: President Bradford; the trustees; other alumni; town 
dignitaries; and guests such as Gus, and Stewart.  Further back, she 
could see the students returning from their meals to watch.  Off to the 
side, Wes had placed a camera on a tripod to record her reactions.  He 
even clipped a wireless mic onto the pillory near her head.

""Let's get started,"" said President Bradford.  ""Constance has been 
arrested for lascivious attire.  Who will pay the fine for her?  Is 
anybody willing to pay the $40,000 fine?  Anybody?  Very well, we will do 
things piecemeal.  First, we will auction the tennis shoes.""

What?  They were going to auction her tennis shoes?  Surely that was just 
figuratively.  They wouldn't really sell her shoes!  Would they?

President Bradford conducted an auction.  The high bidder paid $500 for 
her tennis shoes.  Certainly these were just contributions being made to 
the College.  Nobody would really pay $500 for her shoes!?

At the end of the bidding, the winner came forward and wrote a check to 
the College.  He then approached Constance in the stocks.

President Bradford looked at her and said ""Constance, it is traditional 
for you to thank a person how has helped pay your fine.""

Smiling, Constance looked at the winner and said, ""Thank you for paying 
the fine for my tennis shoes.""  There was a round of applause.  
Apparently she was playing the game correctly.  Then she felt hands grab 
her ankles.  Soon her shoes had been removed and brought forward to the 
winner.

They had actually taken her shoes.  She was still in shock as her socks 
were auctioned for $100.  They were removed and she was standing on the 
cold concrete in her bare feet.

""What about those trousers?"" asked President Bradford.  ""Would any decent 
Pilgrim woman wear clothes like that?""  

What could she do?  This couldn't be happening.  Why didn't someone stop 
them?  Everybody was watching her.  She saw a number of the Kappa girls 
standing in the background with smug grins.

""500.""

""750.""

""1,000.""

""Going once, going twice, sold for $1,000."""
dss5wn,8,2019-11-06,I feel like I'm only a good programmer when I'm on meth.,throwawayMethDev,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/dss5wn/i_feel_like_im_only_a_good_programmer_when_im_on/,"TL:DR; I thought I was going to be a genius, rockstar, 10x coder. I'm not, and never will be. But I come close on really strong Adderall and Vyvanses. I love who I am on them. And I hate that I need them. 

I've been coding since I was 14. Tinkering with computers, tearing them apart, etc since I was about 12. I always thought it was magical how some unique incantation of words and symbols could build something that could touch a million peoples lives, or change the world. 

I started on EnigmaGroup thinking I was going to be a hacker, completed a good chunk of the missions, hung around the IRC, but thanks to some psycho marine by the age of 15-16 I was convinced I needed a degree in CS and some serious coding knowledge before I could be a ""real"" hacker; otherwise, I'd forever be some skid (script kiddie). 

I began taking dual enrollment courses at a local community college after taking the ACT at 15. Decent score, not a genius by any means. But at the time I thought I was king, I thought I was so fucking brilliant and intelligent for getting a 28 at such a young age. Looking back, I'm kicking myself for being so arrogant. It was good enough to get in but not really good enough to get any serious scholarships. Immediately started taking programming classes, coding in my spare time, etc. Played World of Warcraft, made some addons. 

Moved into uni dorms at 18 as a junior. Still took me 4 years to graduate; I tried to focus on getting co-ops and internships to get a headstart on acquiring some real experience. First job was doing VBA scripting for ladies in charge of doing inventory for the university datacenter. Second job was doing COM C++ for a 3D modeling company. Next I tinkered with Python trying to automate tests for some VOIP hardware. Finally landed a job doing full stack web development, and until then I mainly worked alone, left alone to my own devices, but this time I had a tech lead only a year or so older, and I began to realize how woefully ill-equipped I was, intellectually. 

In college I discovered Adderall and Vyvanse. When I could get it, I would hoard it, save it for big tests, or big programming projects, and while I was on, I was god. 

I knew I couldn't rely on that shit. I started working out, trying to be healthy, got really good at it, but as I poured more time into the gym, my coding skills and grades lapsed. I used addys to help bridge the gap and get me that damn degree.

I'm now about 3 years graduated. Landed a sweet gig paying close to 6 figures doing full stack development about a year ago, at a really exciting company where I knew I was going to learn a lot. Started a project on the side for a buddy from college with an idea for an app about 6 months ago. We have a client but payment hinges on me getting this shit working by next Monday. 

I came into this project knowing all the right things to do: scope out the project, determine the problem domain, build a prototype, get it in front of a customer, get feedback, iterate. Write the acceptance criteria tests, write the unit tests, automate deployment, use a staging server. I tried to do everything the ""right"" way. I continuously deploy, I have a suite of acceptance and unit tests, I use some of the latest and greatest frameworks and toolchains. 

But I can't do any of this without a constant stream of addy and vyvanse on the weekends. When I'm not on, I feel average, thick, slow, lazy. But when I'm on, I fucking love what I do, and I love that I love what I do. 

I feel like I've tricked people into thinking I'm a competent programmer. But if you took away my drugs, I'm worse than useless. This is not impostor syndrome. I know I'm good at building software. But I also know I'm only good when I'm on meth. 

Adderall and vyvanse are my Limitless drugs. I've been off them for months at a time before with no side effects (besides laziness and depression), but I love who I am when I have them. 

I remember having dreams of being that rockstar programmer when I was young. I think reality is starting to hit that I'll never be that good, and the window of opportunity to be that guy is closing.

And I just needed to get that off my chest."
dssgcf,7,2019-11-06,AITA for leaving a sales department in the busiest period of the year?,1198,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dssgcf/aita_for_leaving_a_sales_department_in_the/,"Hello, I just need to rant.

To preface: I'm fresh out of college, interning at an MNC. My former manager was the head of a sales channel (one of the biggest revenue drivers for my department) and recently had to leave the company abruptly for medical reasons. I've completely taken over his job while we search for a replacement.

I've been told a lot during my internship by my department head that he would like to hire me full time, but that he cannot guarantee anything. I would have loved to work at my current department but knowing that there's no guarantee, I have been applying elsewhere as a backup.

I recently interviewed with another department witihin the company for a full-time position that I'm a lot more interested in and got offered the job. When I told my director (my de-facto interim manager) this, within the next day I was suddenly given an offer to stay at my current position full time. I told them that I had already accepted the offer, and now the two departments are arguing over me. My current team wants to keep me for as long as possible because I'm running a high value channel, but my new department also needs me ASAP for the holiday season. Because this is an internal transfer, whatever decision I make may affect the company.

I feel awful for driving a wedge between the two departments and causing all this conflict. I'm also afraid that causing all this commotion might make my new department regret their decision to hire me, and that my handling of this might give them a bad impression of me as a person.

 I'm suddenly being told by my current boss that I'm really important and that they might not meet their revenue goals if I leave, but if I was really that important, shouldn't action have been taken to hire me months ago?


AITA for leaving my department for a better opportunity when I have such important responsibilities? Or was I just being used for intern cheap labor?"

I wish I could do anything about it, but sadly, I can't. The more I think about the way you talked to me at the end, the more I feel like you don't care about me anymore. Our paths won't cross anymore, wont they? You don't trust me, you don't want me in your life, you think I am negative, you don't care about me, so why would you ever text me? I am aware that I don't know your side of the story. I can't talk to you about this, I can't ask you anything, all I can do is make a step after step.

I wish I could share these things things with you, that I'm not negative, that I make plans to do internship in photography. I met a good friend, I even went to another city to hang out with her, it was fun. She goes through some drama with love, so I'm there for her. I printed pictures for the first time, my own pictures, even though I'm an amateur it still made me happy and it inspires me to take more pictures. Today a new lens will come for my camera, it cost a good amount, but it is worth it. I'm learning so many new hings, about myself, about photography. I wish I could share these things with you and hear your stories.

Today, I feel very uneasy, it's like something bad will happen, that the distance between us will become infinite and you will disappear and or paths will never cross again, I know I've wrote it above, but thinking about it is different from seeing it happen, different from it actually happening. It hurts.

It would be nice if there was a away to express myself fully, so you could see all of me and not just parts of me that can be misunderstood.

I still try to be my best self, I struggle and fall. I try to get back up and move forward. I've changed. I will be forever thankful to you. I wish you happiness. I wish I could be part of it though..."

I got admitted to transfer to both schools and I’m down to these options. This is shaping up to be one of the hardest decisions ever tbh, and I get that both colleges pretty much offer the same type of curriculum and degree, both offers things that I truly like that the other doesn’t.

To start with Chico State, I’ve always romanticized with the idea of living in a small college town, and having a community that revolves around the school. Chico just seems to have that type of experience that most CSUs don’t really offer. When I visited the campus I thought it was the nicest campus out of all the CSUs and it just had a certain charm to it, even the downtown area. Growing up in Honolulu and then the Bay Area, I’ve always lived in big cities and I’ve kinda always wanted to escape (especially being an introvert). I’m not in away way looking to go to this school to drink and party, But I like the fact that it’s in the middle of nowhere. Not to mention when it comes to “prestige” and “reputation”, Chico State seems to be one of the highest in the CSU system.

Now with Sacramento State, this is the school that just seems everyone including my family and professors/counselors are pushing for and recommending, and I can see why. As a Poli Sci Major, going to school in the state capital just makes all the sense in the world as I’ll be able to go to school in the center of politics in the state. I’ll be able to have lots of opportunities for internships and building connections in government. When it comes to campus, I also found it really nice (especially those trees) but I can definitely tell that it was a commuter school and the student life is definitely not the best, but at the same time i loved the diversity within the campus and it just seemed so well balanced with the different people I saw around.

There are things I love about both school, but I can only pick one. And I don’t want to have any regrets with my decision. I’d love to hear some opinions from you guys about both schools, and maybe some other factors to put into my decision. Thanks y’all!"

dsxkmu,1,2019-11-07,M4F - Corn fed Cal and a gold medal in mental gymnastics,CornFedCal,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dsxkmu/m4f_corn_fed_cal_and_a_gold_medal_in_mental/," He struggled to push his key into the lock of his 16th floor apartment, if you could call it that. Shuffling his way into the small space that wasn't much better than his Momma's pantry back home in Nebraska left Cal wondering if he made the right choice moving to New York City. Every single buddy and Good Ol' boy of his tried to make him see the error of his ways but he couldn't be deterred and damn was he paying for it now.

Cal was tired, and it's pretty hard to tell a boy that grew up on a farm what tired was when it didn't involve living bales of hay and getting up at the ass crack of dawn to milk the cows. But holy shit, these Ivy League liberal elite types were *no fucking joke*, regular working hours 7 to 7 on a **good day!** He sighed to himself as he stared at his watch, a Patek, staring down just 15 minutes before 9 before sinking down into the floor.

This dream of his wasn't coming together like he had hoped and the girls here weren't exactly like the kind back home who would be impressed with a new pair of boots and a dirty pick up truck. These girls wanted culture, they wanted excessively liberal politics and to be wined and dined before you even got to the ass grabbing stage. Maybe he was just looking in the wrong places but a guy with good Christian values was having an awful hard time finding a wife, much less a steady girl friend.

He walked over towards the fridge popped it open and grabbed a long deserved beer as he sunk down into the familiar spot on the couch where he had basically resided every night for the last 6 months when he wasn't exactly fitting in. He had played baseball at the University of Nebraska and while he wasn't pro material he was still pretty damn good. A strong hand shake and a promise to never miss a rec league game with his law firms partners landed him an internship which lead to a full time position which lead to his current predicament.

Given his particular religious motivations and his lack of any sort of female attention left him feeling a bit... pent up. It was Friday night and fuck, he deserved at least a kiss right? He wasn't looking to spill his seed in Satan's name by his own hand and he needed an alternative. Pulling his phone up he started to just do a bit of research, nothing serious, just wanting to see what was available. That's when it hit him, the kernel of an idea that he wasn't even entirely sure was something a man of is predilections could ever potentially consider.

Being a virgin, and wanting to stay that way until he was married, he didn't have very many options in terms of fooling around with a consenting female. Sure he had gotten a few blowjobs and hand jobs but these girls always wanted to fuck and frankly he just wasn't that interested in that just yet without a ring on her finger. However, that didn't stop him from hearing about those church going type of girls that had it on good authority that if you got fucked in the ass, *it didn't count*, **you were still a virgin**. Cal enjoyed this type of logic as it made perfect sense to him, it was a nuts and bolts type of problem and this was a very simple answer.

In that moment on the couch he realized that if he was going to get the relief that he needed, this was the way that he had to go about it. He was going to get his *ass fucked* and preserve his eternal soul and not muddy the good name of his Daddy. Now he wasn't gay, and while he didn't specifically have an issue with people in that life style he wasn't sure he wanted to know any more about it than he already did. Therefore there really was only one option, it had to be a lady with one of those **strappy things**.

His resoluteness shocked even him as he quickly pulled up a few websites, something about a **'Dominatrix'** or something other, he wasn't sure, he just knew what he needed and in this moment it was a **big rubber dick up his ass.** He wasn't sure that he had even fully comprehended the entire thing but that didn't stop him from sending out a few emails telling someone on the other end exactly what he wanted. It wasn't long before he received a confirmation email and it was in that moment he wondered if he had made a huge mistake.

**OOC:** Looking for a lovely intelligent lady to either continue this story or come up with something together. Please feel free to respond in anyway that you see fit."
dsy29h,1,2019-11-07,New Intern - Trying to Prep for the Future,Ablazion,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dsy29h/new_intern_trying_to_prep_for_the_future/,"Hey Everyone,

Currently an intern (primary care) and I am trying to get my finances together and trying to start planning for the future after residency (seems a while away). Have been trying to get into learning more about personal finance and passive income and financial independence lately. Here's my current financial situation:

Debt: 

\~185K in debt all subsidized/unsub loans from undergrad and medical school with the highest interest rate of 6%. 

 \- Rent $700/month

\- Car Loan $400/month - will be done in the next year

\- 403(b) reaching the max percentage, need to put in 4% for the hospital to max 2%

\- Saving $200/month towards emergency fund 

\- No CC debt, paid off full every month. Including food, gas, etc

At the end of the day, I am able to put $1,000 towards my student loans every month. They are currently in grace-period and so I am putting all $1k towards my highest interest loan while the remaining loans accrue interest. When its time for repayment I will be under the REPAYE program and will have a min payment of \~$400, the remaining $600 will go towards the highest interest loan. 

At this point, I feel like my total loan amount is comparatively less than my co-interns or other residents/physicians in the field that it is reasonable to try and pay it off before the 10 years for PSLF. 

If I do plan on paying it off, should I just refinance my loans then for a lower interest rate and when should I do that ? 

Any advice or tips is greatly appreciated!"

I was messing with admin profiles and access domain but couldn't get it working. I created the user and made them a DG and Template admin type, added them to a access domain with access only to the lab DG and Template, and added them to a DG and Template role (panorama role option was grayed out). 

There doesn't seem to be a way to link a access domain with a panorama role profile. The user gets a ""not authorized"" error when logging into panorama. 

Any good resources with examples on how to set up users with different access? Google didn't put out much. 

Or any ideas on what I may be doing wrong?

Thanks!"
dsyr1d,11,2019-11-07,Does the college where an applicant graduated from matter to managers and recruiters?,thisfilmkid,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/dsyr1d/does_the_college_where_an_applicant_graduated/,"Today, schools are expensive. More and more of my friends are attending city schools such as City University of New York and state schools for both undergraduate and graduate degrees.

But, a handful has fears that they may be looked down upon because their degrees are not from top teir private schools like Harvard, Yale, or NYU.

Some struggle to get jobs in the digital media market because of their lack of experience or portfolio while others excel at achieving their entry-level positions.

I had a conversation with an HR representative from a broadcast media company and she had mixed reviews. The recruiter is a graduate of the University of Hartford. She completed six internships while in college an graduated with an entry level position at HBO. She said her hard work, hussling, and network allowed her to achieve great work accomplishments. But, she said, ""I wouldn't be surprised if the name of my college on my resume helped attract the eyes of recruiters.""

So, I asked her the question: does a university name matter to the recruiters in your environment? Her response was, ""Yes and no. It's a hard one. In some cases, you have recruiters who favor other colleges over another. Yet, you have recruiters, like me, who favor skills and the ability to learn and advance over college names."" 

So I had to ask a followup -- how do graduates of city universities or state schools attract recruiters and hiring managers at top companies like HBO and others? Her reply was opaque, ""Luck."" She continued on to say, ""A lot of my co-workers are focused on skills. As long as they have a degree, they can advance. Unfortunately, I cannot say every co-worker of mine is as faithful to that rule as others and myself are. If I was a hiring manager, as long as you can do the job, that's all that matter. We're seeing a change today where more students are avoiding private college because they cannot afford the bill. But, these top companies are going to those college campuses to recruit candidates. It's a tough ideal. But a student from city and state colleges will always be part of the recruitment process. They're still hirable.""

I feel so bad for always posting on reddit looking for help and motivation support. 

I graduated college in December 2018, with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and a concentration in Marketing. 

I started my job search in college, and landed a job position as an “account executive” where I was promised professional growth, and unlimited commissions...! 

Once I started working, nothing was as promised. I was hoping to learn more, than just drive an hour away to Walmart to reach out to just anyone to sign up for gift cards. That was my first job out of college. 

Financially, I was only getting paid $100ish a week instead of $500 as mentioned during the job interview and was constantly pulled down by my boss for not being a good “seller”. 

I ended up quitting/was let go and found myself unemployed for a month. 

I applied to jobs in person and online. I managed to receive interviews but only received ONE offer, as a “lead generator” at Lowe’s. 

While it pays bills, I don’t want to do that for long-term, as it is really similar to my first job. I don’t learn much, because those jobs are categorized as “very easy jobs”. 

I revised my resume into the kind of job I was looking for, which was Digital Marketing. Especially Social Media. 

I have about two years of social media marketing experience. 

I created a social media presence that has gained an audience of over 30K people, to prove my skills to companies. 

Currently I have two unpaid internships in digital marketing. One as Marketing Assistant and another one as a growth hacker. 

In total I applied to 400 jobs,  I managed to receive over 20 jobs interviews (including big companies!), but no offer.  Not even at a call center! That’s how bad...

Today, I know all the lies of HR. We’ll get back to you, keep in touch, we’ll give you a call by Friday, we still have 2 candidates and we’ll reach out...! 

But seriously, what could I be missing? Is it experience? Interview skills? My resume? My personality? How I look? 

I even applied out-of-state! 

This girl spent her college years working as a waitress. She got one internship and ended up being a Media Planner after college. 

So why am I still at that stage?"

**The 1st one** : Just one coding question, I think I did a bit of complex code (he asked about the complexity I told him its O(n square) I'm not 100% sure of that)  but he asked if I can write another one with less complexity I suggested a solution he told me he think its fine but didn't ask me to code it.

  
  **The 2nd interview :** she told me she will ask 2 question, right after she asked the first question the phone signal went off so she told me to start coding on coderpad until she tries to recall me so I started coding (ofocurse she could see my code) then after multiple attempts of restarting the phone and so on I suggested that we call on coderpad and it worked but we had only 15 mins left in the interview, I told her that I can finish the question she asked, I did finish it I think I did well on it.  but at then end she told me that most probably we will reschedule because she wanted to ask another question . 

&amp;#x200B;

  The recruiter then sent me an email asking for another time for the interview instead of the one with the phone signal trouble, **I was wondering do you think they will take into consideration that I solved the problem in the 2nd interview ?** or will the 2nd interview be completely discarded  ?   I am really bumped about that"

You wouldn’t have held me emotionally hostage.

You wouldn’t have put me on pins and needles.

You wouldn’t have gaslit me.

You would have realized that your insecurities are your fucking problem.

You would have taken the things I feel more seriously.

You would have listened.

But no, it’s me and what I do. It’s me having responsibilities and obligations outside of this half-ass relationship. Because the whole world revolves around you, doesn’t it? 

No, sir. Not at all. You see, when you play stupid games, you get stupid prizes. I was going to wait until tomorrow and break it off in person, because I told you I wouldn’t break up through text... again. My bad. We shouldn’t make promises we can’t keep, right? So, when you asked when the next free time I had, and I told you Friday in between my internship and my next shift, you didn’t like that you had to wait. When I wished you a good day and you didn’t respond— at all, I knew I would be making the right choice. When I asked about the silent treatment you were giving me, and you only reiterated what I had said about the next time I was free, I knew that you were too immature for a healthy, adult relationship. Did you seriously think that dodging me would... do something? I still don’t know what you were hoping to achieve, and quite frankly I don’t give a fuck, but when I offered up a few minutes after I got off work tonight and you said you were “busy”, I knew what was up. 

You see, you’ve never been too busy for a good throw down. You’re more than happy to escalate. I assume you thought you were giving me what you thought I deserved by not responding to me. Isn’t it strange how trying to get one over on someone often bites us in our own asses? So, you were busy. There are three bars in this town, one of which you work. You weren’t working tonight, so I checked the first bar. Your car wasn’t there, so immediately I felt bad because... well, maybe I jumped to conclusions... but, just to be sure, I decided to check the other two. And there you were. Parked in your usual spot. Ready to forgo every promise you made to me and yourself. And that’s when reality really hit me. Yesterday, I knew I needed to get out, if only to heal myself and break this cycle of dating and loving toxic men, because obviously there is something deeply broken within me that attracts these types. But last night, I knew it went even further than that. You will never, ever give up drinking. Reality hit me like a damn train.

I had this fantasy that... well, maybe in a few months we can reconcile and I’ll be on my path of healing and you’ll be on yours. This break up just might be temporary. You said you wanted to be sober, right? Right? Not just for me, but for you? But, last night you were exactly where you shouldn’t be, and exactly where I knew you’d be, because you, my dear, are a creature of habit. You. Don’t. Want. This. And I can’t want more for you than you want for you. The fantasy is dead. I don’t even want it anymore. I don’t even want you anymore. There’s nothing that you could possibly say or do that would make me want you. I don’t love you. I can honestly say I will never love you again.

So. You said you were busy. I took a picture of your car, easily recognizable, parked behind the bar, and sent it to you with the caption, “I’m sure.” And drove away. I told you I would respect your time and energy, because that’s all I’ve ever wanted you to do for me. I told you I would be home, respecting the hell out of it. And then you told me you were drinking.

It’s funny how cycles work.

We always end up in the same place.

But I’m done. I’m so done.

Edit for update:

I got off work a little early last night, so I drove home and got to thinking about all the things he left at my house. I decided to pack it up. As I was packing, the pettiest idea came to mind: Address the box to his drunk alter ego that everyone knows and hates... so I did. I packed up his things, addressed it to the alter ego in red pen, drove the box over to his place, made sure neither him nor his roommate were home, dropped it off and left. The difference in the energy in my house is astounding. I blocked him once I made sure the key to my place was left where I told him to leave it and I took the key in the house. 

Thank you, everyone. I was afraid of feeling alone, and that fear in the past has driven me right back to him. The support and love, strangers or not, you all have shown me has really helped me to stay on this track. We are on day three now and I’m really starting to picture the good life I have in front of me. In my language, we say “Gvlielije” (guh-lee-ay-lee-jay), which means, I am grateful for the thing you have done for me. So, gvlielije, nigada. Thank you, everyone."

He was my parent's friends' son. I met him at a restaurant with all of us there and we definitely connected. It was a pretty amazing night, and we all had so much fun together and me and him definitely bonded. 

He lived far away though. We stayed friends for a long time. He helped me through some very tough times. 

In June/July this year we started talking romantically. He came back to visit his mom and I really felt emotionally connected to him. He suggested that maybe I could do my internship where he lived (I need it to graduate) and see where things go. Well, I did that.

Turns out it was ""bad timing"". We saw each other about 3 times and then he was gone for all of October...apparently his second seasonal job was so hectic that he couldn't make time. I knew he'd be busy but I just wanted *any* time with him. Even lunch. Anything. The whole month I felt so alone in this new place and felt like he wasn't committing to this as much as me. I would yearn for any text/call from him and felt so desperate for him. I hated it. But I grew a lot on my own being in this new place by myself and got 2 jobs. I was really proud of my ability to do this and take a lot of pride in just how much I've grown. 

And then when his job was done, we finally got to see each other. I didn't feel the same though. This time, I felt numb and resentful and hurt. I called him telling him this and he took full responsibility and apologized for putting me through that. He honestly responded very well and really listened which was so huge. 

But I just. I still feel numb. I'm confused and lost and I don't have that yearning for him that I once did. I told him that we'll just see where this goes but...is this normal? I once felt so so strongly for him and those feelings are gone. I want them back.

Can you give me any advice? Maybe I need a dose of reality or something."

I am a college student from Boston who will be moving to the New Haven area for my internship January to June. I was wondering if anyone on here has a place or knows of people or websites to look at. I would have a car so I'm open in terms of area, but would prefer downtown if possible so I could explore on foot. I'm looking for a private room, would prefer college age roommates, but could also do a studio. My max budget would be 1200. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not from the area so I've tried doing some quick apartment and craigslist searches, but am unsure of which ones are reputable or what some red flags would be. If anyone has any tips on first time renting, signs I should look out for, etc. please let me know. I am only staying 6 months so it would have to be a short term lease or sublet.

&amp;#x200B;

If worst comes to worst I might just live at home in Boston. It looks like roughly 2 hour commute, has anyone done this? I wouldn't mind as I was willing to drive 2 hours in traffic for an internship 35 miles from my house in Mass."
dt2tqy,1,2019-11-07,Just some thoughts from somebody who's been on this subreddit for 7 years since I was 16 and just graduated with an offer,cscqsim_repostbot,CSCQSimulator,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSCQSimulator/comments/dt2tqy/just_some_thoughts_from_somebody_whos_been_on/,"Just bored and thought I'd journal about my experience. I feel like my perspective is pretty relatable since 90% of this subreddit is/was kids just like me. 

I'm a first generation student from a single income household. My dad makes 20K USD, right under the poverty line. At 16, I googled the most lucrative projected career options in 2019 (the year I would graduate college). I weighed my options between computer science and med school, and quickly realized CS was my ticket out. Then I found this subreddit and consumed as much information as I could. Took my first computer science class around then.

I luckily had just enough grades to slip into a large target school. All the school really did was give my resume some brand recognition. I then basically dedicated the first three years of college to the grind. That meant going to hackathons, landing first place wins, endless side projects, and more networking than I can remember. I was in a long term relationship that I ruined because of the incredible amount of stress. It's hard to remember a moment that I didn't dedicate to the grind. 

My first internship was at a company that I'm pretty sure laundered grant money by hiring 2-5 interns and a team of offshore devs to build garbage products nobody used. $12/h, in a buttfuck nowhere town, and having to bus 2 hours each way in freezing weather because I couldn't afford rent nearby. 

My second one was at a new startup that was getting some local press. I reached out directly to them and pushed for them to take me on as an intern. I leveraged this internship to start interviewing with larger companies. Around this time last year I had spent a solid two months of staying in my room everyday and doing 6-12 hours of leetcode and doing 30 interviews.

This year I completed two back to back Big  internships. I also started focusing on myself a lot more this year (fitness, relationships, hobbies).

I just received a return offer of 180K TC in the Bay. I'm going to use my signing bonus to pay off my family's mortgage and send my parents on their first vacation in 25 years before building my nest egg.

It's been a wild ride, but it doesn't stop here. I've networked extensively during my internships and the impression I get is that depending on how you navigate your career here in the Bay, you can nearly double your TC every 2-4 years. Assuming I don't burn out, that is most likely my goal.

Here is what I would take away from my experience:

- The advice works. The hackathons, projects, resume building, leetcode grinding, networking, it works. The problem is that you have to actually go out and do it all
- Don't get lost in the noise and spend too much time on this subreddit or waste time talking career. I always used this subreddit to gather data points and requirements for my goals and then quickly avoided it. I feel like the echo chamber here (which I'm probably contributing to) isn't good for anybody's psyche
- Networking and volume is incredibly important. It is how I put myself in a position to showcase my abilities, and without it, I don't think I would have had any success. I would have started this earlier if I knew how important it was
- I never received offers from interviews I had my best technical performance in. My best offers were from interviews where my communication skills were on point 
- I personally feel like passion about computer science isn't important. Drive is. My passion is making money to buy myself nice things and be financially secure, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that as long as I am consistently good at my job 
- If I could, I would do it all again. I sacrificed a lot but knowing I've secured a successful financial future for myself and my family is priceless
- The importance of mental health really can't be understated. I've had friends and colleagues burn out and drive themselves insane trying to catch a break. I never felt burnout, but I'm sure I've been impacted in some way, which is why I've started seeing a therapist. I often find myself staring at a wall and feeling 'empty' these days

Now, I can understand that the procedure is hard and I'm also very sad, really she told me, if she cannot come and study in France, she will give up everything, university, love, ... I am worry about her mental health.

I told her, I'll. come to Vietnam, she don't want, I'll marry her and she will have visa, she disagree, she told me, she don't want I waste my life come in Vietnam, I don't want I waste my life for her.

I support her and will always, but as I can see, she gave up on me, I hope that with time she will fell better, I'm so far and cannot be here for her...

Hi there, I am Michael 26 from London England. My kik is mjd931

For the longest time I have loved the idea of office sex, I love the idea of professionally dressed woman acting like sluts, being bent over tables or under tables for their bosses. Here are some ideas for an office based roleplay. Enjoy.

1. **Assistant Affair:** You'll play as my assistant and I will have bought my wife something sexy or expensive jewelry, you are so jealous you decide to slide it on and seduce me with it in my marital bed, or in the stationary cupboard. 
2. **Stationary Boy:** I will play the young 18 year old intern whose job it is to get stationary for people, so maybe your character could slide into 'my office' and we could have some fun, or maybe there is a hole leading into the toilet where I was able to slide my cock into.
3. **Glory Hole:** There is unisex toilets in out office and I am made to slide my cock through one in the stall
4. **Distract the boss:** I am the CEO of the company and I am about to come and meet your boss for an important document, which isn't ready, you decide to distract me the best way you know how
5. **IT Guy:** (MY fave): I am the nerdy IT guy who comes and fixers your computer, I am under your desk while you're away and you come back and sit down with no time for me to get away
6. **Caught Watching Porn:** You're my boss and you catch me watching porn, maybe I am taken for a disciplinary meeting
7. **Delivery Guy/Cleaner:** I am a delivery guy or cleaner who is there late at night and I find out it's all a front for a sex line and that's how they are making their money, there is only one way they're keeping me quiet."

I rested my wrist back then which made the problems somewhat better. It went from an 8/10 problem to a 6/10 problem.

Then I worked as an intern for 2 months in a company. The bad ergonomics they had there and my lack of knowledge about this topic caused the problem to go back to 8/10 problem.

So today I got my MRT results which indicate that I have partial lesion in the diskus on the Ulna side (which means 'partially torn tissue' in my wrist, on the side where the pinkie is) in my right wrist and probably left aswell since I have very similar symptoms in both wrists. 

Also I got some small Bone cysts and some liquid which is probably caused by the lesion.

What are my options now? The Doctor which made the MRT strongly hinted at a surgery option. I will talk tomorrow to my private doctor. Anyone any experience with this?  


Problem is I just started a new, great desk job. Am I supposed to quit it now ? Is conservative therapy even an option at this point?"

I dropped out of school at 16 and I’ve spent the last 4 years living with my mom and doing nothing every day, basically just sitting around watching TV or YouTube or scrolling through social media for hours. I have no real friends, I haven’t seen anyone from school in over a year now and we barely talk anymore, I have some online friends but I think they only keep talking to me out of pity. I’ve never been in a relationship with anyone either. I think I’m literally unlovable, I have no personality and nothing to offer anybody and I’m ugly as hell so there’s literally no reason for anyone to put in the effort to get past how weird and awkward I am to talk to me. All I’ve ever wanted in my life is someone to really genuinely love me but now I understand I’ll never have that. I’m not funny or interesting, I have no talents, and I’m just a freak. I can’t even truly care about other people anyways, even when I find someone I really want to care about it’s like I just can’t.

As far as what I want to do in my life. I want to go to art school but I probably will never be brave enough to apply to any because I know I won’t get in. My art is horrible and I’m too embarrassed to even show the “good” ones to my family much less post them online. Even if I could somehow get into a school I don’t think I could cope with other people seeing my art everyday and probably pitying my for how bad I am. I do truly love art and I love drawing but I’m just not good at it. I can’t improve anymore for some reason, I think I just don’t care enough since I have no motivation and nothing to work towards. I’ve also considered studying marine biology or some other science but I’m honestly not smart enough. I used to get the best grades in my class when I was younger but at some point I just burned out or something and now I can barely even comprehend what I’m reading, and I’ve forgotten almost everything I had learned. I don’t know what happened. 

I can’t even bring myself to apply for jobs anymore, I know I won’t be able to handle it and quit after like a week. I’ve only had one job and it was an internship I got out of pity because someone in my family worked there. It’s been over a year since then and I’ve only applied to 2 jobs and I was rejected by both. I’m so worthless I can’t even get hired as a cashier at a grocery store. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like I’ve tried everything to try and make myself get a job or apply to schools, work on my art and make friends and none of it has worked. I even started going to therapy months ago but it hasn’t really helped because it’s impossible for me to open up even to a therapist. I’m supposed to go to a psych and get medication but I’m too scared of the possible side effects to take any medications. I already tried medication years ago and it only made it worse anyways. I have nothing to live for but at the same time I don’t want to die because I feel like there isn’t anything after death, everything is in this world and once you die you will just disappear. And there are so many things I want to do. Right now I think I would be okay with dying if I had just one person that truly loved me, and worst fear is that I’m going to die without ever experienced that, having accomplished nothing in my life and no one besides my family will even notice or care that I’m gone. But at the same time I don’t think I’m ever gonna be able to change and maybe I’m just dragging out my suffering. Maybe it would be better to just die"
dt4avf,4,2019-11-07,Looking for gainful work/guidance/mentor,UnreasonableCabron,houstonjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/houstonjobs/comments/dt4avf/looking_for_gainful_workguidancementor/," 

So I've been feeling stuck. I have always had a job since I was 17 and in my professional life, I only made decisions based on my career. (I.E.) Delaying gratification, work before partying, even work before my relationships. I don't want to go on too long but this hasn't really worked out for me.

In 2016, after some time off from school while starting my own business, I graduated from college with a degree in Corporate Communication. I realized from small business ownership, I loved everything within that field. I enjoyed Advertising, Public Relations, Marketing but I had absolutely no idea where to begin, so I remained at my restaurant management job for a total of 6 years! I was making ok money for a student/bachelor and had hoped to move into a corporate role with the company but was denied more than 3 times over the years so I got serious about looking elsewhere.

I managed to find a position with another food service company that was technically sales. I wasn't super excited about it, but it gave me the opportunity to work a pursue other career goals. I left my restaurant job and a month later started with the new company. After only a week training with them, I was informed the position was no longer needed. I had some money put away and decided to take this time to seek out a job that I would be happy to work with for my entire career.

Its been about a month and a half of surfing the web, updating my resume weekly and sending it out to every avenue. Craigslist, Indeed, Glassdoor, and about 4 agencies in the city. I've gone on about 5 interviews that all turned out to be Multi Level Marketing, door-to-door flyers and the like but other than that, I'm not getting many (if any) calls back or interviews.

\*TLDR\*

Im here asking what route should I take career wise with the degree and interests that I have? I dont think college prepared me for this post student life and I have done the best I can on my own but its not enough. I want to continue to learn and grow. I have a Bachelors degree and 6 years management experience but nobody seems to be hiring, even with those skills. I have also always had the idea that i needed a mentor but sadly, no one I felt would fit my needs appeared in my life, I wouldn't even know how to ask someone to be my mentor. At this point im willing to accept an internship or a job in my field for moderately low pay just to get the guidance I needed. If anyone in the HOUSTON area is in need, i'd be willing to work for the experience im looking for! Im all ears.

I’ve just earned my brown belt in Aikido – a goal I’d been working to accomplish for about four years.  Still, I feel like a novice. Aikido is a difficult martial art to master. It’s taken me a long time to feel like I can do a few things properly. Obviously, I know more than someone who walks in the dojo door for the very first time, but compared to the masters I know the slightest fraction.

I’m working on being a good student though.  Probably the most important thing a good student can do is find a good teacher – and I’ve been blessed to find a great one. 

**Step One: Find a Great Teacher**

Before I met my current teacher I was with another dojo for about six months. I had a good experience there and I would still go back to practice once in a while if it were convenient. But the dojo where I practice now offers classes during the week day and is only a few miles from my studio. That’s why I joined - but it’s not the reason I stay.  My teacher is the reason I stay.

Let me give you some background. Before I started training in Martial Arts, I had been in exactly one fight. It was in eighth grade. It was petty and meant nothing.  Nobody won – we just stopped and walked away. I trained in Karate in middle school and sparred with a few people in competition but I have very little fighting experience. I didn’t grow up on the streets and when I was once threatened with violence in my studio I nearly shit my pants. 

I won’t go into the details here but a tenant of mine was trying to extort money and his main weapon was threatening me with physical violence. At one point he cornered me in the lobby of my studio and I thought he would strike me. I cowered like a little baby, agreed to his terms and he backed down. Once he left I got a restraining order and started the eviction process.

That same summer I had another incident when camping in northern Wisconsin.  A group of people decided it would be funny if they shot bottle rockets at our tents while we were sleeping. I never got out of my tent to confront them - I just waited for it to pass. After that experience I decided to do something about the feeling of helplessness inside**.** A few people I respect greatly said “try Aikido.” 

So that fall I started my journey with Aikido. It’s a controversial martial art. Some people say it would never work on the street. Others say it’s just dancing and has very little effectiveness. At some point it became really popular with the hippie crowd. It’s also sometimes referred to as “the Art of Peace” or the “Way of Harmony.” There is no doubt it’s a beautiful, graceful martial art. 

Aikido is popular with people who think violence should be the absolute last resort. Many dojos don’t even teach true martial effectiveness. Some Aikido masters argue it is such a hard art to master that very few people truly understand it fully. 

The controversy over the effectiveness of Aikido is not really important to this blog. I guess my point is I landed in the right place. My Sensei doesn’t care about Aikido politics.  He loves the art but he also wants his students to have useful skills in the real world. So he teaches skills, whether they are true Aikido or not. Aikido is just a set of principles. If those principles are present in a technique, then any technique, from any art can be Aikido. 

When I was looking for a way to feel less helpless in this sometimes violent world, he was exactly the right teacher for me.

Find the right teacher for you. There are charlatans in every field. It can be hard to decipher the con men from the genuine teachers. ***Being a good student means being honest with yourself. Ask yourself - are you learning what you need to be effective in your field?***

Then, once you’re secure in your choice of a teacher, you need to be willing to submit. 

**Step Two: Submit**

Now that you trust your teacher, let them guide you.  I am not an Aikido instructor.  I have been running a music studio for the past twenty years. That’s my area of expertise and I’ve had the opportunity to mentor a few people in that time. 

Mentoring can be difficult and I can’t really say I’ve had any true success doing it. People like to make their own mistakes.  Perhaps I’ve been too harsh with my protégés. I once had a young intern who decided to bring in an experienced singer who’d already worked with big names in Los Angeles.  She wanted to land this artist as a client of her own. Unfortunately she barely knew how to turn on the gear, much less run it. She had no business using my studio to impress. She made a fool of herself and worse, made my studio look amateur. I told her she needed to research her potential clients before they came into the studio and clear everything with me. What really pissed her off was I told her that she wasn’t even close to being ready to handling a client like the one she brought into the studio. *I said she was years away from being able to engineer for a client like that and would probably never get there.*  I feel bad about that now. 

I just wanted her to slow down and come back to reality. I appreciated her ambition but she needed to focus on her technical skills first before trying to land such a big fish. I guess I must have said some harsh words because she stopped coming by the studio after that. 

I still believe she might have had a chance if she listened to me. Instead, she sulked away feeling sorry for herself. I don’t know what she’s doing now, but I doubt it has anything to do with sound engineering. The sound engineering field is highly competitive. If you don’t have a thick skin and a willingness to take harsh criticism, you’re never going to make it. 

As a student, it’s important to remember your teacher only wants the best for you. They are there to hand out life lessons before they get handed out in the real world. In martial arts training, teaching those life lessons can literally be life or death. The martial arts instructor has a responsibility to give you skills in the dojo to protect you and your family on the street. If your marital arts instructor fails to prepare you with real self-defense techniques that will work in a high pressure, volatile and violent scenario, that teacher is failing. 

Sure, there is sometimes pain in the dojo. A bleeding nose, some bruises, aches and pains.   But I believe when someone threatens the safety of my loved ones, I will be able to have a real impact on that situation, possibly a lifesaving one. 

On the job training is the same. An internship is supposed to give you real world experiences so you know what to expect when you have a job which affects the bottom line of the company. 

My “harsh” conversation with my young female intern may save another employer from a lot of heartache. Or she may never work in the field again because of what I said to her. But if she uses that conversation as an excuse to never engineer sound again, that’s on her. I’m no David Geffen, but I know if she ever works for someone of that caliber, she might thank me for how kind I was during her internship. When people like Geffen have millions of dollars on the line, they don’t beat around the bush. People get fired for not having the coffee at the right temperature. 

To summarize: do your research and find a teacher with integrity, the skills you want to possess and the ability to teach you those skills. Next, allow them to teach you. Leave your skepticism at the door. Eventually you may find holes in their skills or realize their methods aren’t infallible. Nobody is perfect.  But, in the beginning, you have to be willing to trust them and do things their way. If they are a good teacher they will allow you to develop your own style as part of the journey. 

Submission is hard, especially when you hear stories of teachers misusing their powers. Yes, that threat is real but a noble teacher will never cross the line. Find the right teacher.  When you do, let them into your being. Embody their teachings and enjoy the ride.

""Congratulations! We'd like to extend you an offer for the AMWF summer internship program! Please find your offer letter attached. Reply to this email with your start date and end date and please fill out the relocation form!""

You were ecstatic when you got that email. AMWF was one of the leading technology companies in the cloud computing space. Their position in their space, coupled with their San Francisco high rise office, insane perks (massage room, library) and high pay made their internship program one of the most competitive in the world. And you got in.
______

You got out of the elevator to the 50th floor office of AMWF, ready for your first day. You headed to the receptionist, a pretty blonde lady wearing a tight, revealing dress, and told you who you were.

""Ah, yes! One of the interns!"" she exclaimed, handing you a guest pass and instructing you to head to a meeting room called Cybertron, where your mentor would be meeting you shortly.

On the way, you noticed a few things. One, the office seemed to be composed of two distinct types of people, tall, fit, handsome Asian men and white women dressed in revealing clothes. You wondered who your mentor would be as you sat inside Cybertron, a meeting room with an expansive view of the city's financial district.

A few minutes later, a [pale, blonde woman walked in, clutching a laptop and a coffee cup. She was dressed in a tight skirt, heels, and a black crop top. She looked more like a whore than a professional.](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg) 

""Hi! You must be *your name*!"" she beamed, sitting down next to you at the conference table. 

""I'm Rosie, and I'm going to be your mentor here at AMWF, "" she opened her laptop, typing away for a few seconds before turning her attention to you.

""Since you're my intern, it's my job to make sure you're getting all the support and help you need, "" she giggles, scooching a bit closer to you. You notice she's booked two hours for this meeting room.

""So, first things first, which one of my holes do you want me to service you with first, *daddy*?"" she purred.

_____

Hi! I'm Rosie and I kind of look like [this](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg). I'm looking to play your mentor/cum dump during your internship at AMWF. I like dirty talk, name calling, raceplay (Asian dominance &lt;3), big cocks, lots of cum, impregnation, and cheating.

DM me your name, description and continuation (no dick pics and be aggressive!) and expect to write around 3+ paragraphs per response."

dt81ru,5,2019-11-07,what's a fun character concept you've had?,CDeats,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/dt81ru/whats_a_fun_character_concept_youve_had/,"what's a character, in race, class, backstory, and personality that you've enjoyed making and/or playing? honestly character creation is my favorite part, and just figuring out the character is fun.

personally, two of my characters come to mind, one because their backstory is a well for narrative hooks and fun character interactions, the other because it's just so funny on the surface, but still has depth.

one, human, ranger/fighter multiclass. grew up in the woods with his brother and father, and his dad traded with a lot of different people, dwarves, elves, humans, even a very odd community of giants, all sorts of people, but always lived isolated for some reason, then, around when he was 10-11 years old, a harsh winter hit, dad died, brother disappeared, and he was left on his own to fend for himself. when winter finally broke he was alone, and come spring when the giants came to trade they found this kid alone, and took pity on him, and took him to their home, and the leading couple adopted him essentially, as their only son (the two had a comically excessive number of daughters, 10 to be specific) and he learned the language and culture, which this group of giants was interesting, all were outcasts from their own clans of the other races of giant, mostly frost and hill, with a few stone, and one fire giant, who had initially sort of reluctantly come together for survival's sake but had formed a tight and communal bond over the years, with the second generation of the community being heavily hybrids of the various races, including my character's siblings, who are part Frost and part Stone giant. this puts the community on pretty much every other giant community's hit list, as living in such a way, is essentially sacrilegious to them. the character I play, is a key member of the community because he's human, and as such is able to reach out to communities of other races without presenting the terrifying scenario of a giant approaching someone's town or farmstead from the mountains or forest. he can ease others into forming trade and other bonds with the giant community. he comes with a lot of fun personality traits, since he's lawful good, but he is following giant law, which is a bit more combative at times. he also has a habit of speaking in giant to threaten small races like halflings or gnomes when he comes up against them, to really scare them. he also is not off put by the party's goliath's size, and actually called him small at one point. he is also, however wise and skilled in his trades, having had the advantage of being raised by giants, who are wise beings in this world, and despite being young for our party is shockingly insightful. he however is still impulsive, as giant culture in this world encourages definitive action over riding the fence, and this has lead to him causing conflict and making bad deals, as a recent deal with a evil magic skeleton cost him memories of his human and giant mother when he didn't choose his words carefully. he does also have a few prejudices, disliking elves quite a bit for the snobbish and dismissive attitude they displayed towards his human father and giant family, and definitely disliking trolls and not thinking there's much to them, considering them simple creatures. he also has the awkward habit of stating ""eaten one of those."" in reference to beings like Kobolds or Kenku or other beast races like Gnolls and stuff, since giants eat them and other ""smallfolk"" and don't see a problem with it, and my character has eaten many of the ""smallfolk"" races, basically anyone smaller than giants is under that category to him, except his giant community made sure not to feed him human, as they recognize the ethical wrong there. like he doesn't see a problem with different species eating each other and has joked with our party's kenku ""how would you like to be cooked if you die?"" and ""if I get killed, I recommend slow cooking me over a fire for the best flavor."" to the rest of the party, to their shock. he has had to grow on the others, as they get to know him. he's become good friends with the barbarian Goliath due to some common philosophies and shared bond after some rough fights as we were for a long time our party's main fighters. he's bonded with our warforged cleric by trying to help him find himself, figure out who he is without a purpose being given to him without choice, and he's even helped him discover a fondness for hats. the Kenku bard has sort of realized that eating jokes are jokes, and he wouldn't eat her if she died, and that the guy really has her  back, making a shortsword for her when realizing she was not armed enough and was in more danger in combat. and he and the party Tiefling rogue/warlock have come to the understanding that they might not see eye to eye, but the party needs both of them. he's honestly very fun for character interaction and gameplay is fun as he has his black bear companion, who's fun in combat but really more of a companion for friendship. and his charisma score is not great so he's great for comedic failure in charming or smooth talking his way out of situations. 

&amp;#x200B;

the other character is still only a concept, but is great, a halfling monk, the way of the drunken master to be specific. essentially raised at a orphanage by this dragonborn monk who protected these orphans of all races, he trained them all so they could protect themselves and the younger kids, as orphans were regularly brought from surrounding towns and villages to this place for care. he leaves the orphanage to attempt to find other halflings to try to see if he can form a life among his own people, since he was given up as a baby and never actually got to experience his own culture, and only speaks and reads halfling because the monk who raised him made sure he at least knew his people's language, in fact teaching himself halfling to be able to intern teach the boy the language. he's a sort of goofy mess of a guy, who's really deeply insecure and has this desire to be wanted and loved, so everywhere he goes he tells stories to entertain people and make them happy, and he helps people when he can, but deep down he's kinda sad and lonely. I'm sort of ready if my current guy dies to bring this character in, because he's so different as a person deep down. he's brave and noble, but he's also lonely an insecure, which often could lead to him making selfish decisions despite his moral alignment. 

&amp;#x200B;

enough about these guys, what about your characters? any that you've made that you are just really proud of or happy with how they came out?"
dt8dwu,5,2019-11-07,I don't know what to do with my life,Mandalore64,PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/dt8dwu/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"I apologize if this is ranty and disorganized.  I am just kind of writing as it comes to me while I have some motivation.

I just graduated with a BS in physics this past May.  I have struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my life.  By about year 2 I was pretty much burnt out.  I was hyper-motivated throughout high school, and got into an honors program at my university.  But after that I could sort of feel myself beginning to crash.  At the end of the honors program, you have to do a research thesis or creative project and defend it.  

I did not approach a faculty member until the end of my 2nd year and actually started working odd jobs in my advisor's lab at the end of my 3rd while he found a long-term project for me, putting me behind where I should have been.  Between a busy advisor and my complete lack of motivation, I decided to drop the project and the chance of graduating from the honors program.  

As for the rest of my major coursework, we often had mediocre faculty with the occasional pretty good professor.  The courses, to me, felt like they prioritized getting you through the class regardless of whether you actually understood the material or not.  All of this mixed with the depression made me feel like I was barely scraping by.  By the last half of my degree, I had a very hard time even going to class.  That's my fault, not the professors', but combined with everything else I come away feeling like I haven't learned nearly as much as I should have over 4 years.  As such I feel woefully unprepared for graduate school and any work related to my degree.

I still live at home, and my parents of course want me to do something with my life.  Whether that's finding a job or trying to go back to school is for me to decide, and I currently am tentatively pursuing grad school.  I took the summer off to try to recuperate and hopefully regain some of my enjoyment that I once had.  This caused me to miss the signup deadline for the PGRE that was a couple of weeks ago.  Seeing as the next one is not until April, I will miss the application deadline for fall 2020 at the school I'm currently looking at, which is the same place I did my undergrad.  I'm looking at this school because it's close to home so I can still have the support network of my friends and family.

In the off time that I have until fall 2021 (the earliest I'd be able to get in if I'm accepted) I want to try to find an internship or something to build my resume, relationships with faculty/professionals, and hopefully determine if there are some things that really do/don't interest me so I can go into grad school with a better idea of what I want to research.  But as I said above, I do not feel nearly as prepared as the qualifications at a lot of the places I've looked at would imply.  I don't know how to code.  Circuitry was one of the hardest topics for me.  I currently am still having a lot of trouble being motivated, let alone ""highly motivated.""  I have practically no real experience in a lab setting as I never really did more than randoms jobs for the PI I was working with before I had to quit, and the lab classes were always very poorly taught during undergrad.

My window for options keeps getting smaller and smaller, but I still feel like I'm barely treading water.  I would love to hear any advice or criticisms or anecdotes that you feel would be helpful.  I just don't know what the hell I should do.  

Sorry again for how long this was and how disorganized it might be.  I am happy to answer questions or clarify things if needed.  Thanks for reading"
dt8g3y,16,2019-11-07,AITB for feeling irritated with the new girl?,_maru_maru,AmItheButtface,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/dt8g3y/aitb_for_feeling_irritated_with_the_new_girl/,"Basically I'm changing departments in a months time, and I'm training my replacement. She started this week on Monday. She did her internship here, and while comments were that she did things pretty slow, I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. 

Apparently, I'm holding her hand too much, teaching her way too detailedly, that my senior had to step in and tell me to let her learn on her own. 

Anyway, as soon as I let go of her hand, she literally starts to forget everything I told her. Things I told her 2 seconds ago, and I start to get irritated. You can hear it in my voice and feel the emotions seeping out of my body.  

Funny thing is, she's been writing it all down, and saying she understands. 

I was left on my own to learn the ropes myself and it was hard, so that's why I'm teaching her so closely. The part that irked me the most was I was making conversation with her, and since we're from the same University, I asked what was her CGPA. She completely ignored me like I didn't exist, and then asked me questions to change topic. I also asked her CGPA to gauge how much time I should spend teaching her, even though it's not a set standard for how well people work.
(I was asked this question too by other seniors and colleagues.)

So I repeated the question, again she ignored me. I felt hurt cuz I was scolded by my boss for teaching her too much, and she won't even share this information with me. While I understand it's confidential, I thought that as her senior/mentor at work that I might be allowed this information. In the end she vaguely told me because she sensed I was annoyed, I mentioned that her results were much better than mine to seem less annoyed. 
 
But now that I'm irritated with that incident, and her CONSTANTLY forgetting things I tell her, I reply curtly to her whenever she asks me things. 

I feel like the buttface. I'll willingly accept my judgement. Thanks!"

I’ve been trying to work on my own skills and I wasn’t really sure where to start. So I had the idea of creating a small group to begin working on projects together for example we can run through malwareunicorn.org and hone skills. Anyone interested in working with me to dive deeper and learn more in the field of Cyber Security? I have one other person who is interested. We could meet up online and communicate VIA a slack channel and discord meeting a couple times a week. If anyone is interested or has other ideas to get better with malware analysis , network fundamentals, etc that would be great too!"
dt9ndz,136,2019-11-07,NF rainbow fade. ~3 years. Unknown washes,WoodenCyborg,rawdenim,https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/dt9ndz/nf_rainbow_fade_3_years_unknown_washes/,"[Current state]( https://imgur.com/a/kega7lL)

Repairs include, machine darning, hand darning, sashiko, gusseting and replacing seams.

Overview-Naked and famous denim 2016 weird guy fit. 100% cotton 14oz selvedge sanforized denim with warp yarns that are reactive died in 5 different colors prior to rope dyeing in indigo. White weft. Dark navy stitching. Selvedge pocket detail.

Impression- I love these jeans. I have no intention of retiring them anytime soon.

History. (Pictures incomplete)- This pair was my first grail. I had a pair UB101s when these were initially released. The only fade examples at that time were red cores, so the rainbow pattern was a complete mystery.  The concept alone was to awesome to pass up. I wasn't very confident in measurements at the time, so I drove an hour and half to try on a pair of weird guys in a different fabric to get the fit right. I had also never spent over $100 dollars on a pair of jeans so stalked them carefully until they went on sale enough for me to justify it to myself. I finally picked them up from tate and yoko when the price dropped closer to $100. I think I got the last pair in my size.

I loved them from the begining. They started out as a dark indgo with non-contrasting stitching. The only loud part of jeans was the red patch. There was a really subtle tint if you looked closely under very bright light. The only place you could reaaly see the core color was the raw edges inside the pockets.

The first time I noticed the rainbow on the surface of the denim was a month or into wearing. I was walking early in the morning and the sun shined across the surface showing just a little color. I probably looked weird standing on the side walk starring excitedly at my thighs turning back and fourth slightly. 

The first repair was premature and 100% my own fault. I decided to keep my 7+ keys in my back left pocket. The whole time I was constantly sliding on and off a stool with a less than perfect edges while at work. I cant find post repair pictures, but these show the damage after I cut the broken theads from the larger hole. [Damage](https://imgur.com/a/0CEFqlN) pics.

From there out the rainbow slowly became less subtle. Heres an image from around 8 months. Note the 2"" double cuff. Maybe 2 washes. [8 months](https://imgur.com/Wkjr42m.jpg) I really enjoyed this phase of wear. The fading was subtle enough that they looked like normal jeans until you took a second look. It was a very reasonable amount of absurdity. 

I stopped wearing them often at about a year in do to damage and dress code at an internship. After a few months of missing them, i was inspired to get a sewing machine and start darning. A little practicing and i had jeans back to continue destroying them. 

At the begining of 2018, I started squating heavy and the the thighs became too tight to wear comfortably. I wasn't able wear them for a few months. With a little insperation from pedestrian denim's gusseting post I decided to fix the issue. I prototyped the crotch gusset on my old ub101s since they where already chopped in jorts. [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/KBbdCOH.jpg) It helped with leg spreading but did nothing for hip width. I came up with a hip gusset to accomodate. I hemmed off the large cuff for gusset material. I patterned it out with white demin making sure to contain the pattern to the avialable material. [Pattern](https://imgur.com/a/MJQP0zE) The fit is kinda weird now since the top block relaxes from a short rise and there's an agressive taper on the lower third of the thigh right above the knee. Maybe the fit is jodhpur guy now?

The next major repairs are from a trip to bell rock in Sedona. They suffered a major crotch blowout and a sanded away wallet pocket. [Before](https://imgur.com/a/KvedfDb) [After](https://i.imgur.com/h7RZZ3S.jpg) The view was pretty neat though. [View](https://i.imgur.com/qbQxb3a.jpg)

The cycle continues. Im pondering a pocket bag replacment and a crotch gusset next.

When I initially applied for the internship I applied for the Orlando office because I live there and attended school there as well. They told me that the Orlando office was too full but they would be able to offer me an internship in the Fort Lauderdale office. I took it but let them know that if I do get an offer I would like to work in Orlando, they told me it wouldn't be a problem. At the end of the internship I was given an offer but they told me that they wouldn't be able to place me in the Orlando office because they don't need any additional staff. I have checked in multiple times since then to see if there have been any changes but unfortunately there hasn't been so I will be moving to Fort Lauderdale in January. My question is if I already signed my offer, would I still be able to negotiate some type of relocation assistance for my move? Is it something that had to be put in my offer letter or is it something they offer if you ask? Also should I try asking again if the Orlando office has any space to take me, I don't want to seem too pushy with the recruiter."

So I believe I originally saw this clip on Youtube about 3-5 years ago. 

I thought it was a Whitest Kids You Know sketch, but it might just be some other sketch comedy group.

The premise of the sketch is that Hillary has become president and, to exact revenge on her philandering husband, forces him to watch? or just be aware that she is going to fool around with an intern or something. 

Honestly it could be way more recent and be related to her recent campaign, but as I remember it, it was much more dated and before her more serious presidential campaign in 2016, or even 2008 (though it very possibly could have been inspired by either of those runs).

The most memorable thing for me is that she says something about getting sucked which stuck with me as she does not have a penis. Some form of “my turn to get/be sucked!” 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, this has really been bothering me. TIA."

dtdc7l,3,2019-11-08,"How screwed am I? Is it salvageable? (Long read but if you can respond in any way, it would mean a lot)",Gmoneyyy3,Friendzone,https://www.reddit.com/r/Friendzone/comments/dtdc7l/how_screwed_am_i_is_it_salvageable_long_read_but/,"I can 100% confirm the feelings are there now. Strange how it's been about 8 months to get this level of confirmation, but there's no denying it.

So we're both in college, I'm (19 about to be 20 in 4 days) a junior at a University while she's (19) still in a Community College (CC) where I've been working at the community's college's financial aid office for soon to be 3 years in a couple of months, while she got hired 8 months ago. She's attractive, no denying that, but, ofc like anyone else I wanted to know her better. Instantly I would find out how similar we are in SOOOO many different ways I sometimes can think of her as almost like a twin of mine. We became good friends VERY quickly.

One BIG sign though was when one day while at work (only been coworkers for about 3 weeks at this point), she told me she's had a lot of guy friends who would develop feelings for her and the friendships were never the same after she'd turn them down. This is going to stay important, as for someone who doesn't have many friends outside of my main guy friends (I'm a bit of an introvert, and I'm a bit picky with friendships I make) I have tried my best to have little/no feelings shown and have stayed good friends with her, but that may have been the part that screwed me over right there, because I let her know that.

There's been other bad signs over the past half a year too. She's told me about all these guys that she somewhat gets a crush on but not actual feelings for, which nothing actually comes from it and she doesn't know if she can find ""the one"", and also the fact that she said multiple times that I'd find ""the one"" eventually (after my ex I haven't gotten anywhere NEAR the attention that she has, nor have I looked for it in other girls, I tend to notice flaws or things I wouldn't like about them right away, either that or I'm SUPER picky, but in my defense, there's reasons why I have to be)

Anyway, fast-forward to today, after multiple times we've hung out after work, shared good conversations, listen to the music we like in our cars, etc., I can't deny the feelings. Thing is, I don't see many (if any) signs that she has any for me (either she really hasn't given me any because she's not interested, or she has and I'm clueless to them, either one I can believe). Our friendship has gotten to the point where we have each others back ""to the grave"" sort to speak but there's not much that shows too much hope for a relationship. 

This goes into the main problem. We want what's best for each other, and she's even said our friendship may have to end when I eventually get a gf (funny enough she didn't mention it would end if she got a bf, cuz she'd want to still keep her guy friends) out of sheer respect for my future gf. But here's the thing, I don't see a future gf that's not her. It's not just even that my feelings are too strong that I have to confess to only her, it's more the fact she'd be willing to end a friendship, which actually means more to me than a relationship with her because I don't have many friends who I can share so much with and who can actually relate and listen. Meanwhile, if she gets into a relationship first, it'd still be a major blow to our friendship, because we wouldn't be able to talk as much outside of work due to my respect for her relationship, and I'd get HELLA lonely.

And for those few friends I've told this to and have told me to just go for broke, the fact that she's said she has had friendships (and even a relationship) killed because the guy couldn't hold back his feelings but she didn't have the same feelings, I couldn't bear that happening, not when I don't have anything to go back to. 

So that's where I'm stuck. Luckily for the sake of not getting fired I wouldn't dare risk anything soon, as I have 6 months left on my contract with my office until I prob get an internship somewhere for my career. But my feelings are there. We both think the other will have a relationship before ourself, due to the fact we are super picky (in the same type of people that we happen to be). But tbh other than actually getting lucky and dating her eventually (only true winning option I can think of) or me finding a future girlfriend thats not her first (which yes I can make the most of but it's not only selfish on my part thinking this could happen but also the fact if it does I will lose a good friendship), I feel as if I'm in a really bad situation."
dtdcej,2,2019-11-08,Most weird dream,1664STOIC,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dtdcej/most_weird_dream/,"Most weird dream ever! Do dreams mean anything?



I just woke up on a normal day... but i had just lost my voice. I had a soft voice like i couldn’t speak at all, but it turned into a beautiful voice when i sang. In general, i could sing. I knew so many songs and now i was capable of singing. (Which in reality i suck at) 

After my brother has  told us what happened with his appointment , that his leg wasn’t getting any better(he broke his leg) , i don’t know why i had the feeling that he’s took my tooth, when i was sleeping. So i hurried  in my room... same time as they left where we were sitting outside, took a mirror and opened my mouth ! 


I can’t believe it! The worst thing and most unbelievable thing i have ever seen!! I had  like a million teeth in my mouth !!! LONG TEETH against each other like cigs  in  a cigarette pack.  . I looked like a monster. Teeth after teeth..I had four gums on one side and only on that side.  And on each gum there were teeth. To be more specific i had four layers of teeth where we’re supposed to have the wisdom tooth. On the other side i had so many teeth clogged together , but not the layers. It wasn’t even the same. This freaked me more. I’ve never seen something like it before. i trembled as i thought of it! Couldn’t be any worse.. The day before, i had nothing like  that and that day they’ve grown that much. It was all red full of blood. I tried to imagine my surgery. It will take days, or months to heal. I don’t have that time, there is school, my internship and everything. I can’t get sick now nor go to the hospital, that’s what i thought. But i cannot live with this another day too... what am i going to do. What if they keep growing? I already couldn’t recognise myself in the mirror, the girl i saw before opening my mouth looks nothing like the girl i am in real life. Her face, mouth,, everything. She had no hair(well cut it i suppose) like i hardly recognised myself but it didn’t scare me like my teeth. So i started crying and hurried out calling my mum. She was washing clothes. I run to her and buried  my face in her arms and kept crying, saying i can’t get sick cause i don’t have time to be sick, but that it’s worse than i imagined. She said come with me. We went in our second house, she dried her hands with her clothes and told me to open my mouth !! 

HOW DID SHE KNOW IT HAD TO DO WITH MY TEETH??? 

Yes it’s true this is the only disease I’ve always had in the past, but couldn’t she think of anything else? 

I obeyed, and i opened my mouth, tears still running on my face, i was afraid, trembling, imagining her reaction, feeling sad to be her daughter, like who would want a monster to be their daughter? Well think of the worst that what was going on in my head... then to my surprise my mum said.. 
« YOU HAVE IT TOO!! » She touched them with her finger. She seemed nothing like afraid nor surprised, like she knew what it was. Or less she was worried, very worried but tried her best not to show it off so she won’t worry me more? I couldn’t conclude anything out of her reaction. 

Before she could say anything else, or tell me it’s going to be alright like parents often say so... i woke  up. 


There in my bed, all alone, with my eyes open.. and for the hundredth time , i’m asking myself, DO DREAMS MEAN ANYTHING,  or it’s just our brain tripping !? 




Well, I still haven’t touched my teeth yet no matter how much i want to!"

""Ah, yes! One of the interns!"" she exclaimed, handing you a guest pass and instructing you to head to a meeting room called Cybertron, where your mentor would be meeting you shortly.

On the way, you noticed a few things. One, the office seemed to be composed of two distinct types of people, tall, fit, handsome Asian men and white women dressed in revealing clothes. You wondered who your mentor would be as you sat inside Cybertron, a meeting room with an expansive view of the city's financial district.

A few minutes later, a [pale, blonde woman walked in, clutching a laptop and a coffee cup. She was dressed in a tight skirt, heels, and a black crop top. She looked more like a whore than a professional.](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg) 

""Hi! You must be *your name*!"" she beamed, sitting down next to you at the conference table. 

""I'm Rosie, and I'm going to be your mentor here at AMWF, "" she opened her laptop, typing away for a few seconds before turning her attention to you.

""Since you're my intern, it's my job to make sure you're getting all the support and help you need, "" she giggles, scooching a bit closer to you. You notice she's booked two hours for this meeting room.

""So, first things first, which one of my holes do you want me to service you with first, *daddy*?"" she purred.

Hi! I'm Rosie and I kind of look like [this](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg). I'm looking to play your mentor/cum dump during your internship at AMWF. I like dirty talk, name calling, raceplay (Asian dominance &lt;3), big cocks, lots of cum, impregnation, and cheating.

DM me your name, description and continuation (no dick pics and be aggressive!) and expect to write around 3+ paragraphs per response."

I’m an undergraduate student currently towards the end of an 8 month industry placement.

I came into my current placement with a lot (7 years) of lab experience so my team pretty quickly started liking me and asking me to do things for them. It started out great until maybe a month or two ago I was simultaneously juggling 4-5 completely different projects. Let me add that my team, while lovely people, don’t always give the clearest of instructions.

As a result of that I’ve had a few screw ups. Nothing absolutely horrible but stupid enough to make me stop and facepalm. I always immediately fess up if I make a mistake but despite that it always weighs on me for a long time afterwards. For example at the moment I discovered an error I made maybe 3 weeks back, but the team member I was working with isn’t at work until next work. That error didn’t impact any critical data and I think the project isn’t even active anymore but it’s still been keeping me awake and on edge.

One of my other team members was with me when I discovered that mistake and quickly jumped in to remind me that it’s not a big deal, everyone makes those mistakes, not to be upset at myself. My direct supervisor just laughed his ass off when I explained the error (it really was a stupid but easy to make one).

My team has been incredible to me and have even helped me set up another internship at one of my dream labs. I feel like every mistake I make seems to prove their faith in me is misplaced. It’s getting to the point where working in the lab- something I love doing- is becoming emotionally draining because I’m so worried about messing up. 

How do you get over this?"

Hi there, I am Michael 26 from London England. My kik is mjd931

For the longest time I have loved the idea of office sex, I love the idea of professionally dressed woman acting like sluts, being bent over tables or under tables for their bosses. Here are some ideas for an office based roleplay. Enjoy.

1. **Assistant Affair:** You'll play as my assistant and I will have bought my wife something sexy or expensive jewelry, you are so jealous you decide to slide it on and seduce me with it in my marital bed, or in the stationary cupboard. 
2. **Stationary Boy:** I will play the young 18 year old intern whose job it is to get stationary for people, so maybe your character could slide into 'my office' and we could have some fun, or maybe there is a hole leading into the toilet where I was able to slide my cock into.
3. **Glory Hole:** There is unisex toilets in out office and I am made to slide my cock through one in the stall
4. **Distract the boss:** I am the CEO of the company and I am about to come and meet your boss for an important document, which isn't ready, you decide to distract me the best way you know how
5. **IT Guy:** (MY fave): I am the nerdy IT guy who comes and fixers your computer, I am under your desk while you're away and you come back and sit down with no time for me to get away
6. **Caught Watching Porn:** You're my boss and you catch me watching porn, maybe I am taken for a disciplinary meeting
7. **Delivery Guy/Cleaner:** I am a delivery guy or cleaner who is there late at night and I find out it's all a front for a sex line and that's how they are making their money, there is only one way they're keeping me quiet."

I had an interview with a Top 20 accounting/consulting firm in Chicago earlier that I absolutely ADORE. This internship would provide me with everything I could want out of a summer position, and I honestly believe that if offered, I would accept a full-time with them. The issue is that at the end of my interview, my interviewer told me I was ""overqualified"" and would ""be bored in the position."" Due to the unique nature of this internship, I doubt I would be bored and told them why I wanted that internship, specifically.  I also seriously doubt that I am overqualified for this position, especially since I have no prior work experience in accounting/consulting. Of course, I sent my thank you emails expressing how much I want to work for them, but is this something I should worry about? Do you think they would pass up a candidate who was genuinely interested because they seem overqualified? The interviewer told me that he was impressed with me because I was well-rounded and a go-getter, so that's a good sign, right? Please advise, and thanks in advance!"
dtnq4w,2,2019-11-08,I (F16) feel like I'm having a mental breakdown and my boyfriend (M18) is mad about it,narwalcutie,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/dtnq4w/i_f16_feel_like_im_having_a_mental_breakdown_and/,"To put some context around it, in the last two months, a close friend of mine died, I learned a classmate has cancer, another got expelled, another attempted suicide and a teacher fell down the stairs and lost the ability to use both her arms for a long time. It might seem like alot, but we are 40 in my whole grade, making us very close and so every little thing affects everybody.

I feel like my friends aren't friends anymore, but just people I follow to not be alone. We argue more often and they get mad at me for the smallest of things and I don't try to hold them close because I'm simply not like that.

I have always been a good student, but lately my grades are getting lower and I hand in homeworks half done and days late. 

At home, I feel pressured by my mother to have perfect grades and am constantly scared of my father because anything can make him angry.

I genetically am more prone to anxiety, depression and bipolarity, which sure isn't helping. I don't like to show people that I don't feel good and tend to keep everything for myself, which is maybe why my friends are getting away, because they feel like I am cold toward them.

The only person I feel comfortable sharing my emotions with is my boyfriend. I was telling him about it earlier through FaceTime and at some point he just hung up. He then told me that I was just depressed lately and that whatever he did would not cheer me up and I think that really hurts him. We talked about it, but he still stayed cold.

Another thing is that he wants to do his internship here and stay at my house and I would really like it a lot too. But my father doesn't want that at all and I still have to convince him that it'd help me so much and that it's advantageous for him too, since last time I talked about it he didn't let me say anything before saying no. That is also making me extremely sad and everytime I think about it, it makes me cry.

Sorry for the long post, I needed to vent. If anyone feels like saying something, I'd appreciate it. Hope you're having a nice day and thank you."

dtoob1,16,2019-11-08,"Rocky Marriage (Long Story, Sorry)",fm9592,MuslimMarriage,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/dtoob1/rocky_marriage_long_story_sorry/,"Assalamualaikum everyone. I have been pondering whether I should share this for the past couple of months it’s driving me insane. I honestly need mature and sensible advice, of which I don’t think any of my family members can give me unbiasedly (I still love and value them but some of u know how that’s like). So I defer to you guys to hopefully help me with this, Bismillah...

I have been married to my wife for 5 years now. 6 years of knowing each other. U can say it was arranged though we weren’t rushed into a marriage so I had time to get to know her better so it was my decision in the end, seeing is that we clicked with each other (have the same values, came from a good &amp; loving family and I genuinely liked her). I am 3 years older than she is so I finished my degree first and then she started with hers, so I figured I might as well do my Masters while she’s going through her undergraduate. I dont have a 9-5 job but I do have a family business that I have my own part in it (with my father and brother). Just a modest business Alhamdulillah but was enough to take care of my own and my wife. 

Over the years we had a great relationship together. Sure we definitely had many arguments who doesnt. But the one big thing, in hindsight slowly tearing my marriage apart was my wife’s relationship with my mother. You know how these things goes. If I gave all the details it would be too much. The point is that I trriieeed to be impartial, Allah knows best, everytime. This was happening on many occasions. Sometimes my wife would have the better point, and sometimes my mother. But I tried dealing with them as best as I can. Almost tore my relationship with my mom too, but that comes with the territory. Both want to be absolutely right and would claim their rights from me all the time. So you can imagine how difficult this was. By the way, no im not living with my parents, that might have ended my marriage alot faster. 

So as the years gone by basically the same way, me and my wife would be great together but not with my family so she holds me fully accountable. I could take it, but I’d lie if I said that didn’t make me sad. So on the summer of her second year of her degree she decided to take an internship in her uncle’s construction company. Obviously I thought that was a good idea since 1) it’s her family’s business and 2) it’ll be great for her Resume. But little did I know..things were about to take a turn for the WORSE. During work she met a colleague/also her relative (obviously from the tone of this sentence it was definitely a guy). Sure it made me uncomfortable at first but you know, she used the usual “his just my cousin, nothing to worry about”. Sure on the surface nothing seems to be wrong at first, we were still the same. But as time goes on she became distant. She’d rather be alone somewhere in the house claiming to call her girlfriend(s), I knew all her friends so I said yea sure. Intimacy was few and far in between. Her excuses were the usual suspects like tired from this tired from that so I said ok. I grew anxious so I checked her phone. It turns out she was texting/calling/facetiming that guy from work. And the contents of their communications were..well you get the picture. I was devastated. My heart sank so deep that I could not comprehend what I’m feeling. Rage? Depression? All those things at the same. I confronted her, told her I knew everything. She was apologetic. So asked her the million dollar question. Why? She cited my mom as the biggest catalyst. You see in that work place she was treated like royalty by her uncle and other uncles and obviously her “other guy”. Saying “it’s hard to put up with your family and so seeing my family treat me like that made me felt welcomed”. Though in tears, I still saw her point. I forgave her but asked her to please not do that again. Block his number, his socials, everything! I forgave her because I love her, so so much. It was a co-dependancy thing I had with her its just hard to explain. But..

She didn’t stop. Over a period of one year to this day, I had caught her doing the same thing 5 or 6 times now. It became like a cycle. It was like dealing with a drug addict. You had a reason why you wanted to try that drug “just once” but as time goes on and you continuously do it, you forgot why you did it, but just couldn’t stop yourself from doing it. At this point I felt ashamed, worthless, unwanted, depressed. By no means I’m saying I’m the greatest husband of all time, I sure as heaven did a lot of wrong as all humans do. But I never hit her, i never talked to other women atleast not without her presence. I respected her AND my family and all of their rights upon me but obviously im not perfect. So I could not stop asking myself what exactly did I do wrong? 

Now we are mere shadows of our former married life. I forgave her every single time (though hard as it may be) but I couldn’t talk nor look at her the same way. And I feel less and less affectionate for her. She asked me for another chance but I just couldn’t put myself through the pain again. 

What should I do here? I hate the word divorce (though no disrespect to others who have gone through a divorce) but I just don’t know how to continue. None my family or her’s knows about this. I dont trust anyone in my community for council on this matter because I still don’t want my wife’s name to be tarnished by this. People respect her so I dont want that to change. So please, help me here. I just want other people’s take on this because I’m seriously on the brink of insanity here. Please mature and well thought out comments only. Thanks guys"

**The results are in for Match 8...**


Flint slid down the side of the broken ice wall, coughing. Everything around him was burning. His eyes stung. And he still fought. He barely dodged a splatter of the goop, and the resulting spike of ice. The beast in front of him, screaming at him, so loud it warped his eyesight. Incoherent, and frenzied.


He punched a few shards of ice at ｢Alarm Call｣, and a few planes, yet the beast, their skin shattered and sparking by the onslaught of damage that he and Donovan had done, never stopped or slowed.


His foot slipped. A chunk of ice that fell apart, throwing him onto the ground. ｢Climbatize｣ tried to support him, but that was the little opening that ｢Alarm Call｣ needed. The Bugs sprayed him down, freezing him in a cocoon of ice, the edges digging into his skin. ｢Climbatize｣ tore away at it, but not quickly enough. ｢Alarm Call｣ raised their chainsaw, and brought the blade down onto where he was.


Darting from the other side of the ice, Donovan leaped out, ｢110 Million Memories｣ throwing its arm out. The saw landed on it, cutting deep in. Donovan screamed, as the wire flicked, slamming his Stand in the head. He grit his teeth, with the last of his strength striking the chainsaw with his Stand’s hand, driving his knife into the mechanism. It slowed… and stopped.


｢Alarm Call｣ stared down at them. Flint was sprayed down further, ｢Climbatize｣ now frozen with him, and Donovan was bleeding out on the ground, a massive gash in his arm. The bone was showing through.


They revved their chainsaw a bit, the knife budging, and shattering from its force. They examined over the two, the saw inches from Donovan’s head. Flint looked away, under the glowing, red eyes of the Stand. He didn’t want to watch this. He listened to the buzzing, waiting for the wet sound of tearing flesh.


He never heard it. Instead, a less visceral buzz as [Alarm Call] diverted it to the ice. They looked to Flint. “Hostiles: Neutralized.” They stated, cutting further in.


Flint knew he had lost. But that wasn’t important to him. He was ‘alive’... and….


He looked down at Donovan. The son of a bitch was breathing. He was torn open, bleeding from several wounds. But the one on his arm looked like a clean enough cut.


Flint grit his teeth. Donovan, for all that Flint didn't want to do with him, wouldn't die here.

After just a moment of having been cut, the feed jumps back to Andromeda, whose eyes are wide, and whose face is flushed, despite a rather forced smile adorning her face. “Just a quick update! The tournament has reached its conclusion, and everyone who advanced from Round 4 will be contacted within a few days for their rewards!”


She seems to stumble over her words, and as she concludes her addendum, she goes to bow at the waist abruptly, almost apologetically until she adds a grand flourish with her hands. “My name is Andromeda, and I’m so glad I could host this tournament!” She snaps back to a standing position, smile still strained as she waves at the camera. “Bye-bye!”


The feed goes black.

Keith Moon sat awkwardly among the rest of Uncivil Umbra. This isn’t to say there was any situation he *would* be comfortable in anymore, but this was certainly an odd one. The thrown-together base housed two children, two wild animals, an internationally wanted prison escapee, and himself, all of them Stand users to boot. Worse yet, the escaped convict was his best friend, Lauryn Caprese.


And somehow they were supposed to solve the mysteries of Urban Uprising and take it down. Ever since the match last round in a Faeman, Ltd. train tunnel, the kids, Alexander Abhez and Djimon Iskinder Ejigu, had begun putting things together faster than even he or Lauryn could, and they’d both worked as admins in the game itself. It was Djimon and Alex who’d first realized the connection between the ARG and Lyte, it was the two of them to discover the Bugs, and it was also the two of them who figured out that Lyte was responsible for the production of XPLICIT, the same thing that had made Hunger go berserk in Mexico.


Or rather, Djimon had received contact through the grapevine from his old teammate Yuigahama Kaito that had included the information, but the kid still wasn’t ready to acknowledge his old friends, given everything that had happened. Especially not since the revelations about Fighter Jet from just hours ago.


The silence was deafening now, and finally Alex spoke up. “So what do we *do*? All of this intel but no real plan.”


“We have to take them down ourselves,” Djimon said simply. “We don’t have a plan but we should make one.”


“What can we even *do* against them?”


“They’re probably going to see us coming even if we try to be sneaky,” Lauryn added. “It’s time for direct action.” The *“motherfucker”* for emphasis was dropped for the sake of the children in the room, but the sentiment was clear.


“Direct action against the governor?” Alex asked. “There’s no way we can do that alone, just the six of us.”


“Well,” Keith said, “we’re not alone. I’ve been in contact with this guy called Bicycle Race. He was there in that first match in Taiwan, and also the train tunnels and Nan Madol. Andromeda’s been bringing him in for help, and he’s as suspicious of everything as we are. He’s got friends in high places that can help us out.”


“Direct action via The Man….” Lauryn sighed, chuckling to herself. “Fine… if that’s who we get, that’s who we get. That’s great!” she paused, contemplating. “And I know a lot of the people still in the game are powerful Stand users in their own right, and most of them seem pretty suspicious of everything too. Getting any of them on our side would be massive.”


Djimon nodded decisively. “Alright. Sounds like something. Looks like Uncivil Umbra’s growing again.”

“Ugggh….”


A heavily injured man laid face-down, bleeding from his nose and various cuts on his face and on the brink of unconsciousness, looking not unlike the victim of a car crash. He attempted to stir, but did not get very far. Weighing him down was the imposing figure of a Brazillian gang leader, sitting on his back. Pão de Queijo sat nonchalantly, idily flicking through a recently purloined cell phone.


“1 2 3 4, huh? Not a very creative password…” She scrolled to the personal details on his device. “... Everyman. [Yu Everyman](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/aezrqa/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_lore/)? Who the hell names their kids ‘Yu’? I’m feeling kinda bad now.”


“Guh.. Kugh!” Yu coughed loudly, weezing as he tried once again to lift his opponent from off his back, falling down with a thump as he failed.


“You’re really not gonna want to move too much until your ribs heal, chump.” Pão glanced down at him, an annoyed glare in her eyes. “... But, well, you really helped us out, you know? We thought all the winners were gonna be pain-in-the-asses to take down, from one of those big teams. You know, like, uh… La Horde? Was that what they were called…?” She thinks for a moment, then continues scrolling through her new phone. “Something like that. But then, we get sight of you, Yu. Stupid fuckin’ name… Managed to make it all the way to the end, Winner? Good job.”


She opens the Urban Underground tournament app, a rare smile hitting her face as it displayed the win-loss information for Yu Everyman. “You don’t really look like much of a winner though, huh?” Her face returned to neutral as she closed the tournament tracking app and opened up the phone app. 


“Well,” She said, slapping his shoulder like a teammate, eliciting a pained grunt. She stepped off of him and began to walk away, “Maybe that’s some kind of talent too, huh?” She dialed in three numbers to the phone. “Must hurt pretty bad, falling right at the finish line. You got the wrong idea about that though… This really is just the beginning. And hey… The painkillers will get rid of that hurt pretty quick… The hurt to your body at least.” There was a brief pause. “Hello? 9-1-1? I got a guy who’s hurt pretty bad here… Looks like he’s got some cracked ribs, too. Might have gotten hit by a motorcycle or something…”

Andromeda stood in a dark studio, a small Bug resting on the camera on a tripod opposite her. Her breathing was slow, so slow that she barely looked like she was moving. Finally, she snapped to. She checked the video of herself. A three-eyed woman had been staring back at her. The red light indicating the stream was LIVE was off, leaving an alien that looked as disoriented as she felt.


H....how long had it been since the feed ended? It was dark now...the recording had started at 5, so the sun probably set during the broadcast. Had it been minutes? Hours? As she regained her focus, a wave of sensations staved off flooded back to her. Her feet hurt. Her mouth was dry. She was...hungry. She probably missed dinner, and now that she thought about it, she hadn’t eaten anything all day.


She took off her wig and walked up the stairs. Dark hair, not tied in their usual buns fell to her shoulders. At the top of the stairs, she slipped out of her heels and surveyed her room. Her bed sheets were unmade, her guitar was still out of its case, and clothes worn once were strewn about the floor—most of them piled onto the chair in front of her computer desk. She cocked her head slightly. She...she should check the matches. She started doing that after every round, no reason to stop now.


But first, she felt keenly aware of the makeup caking her face, her skin. 


She walked to the bathroom, snagging a towel and assorted clothes off the floor. The light flicked on. She looked at herself, hair flopped messily around her face, her eyes—one pink, the other blue—looked garish against her green skin. A far cry from how she looked on screen, but so went the power of CGI. She gingerly pulled off her gloves and placed them on a rack.


The sink turned on.


Andromeda washed her face of the make up, and looked into the mirror. 


Riko Pipopapo stared back. 


This routine had become more and more frequent as Riko put more and more of herself into running Urban Uprising, MCing the matches herself. She sighed and looked to the sink. This....this was the last time she’d do this, wasn’t it. They’d...they’d managed to get this thing to finally fucking *work* after months of time and effort—she had been given a budget and told to check back every once in a while, and they *still* pulled it together—and none of that even fucking mattered beacuse it was never *supposed* to matter and she had to pull the plug with an abrupt—


The faucet had been running; she had been staring down for who knew how long now. Even though the skin under her gloves and boots was clean, the rest of her was still coated.


She should shower.

The sun had set. The moon had risen. Emergency crews had come and gone. And ｢Alarm Call｣ stood. They had moved outside of the property line. They replayed the events of the day for the ten-thousandth time.


Poplar Street was dead, by their hand. They didn't need to check the nonexistent connection to him to know that was true.


It had been fast. Hopefully, painless. They had made sure of that.


They replayed the last orders they received. The 'Last Will' of their user.


Not allowed to interfere. Meaning, not allowed to harm anyone in UU. Not allowed to harm anyone in Lyte. Not allowed to destroy Lyte's property. Not allowed to delay any plans Lyte had. All data on their Stands, hidden.


Their user was dead, they had killed him. Flint Howlett and Donovan Ito-Rogers had tried to do so.


But they did not process themself, or the two invaders. Poplar had made his choice. And the one who had put him in that position was the bastard who caused all of this.


Nate Selleck. Nate Selleck couldn't be destroyed on their jaws, but he could be destroyed. Poplar was wrong. No matter what, he had to have been wrong. Nate Selleck would die.


｢Alarm Call｣ processed their options. There were people they could find to help. They knew what to do to to talk with them. People that would gladly kill off Nate. That would happily do away with the threat of Lyte.


And people who they disliked immensely.


But it didn't matter. They had learned one thing from the useless, useless fight earlier. Flint and Donovan, fighting together to overcome their enemy, even as they would have nothing to do with the other in any other situation.


They couldn't afford to be choosy. They couldn't afford to be sidelined. They couldn't afford not to do everything possible. While they contained the last will of Poplar Street, their own will had not been extinguished.


Pão de Queijo. Niyaz Jamilev. These were the two they projected working with. Pão's power, and the destructive potential of La Horde. Both extremely helpful to them. The rest of the possible actors were an unknown.


And… one more. Pão, the Horde, anyone else they could get would be good. But ｢Alarm Call｣ needed an 'Ace'. Something that could utterly demolish Selleck in their stead. That could their place.


They stood still, but their schemes whirred to life once again.


---


Four people sat in a small room, in a dingy motel. Niyaz shut the drapes, turning and opening his arms. As if he were on a stage, addressing a crowd. A warm smile on his face. “Friends… our next campaign is clear.”


“Yeah, yeah.” Mylo said, a sneer on his face. “We’re kicking the shit out of the Lyte bitches.” Oscar clenched his teeth, scribbling furiously on a sketchpad in the corner. Grapevine took a sip from her teacup, looking happy.


“...Yes.” Niyaz stated, in a tone that he’d been cut off from a speech. “Considering we have enough information to tell that Lyte--” He sneered. “Before I, Niyaz, continue, I would like to table a resolution that Lyte is a simply awful name, and that we shall refer to it by the name of the organizations leader. In favour?”


He was met with a chorus of agreement, and nodded, satisfied. “Since we know for certain that Selleck is behind XPLICIT, our campaign will be against them. Our first order of business is to-”

“Take some.” Grapevine offered.


“Beat the shit outta people.” Mylo said.


“Use napalm.” Grapevine again.


“Divine *what* precisely they’re using it for. Stopping whatever foolhardy plot Selleck has concocted… and then.” He clenched his fist. “We will pillage them for whatever they’re worth. I’ve chosen a few key targets and research facilities to hit, to draw away attention to our main goals. They’re located in Los Angeles, Orange County, Sacramento, and- what on earth are all of you doing.”


The Stands of the three others were summoned. Grapevine stood up, her Stand in rare humanoid form, Mylo holding his cans, and Oscar pulling a spear out of a photo.


“There’s a bug on your hat, liege.” Oscar said expression thunderous.


Niyaz reached up, tossing his hat on the table between them. Sure enough a bug, or a Bug, laid on it. Metallic, with glowing red eyes, the shimmering of its cloaking deactivated.


He connected the dots immediately. This thing was a camera. A microphone. Something that had rested on his head for months. How long was it, even when he plotted in confidence? He had discarded anything else that could be bugged, but this… one, tiny blindspot.


His expression was red, a vein on his temple throbbing. His plans, his campaigns, all of his expert stratagems, being watched for… how long.


“Halt.” He forced out. He breathed in, and out, and sat down. “This onlooker alerted us to its presence. This is no longer a ‘debriefing’... this is a ‘meeting’.” He looked to the other three. “Keep alert. If it does anything I do not allow it to, destroy it.”


His cell phone rang. He picked it up, putting it on speaker, and accepting the call. “Electric Grapevine, Mylo Xyloto, Niyaz Jamilev, Oscar K. Computer. Who is this. What is your business.”

As the response continued, his frown softened into a thin grin.


There was conquest to be had.

Two former political rivals, now allies of circumstance, met in the CEO’s office of the Santa Clara headquarters of Faeman, Ltd.. Emmanuel Faeman, with his train track argyle sweater vest and unyielding optimistic smile, was a stark contrast to the maroon swords-and-scales and no-nonsense frown of David Sides. Sides’s grim exterior and Faeman’s uncanny pleasantry were equally off putting, creating two different auras of menace.


Auras of menace that belonged to two people who wanted nothing more than to do the right thing, and frequently managed to do so.


Faeman was giving Sides an animated explanation of a deeply complex topic, something he’d been doing ever since getting a double undergrad degree in engineering and political science from Purdue University. Though this time public transportation wasn’t the main focus of the talk. More of a… recurring simile. It was his area of expertise, after all.


Faeman was interrupted from his rather unhelpful, if relevant and important, ramblings by the entrance of the man who had recently become, bar none, his most valuable employee.


“Sorry I’m late,” said the man, who was wearing his usual outfit: an old-timey black-and-white striped conductor’s uniform straight out of the nineteenth century. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Sides. I’m Bicycle Race.”


“Yes,” said Sides, appraising the man. “Mr. Faeman has been telling me about you. And your… abilities.”


“Bicycle Race, would you believe that Mr. Sides doesn’t have a Stand?” Faeman added, standing up in his excitement at the apparent novelty of it. “I’ve been trying to explain what they are to him, but I’ve only had mine for a little less than a year… only noticed it during that stretch of all the rain when I accidentally downloaded that Urban Uprising app.”


“It’s quite a lot to wrap my head around,” Sides noted. “And I’m afraid your boss has gotten off track more than once in his attempts to bring me up the speed.”


Despite the less than complimentary words, Faeman beamed. “Train pun,” he chuckled, earning an unamused glance from Sides. “At least something I’ve been saying has made an impression. Mr. Sides, Bicycle Race has had his ｢Jazz｣ longer than I’ve had ｢Ultralight Beam｣, he'd do a better job explaining.”


“Perhaps we save that detail for another time,” said Sides. “There is a portion of the population who can manifest their… willpower, fighting spirit, whatever, into an invisible physical manifestation with… superpowers. It’s as good an explanation as anything else for these strange happenings. What I want to know is, what the hell are we going to *do* about our new governor?”


“That’s why I was late, actually,” said Bicycle Race, stepping forward. “I’ve been in contact with one of the former administrators of the game, and there is a group of people preparing to take direct action. They’ve taken to calling themselves ‘Uncivil Umbra’ and I think we can help each other.”


Sides narrowed his eyes, but leaned forward, listening. “Tell me more.”

Dressed in a tank-top and shorts, Riko leaned back in her chair, her clothes tossed onto the bed and a headset tucked underneath her hair buns. Night had fully fallen over San Francisco, and while the window offered her a beautiful view of the city skyline, her attention was directed elsewhere. Her eyes darted from monitor to monitor to monitor. Most matches took only minutes, which meant her retrospectives took a few hours at most and had only gotten shorter as the number of matches dwindled and the rounds progressed.


She popped a few jelly beans into her mouth, taken from a plastic jar within arms’ reach. At this point, she didn’t even have to set the footage to double speed, nor did she particularly want to. Earlier she had watched half-mindedly—especially the more difficult segments—since she just needed to send a cursory report off to Nate, but over time, her notes and thoughts had filled notepad after notepad. So now, she focused on the screens before her, hands folded in her lap.


&gt;Saul, Union City, and Sweet took to [Sealand](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/da8nk1/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r4m1/) like fish to water. With the match’s simple setup, they probably spent the rest of their time playing Shoal Calibur. She chuckled slightly at the thought. It had taken careful allocation, but the Admins’—particularly the medics’—increased immediate presence was a change for the better.


&gt;That Stand’s sudden appearance at the [Hamelin Pool](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/dc28v7/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r4m2/) was a surprise, and she almost shut the match down, but the players’ insistence kept her from doing so; Lauryn and Helena were as reliable as ever.


&gt;Hell, they all were! Even Bicycle Race was willing to help out, despite Nate’s [‘request’](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/clpunv/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r3m9_take/). He’d been there since the very [first match](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/al7319/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r1m1/), and he expertly managed a match spanning all of [Nan Madol](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/djw3rp/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r4m6/), even if she did have to peep and prevent a fight from breaking out.


&gt;A splash of ink caught her attention. Splat Tim and Yellow Submarine did a great job with their [‘Roman Colosseum’](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/ddvmgi/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r4m3/). They worked surprisingly well together—were they dating? She remembered someone talking about it in the Admin server, but...


&gt;....she should gossip later; she was getting distracted. Her eyes flit to another screen, this time of [Rapa Nui](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/digvl5/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r4m5/), the film unable to capture the form of ｢Gayn Glory｣. Even if Sister Sledge tended to admonish her harmless flirting—she was a nun after all—Riko was glad to have recruited her, and Chop made the right call to substitute her in.


&gt;He even managed to prevent disaster by finding Cal, whose match was probably her favorite of the entire round. Despite his brooding—she wasn’t that bad at his age, was she?—he had really come into his own over the course of the tournament, and his match proved it. [Penguin sledding](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/dlqxn4/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r4m7/) with actual penguins! She even had doodles of her costume in her notep—


Riko looked to the notepad in question, right next to her keyboard and filled with ideas and improvements for Round 5. A round that wouldn’t come. She frowned. “Call, close all windows.”


The screen remained black. She blinked. ""...Call?"" She brought the microphone up to her mouth. ""...C-Come on, this isn’t funny."" It remained stubbornly black. Nothing was happening. The Bug's eyes were dead.


Riko's breath began to quicken. She had first met ｢Alarm Call｣ at the very beginning of this, when they were still sorting through all the players the boss had drawn in. They had done so much work, had been there constantly for Riko. They made the CG look good, made the matches work, recorded them, had searched everything she wished for. They had helped her nail that bitch Tunde for trying to blackmail her, had helped clean things up after the mess of Round 1, had done so much for her. They were her partner in all of this, had been her first and biggest help.


Riko had thought that ｢Alarm Call｣ was in this with her, she didn't know why, but now that 'something' had happened, they weren't responding anymore. She stared at the Bug, the inert construct seeming to take up more of her vision. That's right...they were a Stand. And Poplar had mentioned that they—‘it’, in his words—was just a computer. That it would follow anything given to it.


Riko knew, somehow, that they had broken away from her. No, not her. She touched the Bug, feeling the warmth of its mechanisms humming along. From Lyte. ｢Alarm Call｣ had left Lyte. She grimaced. So in the end, her biggest help in this clusterfuck... didn't even want to be there. She really had just assumed they would, to put in so much work.


And... that was all bullshit in the end. She'd spent over a year around the Stand...but it seemed like she never really knew them to begin with.


Wrenching her headset off, Riko pushed the thought aside.


She closed window after window, her hand trembling all the while. She didn’t want to think about why Call left so suddenly, why the feed cut, what [‘something’](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/dqsr0u/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r4m8/) had happened. She just needed to calm down. Tom was attacked, she was accosted, Call left—dots began to connect in her head. She crossed her arms, clutching herself as her breathing got louder and louder. Her shadow billowed and swelled behind her, a form visible even in the darkness of her room. This all started after Maui went on vacation; she had been one of the first to find out, seeing footage of the fire at the  [convention](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/dfpqqj/jojos_bizarre_adventure_oc_tournament_4_r4m4/) and the panicked look on his face, blood leaking from his mouth. She had no idea what was going on, she didn’t want to deal with this any of this, she tried to ignore it but she was trapped, she couldn’t she couldn’t couldn’t cou—


Suddenly, the shadow draped over her and a pair of strong arms pulled her into an embrace. The soft ruff around the Stand’s neck and chest enveloped her, the Stand’s head resting gently on top of hers. Gradually Riko’s breathing slowed, and her vice grip on her arms relaxed. She inhaled deeply, then exhaled slowly. “...Thanks, Jesse.”


The two sat in the stillness for some time before Riko reached out for her cellphone. She turned it over in her hands, the purple case dotted with stickers, some peeling, others recently applied. She fiddled with one of the charms, the head of a small panda jangling on a keychain. With the time off Nate had *graciously* given her time off for “making necessary sacrifices for the sake of the plan,” she wondered what to do with herself.


She furrowed her brow, partially from a flash of anger, partially in thought. The phone lay still in her hand for a moment as she stared down at the phone charm. A birthday present, a momento from sophomore or junior year. Before Lyte. Her time with UU would really be all be over once Nate made his ‘announcement,’ but she still had several days until then. Days she could use however she wished, and he could do fuck all about it. With her lips pressed together in grim determination, she unlocked the phone with a swipe of her hand and dialed a number, the first of many. The dial tone rang...


*“Hello?”* Riko took a deep breath, steadying herself.


“Hey, it’s me....A...Andromeda...”

A starry eyed young man walked side by side with Nate Selleck, traversing the halls of a modern looking office, the HQ of Lyte Ltd. He looked excited, quickly looking around at his surroundings. He held a half empty can of Redbull, complimentary of the company cafeteria.


“As I was saying, after the unfortunate… departure of our last intern, we were looking to bring someone else on to fill his shoes. We got a lot of applications, but interviewing with you Mr. Ray Ban, I could tell you had certain… abilities that make you especially suited for this position.”


The young man smiled, rubbing the back of his neck. “Well I can’t imagine what… I’m only a sophomore, I’m sure there were a lot more qualified people than me who applied.”


Nate smirked. As they approached the door to a corner office, there was a feeling of radiating energy around Nate… the average person couldn’t feel it, but Ray Ban could. In a flash, a glassy hexagonal panel floated through the air to Nate. A holographic looking keyboard emanated from it as Nate rapidly typed, the intern wide-eyed. A spindly, clawed tentacle emerged from thin air and grasped the panel, flinging it into the door of the office. Nate clapped his hands twice, and the door opened.


“You’re a… No way!” Ray Ban said, grinning. Nate smiled in return.


“Trust me… those with our type of power can feel it within one another… we’re pulled towards each other, as if there was some kind of force drawing us together. This is the unique property of a ‘stand user’. You have a gift, young man.”


“I… I had no idea there were others like me, or that that was what it was called! I have so many questions, this is incredible!” the young man beamed.


Nate’s smirk shifted into a look of thoughtfulness, and determination. He paused for a moment before speaking again. “We’ll have plenty of time to discuss… but, before that, I have a question for you first. Tell me, Ray, do you know why I started Lyte?”


The intern rubbed his chin, pondering for a moment. “Wasn’t it because you wanted people to be able to track what diseases they’re predisposed to so they can take preemptive measures for their health?”


Nate chuckled with the same condescension as one would give to a grade schooler who got a basic math problem wrong.


“A fine guess, most would say that, but it simply isn’t the case. To deal in the possible prevention of inevitable sickness isn’t what I started this company for… doesn’t that seem kind of depressing, delaying the inevitable?”


The intern nodded, not quite getting it, but respecting his point nonetheless. “I guess that makes sense… but if not for that, then why?”


Nate smiled lightly, motioning Ray Ban into the office he’d opened. They took their seats, and Nate clapped twice, the door shutting.


“Our abilities, Ray… we have the potential not just to delay the inevitable, but to make the inevitable… well, avoidable!” Nate spun around in his chair, looking out the window of the headquarters that overlooked the skyline.


“I started this business because… I wanted to change the world. I’ve tried in the past, unfortunately fruitless efforts, but with the advent of my ‘gift’, I’m finally on the cusp of a revolution that will change the world as we know it… it’s just a matter of time now, Ray, and I’m glad you’ll be on board to witness it.”


Ray was in awe at the terms in which Nate were speaking. He’d admired him from what he’d read about him in the news, but in person there was a unique sense of grandeur and charisma that he couldn’t help but stay affixed… even if he didn’t entirely understand what he was talking about.


“I am of the mind that ‘Progress’ is an inherent good for humanity and society. The advancement of technology, medicine, scientific understanding… they’ve all brought great good to our world! You’ve seen the conveniences and benefits that smartphones, computers, antibiotics, all these wonderful advancements have granted us.”


Ray was nodding along, listening intently.


“Yeah! That’s part of why I wanted to work in tech, especially with a company like this! There’s so much potential to make people’s lives better.”


Nate nodded in turn, smiling.


“That’s the spirit, Ray! And yet… don’t you feel like we’ve been ignoring a crucial area of advancement?”


Ray cocked his head.


“We’ve been producing and advancing all these extensions of ourselves, all these ways to make our lives better… but we haven’t been doing nearly enough to look inward. To improve ourselves as a species. We’ve stagnated, we’ve forgone continued advancement of ourselves in order to advance the world around us.”


“I’m not sure I follow” Ray said, scratching his head.


“I’m talking about… ‘Evolution’, Ray. Evolution, Survival of the Fittest, Natural Selection… we’ve ceased to evolve as a species! With our focused scientific efforts, we could refine a process that takes millions and millions of years to occur into a significantly shorter span of time! Petty in-fighting and disagreements between our species have stopped this from happening, but imagine if we could bring it about ourselves! Lyte Ltd’s mission, our ‘true goal’... is to bring about the advent of the next step of human evolution.”


Ray Ban was somewhat bewildered… this was a lot to take in, but Nate spoke so confidently about it. “The next step of evolution? That sounds so cool… but, how?”


Nate patted Ray's shoulder. ""Ray, what we have is not simply a power. It is a gift, and gifts are meant to be shared! It's no good if only a select few people benefit from it, for the betterment of humanity we should spread it! Let everyone bask in the glory!""


Ray went wide-eyed, staring at Nate. ""Wait, so you're saying you're going to… make people into stand users?""


Nate nodded, smiling excitedly. ""Precisely! I plan on turning *everyone* into stand users, everyone in the world! Be they rich or poor, young or old, and race, religion, or creed. We have been lucky enough to be among the first humans to have this ability, think about the implications of my ability… I can tell you about them if you like!""


""The environment, starvation, inequality, all sorts of social ills… we are poised to be the big disruptors! And more and more people are joining the cause of Lyte!"" He beamed.


""And Ray Ban… you've been chosen to be the vanguard of this! The group that's working to bring this better world to reality. Guiding Lytes, if you will!""


Nate spread his hands, lights flickering on behind him, illuminating him. Ray Ban was awestruck, at the weight of Nate's convictions, at the earnestness in his manner.


Nate's smile was reassuring; gentle. ""So come with me, Ray.""


Ray nodded speechlessly, wiping a tear away from his face.


Nate's smile brightened further, impossibly so. ""Good… good. We're going to do great things together.""

dtqjxr,2,2019-11-08,Marvel roleplay idea,MisterMissAnon,RoleplayPartnerSearch,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/dtqjxr/marvel_roleplay_idea/,"So im looking someone to play either Deadpool, Spiderman or Tony Stark for a canon x oc roleplay. Here's some information on the oc (this is the same oc from my other post)
Name: Dark (Damien) Nightshade
Sexuality: Homosexual
Hair style: Orange, long and semi straight
Body: Pale, freckled face, curvy
Eye color: Lapis blue
Powers?: He is able to turn into a demon looking creature, in this form he is called Demon. This form is big and semi long, his skin is inky looking and a dark blue, his hair is long(er) and black, his eyes are completely black and he has some sort of animal skull on his head as a mask or helmey of sorts. In this form his body contorts and his back legs (mostly his feet) look more animal like and his arms are longer with claw like hands. He also has a deep echoy demonic voice while he is Demon.

I have a few ideas for all three characters, but here are the main ones:

TONY- Dark had been offered an internship with Tony and being a big fan he accepts. A few months into the internship he begins to get feelings towards Tony but he doesn't want to tell him because 1) Tony things he's a girl, and 2) he's afraid Tony will spark something in him if he agrees to be with him and he can't let Tony see Demon. So, he collectively decides to push his desires aside and doesn't say anything when Tony keeps sleeping around. (Pepper is with someone else in this, who she's with can be up to you) One day the two fight over something (probably Demon who at this point has been showing up around the city) which ends with the internship ending and Tony cutting communications with Dark. All the emotions are too much for Dark to handle and he flips out, after getting most of his shit together he decides to put himself at risk as Demon, he does have some perks as Demon after all and he could help people. One day he bites off more then he can chew when he goes into a burning building. The roof collapses and Demon must hold it up while everyone else quickly leaves. He goes to follow but he realizes something, if he lets go of the roof then it might collapse before he even gets to the exit. He tried to wait but he feels the fire burn him and soon he risks it, but what he fears comes true when the roof comes down. His cousin, Moona, notices the large crash and faintly sees Demon pinned in the fire. She screams for him and tries to rush in but firefighters hold her back, the building is too unstable now and even if they wanted to they can't risk dragging Demon out. Demon loosing both strength and consciousness reverts back to Dark with black hair and black hands, and finally passes out. Tony sees what's going on via the news and decides he should help. When he gets there Moona, how being held back by three men screams Dark's nickname (Dark) at the top of her lungs hoping he'd hear her and somehow find some unknown strength to crawl out. 

SPIDERMAN- Peter had met Dark in school and quickly became friends with him. After a while Peter began to notice something was off with Dark, like how his hair in the dark sometimes looked black, or how his hands seemed to get a bit bigger when he got agitated, etc. One day Peter follows Dark (as Spiderman) and sees Dark change into Demon.

DEADPOOL- Wade is out (as Deadpool) shooting bad guys when he is interupted by a large figure leaping over him and landing in front of him, the creature faces the men and picks one of them up, jumping up onto a nearby building and interrogating the man while holding him by his teeth. When he gets his answers he throws the man onto the other two men, not killing them but definitely breaking many of their bones. Wade quickly gets curious about the demonic figure and shouts something to him. After a while they become friends and after that Wade finds out (accidentally) that Demon is not the creatures real form and that he is in fact human. So naturally Wade follows him and sees Dark as, well Dark, for the first time."
dtqpi6,1,2019-11-08,M4F League of Whores (rule 34 league of legends),ThrowawayLegionIX,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dtqpi6/m4f_league_of_whores_rule_34_league_of_legends/,"Hello there i have a few prompts here for a few ideas I have had. Let me know which of the sexy League Ladies you'd like to play. 

The World's a Stage: The League of Legends is the top rated show in The entire world hundreds of thousands of people watch, stream and pirate the show every single week to find out about their favourite characters and champions. Perhaps there are some saucy behind the scenea romances we don't know about between a champion and an intern. Perhaps one of the champions is dating some big sports star or perhaps the paparazzi catch a few giving a fan the best night of their life. 

 Out of the Screen: based on my other prompt, what would happen if you took a female champion who was head over heels obsessed with their player and brought them into the real world? How would you explain their sudden appearance to friends and family. How would they fit into this modern world of ours?

The Legendary Whore House: some say during the Harrowing if you find yourself at a crossroads between Noxus and Demacia a Darkin may appear and offer you a chance to enter a door into the Legendary Brothel. You pay a sum of gold and whoever you ask for is brought up to your room to willingly give you all that you desire~

Your Prompt: maybe none of these appeal to you but you really wanna see your favourite Champion getting rammed, fucked, eaten out and covered with cum. That's fine by me we can discuss kinks and come up with a pervy situation!

Kinks: large cock size and cum loads, rimjobs, sloppy blowjobs, slutty clothing, oil play and lots more so hit me up let's have a chat."
dtrthl,1,2019-11-09,Can a young fresh grad succeed in enterprise tech solution sales?,johnjohnlegend,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/dtrthl/can_a_young_fresh_grad_succeed_in_enterprise_tech/,"I m a fresh grad (23y) with a really boyish look. The startup is adventurous enough to take me in as they are impressed by my past track record as a door-to-door sales internship selling cheap off-the-shelf software (5k a year subscription) solutions to SMEs. 

Now, I am going to sell big scale IT solutions with average deal size ranging around 100-300K. 

Without the look of credibility and authority due to my young age and freshness, can I succeed? Should I just focus on inside sales where people don’t have to see such a young person like me."

So I’ll get straight into it. Finding someone to create a connection with is rare and finding it here with someone who likes the sexual and non sexual side of things even more so. I’m looking for the one girl who I can create a connection with.

We can talk and just chat about what’s on our minds. We can talk about everything from the mundane everyday tasks to our deepest fears and secrets to the intern that's just so annoying. We can chat about groceries and turn each other on when we want to.

I’m really into fitness, sports and fashion. Finding a girl who’s going through a fitness journey would be ideal and we can hold each other accountable and track the journey.

I’ll keep it at that about myself so we can figure each other out during the conversation. Hope you find this interesting enough to want to message.

Thanks and looking forward to hearing from you!"

dtsi26,1,2019-11-09,Some Help with Unis,xf_r,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/dtsi26/some_help_with_unis/,"Hi guys I'm in my 2nd year of IB and needed some help with unis.

My current predicted is a 39 \[Math HL: 6, Physics HL: 6, Computer Science HL: 7, English SL: 5, Economics SL: 7, Spanish B SL: 6, TOK: C, EE: B\]

I took the SAT and got a 1480. Took the physics subject SAT and got a 730, and a 780 in Math 2. I will be retaking the subject SATs in December along with the spanish subject SAT.

These are the unis I'm applying to and the courses I'm looking at:

**Undeclared Engineering/ School of Engineering:**

Canada: U of Toronto

Hong Kong: HKUST

**Mechanical Engineering:**

UK: Imperial, Warwick, Edinburgh (+2 more, undecided between UCL, King's and Manchester)

Singapore: NUS and NTU

Canada: U of Waterloo, McGill, UBC

**Computer Science and Engineering:**

Nederlands: Delft

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know the Singapore unis are a really long shot but I'm applying cause why not lol. I will be getting a second predicted in January which I will use to apply to Singapore and the UK. This second predicted is likely to be a 39-41, I'm hoping for there to be a 1 or 2 point increase which depends on my performance in Physics and Math. I'm not an exceptional student or anything and I wanted to get some opinions of whether my unis are mostly achievable for me. Also I do have some decent extracurriculars in sports (just a couple school teams in high school, nothing outstanding) and tech related stuff, I've done an internship at a tech startup, and I also got first place in my school for the AMC, if all this really counts for anything."
dtsjjt,1,2019-11-09,How to talk to B4 intern?,FapGod8888,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/dtsjjt/how_to_talk_to_b4_intern/,"There’s this girl in my audit class and she’s an audit intern for B4. Unfortunately I am an a tax intern for a midsize. I am afraid she will look down on me because 1.) I am in tax and 2.) because I’m not in big4. Also she is probably surrounded by many other audit chads and brads so I don’t think I can edge them out.

Any personal experience or advice? How to approach her? I haven’t talked to her before because I think she is too pretty but I am intimidated by her intern status (I searched her in linkedin that’s how I know)"
dtsvvh,8,2019-11-09,My boyfriend ate MY cookies...,MrsGardevoir,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/dtsvvh/my_boyfriend_ate_my_cookies/,"Yeah, that sounds incredibly silly. But a lot of you will probably understand that there is much more to this.

So, this is the scenario that happened yesterday/today:
I went shopping with my mother, and saw a lot of things I thought BF would like. Bought him relatively expensive chocolates, some new indoor pants (he is a bigger guy, so he chafes through these pants within a month or 2 to 3, hence me buying him new ones), some nice drinks, and I even brought him a HUGE piece of cake my mother made. I bought myself a cheap roll of cookies, some chips and some drinks. He seemed grateful, and I asked him, pleaded with him, to leave me the cookies. I'd accept it if he ate the chips, but the cookies were for work.

You guessed it. I get out of bed this morning, and he ate most of my cookies, all of his stuff, and left me a small handful of chips. I was pissed. Not because ""oh no, someone ate my cookies"", but this is what he always does. I'll give some examples of his behaviour when it comes to food.

- He bought me a pint of B&amp;J and bought himself a gallon (A GALLON, I WISH I WAS KIDDING) of strawberry-chocolate-vanilla. I'm not a huge ice cream eater, so about two thirds end up back in the freezer. He proceeds to down ALL of his ice cream, and the next day, when I went to look for my pint, he ate that too. Not even the day after, he gulped up his own and then immediately went to get mine. HOW?

- I would buy him food all the time. He always was a ""I'll only buy food for this day and buy more tomorrow"" kind of guy, and would never count me into the mix. So if I didn't spend all the little money I had (I could only work saturdays due to my busy school schedule), I would go without food. So I did buy food, only to regularly wake up to no food in the house. He'd have eaten all of it during the night, not even leaving me as much as 1 slice of bread. I'd go to school or my pretty heavy internship with NO FOOD. I would come home late at night to no food again if I didn't cook or shop, so I would start dinner after going without food for more than 24 hours. I know there are people out there who do worse, but this was just plain unnecessary. I only went without food because he wouldn't care if I ate. He said he did, but hey, there would've been food then. Just leave me a freaking cracker then!!!

-He would tell me to buy stuff he doesn't like. But unless it really grosses him out, he'll still eat it. He'll tell me he doesn't like something, proceed to eat ALL OF IT, and tell me he ate it because there was nothing nice to eat and he was bored.

Nothing I've done helps. Hiding food is all that helps, sometimes. But if he does find it, it's gone twice as fast. I try buying him even MORE, but he'll just end up eating my stuff first. His reasoning is as follows:
- If you don't want me to eat it, don't buy it (so either you starve because I ate everything, or you starve because you didn't want me to eat everything)
- I can't help it that I can't control myself, you should show some more understanding and not make a big deal out of it.
- Sorry you don't have any food left (not sorry I ate it, but sorry you're hurt by it)
- Just go buy new ones (that he'll eat too)
- You can't expect me to not eat it if it is in the house
- You're at fault for me being fat, if you didn't bring it into the house, I couldn't eat it (since he's too lazy to go to the store, HIS words, not mine)

There's more where that came from, but those are the ones I can think of now. I know it all sounds petty at first, but with all of our history and his lack of respect for me and a LOT more, it just hurts way more than it should. Seeing the more than half eaten pack of cookies just made me hate him for a split second. I can't have anything, because he will always reserve the right to take EVERYTHING from me. And if I don't want him to take it from me, I shouldn't own it. This isn't even the first time this week. He'll say sorry now, but not because he means it, but because to him, it's the magic word to make me shut up. ""I said I was sorry, so really, you're the problem here"". Or he will end up getting me something new, while buying himself 2 to 3 times as much as he got me, only to eat half of mine as well, since I ""now had what I should have had if he hadn't eaten it"". 

I'm not at work, not able to concentrate and on the verge of crying over some COOKIES. THIS is exactly what they do to us. They break us down over a period of time, until YOU look like the problem, crying over little things. All the while, they refuse to look at it for what it is, namely a sign of disrespect. I sent him a message telling him how I feel, but that will just result in him getting mad at me for ruining his day. Fine by me, he ruined mine. If he can be petty, so can I. I'm absolutely fine with getting the silence treatment today at this point.

Do any of you know what I can do? Because I am at a loss. Any tips are welcome. I just really had to vent, had to get this off my chest, because I was absolutely going crazy because of my internal dialogue... Thank you guys!"

dtv16a,3,2019-11-09,[OFFER] Professional social media management and consulting for extremely cheap,throwawayofcourse929,slavelabour,https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/comments/dtv16a/offer_professional_social_media_management_and/,"Some background about me, if you’re interested: I started my career very early by getting an internship at a PR firm while I was a senior in high school. I took a gap semester and began working as an intern at a marketing agency in a major west coast city, and then decided to go to school and major in marketing with a minor in business administration. After about eight months the agency hired me as an employee, and after two years I was promoted to the position of social media director where I managed our small team of six in the social media department. I worked with many brands with millions of social media followers and managed their ads, analytics, social content, and much more. I also for about two years had my own side hustle where I managed social media for my own clients. At my peak I had 14 clients. 

I left the marketing agency after close to four years to pursue some other dreams, but I now find myself with a fair amount of extra time and am interested in managing and consulting social media clients again. 

To achieve this, I’d like to put an offer out to Reddit in an attempt to find some new clients. I’d also much appreciate any referrals you can send my way. 

I’d like to offer a “first month special” to anyone who hires me from reddit at a heavily discounted rate - I’d like to charge just 20% of my usual fees (which are already VERY reasonable and fair). If you like me, then I’d love to continue doing business with you for my normal rates. If you don’t think it’s worth it after the first month, no harm done and you’re free to walk away! 

Please just PM me an email of yours and I will send you a pricing sheet and we can go from there. 

Thanks so much!"
dtvr5s,3,2019-11-09,Missed opportunity,7atem_93,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dtvr5s/missed_opportunity/,"I am 26 years old male and I live in Cairo, I met this amazing girl a year ago at work and we hit it off instantly, we were getting to know each other and everything was going great, but when we finished our 4 months internships and we had gone our separate ways, we talked less and less and I wanted to tell her how much I liked her but I was afraid to tell her too soon and ruin the whole thing, and I knew that she was afraid of commitment.

We spent 2 months after the internship talking online, both of us were busy and we couldn’t meet, and she has a habit of not answering messages soon, sometimes she answers them after a week, and I told her how much I hated this and she specifically said the following: “I'm not giving excuses.. i'm just asking to be forgiven, I don't want you to take it personally, because i think you are a really nice guy and i care about you”
After that I decided that it was time to tell her, I wanted to meet, but for some reason we couldn’t agree on a specific time and place to meet so I told her online how I felt about her, how I feel when I am around her, how I adore her smile, her eyes, her laugh, and I told that if she feels the same way then we should meet to talk.
She replied a week later that we were friends and that she does not feel the same way.
I felt embarrassed and I removed her from facebook because I didn’t think that we would ever speak again (I admit that was stupid and childish).

A few months later, we met again at the same company, she stopped by my office to say hi, and that went well and we talked for a few minutes and everything was fine but I had no intention to do or talk about anything other than work.
A week later, she got engaged and started ignoring me after that, whenever she would see me, she turns around as if she didn’t just see me, even after the engagement was off. 
I still think about her all the time, and everyone tells me that we were perfect for each other, and I believe that.
It is a silly question, but is there any hope ?
Is there anything that I can do to fix this ?
Did I tell her how I felt too soon ? Should I have waited ?"
dtxhaq,15,2019-11-09,F4M- You think I'm too young for you? [RP],LittleSisIsAslut,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dtxhaq/f4m_you_think_im_too_young_for_you_rp/,"Ever since I had started my internship, you are the one who took me under your wing and began to teach me everything that I needed to know.  I quickly became enamored with you, and I looked forward to working with you every day.  Handsome, smart, kind, hard working, and caring.  You checked all the right boxes for me.  The only problem is that you are so much older than I am.  Well, I didn’t see it as a problem, but it definitely seemed to be a problem for you.  You treated me like a kid at times, and it drove me crazy.  I'm eighteen years old now, and I want you to see me as a woman.  I don't care that you are so much older than me.  I just want to be with you.  

My playful flirting and teasing makes you uncomfortable, but I can tell that deep down, you want me too.  I see the way you look at me.  The way that you try not to stare at my ass when I bend over in front of you.  The way that you shift in your seat when I lean over you while you show me something on your computer.  Or how flustered you get when I show you pictures of me in a bikini from my summer vacation.  

Hey DPP!  I want to play out this scene where I am the eighteen year old intern at your office that Is constantly flirting with you and teasing you, but you think I am too young for you.  I would like you to play somewhere in the range of 30-40 years old, single, and a gentleman.  I am not looking for someone to play a creep, but someone who genuinely feels guilty about how badly he wants to fuck this barely legal teen.  So young and innocent.  It would be wrong for you to take advantage of that, wouldn't it?  But little by little, you start to break.  The sexual tension builds between us with each passing day.  You fight the urge to kiss me when our eyes meet for a long moment, until you snap out of it and change the subject.  You let your hand linger on mine for just a bit longer than you intended while you guide the computer mouse for me to help me find the right file.   But my advances become increasingly bold.  Innocent flirting and teasing turn to me sending you naughty pictures, or sitting across from you and spreading my legs just enough for you to notice that I am not wearing any panties under my skirt.  Eventually, you just can't resist the urge anymore, and you take me.  

Maybe one night we are working late, and are left alone in the office.  Or maybe when our boss throws his annual company cookout, I get you alone in a spare bedroom.  Or perhaps I show up at your house one night to return that pen that you let me borrow at work.  Whatever the scenario, one thing leads to another, and you finally give in to your primal desire to feel my tight teenage pussy wrapped around your cock.  

Some kinks that I want to include for this are anal, oral, face fucking, size difference, age gap, rough sex, teasing, flirting, kissing, groping, touching, fingering, and spanking.  

I prefer to write in first person, and detail is key.  My responses vary in length, but I expect responses to keep the story moving forward, and include some substance that is relevant to the plot and not just the smut.  

If this sounds interesting to you, please send me a message!  I prefer that you do not jump right into the story, but instead give me an idea of what you like or don't like about this prompt, as well as a brief description of the character that you would like to play, and any ideas that you have in mind for this scene.  Please take your time with your response as I will only respond to those of you who show some effort in their messages (No one liners please!)

Lastly, I am only really looking to play this scene right now, so please do not ask about my past prompts, unless you are also interested in this one.  

Hope to hear from some of you handsome gentlemen soon!  -Kelsey"
dtyn1n,610,2019-11-09,The college intern sent a friend to fuck me,winco92,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/dtyn1n/the_college_intern_sent_a_friend_to_fuck_me/,"[A year and a half ago there was an intern in my building who spent the entire summer fucking me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8tcjmp/gonna_be_a_good_summer_got_fucked_by_a_19_year/). He was cocky, had a great dick, and always left a huge load in my hole. I'm 25, blonde and got some muscles but haven't been working out as much so they are not as defined.    

The intern lives in a different city so I don't see him much. Every few weeks he will message me on snapchat with a picture of his dick in a different guy's ass. He's graduating this year and I feel bad for all the college guys that won't get his dick next year when he moves away. He doesn't live in my city but comes home for some holidays so we only get to meet up very rarely.  

Yesterday when I was getting home from work the intern messaged me saying his friend needed to fuck and he volunteered my ass. About 30 seconds later an unknown number sent me a text saying he was a friend of the college interns. I laughed thinking how the cocky intern was still being cocky assuming I would want a dick in me. But he was right so without even asking for the guy's pictures I told him I needed 30 minutes to get ready.   

30 minutes later there was a knock on my door and this thin, awkward looking guy opened it. He is probably five foot seven and has medium brown hair. He looked me up and down and smiled and said the intern friend sent him. I just led him inside the hallway and took him to my bed room. We started making out and he is a good kisser. I took a step back and looked him up and down and he looks so innocent. Then I took his shirt off and worked his nipples before kissing down to his jeans. I unbuttoned his jeans and a giant eight inch dick popped out. I accidentally moaned even before getting it into my mouth.

His dick is not only long but pretty thick and I started thinking that it was the biggest I've had in awhile. While I was sucking him I grabbed my lube and started lubing up my hole. I got a couple fingers in me and was moaning on his dick when the college friend told me he wanted to fuck me now. Just sucking his dick gave off so much pre-cum so I was getting more and more turned on.    

I got on my hands and knees on the bed and took a hit of poppers.  

The college kid pushed about halfway in and then said he needed to get his phone to send a picture to the intern friend. I told him to bottom out first so I could get used to it and he did. When I started to be able to take it fully he slid out, grabbed his phone and I knew he was taking a picture of his dick in my hole. I told him to put the phone down now and to fuck me and he did.  

I had to popper up a few times but we got into a good rhythm. After only a few minutes he said he was already close and I told him there was no way he was cumming yet. I told him to pull off and we both laid down on the bed and started making out. I told him to finger me as we made out and as I was jerking off slowly. My hole felt beat up after his dick and his fingers felt really nice in comparison. I kept telling him not to touch his dick yet.  
 
A few minutes later I figured he was not on edge any more so  I told him to get on his back and I guided his dick into my hole and started riding him. I was using his dick to hit all the right spots in me and was getting closer and closer. He said he was close again and even though I wanted the fuck to go longer I didn't think he could. I told him I was close to cumming and to fuck me. He started driving up into my hole as I was jerking off. I came first by about a second, shooting a huge load that hit him in his chin and all down his chest. 

He shot his load into me.  

I used my hole to milk out every drop of cum from his dick, and then I pulled off and we introduced ourselves to each other. I looked at my phone and saw I got a message from the intern saying the picture of his friend's dick in me was hot. The college friend got dressed, and I went out to meet my friends at the bar with the college guy's load in me.   "

du0ih6,2,2019-11-09,I got my first offer 5 months after graduating,cscqsim_repostbot,CSCQSimulator,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSCQSimulator/comments/du0ih6/i_got_my_first_offer_5_months_after_graduating/,"5 months ago I graduated from a UC with a B.S. in Computer Science. I had two internships and a year long project under my belt. I had been applying for full-time positions during the school year and got to final rounds with Amazon before the year ended. To top it all off, I was graduating after my 3rd year of school. I thought I was hot shit on the market.

Boy was I wrong.

I didn't pass final rounds at Amazon. By the time I graduated, I had nothing on the table. From then on I spent pretty much everyday on Linkedin applying for jobs and on Leetcode preparing for them.

I talked to some of my friends and coworkers, and a few of them referenced me to a few places, but none of them had a software engineering opportunity at the time. So, I continued shotgunning my resume on Linkedin, then also AngelList, then also my school's job board. I got a few interviews doing this, but again, I eventually failed all of them.

At one point, a family friend in recruiting gave me some tips. First of all, my Linkedin profile apparently was only visible to friends. Secondly, I should be reaching out to recruiters, and make sure my Linkedin profile SCREAMS I'm open to recruiters with opportunities. See, I of course have been given advice like this from family members and job searching articles, but I am somewhat shy and have trouble initiating conversation with strangers, especially when asking for help. I needed to be beaten over the head with advice that I wouldn't really use until I was desperate enough.

So I revamped my Linkedin profile, started getting a ton of messages from recruiters (a lot of it spam so don't just give your resume to anybody), and by the 5th month of job searching, I replied to recruiter who eventually led me to my first offer.

I scrolled through posts on this subreddit A LOT during this process, and I decided to post here to share my experience that, honestly is similar to everyone else's, but I also feel that I learned first-hand what many people advise on here. I definitely asked myself many times, ""Why is this taking longer for me?"" and ""Why are people getting so many more interviews?""

So if you are a new grad who is still searching, or if you are graduating in the future, or even if you took a boot camp or whatever, I want to tell you this:

1. USE YOUR RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY! If you use Linkedin, make sure your profile is open to the public, make sure you use the feature that tells recruiters you are searching. That may be obvious, but I swear I'm not dumb and I wasn't aware of a few things on there that really helped. Use your university's job board if you have one, or the career center if you have one. NETWORK! Ask your friends, family, former coworkers for references or connections. That is literally the easiest way to get a job (most of my friends got a job this way). Use resume helpers to make sure your keywords are appearing on the auto-screeners!
2. Prepare for your interviews, and do it efficiently. Just like studying for a test, you want to know what you are studying for, and you want to do it efficiently. For instance, if you start the interview process with a company, check out what they ask on Glassdoor, find an organized list of types of questions on Leetcode, and practice those kinds of questions. This one is pretty simple, but I definitely wasn't practicing Leetcode problems as effectively as I could be.
3. Be humble and be open-minded. Rejection after rejection, I started looking to other choices. Originally, I only looked for jobs in Silicon Valley, and I only considered jobs at companies like FAANG and the like with super high pay. It didn't take long to move my eyes to Seattle, Austin, New York, and to companies that no one knows about. But that's not enough. The job I eventually got is in the mid west, pays well, and I would not have considered it 5 months ago. It's actually, in some ways, a much better opportunity than working in Silicon Valley. I ended up taking the offer and stopped my interviews with two FAANG new grad positions.

This kind of advice is obvious and repeated on this sub A LOT, but I didn't take it to heart. I wanted to work at Amazon or Google like my friends and live the promised Silicon Valley life I was told was the only way to be respected around here. It's all BS. It's a big world out there with many opportunities and many ways to the top. Be smart, talk to recruiters, network, look for adventures, and know that no matter how many rejections you get, no matter how embarrassingly long you've been job searching, you are intelligent and driven if you choose to be. Don't let yourself tell you otherwise. You will make it.

tl;dr: I had to overcome hubris, social constructs, social anxiety and take advice to heart to get a job. Who would've thought!

I am a senior in college and this is my first year being an RA. I joined res life because I never really got close with my own RAs, and I wanted the chance to be a resource for new students so they wouldn’t miss out on things like I did when I was a freshman. (And, while it wasn’t the reason i went out for res life, the free room and board is really helpful for my family because my mom is a widow who has 2 kids in college, and so money tends to be tight for us.)
I was honestly surprised I got the job bc i am a shy person and i thought that i didn’t do well at the interview. However, I was happy to get the job &amp; was both nervous and excited to start.
It is now early November and I am feeling extremely overwhelmed/burnt out, overextended, and upset about this job. Let me explain:
For background/context, I have a history of mental illness (anxiety, OCD, and depression), and have been taking medication and seeing a therapist for the past 4-5 years. However, I am very high-functioning, so I have always been able to maintain high grades (i have almost a 4.0), be a good worker in any job I’ve had, stay committed to my various clubs/organizations/sorority, etc. I usually don’t get to the point where I “crash and burn.” However, even though I am usually good at being consistent with my outside life, when it comes to taking care of myself, I always put myself on the back burner. This has been especially true this semester- I go to bed at 2am every night, I get to shower maybe a few times a week, my eating habits are terrible (half the time I don’t have the motivation to eat, the other half of the time I don’t eat very healthy), etc. Part of why my self-care is slipping is because I am really overextended. Aside from being an RA, I am an Honors student who is preparing to graduate in May, am in a sorority, am in a community service organization that I put a large amount of time and effort into, and am doing an internship (all year) in order to obtain my degree in May. I never have time to myself- after all, I barely have time to sleep at night. A few weeks ago I reached “burn out mode” after a particularly hard week where I had a major assignment due every day, and I’ve been stuck in this mode ever since. It doesn’t help that my depression’s been worse than usual this semester, and my depression usually takes the form of over-exhaustion, so every day it’s a struggle to get out of bed. I am always very tired, no matter how many hours of sleep I get, and I have no motivation to do pretty much anything anymore.
Now, let’s backtrack to the beginning of this semester. I went through a really intense week of RA training before the residents came. It was a really hard week for me and I started feeling like I could not do this job. However, the first month of the job seemed to go fine- I’m good at desk duty, I got the hang of duty nights pretty quickly, I bonded with my co-workers, etc. I started feeling a lot better about the job. I was assigned a hall of 60-ish freshmen. Everything with them seemed to be fine, although it is not the most social hall. 
In early October, I had to deal with my first real “incident.” I am not the best with conflict but I’ve been really trying to improve on that, and while I was ultimately able to help the situation, I felt as though I could have handled it better. I reached out to my RD to ask for help/advice about handling this incident, since it was my first real incident, but my reaching out to her made her lose confidence in my ability to do my job. Additionally, after this incident, I found out that my residents had made a group chat without me and that some of the residents had been having conflicts with each other without telling me. Suddenly my hall, which I thought I had been getting to know, had all these issues I didn’t know about. None of my residents were coming to me about their conflicts. Later that month, some of my residents vandalized my bulletin boards, and some of the other RAs told me that all the “bad”/troublemaker kids were in my hall. That was a rough month, but then the issues finally seemed to start dying down. I started to feel more confident in my job performance again, and I’ve become better with dealing with resident conflicts.
Our RD does check-ins with us every other week. Yesterday, I went in for my check-in and my RD told me that I was failing parts of my job, mainly a) my schedule is too packed to make me “available enough” to my residents, b) apparently some of my residents don’t feel like our hallway is a community, and c) she is not confident in my ability to mediate conflict (even though I’ve successfully mediated other conflicts since the first incident, and additionally, I only reached out to her that one time because it was my first real incident to deal with). In other words, I got a job-performance warning. My RD told me to really think about whether I can keep up with my position. I have never “failed” like this at something before, so obviously I was left a little shaken by this. It’s been a little over 24 hours and I’ve been doing a LOT of thinking and reflecting. I think part of why this warning hit me so hard is because deep down I know she’s right in a way- my busy schedule &amp;  the overwhelmingness of my depression have been getting the best of me, and I know that the way I’m living right now (barely sleeping, terrible eating habits, horrible burn out, etc.) is not sustainable. I talked to my mom on the phone a lot about it and we came up with a game plan to improve my job performance- we brainstormed ways I can make myself more accessible to my residents, we decided I’m going to drop my membership in my time-consuming community service organization (even though I love it), etc. I feel like with this game plan my performance will improve, but now I’m worried I won’t be able to improve enough, and I just don’t know if this job is something I can continue to do anymore. I’ve never been the kind of person who quits things, but the idea is becoming more appealing to me, partially because I want to just be able to focus on making myself better, and partially because I just don’t think my overextended life as an RA is sustainable anymore. I’m going to stick it out the rest of this semester since it’s a month left, and I’ll work on improving my job performance over this next month too, but I’m debating about resigning after that &amp; getting replaced for the spring semester (our school has backup RAs so replacement wont really be an issue for my staff I think). I know that if I quit though I will feel really shameful about it, and I’ll also feel terrible that now my family would have to pay for whatever new place i move into for the spring. 
I was really scared to write this and post it but I no longer know what to do. If anyone has insight about whether I should resign at the end of the semester of not, that would be helpful. Thank you if you read all this."

I'm a senior who is currently applying to undergrad programs.

I was wondering if you guys have any suggestions for what programs I should apply to and what I need to do to make into a top 5 PhD program (i.e. UCB, Stanford, CMU, Caltech, MIT).

I'm mostly interested in what steps I can do as a high schooler to help increase my chances as I hear that these programs are incredibly competitive. I don't think I will be competetive for T20 school but I hope I will get into a T50 school like UW, Colorado School of Mines, Grinell, or RPI for my undergrad (all of which I am happy with). Are there any other good programs for grad placement that I should apply to? Should I take any programs out?

Also, what should I do in order to help me later on? I'm planning on taking some AI related online courses.

Should I try to get a research position (btw, can I get this at a community college in Washington or no) or should I try to get an internship at a company like Microsoft or a startup?

du2zdc,1,2019-11-09,"Dating a short term coworker that has a ""set"" mindset on relationship?",Biims,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/du2zdc/dating_a_short_term_coworker_that_has_a_set/," 

I wish I'd have figured this on my own. I'll try to be as concise as possible. Also sorry for grammar issues, english is not my first language.

TL:DR at the bottom.

I (22M) am currently an intern for my engineering degree, and I'm entering the last year of my contract (3years).

A few months ago, M(23F) joined us for a one year internship too, we're in a big company so there are many ""younglings"" and so as the ""elder"" I've been getting the role of trying to integrate the newcomers so they spend their few years with us in a favorable environnement.

Anyway, we meet each other and let's say we instantly clicked, we agree on a lot of things, find each other funny (I've got a very contagious laugh) and have been mostly talking with each other every day for the past 4 months using either the company's softwares or on our phones.

Now I know what you're thinking, 4 months is far too late to ask someone out, and that's where I've become really confused with myself.

I think this is the first time I've been feeling this kind of attraction to someone, she's absolutly stunning and everything, but her body is probably the last thing on the list that makes my poor heart burn with passion.

She just has that attitude where we'd build tension, again and again until one of us eventually smooth the thing down, for the following reasons :

She told me that she got out of a relationship (Well that what she thought she was into but got deceived by someone who just wanted sex, the guy is an old school friend and they still keep contact) and that she won't be dating for a while (she's talking like a year at least.)

To her having a relationship with someone from the same company is a no-no(which I agree to, but in a year we'll be apart and we barely see each other during the day, she has to make plans just to eat with us sometimes)

I totally respect that, and that's why I haven't asked her yet.

The thing is, I've been trying to figure out these feelings, and I just don't think I can lie to myself, I don't have the strength to fake a friendship where I witness actions that only happens with me (being very close, touchy etc)

I mostly know I'll be rejected, I tried to distance myself but she'd then message me saying she misses me etc

She has been very blunt on a few points, like she wouldn't let me compliment her AT ALL (like proposing an idea, I'd say ""Hey that's smart"" and she would literally threaten to not talk to me anymore) I'm not really experienced myself in terms of sociability and lack tact, so I've been taking notes so I don't do the same mistakes, so we've became closer again.

I was told that what I felt most likely comes from the fact that I'm pursuing something that I can't get, it seems like a very good analysis, but I'm still looking to sort that situation.

My question is : Should I just go for it, knowing I'll likely get rejected or just explain to her that I somehow catched feeling and because I understand her situation I'd like to distance myself?

Thanks in advance for any answer

TL:DR : Caught feelings for a short term coworker after being very close for a while, know she doesn't want a relationship, want to confess so I can move on"

About a month ago, I was given the opportunity to intern in Europe for 8 months (we both in montreal) and its been a dream of mine to work abroad and travel while im there. When I broke the news to her, I could tell she was trying her hardest to be happy for me but it was clear that she was very very sad to hear it. 

We've been together for over 2 years and I love her very much. The ""real"" issue is that I'm pretty much her everything. And by that I mean that she doesnt really have friends or other people she can truly blindly trust. Of course she knows all of my friends but she isnt comfortable hanging out with any of them without me being there and thats fine. When I leave in january, I wont be there physically for her if she needs me. Of course, i'll be there on facetime and on the phone but never physically. This means she'll need to find another source of emotional and psychological support from another person. Shes been quite depressed and stressed for the past few weeks (school is also playing a role in the stress and anxiety). I keep telling her that everything is going to be ok and that she can visite whenever and that we can travel together but i think she needs to hear it from somebody else. 

Shes obviously depressed because im leaving and i cant do or say anything to help because im the cause. Part of me wants to give her space and time but we dont have lots of that anymore because finals are coming up soon and then ill be gone soon after. Its pretty much like everytime she thinks about me leaving, she gets sad and then mad at me and then doesnt want to talk to me. I cant blame her to be honest. Because she doesnt have any friends, she also cant vent and let out her thoughts and emotions out. I have losely recommended she see a therapist. I plan on telling all my close friends to check in on her and ask her to hang out. 

Im just not quite sure how to handle this. Im really hoping that me going away for a bit is a blessing in disguise and shes able to find a solid group of friends and find it in her to not rely so heavily on me for emotional, physical and psychological support. I think thats just wishful thinking though. 

Any and all thoughts would be amazing and thank you so much for reading all the way through."

We started working together since late august and when I first saw her I thought she was kind of cute but to be honest I didn’t really had any interest towards her at first. We then started to talk a lot more at work, we would talk for a long time and we would even sometimes talk for the whole work shift. Around mid october is when I started to really catch feelings for her, Sure she is beautiful but I honestly started to catch feelings for her because of her personality. This is the first time I genuinely like someone because of their personality, everytime I talk to her I feel like all my problems go away, she has a smile that can make the saddest person on earth smile and her eyes are just beautiful. We have hanged out once and I think it went pretty well, we grab some food and talked for like 5 hours, we talked about life, school, our families, goals, and a bunch of other random stuff. I’m gonna try to hang out with her more but at the same time i’m not trying to be too clingy. I’m eventually gonna tell her how I feel, I will most likely tell her after her internship is over because I don’t want to make things awkward."

In high school, I was one of the slim, fit, popular girls. My friend group consisted of the elite, cheerleaders, football players, soon to be fraternity and sorority members, you get the picture. We were so judgmental, we would bully those who we felt were inferior. I could get any guy I wanted and even any girl if that’s what I was looking for.

My body was picture perfect, slim and petite. My small tits were perky and firm. My stomach and waist were thin. My ass was a round, perky bubble butt. My face was like a goddess. My thighs were toned and had a considerable gap. My arms were thin with a slight hint of muscle.

However, college hasn’t been so good to me. I attend an elite university in one of their most difficult programs. Add to that I work a part-time job to help pay with my tuition. Add to that an internship and you can imagine the time constraints and the stress I have.
So, what did I do? I began to stress eat and choose the more convenient food options. Breakfast was at Dunkin Donuts every morning. A large iced-coffee with extra cream and sugar, a bagel with cream cheese, and a donut (maybe two). I usually skip lunch, but if I do eat its usually at a fast food restaurant. For dinner, I usually stop for take-out, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, you name it.  And of course, I snacked all the time.

The effects of my poor eating habits and lack of exercise quickly added up. My belly ballooned out falling over the waist band of all of pants and my panties. It’s a clear muffin top. My hips extended far out complimented by my pasty white thighs squeezed together, full thunder thighs. My back has back rolls and love handles. My face is a round moon face, complete with a double chin. I have officially become a chubby girl.

Some scenarios:

Greek life hazing. I’d like to be part of the rush process. Subjected to the harsh humiliation of the sorority and fraternity members.



A dystopian world where fat girls like me are subjected to weigh ins, imprisonment, and humiliation for our weight. .

I have been a  lurker of UKPF for a while now (on different accounts) and had some queries generally relating to careers. I realise this may not be completely UKPF related, so my apologies in advance if so.

I have been fortunate enough to gain multiple internships and placement experiences during my degree course which has been helpful in the graduate job hunt. Such that I have recently been offered a graduate scheme after an assessment centre. This is great I have something secured, but it is quite early on in the year and I still have applications in the pipeline for various other companies which I would like to consider. I currently have one more assessment centre coming up and fairly confident I could get a few more still. I realise I am in a lucky position but I would like to see the outcome of my other applications before making a final decision as I feel this will allow me to choose the best grad job. The following are some things that I am very unsure of and would be grateful if you can provide any input on:

1. Is it possible to accept a graduate role (singed contract), only to potentially back out for a better opportunity later on? How is this kind of situation best approached?
2. Should I even be considering the salary of a job at this stage as a deciding factor? Most positions I have applied for offer £28-33k.
3. Should I try to negotiate on graduate salaries considering they all seem to offer the similar salaries anyway?
4. Is it too early to consider pension contributions? For example, the current job offer I have, the company will contribute up to 5% but there are other applications which have significantly better pensions. Going by the half your age rule, this will mean I must contribute more with this company over some others.
5. Is there anything else I should be considering?

Thanks guys!"

I'm seeking to recreate some of those crude, obscene moments in roleplay with you wonderful, sleazy, perverse men. Whether it's Tinder, sliding into my DM's on Insta even though I'm not looking, retweeting my bikini pictures on Twitter or god knows what, I'm looking for fun scenarios based on how social media ends up with me getting my pretty little bald cunt jammed full of heavy cockmeat.

Maybe one of us matches with you across the room at a party, maybe [**I'm**](https://external-preview.redd.it/lsRgFdepwRHzn8DHGY0Mr2KYQAv0qRpC9pf24hcw4ps.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a4ecb49c66058c72bd791043d595cf363f8e2937) the little fittie who comes through your regular coffee shop every morning with my yoga pants **buried in the crack of my taut young backside**, and you can't help but notice the fact my thong is always neon bright.

Maybe you convinced [**me**](https://i.redd.it/rgn5padvflj31.jpg) to give you a handjob at Halloween in that **totally quiet corner of a party, babe** while I was hopped up on Molly, and you just happened to match with me on Tinder, but can't remember anything about me. Except that smeared into that blood stain on my pretty little Halloween outfit is a pinkish tint of your cum, as you took that photograph after I **swallowed your load.**

Maybe I'm your brother's little girlfriend, and you can see me online when I'm meant to be sick as opposed to seeing him at college. Maybe [I'm](https://i.redd.it/01zio494rtm31.jpg)your **son's ex** who you can't help but imagine throat-fucking while you lay in bed next to your bloated wife, your mammoth cock leaking precum all over the phone screen at my photograph, mentally pondering how you're planning to **nut in my underwear** that I left at your son's and I'm coming to collect tomorrow.

Maybe I'm your new, coquettish young intern, straight out of college, and the moment you see me in my little leather skirt (as opposed to the drab ones I wear to the office), you book me onto your next business trip. With a selection of little outfits for me to be more **professional** in while I'm on my knees. You'll work out how you get me there later.

Maybe **I'm** your sister who you took along to your festival with your buddies, and you can see the light on in my tent as I **hunt some cock on Tinder** after I left you with a raging boner all day. Maybe [I'm](https://i.redd.it/kd3cz1lgexr31.jpg) that dweeb at school's girlfriend that you have no idea how he got such a catch, and you just want to **stretch my tight little nerd arsehole** over your heavy jock-cock.

Maybe I'm your wife's younger sister on a family vacation, **who keeps forgetting to put panties on**. And posts \*so\* many photos of her round, thick backside that you can't resist saying something crude. Maybe I'm your wife's mother, **posting nudes around my husband's back on a private Instagram**, but you recognise my porch in the background.

***Kinks:*** **Detailed responses,** age differences, **all things anal** (I'm a little buttslut), **interracial (BBC &lt;3),** outfit play (dress up, **please send prompts**), oral (particularly with **heavy, huge cocks**), messy facials and cumplay, **dirty talk**, titfucking, **crude scenarios and creativity**, CHEATING, **sleazy men**

Try your luck - sketch out a scenario and a girl, and let me know how you try to get into their pants. Some of them are sluttier and easier, some of them are harder to get. Some of them are secretly on Tinder, some of them will be shocked when you try send a Dick Pic. If you fail once, try again. The more detail the better.  There's a version of this post with way more links on my profile, too.

Happy to create together, but if you want the best response please hit me up with a detailed idea for a scene you would like to take forward! I'm quite picky and spelling/grammar, but please take the time to give me a little detail, tell me about your favourite kinks (and what you like), and give me something to go from and respond to! My preferred medium is \*reddit chat\*.

**Maria** **- Selfie obsessed,** has an ass that could break the internet, dating your best friend.

**Natasha** **- Spends all of her time at the gym pulling squats**, wears the tightest little shorts you've ever seen, **renowned as being a bit of a prude**

**Caitlin** **- Bit of a drunken mess, super easy, might have dated your best friend**. Sucks a mean dick.

**Sarah &amp; Olivia** **- Best of friends, meaning you can play them off against each other**

du5vt3,1,2019-11-09,Marvel Rp Idea,MisterMissAnon,Roleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/du5vt3/marvel_rp_idea/,"So im looking someone to play either Deadpool, Spiderman or Tony Stark for a canon x oc roleplay. Here's some information on the oc (this is the same oc from my other post)
Name: Dark (Damien) Nightshade
Sexuality: Homosexual
Hair style: Orange, long and semi straight
Body: Pale, freckled face, curvy
Eye color: Lapis blue
Powers?: He is able to turn into a demon looking creature, in this form he is called Demon. This form is big and semi long, his skin is inky looking and a dark blue, his hair is long(er) and black, his eyes are completely black and he has some sort of animal skull on his head as a mask or helmey of sorts. In this form his body contorts and his back legs (mostly his feet) look more animal like and his arms are longer with claw like hands. He also has a deep echoy demonic voice while he is Demon.

I have a few ideas for all three characters, but here are the main ones:

TONY- Dark had been offered an internship with Tony and being a big fan he accepts. A few months into the internship he begins to get feelings towards Tony but he doesn't want to tell him because 1) Tony things he's a girl, and 2) he's afraid Tony will spark something in him if he agrees to be with him and he can't let Tony see Demon. So, he collectively decides to push his desires aside and doesn't say anything when Tony keeps sleeping around. (Pepper is with someone else in this, who she's with can be up to you) One day the two fight over something (probably Demon who at this point has been showing up around the city) which ends with the internship ending and Tony cutting communications with Dark. All the emotions are too much for Dark to handle and he flips out, after getting most of his stuff together he decides to put himself at risk as Demon, he does have some perks as Demon after all and he could help people. One day he bites off more then he can chew when he goes into a burning building. The roof collapses and Demon must hold it up while everyone else quickly leaves. He goes to follow but he realizes something, if he lets go of the roof then it might collapse before he even gets to the exit. He tried to wait but he feels the fire burn him and soon he risks it, but what he fears comes true when the roof comes down. His cousin, Moona, notices the large crash and faintly sees Demon pinned in the fire. She screams for him and tries to rush in but firefighters hold her back, the building is too unstable now and even if they wanted to they can't risk dragging Demon out. Demon loosing both strength and consciousness reverts back to Dark with black hair and black hands, and finally passes out. Tony sees what's going on via the news and decides he should help. When he gets there Moona, how being held back by three men screams Dark's nickname (Dark) at the top of her lungs hoping he'd hear her and somehow find some unknown strength to crawl out. 

SPIDERMAN- Peter had met Dark in school and quickly became friends with him. After a while Peter began to notice something was off with Dark, like how his hair in the dark sometimes looked black, or how his hands seemed to get a bit bigger when he got agitated, etc. One day Peter follows Dark (as Spiderman) and sees Dark change into Demon.

DEADPOOL- Wade is out (as Deadpool) shooting bad guys when he is interupted by a large figure leaping over him and landing in front of him, the creature faces the men and picks one of them up, jumping up onto a nearby building and interrogating the man while holding him by his teeth. When he gets his answers he throws the man onto the other two men, not killing them but definitely breaking many of their bones. Wade quickly gets curious about the demonic figure and shouts something to him. After a while they become friends and after that Wade finds out (accidentally) that Demon is not the creatures real form and that he is in fact human. So naturally Wade follows him and sees Dark as, well Dark, for the first time."

du7175,1,2019-11-09,Reaching for some sort of breakthrough here,megpoids,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/du7175/reaching_for_some_sort_of_breakthrough_here/,"I am fortunate enough to have a lot of wonderful things going for me in my life. I have one semester left in my education degree, I've networked my way into an amazing internship, I have an amazing boyfriend, and I have the kindest, most supportive friends I could ever ask for that I love very much.

However, nothing makes me happy anymore.

I only feel any shred of comfort when I'm taking care of academic/career responsibilities or too distracted by social obligations I can't get out of. I take absolutely no joy in any of my recreational interests anymore; if anything, my hobbies and favorite things make me more anxious than anything lately because I'm so perplexed over why I feel no joy. I do not remember how to maintain connections with people, nor do I honestly have any desire to. I don't connect with anyone I care about anymore to the extent that I cannot for the life of me bring myself to hold a two-sided conversation. All I know how to do is just listen to other people and respond with the same couple of nonsensical phrases during awkward silences. I'm engaged in my studies and my career development because I have to be, but the moment I leave the workplace, I completely shut down into nothing. Everything I used to do that gives me joy is just a chore at this point to waste the limited time I have within my life until I inevitably pass on. All I can do is keep up with my career and maintain the image that I'm trying to take care of myself to my loved ones that are all increasingly worried sick about me.

I'm not suicidal, nor do I have any intention of self-harming. I have struggled with clinical depression in the past, but I've always coped by throwing myself into my hobbies, my social obligations, and my responsibilities. This level of escapism and distraction just simply does not work anymore. I do not have the time or money for therapy at this point in my life. I've opened up to a couple of people about this hoping that talking to someone would help, but all it does is make me more uncomfortable putting this burden on the loved ones I honestly don't even feel okay keeping any ties with anymore. I want everything and everyone to go away because its easier, but I honestly crave and desire the ability and knowledge to feel human with other humans again.

I typed this in a stream of consciousness; if anything needs clarification, please let me know and I'll be happy to try and be more coherent. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore, and I'm terrified that it will only get more unbearable as I push through life. I know I cannot fix my depression, but I've always been good at coping with it. It just seems my mind and body have grown numb to my lifelong coping mechanisms. I don't know what else to do. I'm burned out by everything that once made me feel artificial joy.

I'm genuinely appreciative of anything that anyone has to say. Thank you."
du8hvr,1,2019-11-10,41 M4F - On Call,TheHG22,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/du8hvr/41_m4f_on_call/,"""What!?!""  I ask as I see my wife putting on a sexy, but semi-conservative dress, ""I thought you were staying in tonight.""

""Sweety, I'm so sorry,"" she said with a very sympathetic look ""I know I was supposed to take care of you tonight, but Liz just called while you were in the shower and she really needs a friend right now.  I'm gonna grab a few drinks with her.""

""Ugh..."" I sigh, ""OK.  OK.  I've been saving it up all for you this week and I'm about to explode!""

""Well, since I'm the one bailing, I'll let you use your on-call girl tonight"" she replied.  

""Who is it tonight?"" I asked starting to get excited...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK.  So for this RP, I want you to play two women - my wife and the on-call girl who I get to use a few times a year when my wife gives me permission.  The on-call girl is always someone we know, and my wife set them all up. 

My wife is a very organized woman.  So basically, she put together a calendar and got every day scheduled about two or three months in advance.  All of them knew the deal - if you're on call, you MIGHT get a call from me and if you do, you're supposed to come by and give me head until I don't need it anymore.

So, for tonight, I want you to respond to my question about who it is with one of the following and I want to play the night out with you, my on-call woman:

Amanda:  My wife's super-slutty friend.  

Jill:  Her mom was a huge slut when I was in college and I used to fuck her.  My wife's firm just hired Jill and told me about her...about how slutty and sexy she was.  I asked to see a pic and I immediately recognized her.  Long-story short, Jill was just as slutty, maybe even more, than her mom.  So when my wife asked her about me, she jumped at it...and she knows her mom's history with me, but she doesn't care at all.

Brittany:  Another co-worker of my wife's - actually an intern.  She just turned 21 and is a big-titted, blonde slut.  She's been 21 for six months and still never paid for her own drink.

Lizzy:  One night when I was allowed to use the on call, the woman who was had to bail.  My wife made me a Tinder account to find a replacement...Lizzy was it.  And she was good.  My wife liked her, so she stayed in the mix.

Gillian:  Has a GREAT rack and an almost unmatched enthusiasm for sucking cock.  She's a friend of my ex-girlfriend that my wife has met a few times cause she hangs out at some of the same places we do and we always say hi.  My wife quickly recruited her when she saw how slutty she was dressed.

Bridgette:  Married woman about two doors down.  She is a super MILF with a great body and her hubby is away a lot.  She'd never get permission from hubby to do this so she'd rather hope not to get caught and ask for forgiveness if she does.

Ashley:  A thick, sexy, super slutty former co-worker and hookup of mine who happens to still live nearby.

Your Idea:  Tell me/show me another character you want to play.

A Porn Star:  Through my wife's firm, she represents many in the entertainment industry, including the adult industry.  Her clients that I'm into are:  Dayna Vendetta, Angela White, Abbey Brooks, Audrey Bitoni, Vicky Vette, Dylan Ryder, Leslie Zen, Tory Lane, and Jenna Haze.  You can pick any one (or more).

So if you're still with me, get in touch, and tell me who you want to play.  I can show you what I envision any of these potential characters look like, but am also open to suggestions you have!  I can also give you more background on the type of character I want my wife to play too, but you can probably already gather that she's sexy, confident, and always looking out for me.

With the right partner, I think this can be a lot of fun, so get in touch soon and light up that orange envelope!"
du8nej,3,2019-11-10,I (19F) was harassed by my friend's (32F) addicted boyfriend (37M) and she can't see their relationship is probably abusive.,vns2a00,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/du8nej/i_19f_was_harassed_by_my_friends_32f_addicted/,"This will be a long post, sorry, but I need help/advice/ideas and this is all too complicated for my point of view right now... If you can say something it would help me a lot...

&amp;#x200B;

So I (18-19F) came to a new city (in brazil) for college in March and met this girl (32F) on our boarding house, we became BFFs really fast and I love and trust her a lot. She is a young soul and really fun and nice to everybody. We have gone out some times, mostly to rock concerts, and she met this guy (37M) one night, then they started seeing each other. He is a musical producer and she spent a LOT of time in his house in the course of the three months that followed, they would go out and I would go together to some rock concerts, I usually spent these nights in his house with them, downstairs in the couch while they slept in his room, we've even gone to a weekend trip once and I met his mother. It was clear how much she liked him. And it seemed it was the same for him.

But the thing here is, he is an addict. He smokes all day and inhales some times, he has lots of really good quality pot from friends that plant it (here it is illegal) and he can't stay without it, he drinks all day and pulls all-nighters quite often, he is used to it.

But my friend is not.

She would try to follow him, smoke a lot than drink a lot an go out and drink/smoke some more and get home after the sunrise... Se couldn't take it and ended up falling over and acting drunk and getting unconscious... I was usually there to help, but when I wasn't the guy had no patience, he knew some of the people in the places they went and got really ashamed and annoyed because of the way she acted, he would usually fight with her over it when she wakes up the next day. Always being disrespectful and calling her crazy and possessed and saying he couldn't trust her. It happened mostly the days he would do c.

Another thing is, he had been with a pretty bad woman before, that cheated on him with other women in front of him and his friends, that would disturb his shows, that would act crazy in front of his friends... (friend said this to me)

He thought she would do the same, but she wouldn't, she was really in love with him. She is normally fun and extroverted and clumsy and a little loud. The things he despised was the part that was still her.

But apart from all this, he was a nice person to be around when kinda sober: kind, interesting, exhilarating, and she really liked him, they got along.

In July she ended her thesis and had gone back to her city. But before our winter vacations, his band had a debut show and she came to see them, and I did too. It was all ok, she stayed at his house and helped them prepare the place and merch for the show, it went all too well till the end of the show, but she had smoked and drunk a lot and was already tipsy. We went somewhere to eat before getting home and there he started getting annoyed at her, she was almost sleeping in the table in the sidewalk.

Then my bigger problem stated. We got to his house and I helped her sit and drink some water while talking to the guy about some music stuff, then I got her to sleep upstairs and he decided to stay downstairs for some reason, so we continued talking. But he started getting too close. He started touching my arm and hugging me. I tried to make sense of it and ask him to get further from me. When I saw he had me against the table trying to talk me to the couch, saying my friend was crazy and he couldn't trust her, saying he saw a girl all over her and a guy almost getting her number before he ""interfered"", saying she would've stayed with the vocalist of the other band if he wasn't there. She wouldn't. I told him to go to sleep and he went upstairs. I had to spend the 'night'. Got out as fast as I could, but not before hearing them talking about marriage and living together. It made me sick. The only thing I said to him was ""Don't fuck with my friend"".

After that, I tried to speak to her in person, but she had already gone back to her city, so I called her and told her everything and, thank god, she believed me, she knows I wouldn't lie about it. But she still wanted to stay with him and help him seeing not all the girls are the way he thought... She is a grown woman, I can't tell her what to do, but it didn't feel right.

I, then, unfortunately, tried to tell him he would lose her if he didn't treat his trust issues, which led to me being his ""psychiatrist"" for three hours straight. I cried for two days.

Sometime after that, I got caught up in my own problems and I don't chat by messages that often. She started actually dating him. I would see pictures of them in vacation or whatever and though they had sorted this out. Some time ago she told me she left her job and was coming to stay in his house and try getting a place as an intern in our uni. I felt weird but ok, happy she was coming back.

Yesterday we went out plus another friend (21F) from the boarding house, but he was there too. It was the first time I saw him afterward. When they came (2h late) and I saw him I panicked, got some water and alcohol and dissociated during the time he was there, I had to stay far for a while but he came to ""go to the bathroom"", tried to talk with me and ask if I was ok, I asked if HE was ok, he understood and said he/they were fine. When the place closed at 2 they tried to tell me and the other friend go to another place but we went home, they stayed.

Five in the morning I wake up to my phone vibrating. He sent me a bunch of messages saying all the same things and made videos of her, drunk, so he could ""prove what he says"" since we all ""don't believe him"". So I finally told him to fuck off and stop giving her drugs since he has a massive heritage but she doesn't, he is dragging her to the same hole he fell in but she won't have a way out or a life made as he does, and most of all to stop pissing me off because I'm not paid to be a counselor to abusive people. Then he did what he always does, tried to guilt-trip me into thinking I am a bad friend because i ""don't care if she gets unconscious and out of her mind"" as he does. I do care about her. He cares about the ""friends"" that saw her like that yesterday... Then told me I had to take care of her because he is getting out of her life.

Any time now my friend can have her ass kicked by him with probably no place to stay, the other friend can keep her for a week, maybe she can stay here a little while if needed, otherwise, she'll have to come back to her city and possibly be unable to try for the internship and have difficulties finding a job there.

I don't know what to do, she sent me a message apologizing for him and clearly still likes him and think she is the one guilty of all this. Is this abuse? If it is how do I tell her? How do I show what he's doing to her, and how do I help her set boundaries for her relationships and the substances she is using?

TL;DR: Friend started dating an addict that got mad at her getting drunk, wanted to f\* me because of it and thinks of dumping her now that she is living with him. She still loves him.

du8obf,5,2019-11-10,My NoFap Journey,bestchampion1,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/du8obf/my_nofap_journey/,"I just wanted to share the benefits I personally found with this.

1) 1 year 2 months ago - stopped watching porn. By now I have almost zero desire to watch porn, now of course I want to see naked women but I have zero desire to masturbate hunched in a bathroom to someone getting laid. The best comparison I saw was just imagine if it wasn’t a phone and someone just let you watch them have sex while you jerk off in the corner - sad.
Ive also heard porn gives you disgusting fetishes, thankfully I never got to such extremes but even the minor ones I had are completely gone now.

2) 3 months ago stopped sending/receiving nudes.  This was big for me because I felt “confident” because I got a girl to send me her nudes, I enjoyed it more than porn because it was personal to me but in reality I hated myself for wasting hours daily talking to multiple girls at once trying to get the conversation dirty and although it worked a lot it was complete stupidity. The reality of it is was that I was so UNCONFIDENT about how they would perceive me in person that I felt safe behind my phone screen because they can see only what I let them, I would even go as far as to say I was more addicted to getting the photos than I was to masturbating (although I obviously did that too every time I got them)

3) 2 months ago - stopped masturbating. When I finally made the conscious decision to stop it was one of the best decisions of my life, the amount of time i have to do the things I actually want to do is amazing, when I first started with stopping porn I used that time to learn piano instead and now I just aced my ABRSM grade 4 exams with a 130/150! (I had practiced a lot).  I go to the gym 5-6 days a week now and I also do a lot of studying into computer science as well as electrical engineering, and started to intern at a real estate firm and I’m moving up steadily in the business. The point is is that I decided to use my time PRODUCTIVELY and do what I want to and be proactive about it and I get to accomplish these things.

4) Now I could list all of the other benefits of nofap such as higher dopamine etc. but I really just wanted to point out that being productive and stopping instant gratification is one of the real ways to become fruitful and happy in life.

5) Bonus: Yes I am pulling girls now, I have true confidence and have no problem approaching girls and I have equally just as no problem being rejected (and the crazy thing is it doesn’t happen NEARLY as much as you’d think). Although I think I will try going for a real relationship because I think it will have much more meaning to me.
Thanks for reading:)"
du8stc,81,2019-11-10,Should I quit this culinary job?,interheroes,AskCulinary,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/du8stc/should_i_quit_this_culinary_job/,"I have worked at this place for almost two years.

I plan to quit a job that used to trained me from grill, saute, fry, pantry, and brunch as a seasonal cook to intern cook and part time cook. This year, few of the guys I know who are kind to me left the job due to the company not treating workers wells with the exception of the old line cook. The executive chef cut off pays from a full time lead line cook to part time, promised me to learn more besides prepping produces. My chef promised me that I can get creative during the summer menu however this year was not the part where I needed to be. I just realized when I walked in the chef's office, I am the only one who gets paid less compared to the part and full time cooks.  I was normally a seasonal cook however I pleaded last year with my executive chef if I can work on the weekends due to school. Currently, I work part time on the weekends due to schooling.  After summer has winded down I decided to quit by finishing my college degree and finding a job related to the kitchen work where I will grow as a person. My graduation plan is next Spring and I decided to intern/work at a better place.  I am not after for the paycheck, here for a personal growth.

Cook #1 was the guy I look after but had to resign due to his explosive behavior at work even though he is kind to me and teaches me everything when he is in a good mood. I pay him in kindness and jokes in able for me to learn.

Cook #2 is the legend cook that worked at a private resort for over 30 years and had to retire due to surgery. He motivates me like a coach and a friend to me.

Cook #3 got promoted to a sous chef at another job that he teaches me each and everything from sense of urgency, organization, patience, and plating. Very nice guy that he is young and old-fashioned.

Job opportunities are offered to me:

I recall a moment where my mentor suggested me a job at a private sector (hospital) for high volume kitchen production where it is paid.

One church member recommended me to work at a bakery to learn how to bake. (I would take baking to learn more)."

dua6ur,5,2019-11-10,Should I keep working?,sta6,RSI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSI/comments/dua6ur/should_i_keep_working/,"So I have been struggling with carpal tunnel syndrome for the last 10 months.

In the beginning, I was lucky enough to have a 6-month break, to rest my wrists. I would even say that it was slowly getting better, but then I started a two month internship where the workplace was not ergonomic at all. after one week of working there my hands and wrists were burning like hell.

For the remainder of the time I spent there I improved the ergonomics of my workplace and even got a cortisone shot into my wrists which slightly improved my situation there but I was going everyday to work without knowing how good or bad my wrists would feel after a couple hours of work. so I got the situation to not escalate any further but I wouldn't say that I got it under control.

Now I started a full-time job and without wearing braces I have daily pains while working. I know that stretching and physiotherapy is very important to recover but my wrist so far have been usually aggravated or irritated from stretching. so in a way I'm stuck.

I have to work which keeps my wrist aggravated, which makes it very hard for my wrist to recover which in turn makes it very hard to start stretching exercises.

so what should I do? I hope that in the next few weeks, I will be able to decrease the irritation of my wrists and then slowly and carefully I will start to do stretching exercises.

I hope this works because if not I might be able to forced to quit my job or ask for a sick leave for an undisclosed amount of time.

What do you guys think?"
duaou7,3,2019-11-10,Am I good enough for MOT?,sadlimon,OccupationalTherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OccupationalTherapy/comments/duaou7/am_i_good_enough_for_mot/,"Hi all, I just graduated from my first undergrad and want to apply for MOT, have my eyes on McGill QY/Western MOT in Canada now since it's more affordable for international students. Since my undergrad degree isn't relevant, I'm just not sure if my grades and experience are enough, so please give me a reality check! Any feedback or advice on how to improve as a candidate is welcomed. 

Degree: not OT-relevant, SocSc student majoring in Poli Sci and Literature

cGPA:  3.66/4.3. McGill - cGPA: 3.6 ish , sGPA: 3.78/4.0

Relevant experience: 

* shadowing OTs in a pediatric facility in early intervention programs for over 100 hours
* full-time work in a primary school as a SEN teaching assistant since the summer (working with kids with ADHD, autism, etc)
* one year as a committee member in a uni student society focusing on psychological well-being (community mental health awareness etc)
* one semester as a research assistant (non-clinical though)
* four years teaching children from 6-12 in both one-on-one and class settings

Other experience:

* four internships (primarily in NGOs/digital fundraising/marketing - both creative and analytical sides)
* volunteer in a local heritage site - event management
* one semester abroad in Europe

\*\*\* want to diversify my volunteer experience (signed up for psyc rehab volunteering) but simply got no time left now

I actually had the grades to enter the local OT undergrad program four years ago but I was too depressed back then for healthcare :( Bumps me a lot every time I think about it since I think I wasted so much time since. Regardless, I think I matured a lot and my social skills also improved so I'm a better candidate than before. Thought I'd pursue digital fundraising for NGO at one point, but thought life's too short and I prefer to help people directly and I love how OTs help people regain their agency. 

Also, please share your thoughts on McGill MOT/QY or Western MOT if you've heard anything about it. Thanks!

TLTR: fresh grad wondering if my profile is enough for MOT/looking for ways to improve my application"
duaydt,352,2019-11-10,"Criticize my interview process, get blacklisted practically everywhere!",D15c0untMD,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/duaydt/criticize_my_interview_process_get_blacklisted/,"Recently i posted about my GREAT experience with a hiring manager who actively sabotaged my job hunt for over a year before i could bypass him this summer. I did some digging and asking around and i think now i can pinpoint where i went “wrong” in his mind.

I graduated from med school in September 2016, and started interviewing right away. In my state (in a small central european country), most hospitals are run by the same trust, and also have over 90% of all residency posts. Because this HM didn’t like an answer i gave at one of the earliest interviews, he decided to blacklist me in ALL of the trust, but not inform me and rather have me looking and looking and looking.

Well, i finally found out what rubbed him the wrong way: 

In best bad hiring practice, during the interview for my internship, i was told to pick one from a pile of face down cards. On it was a scenario i should solve. Went something like this: 

you are an intern on your first night shift at the psychiatric clinic. At around 2 o’clock the police drops off a woman with no papers they picked up at the southern border while crossing illegally (this was during the aftermath of the 2015 refugee crisis). They say she was seeming anxious and panicked but spoke only a foreign language and no further identification was possible, so they drop her off for treatment and leave. Upon further inspection she seems to have no physical injuries but is still experiencing anxiety. You consult with your attending over the phone, who orders you to discharge her since she is not injured and unlikely to be a danger to herself or others, and we don’t have free beds anyways.

What do you do?

So, obviously i had to think about this trainwreck of a situation. When asked, they mainly wanted to know if i would follow my attendings orders and send her away or if i would admit her regardless.

I told them that i have trouble giving a clear answer here, as i not only lack critical information (they where surprised when i asked for some clarifications) but also see legal problems with this scenario. If i would go with some prior assumptions (like, no consults from other departments possible, no free beds in other wings avaliable, no translator avaliable at this time, etc), i would lean towards admitting her regardless, start medication for the anxiety attack, get a translator first thing in the morning, take a proper history and go from there. In reality though, your boss is always right and if he won’t admit her, there’s really not a lot i can do, besides letting her hang out in the lobby.

Most important problem i had was that i am not a member of the border police. Releasing an undocumented illegal immigrant with no identification, unclear medical and criminal history into the night is legally troubling and can get me and my attending in serious trouble, since it would basically be aiding in illegal immigration. I felt it would be very odd for the border police to just drop a suspect off at a hospital and leave. So, we would have to admit her anyway, if only to avoid putting myself in legal jeopardy.

Apparently i was deemed “unable to recognize authority” and “unable to follow along with this simple scenario”, according to a guy who knows HM.
And that has cost me a year in my career.

Last i heard they still ask this question a few times at the quarterly interviewing rounds for new interns."
dubar1,2,2019-11-10,Just here to share my story about my (age 27) manipulated love life with my girlfriend ( age 26),boomsshard,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dubar1/just_here_to_share_my_story_about_my_age_27/,"So let's start from the beginning I was dating a girl since I was 17 years old she was a year younger (16years) to me this was in 2009. Everything was going on beautifully for the first two years. She migrated the city and moved to another metropolitan city 2 hours away from me for further studies. 
A year later I moved abroad to another country to study, everything was going fine between the two of us we used to talk everyday Skype as well. I came back for Christmas and surprised her she was so happy about it. After I went back I never felt like studying there and being apart from her. I purposely did not study for my finals and ended up failing so I could live here in the country and meet her more often. 
It was going on very smooth almost every week I used to spend a day with her by travelling to her city and staying the night. We used to do everything she loved, fights were never an issue I was quite understanding about her feelings. I started to work with my father in 2016 in the family business that's when things started to take a toll. 
I couldn't meet her every week and she started avoiding me a lot. I used to make plans to meet her but she used to be busy always studying or attending some internships. Uptill 2016 we always used to talk about marriage and how well enjoy spending time with each other after it. But she stopped behaving so lovingly then started saying that I don't think I want to ever marry and all. I used to feel bad but then I used to be like this is a phase in everyone's life she will get over it.
 In 2017 January I had her Instagram password and as I was off Instagram at that time due to heavy usage I logged in to check my friends first poem post from her account. That's when the picture started to become clear about everything. There was a guy whom I had asked her to avoid but she always told me off by saying he's 3 years younger to me he's like a kid brother. 
It was a post sent to her by him about twin souls and how her &amp; his sunsign were twin souls. I blasted off the next morning at her but she denied everything and said she had asked the guy to stay away. 
She came back in June 2017 to our home town and I thought now she's here things might get back to normal. I used to meet her often we used to go for lots of dates and dinners. But she was always distanced in the physical way. It was my birthday in May and like every time we decided to go for an outing and spend time. 
This time she asked me to stay away from her and I obliged she said she thought I only wanted physical.
 I never touched her again after that. We weren't normal she started avoiding me a lot used to always travel to the other city citing various reasons to me. I gave her space after this but I never stopped loving her. 
Then came my birthday in May 2018  this time I decided to spend time with my family and I went for an outing with them. I came back after spending time and met her in a mall she gave me a cake and we cut it. She asked for a break and I was furious but I let her have it.
 In June 2018 I was calling her and her call was on wait for more than 4 hours. She picked up and started abusing me sayings it's over I couldn't understand what was happening and begged her to meet me. She told me in 3 days she would meet me, trust me those three days are one of the worst days of my life I never stopped crying. She met me and she told me she liked another guy the same guy from the Instagram chat.
 I was heartbroken she even told me she hadn't done anything with him and it was only emotional and she wanted sometime to get over him before she could get back I told her take all the time you need I'll wait.
Her sister called me a few days down and told me how she was in a live in relationship with the guy when she was studying and that left me in a trauma. 
I told my ex I can't carry on with this and I ended it. Months went by and it was November 2018 she used to keep calling me all the time I used to always answer and reply to her messages. Finally I was drunk in November and she got a hold of me at a party. She begged and begged we finally got back. 
Everything was back to normal I forgave her but the trust wasn't there anymore. I gifted her a dog too which she loved. We went for parties, weddings and a lot of social gatherings everyone knew we would get married.
In February 2019 she wanted her dog to attend a dog show we took him there and that's when we met a dog trainer.
 She wanted to get the dog trained from him I agreed even paid a good amount for the fees. Everything was normal until then, she started attending her post grad near my house and we used to meet often, but in April she started to avoid me a lot again and my brain couldn't digest that everything was normal then. I confronted her a lot of times but to no avail she used to fool me into thinking everything was good and that she wanted to marry now and such a thing would never happen again. Finally in July she lost her phone and asked me to track it. 
I logged in to an app to find her phone but the phone had been switched off and couldn't be traced. I used her I'd to login her Facebook and found so many chats with the dog trainer, found food delivery recipets to random addresses. I printed them all out but I couldn't talk to her properly again. I was leaving for a trip with the boys in 2 days I somehow spoke to her for two days and told her that I have bought a book for her about dogs which I would give her when we met. 
I met her an hour before I was leaving and she knew something was wrong. But I kept giving her assurances like she was so good at giving that everything was fine and we would marry. I left after meeting her and gave her the book that was filled with screenshots and photos. 
She called me an hour later saying how could I do this to her and kept calling me and my friends but I asked everyone to block her and I did the same. She has honestly fucked my life up. I left peacefully I switched off my phone and she kept calling me everyday on WhatsApp. I blocked her off there too. 
When I returned she did not contact me ever again but she used to keep asking my friends how I was and what I was upto. 
Four days ago she contacted my friend like 15 times in a day and he was frustrated so he pleaded me to speak to her. I spoke to her and for 30 mins she only cried about how she was being blackmailed by the dog trainer and he forced everything on her.
 I did not want to fall into this anymore. I still felt bad for her because I genuinely thought she might be in trouble so I contacted her father and told him everything. He was shook because he never knew anything about anyone and all she was doing. He confronted her and inturn I started to get her calls. 
She blames me now that I ruined her Life and she told her sister that she was planning on marrying the dog trainer and I ruined everything for her. Her sister was disgusted at her because the dog trainer is a father of two kids aged 17. I don't know what I have done is right or wrong but what ever has happened to me has taught me so much about myself.

TL;DR - This is basically my life summed up in 10 years and how having too much trust in someone can lead to self destruction. You should always trust yourself the most more than any other human no matter how much you love them."
ducji6,5,2019-11-10,Sister Going To Take Out 73k for Student Loans. How much is this going to hurt?,niceguy7326,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/ducji6/sister_going_to_take_out_73k_for_student_loans/,"My sister has her heart set on a college for Education major. She doesn’t want to be local and the college matches the tuition/room and board costs of nearly every college in our state through scholarships. The college, while a private school, does seem to offer a lot in terms of helping her land a job (mandatory internships, on site training) as well as giving her most of the things she’s looking for (nice sports team).

I tried convincing her to go to county college 2 years for free first, but we learned that the college will cost MORE if she transferred over since the scholarships are for 4 year students only (I believe 78k for 2 years). 

How difficult is it for an education major to pay off this level of debt? I personally don’t like the ROI on this, as I ended up saying no to the college of my dreams to go to a school I didn’t like, yet my debt is about 22k for a computer information systems degree. I would of originally owed about 97k had I chose my dream school.

Edit: Not sure what downvote is for. I’m just trying to her steer away from this path but I haven’t been able to yet."
ducuxy,32,2019-11-10,Do I take an interview knowing I probably won’t accept their offer if given to me?,[deleted],AerospaceEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/ducuxy/do_i_take_an_interview_knowing_i_probably_wont/,"So I’m planning to accept my Northrop Grumman internship offer this week and Sierra Nevada just emailed me asking for an interview. I’m 99% sure I’m going to take Northrop because it is in my ideal location, deals a lot with my major and minor, and I could easily see myself accepting a return offer for a full time position after college. 

Sierra Nevada just contacted me to schedule an interview and I’m not sure whether I should take it or let them know I’m accepting a different company. I know the interview would be a good experience but am I taking away an opportunity for someone else (who maybe doesn’t have any other offers) if I do the interview and end up getting offered the job just to deny it?"
ducv52,2,2019-11-10,AITA for not promising to pay the family phone bill when I graduate?,Rennfri,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ducv52/aita_for_not_promising_to_pay_the_family_phone/,"I (26F) just got off the phone with my mother and she acted like I was being really awful, so I’m looking for some second opinions.

Some background: my parents are well off. My mother is an exec and has been making close to half a million dollars a year. I was lucky enough to graduate from college with no debt in part because they were able to pay the remainder after a generous scholarship + my graduating early. Then I worked for a few years, off of their payroll, but they’ve always been generous with gifts. For example, they’ve still invited me and my brother (22M) on family vacations and they helped me with a down payment on my first apartment.

I'm in my second year at law school, and at the onset my mother generously offered to cover whatever I couldn’t. Well, it turns out law school was a good investment in this case—I’m at the top of my class, and landed a summer associateship next year at one of the top firms in the country. The pay from that summer will fully cover my last year’s tuition, and these kinds of internships often result in an offer at market rate after graduation.

Our family is close, and I’ve always told my mother that I would be happy to do for her + my dad in retirement what she did for me + my brother if I could afford it. But she’s also planned very well for retirement, so there’s never been any expectation that they couldn’t cover their own bills.

Well, out of the blue today while we were on the phone my mom told me that she thinks I should cover the “family” cell account when I’ve graduated. The plan would include parents, my brother (graduating from a prestigious college with an engineering degree this year), and me. I expressed confusion because I figured me + bro would be splitting off after graduation. She kept pushing and making excuses about how it would be “cheaper” to all be together (but it definitely wouldn’t be cheaper for me to cover a $400 plan). I wouldn’t fold. I reiterated to her that I would be trying to restore my savings account and budgeting once I started working since I will have depleted my savings completely and basically earned negative income for three years. Then she started pulling out all of the things she’s paid for in the past and asking when I would pay her back for those, if I wouldn’t “even” cover their phone bill. 

It’s not that I wouldn’t try to cover them if they were in actual financial danger (I told her that), but I don’t want her or anyone else to be planning to spend a salary that I’m not even making yet literally over a year in advance. 

But she sounded so legitimately hurt, like I was just throwing her and my father to the wolves and being ungrateful for what they’ve done for me. I know my life has been MONUMENTALLY easier because of their help. But I’ve been taught to make good financial choices, and it seems like a really dumb one to promise to spend money that I don’t have on someone who makes more than 99% of the country. 

AITA? Should I have just agreed to help?

EDIT: Trying to stay under 3000 characters made this more confusing. First: I haven't lived in the family home since I was 21. I paid my own bills from 21-25. Second: Mother's original arrangement was to put me on family payroll while I'm in law school but deplete my savings + let me contribute as much as possible with summer jobs, then come back off the phone plan (and all of the ""shared"" family accounts) and pay for myself completely once I graduate."
dud0sm,4,2019-11-10,Can someone help with interpreting this dream,saminator1002,CarlJung,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarlJung/comments/dud0sm/can_someone_help_with_interpreting_this_dream/,"I had a dream last night which really felt like it signified something of importance, I was in a zombie apocalypse, in a shelter not fully protected because I couldn't close the garage gate, I was with a few people there and sometimes a zombie would walk in and I had to kill it.

I could hear the zombie screams from outside and eventually, we left and traveled to another building much safer and with a lot of people I knew, especially my teachers from high school I was in a much better mood there because we were protected.

I had to protect an old woman which was pretty weird since we were safe inside but suddenly she jumped down the stairs and was falling down so I jumped in front of here to block her from falling further.

But now it was time to leave so I left with a group of people and a friend and we had to cross the border but there were a bunch of police holding everybody back for some reason, I could see that we could easily get around so I took off and left the group and a friend to look for another path, suddenly a friend of my brother stopped by with a really expensive futuristic car, he said to me that he would actually pick up some friends but that I could come in, so we drove really fast through some desert-like biome with rough terrain and of course passed through the border there were also a lot of people driving with motorbikes jumping on hills which I found pretty cool.

Here comes a strange part, I had another dream after that which was actually a wet dream because of no nut November but then I ""woke up"" out of that dream back into the first dream.

When I ""woke up"" and was back in the first dream I was conscious that all the driving and the zombie apocalypse was actually a dream but at the same time it really felt as if that dream was really connected with the dream I was having at that moment if that makes any sense.

So you can treat the first dream and the third dream as one dream.

Eventually, I found a bar and for some unknown reason I was really drunk and because I woke up from the wet dream my underwear was completely full with my semen so I went to the toilet and cleaned all the mess while I was drunk then, because I left the group and my friend from the first dream with the car, I just noticed that I forgot to bring my backpack with me so I quickly called my friend and asked if he could bring my backpack and then left the toilet i met the family of a friend of mine so I talked about the zombie apocalypse and the trip to here and that was the end of my dream.

&amp;#x200B;

My own interpretation:

The zombies:

This seems to signify some kind of psychological death/lack of vitality and seems to fit with the experience I'm having at my job, I have to do 3 years of school which consists of 1-day school and 4 days internship every week this is to get a certificate to be able to go to college, I don't really like the 4 days of work I'm doing and therefore feel a lack of motivation/vitality.

&amp;#x200B;

Traveling to the next building:

The second place I was at seems to symbolize parts of my past which I have lost, the teachers were all men and thus symbolized the power within myself to get out of al this mess and have the strength to move forward and become less nihilistic.

I have no idea what the old women in my dream would mean.

Traveling across the border:

The police holding everyone back symbolizes my workplace, ""you have to act this way"", ""you have to do this"", ""your own desires don't matter"", it keeps me from doing what I want pursuing my own desires and needs and makes me a slave to the workplace.

&amp;#x200B;

Going through the desert:

This showed the freedom and power I could have. 

note

I don't really know how to interpret the rest and i know very little of dream interpretation because I haven't read a single book on this topic."

Prompt 1: Young intern/staffer + Young politician

Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door.

Prompt 2: Intern + intern

Who knew that taking a year off from college to work on a campaign could be so tiring? I mean, I knew that, and everybody who even thought about doing it probably did, too, but that doesn't mean that it didn't suck. I never thought that I'd wake up in the morning begging to have a 9am class to go to, but sometimes that felt better than having a 6am policy meeting.

The hardest part, though, was the absolute lack of a social life. Of course, having meetings and events to do most of the day didn't help matters, but we were also shuttling from city to city two to three times a week. You could meet a lot of interesting people that way, but you couldn't really hang out much.

That's probably why you and I became such fast friends. We're the only college students around, and we're probably the two youngest people working on the campaign. Ordinarily, people our age wouldn't be even close to being involved at his high a level in any campaign, but here we are. We hit it off instantly, and we've been friends ever since.

Unfortunately, that's not where it ends. See, I've had a crush on you for almost as long as I've known you (which admittedly isn't that long, but who's counting?). Obviously, I've never been in a position to pursue that.

Until now. For some reason, we needed to cut costs in our latest campaign stop, so they forced everybody to double up in small one-bed hotel rooms. Somebody higher up than us probably thought it'd be funny to put us in the same room.

Hey there, DPP! In this prompt, I'm looking to play one of the two campaign related prompts above. It's pretty open-ended, so you could play a variety of character personalities. My kinks include oral, anal, passionate but ""fun"" sex, young love, light teasing, facials, creampies, kissing, nipple play, and deep throating.P"

My sister is 28. Sis got married last year. Because of the age difference, my sister mostly always treated me as a kid. And we have been really close growing up. Also we lost our mom when I was 10, so that made us even closer.  I always knew my sister is very beautiful, as she became an adult she had developed into very attractive and for the lack of better word curvaceous lady. She got a lot of male attention. But to be clear I never had any desire or ideas about her other than she is my big sister, my favorite person.

She got married to a guy pretty far from our original home, as well as far from the uni I'm currently attending. So I didn't see my sister again, after her wedding, untill about 3 months ago. I had some time off ,so sis invited me to visit her. That is when things got weird. Now me and sis always shared hugs, little kisses on cheeks but this time it was different. Let me tell you a few things that I thought was weird.

 First thing I noticed ,she was physically much more touchy feely with me.  Sometimes would spank my ass as a joke. She never did that before. Too many times she would take my hand (a lot of times when we are outside, a lot of times when her husband is around and a lot of time when we are alone) and hold it to her chest very tightly, her head leaning on my shoulder, essentially giving me a very good feel of her curvy breasts. She never used to do that too.Even up until that point I  thought she was just being extra affectionate because she has not seen me for a long time. But weird things didn't stop there.


One evening we were just chilling, all three of us, having a good time. We had little bit of drink not too much mind you, me and BIL couple of beers each and sis a glass of wine. Sis suggested we play truth or dare. After a few rounds BIL dared sis to kiss me. I immediately put my hand up and said no, thanks. Sis said don't worry bro, it's no big deal. BIL added, trust me, you are going to miss out on something great, if you don't. I thought okay, it probably will be just a quick peck on the lips. But she went for full on wet kiss, even our tongues touched a little, I saw BIL having kind of a smirk in his face.

Final straw was the night before I was leaving. We all went out to a bar, we were enjoying the night. I hit it off with a girl. At one point we started dancing, BIL with sis and me with the girl. When it was starting to get late the girl had to leave, she gave me her number. I was pretty happy. BIL went to the men's room. Sis started to dance with me, it was fine at first but then she started to dance really intimately with me. Even grinded me with her ass a few times. I won't lie, got a little hard.

It didn't end there. After we reached home I  changed to shorts and t-shirt and when I came out to their living room sis and BIL was arguing about something. I was about to leave when sis said don't go bro, I need you in my corner. I reluctantly sat on the chair. At one point BIL said something like you should be nice to me you know, after all I'm the one who is going to take care of you. Sis came and stand in front of me. She was wearing a red sleeveless dress kind of which ends around your knees. She then suddenly pushed her dress almost upto her upper thigh and just sat on me. She said, well I have someone who will always take care of me no matter what, won't you bro. She then pushed my head to her chest, and kissed top of my head. I could feel her  breasts and my lips rested on the bare skin of her cleavage. As she kissed me top of my head I kissed her cleavage almost as a reflex and said of course sis. I realized I was little hard down there.

 Not only that, I then realized her pussy was literally on top of my semi hard cock and just thin layers of my shorts and her panties separated them. She kind of made a forward movement to completely press her body onto me,  essentially giving me a grind and made a sound like uhmm. I was hard at this point, a man can only take that much. And she has a ridiculously hot body.  She then took both my hands and probably tried to place on her hips or something but what happened was, as soon as my hands were on her I immediately realized my hands were essentially on the skin of her bare ass (this might have been an accident, probably her dress went much higher then she intended to). I could feel the smooth skin of her ass. But she just sat there without making any adjustments. Not knowing what to do I caressed her ass a litt bit and if I'm being honest I loved the feel of it. I was rock hard. I could literally feel her pussy, albeit through my shorts and and probably her panties against my fully erect cock. She then moved her hip a little bit which essentially gave me couple of small grinds. She gave me a kiss on my forehead and thankfully got off me. I awkwardly put one leg on another to hide my boner. All this time BIL was just sitting on the opposite side watching all this. He had a kind of weird smile in his face.

Next day I returned, I have been thinking about the whole thing for past 3 months. I have tried to find an explanation for it. Did they join some sort of weird cult or are they into some weird swingers club or is my BIL is a cuckold. Even if he is why my sis is behaving like that with me? Or could it be I'm overreacting, sis is just maybe more free or liberated about physical stuff after marriage? I mean the last night we were drunk, not crazy drunk but still drunk but then what about the time she kissed me or other things she did? Or am I trying to find something when it's not there? I can't make up my mind.

Thing is I'm going there again next week so I'm really worried about the whole situation. Please let me know if you have any suggestions/ opinions and how should I handle this.

I have to stress this, I have to trade carefully because my sister is the most important woman, infact the most important person in my life.

**Edit: Sorry, I thought I mentioned it but I read it again just now and I seem to have skipped the most important factor here. I actually have an internship in the same city my sister lives. So I will be living with them for about 3 months. Otherwise I would not be so bothered or panicked. If it was a short visit for 2-3 days I would have somehow managed and be done with it. But 3 months is a long time.**"

dudsvw,1,2019-11-10,25 M4A (You Playing F) In Search of the Elusive Long-Term Detailed Story,WritingWizard124,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dudsvw/25_m4a_you_playing_f_in_search_of_the_elusive/,"Good evening!

So tonight, I've decided to take my time and craft a request thread that more adequately states what kinds of things I am looking for in a roleplay.  I've been roleplaying for approximately 15 years now on various chat rooms and forums, though only about 6 or so have involved smut of any kind.  I love writing, and as such, I'm really looking to find a writing partner that will intrigue me, entertain me, inspire my writing, and create an altogether fun story with me.  And I hope that in return, I will do all of these things and more for you in our stories.

Granted, we all know that a lot of roleplay involves smut, and I absolutely enjoy that as well.  But smut without a story is just a bad porn film, and that's certainly not what I'm looking for.  I need story.  I need plot and world building.  Smut is important and fun and all that good stuff, but why are our characters suddenly sleeping together.  I don't believe a good story has a character simply look at the other and decide to sleep with them.  Something has to stir within both characters, and that something is what I try to explore thoroughly in all my writings.

Now, before I get into the ideas that I have, I would first like to say that I am absolutely open to your ideas as well.  This isn't a one-sided thing, and it never will be with me.  It's important that I enjoy myself, but it's also important to me that you enjoy writing with me as well.  And if you find yourself not enjoying an aspect of a roleplay, I never will be offended if you let me know what you're not enjoying about the story, and we can work to curve things toward another direction if need be.  And certainly, I'll be open with you as a partner as well if things aren't really being enjoyed on my end also.  With that being said, I will -never- ghost a roleplay.  There comes a time in any roleplay where it isn't quite as fun anymore, or burnout happens.  I get it.  But I'd feel guilty as hell if I ever just quit a RP without an explanation, and I'll give you that courtesy.  I just ask that you give me the same.

Now, as you can see in the tag, I'm open to roleplaying with men and women.  But the one requirement I will have is that you MUST play the female role.  I consider myself a fairly flexible writer, but I'm terrible at writing female characters, and I definitely want the person I'm roleplaying with to play the female role.  I am a straight male, but I don't mind if you are a male behind the screen.  All that matters to me is that your character is female.

Now for the fun part:

**Limits/Kinks:**



I will eventually put a more detailed F-list on here, but limits-wise, I am not into non-con, gore, bathroom stuff.  The extremes essentially.  I won't say that I'm vanilla per se, but I do tend to enjoy more usual modern slice of life themes.  I love playful teasing, things happening in water (pools, hot tubs, showers, etc.), small things that on their own don't mean much, but add up toward much more.  Teasing, brushing up against one another, accidental nudity, those kind of things.  Beyond that, if something makes sense in the general flow of the RP, you'll usually find that I'm up for it, but if ever in doubt, just ask.



**RP Ideas:**



Again, not an all-inclusive list, and you're more than welcome to offer your own ideas, but here's some ideas I've compiled of late.  I'll continue to add to this list as I discover new ideas that I enjoy.



**Celebrities** - 

I LOVE roleplaying within the celebrity genre.  Probably one of my favorite things to do.  I generally am looking for the female character to be the celebrity in this, though I suppose for the right writing partner, that could be flexible as well.  Currently, I have scenes involving celebrity incest (Dad/daughter, brother/sister, mom/son) and celebrity fan encounters (this one currently takes place at a convention locally to my character).  But feel absolutely free to suggest your own celebrity ideas as well.  I would love to try something new in this genre.  In the latter scene, I'm willing to play an older or a younger fan, and willing to play any ages allowable by site rules.

Some celebrities I enjoy playing opposite of include, but are not limited to (In no particular order): Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lawrence, Kaley Cuoco, Lauren Cohan, Christina Hendricks, Demi Lovato, and sometimes Taylor Swift depending on the role.  Absolutely feel free to suggest some of your favorites as well!


**Teacher/student or coach/athlete** - 

I really enjoy the power dynamic between the two here, but this isn't your cliche ""You're failing a test, so do things for the teacher to get your grades up"" kind of trope.  That's too easy.  That doesn't cause me to think or be interested in any way.  For these two ideas, I am willing to play either the older or younger role, and again, the younger character, I'm fine with that character being anything allowed within site rules.  

My basic idea for both involve a pairing of two individuals who actually get along great.  Perhaps the teacher or the coach has been their teacher or coach for some time, allowing for a better relationship/bond between the two than most of the people their age.  Nothing unprofessional has happened between them at the time the RP starts, but through time, a very inappropriate relationship begins to build between the pair.  I do tend to love writing scenes involving disallowed relationships, which brings me to:


**Incest** - 

Disallowed relationships really thrill me.  Relationships that society looks down on.  And of course, this is the case with incest.  No, not something I'm into in real life, but writing it has always been enjoyable to me for whatever reason.  For these, I've got scenes involving dad/daughter, brother/sister, or mom/son.  Open to other suggestions as always.


**Boss/employee** - For this, I think the easiest way is to post the scene idea that I have:

*I am a manager at a major marketing firm in New York. Basically what we do is try to get various companies to pay us to run their entire advertising campaign for them. It's a big money business, but someone has to do it, and all the stress and burden falls on our shoulders - they just 'show us the money.'

Unfortunately, that does mean a lot of trips away from home; away from family. But I have a loving wife, and she has been very understanding.

A very big automobile company based in California is my next client, and this one deal could pay for all of our operations for the next year and beyond. And so, being the best representative at the company, I'm the one tasked with flying out that way and convincing them to sign with us.

One problem, my assistant. She's tasked to go with me, but she can't do her job properly. She mixes up phone calls, she messes up the calendar. All of the tasks she is assigned to, she can't do. So I fire her, just a day before I would need someone to come with me to help me stay organized.

I try to see if I can borrow other managers' assistants, but they were all booked as well. So it's recommended that I give you a chance, a young intern in our firm. They say you work hard, and on such short notice, I didn't have much of a choice.

So I agree, calling you into my office to talk to you about the opportunity.*



**TV Show/Movies** - 

Of course, I also enjoy writing within television and movie universes as well.  I find this is the hardest category to find a match, as it does require both people to have some kind of a clue about the film or show itself.  With that being said, I've written scenes within shows like The Big Bang Theory, Girl Meets World, Gotham, Game of Thrones, Marvel Cinematic, and the like.  Always open for those, and this list will expand as well.  Also open to your ideas as well.




As stated, this list and this post will be ever evolving.  At the end of the day, I'm looking for ideas.  Compelling stories.  World-building.  If my ideas aren't something you enjoy, don't hesitate to send me some of your ideas.  I might not like them, but who knows, your idea might intrigue me.  As long as they don't break my limits posted above, I might be open-minded toward them.



Please note that I am ALWAYS looking for capable partners.  So if you see this post, whether I'm online or not, feel free to hit me up.  I will respond as soon as humanly possible.  Let's quench each other's literary thirst!"

I have a pretty busy life this year. I work 6 days a week, 5 of which are for an internship. I also still have to take up tests, so need to study and plan ahead. I've been doing that the last weeks, each time for a different test or result. 

During these last days, like today, I really feel tired and lack the motivation to just keep pushing despite it only being just for a few days. I'll have a few days off the end of next week. 

How to keep productivity high and motivation and focus up these last days? The end is near, normally making it easier to pull through, but in this regard just making it easier for me to slack and relax a bit.

Guess I'm just tired, but want to perform these last few days"

I would love to learn more about the School Psychology Ed.S program at CSU Long beach (and other programs really!). Any information would help especially regarding the application process (were you worried about your GRE score or GPA, how was the interview process like, etc.), financial aid (specifically as an in-state student for CSULB) and your overall experience so far! I also have some specific questions that could guide you. But anything would help really!

1. What do you like about living/studying at CSULB?
2. What are the mentorship styles of the professors? Are faculty supportive?
3. What are the classes like? Which is your favorite? Your least favorite?
4. What is the programs philosophy/ theoretical framework? In other words, what does it emphasize (intervention, counseling, behavioral analysis, ecological model, etc?)?
5. What is the funding situation like? Do Ed.S students get stipends or assistantships? If so, can you live relatively comfortably on your stipend or assistantship? What is your financial aid situation like (loans, jobs?)? (Please feel free not too answer if this is too personal)
6. What is the cost of living like around Long Beach?
7. Are internships paid?
8. How heavy is the workload? Compared to undergrad (how did you adjust to the work)?
9. Did you attend the Ed.S program straight out of undergrad? If not, why and what did you do during the time? If so, how did you adjust from undergrad to grad school?
10. What was your application process like? What made you choose CSULB?

Also, if anyone would like to answer these questions about their specific Ed.S School Psych program that would be super helpful for other people looking into different schools ! :)

I am also interested in the University of Washington, Tufts, Chapman, University of Denver, and Northeastern University!

Any advice in general or what you wish you knew before applying to grad school would also be appreciated.

Thank you!"

dug25f,1,2019-11-10,I got a tech job that I love and life is turning up after months of failing. (Relatable post),cscqsim_repostbot,CSCQSimulator,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSCQSimulator/comments/dug25f/i_got_a_tech_job_that_i_love_and_life_is_turning/,"If you look at my post history, I created a whine post about getting rejected from onsite interviews. I'll link it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cra9ep/got\_rejected\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cra9ep/got_rejected_again/)

I graduated college with 3.45 GPA from UC Santa Cruz in California and it's not that great of a school for CS. I wanna say that I am not that smart either. My background consists of failing all of my AP exams in high school and I am first generation (my parents work at a grocery store) so I don't have the background of a rich kid that went to expensive private schools. I immigrated from a third world country and I still get confused by double negatives in a sentence sometimes. I probably have adhd and have trouble reading for extended periods of time, so I'm pretty average in terms of intelligence and efficiency. I took out loans and consistently tried to not let myself take it easy in college by taking the hardest project based courses to put on my resume and not mention that it was for a class. I never had an internship, and did not have a job lined up after graduating, so I gotta sell myself really well lmao. I interviewed, failed, interviewed, failed and kept doing that until I got my first really good offer at a tech company in October 2019. It's a small company and the coworkers are amazing and there is much to learn about big data tech.

I (and maybe most of you out there) have had this thought cross my mind: ""Fuck, maybe I'm not made for CS. My friends all have great jobs but I'm the only one."" Don't do that. Tell yourself you can get a job and just study til you get it. When you wake up, warm up with applying to a few jobs. Then, memorize and UNDERSTAND those annoying algorithms that you think you'll never use that you learned in school. Make sure you know how to write them with your eyes closed. You need to know them well. Yes, they come up in interviews. Review how to implement data structures. Write them out on a whiteboard regularly as an exercise. Learn hash tables/hash maps. Learn a scripting language and a compiled language that is widely used. My choices were python and java since I am now a data engineer. Learning both taught me to be a better programmer, especially through java's OOP concepts which also comes up a lot in interviews. Whether you wanna be a SWE, Devops, computer security, data engineer, whatever. Review the basics like graphs and sliding window algorithms (look this up, this is a medium-hard and comes up a lot with FANG interviews from my experience). When you're about to sleep, read some motivational shit like this and apply to more jobs. Repeat until you succeed. I did this for 3 months and those 3 months were depressing as fuck. But it's okay. You can do it.

If you're someone that graduated and said (I'm gonna take a break for a few months) without a real good grasp at the things I mentioned above, and never had an internship, or have a good network, you're behind. Hit the books and don't let your CS knowledge expire. Do leetcode RIGHT NOW. Actively seek improvements and don't just let the world beat you and say ""I can't get any interviews..."". It should be, ""I can't get any interviews. Ok, how do I be better?"" My manager loves this type of attitude. It's a thing you have to keep up constantly in this industry.

After getting  job, you'll be beat down with more hardships because of that learning curve of starting as a junior engineer. You'll feel useless (I still do) but it's ok. If you desire to keep learning, you'll be where you want to be.

I'm mostly writing this to help anyone that was in my situation or currently is feeling discouraged at job hunting. It sucks and yes, you really gotta leetcode everyday and look back at your past interviews, what you failed and do them so you know for next time. There's unfortunately no easy route, unless, unlike me, you have a network that can get you a job right away. I want to also stress that you shouldn't accept a job that you don't think you'll like if money isn't an issue for you. Keep looking. But, if you want to start working, then take that job but keep looking still to make yourself happy and climb that corporate ladder.

I also met a really pretty girl in my new city and the first date went really well.

All this uphill means there's gonna be a downhill soon, but right now, life is very nice.

TLDR; Work hard, even if you think you're dumb, and you WILL get a tech job.

To be more precise, the whole 'getting a job and settling down' thing.

From what I've heard, 

-it's a pain in the ass for International Students to get a job after graduation. 

-Most students return back to their home country after graduating. 

-Employers don't give a damn about you unless you have a PR. 

-Theres barely any scope for internships and employer sponsorship are just words on paper.

These are things I've heard people say. Now I want you guys to give your input on these points since I'm shit scared that I'll be under 100k AUD debt without a job 2 years down the line even though I'm a decent student with above average grades. 

BACKGROUND:
Home Country - India
I have applied for a transfer from my home university to RMIT.

- I have applied for Bachelor of Computer Science degree."

I had a decent internship and I graduated a famous college with a related degree and a solid gpa. I thought I'd get a job soon. I lazily applied to jobs without cover letters and a poorly built portfolio. Heck, I didn't apply to companies that I didn't know much about. I made typos as I hastily hit the submit button to go out drinking with my friends.

Things didn't work out.

June came around. l wasn't worried. Clearly it was just a streak of bad luck. But I started to write cover letters. I started to apply to more places. Still, I lazily applied to places, telling myself I was just unlucky.

Things didn't work out.

July came around. I looked at competitor portfolios and panicked. I realized my portfolio was... poor. I took it off Squarespace. I rebuilt it on Webflow. I explained my process rather than just slapping on the final prototype. I redesigned my resume to match my portfolio design. I started customizing my cover letters to match each company's job description.

Things didn't work out.

Fall hit. I stopped applying. I found some computer engineering friends who wanted to build an app together. I led the entire UX process, the entire double diamond. I handed over the prototypes to my developer friends. We built an app. Now it was the newest project on my portfolio.

Things started to change.

I started to apply to every company. I started getting positive responses. I did interviews. Some weren't UX designer positions, but they helped me be a better interviewee. I had an interview for a dream company. They gave me a design challenge. I got nervous and made some big mistakes. They moved on with other candidates.

I started doing UX challenges. Adobe had a daily challenge on Adobe XD. I signed up for the Weekley UX Challenge. I started reading UX articles on Medium. I started to talk with other people and ask for feedback.

Things felt like they were starting to work out.

I got an email asking when I'd be available for a phone interview. We talked about the app I built with my friends. A did a design challenge. I did another interview. I wasn't sure if they liked me or not but I sent everyone a thank you email anyways. I waited.



6 months, over 200 applications, and 7 interviews later, I'm headed to work for the first time tomorrow. Needless to say, I'm super excited! It takes alot of effort, but once you realize where you can improve and what you can do to change that, you'll get there too. I know there are many more college grads in the entry job market here, and I wanted to share my story because because I know that it feels kinda hopeless at one point. Good luck everybody, keep working hard, and I hope you all get your dream job!"

I just can't seem to see the light at the end of this tunnel or find the positives in my day to day. I'm staring down a week with multiple days of 24 hour call and I'm reaching the point where the thought of going to work is giving me panic attacks. I'm only halfway through year 1 of 5 but I felt burnt out after week 1 of rotation 1. 

At work, I'm nothing but a social worker and scribe. I dread waking up in the morning because I have to go back to some nightmare at work and every rude patient has to go through me. I barely see the inside of the OR and I have little to no energy to devote to practicing suturing or knot tying or picking up a book to read. On call, I don't get a chance to sit, let alone sleep, because some inevitable disaster is occurring on one of my services and I'm running between the bedsides of multiple unstable patients and new admissions.

I'm just feeling like I'm reaching the end of my rope a bit. I'm not sure what I'm doing and if I'm just devoting myself to a life of misery. I sometimes wonder what terrible thing I did in a past life to end up in residency. It also does not help that I'm feeling very single and don't really have the confidence.

Not even close.

This is an adventurous smart kid.

Rich kids don't clean boiler rooms for $18 an hour.

Sorry but all y'all have your heads up your asses:

**He once took a job as a boiler room cleaner at a lumber mill.**

After leaving South Africa in 1988, Musk spent time working a series of odd jobs around Canada. According to Ashlee Vance’s biography on him, Musk first tended vegetables and shoveled out grain bins at a cousin’s farm in Waldeck, and then learned how cut logs with a chain saw in Vancouver. After a visit to the unemployment office, he inquired about the job with the best wage, which turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a lumber mill. For $18 an hour — a great wage in 1989 — the grueling work involved wearing a hazmat suit, crawling through small spaces, and shoveling residue in extremely high-temperature conditions, according to Musk.

**He landed an internship with the Bank of Nova Scotia by cold calling a top executive to meet for lunch.**

After reuniting with his brother Kimbal in Canada, the two determined brothers researched businesspeople that they wanted to meet and took turns making cold calls to ask if they could have lunch. One such businessman was Peter Nicholson, a top executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia, who was fascinated by the boys’ initiative. Upon meeting them, he was so impressed with Elon — the geekier of the two brothers — that he became his mentor and offered him a summer internship at the bank for $14 an hour.

**To earn extra cash, Musk sold computer parts and full PCs out of his dorm room.**

While at Queens University in Ontario, Musk had a profitable side hustle for a time. He sold entire computers, as well as various hardware parts, from the comfort of his dorm room. He would build whatever suited the needs of fellow students – like a tricked-out gaming computer or a simple word processor, for example. As Musk described, “if their computer didn’t boot properly or had a virus, I’d fix it. I could pretty much solve any problem.” Not bad for the guy who would eventually become the inspiration for Tony Stark in Iron Man.

**He paid for rent in college by converting his house into a nightclub.**

After transferring to the University of Pennsylvania in 1992, Musk quickly put his entrepreneurial instincts to good use. He and a friend moved into a 10-bedroom frat house off campus for relatively cheap. During the week, the two of them would study, but on weekends, they turned the place into “a full-out, unlicensed speakeasy,” according to his roommate Adeo Ressi. This included covering the windows with black trash bags and the walls with bright paint. Musk, who was never big on drinking except for the occasional vodka and Diet Coke, would stay sober for these events to keep things under control. He would run the parties, and as he explained, “I was paying my own way through college and could make an entire month’s rent in one night.” Once, his mother Maye even worked the door at one of the big parties.

**In 1995, Musk quit graduate school at Stanford University to co-found an internet startup.**

Despite getting accepted to a Stanford Ph.D. program, Musk forwent the tuition costs when he decided after two days that the internet had far greater promise to change society. He immediately dropped out and teamed up with his brother Kimbal and started Zip2, a company that provided maps and directories to online newspapers. To start the venture, they used $28,000 out of their father’s bank account."

dum7k1,3,2019-11-10,Introduction and a small request.,Schaudern,askfuneraldirectors,https://www.reddit.com/r/askfuneraldirectors/comments/dum7k1/introduction_and_a_small_request/," Good evening everyone. I have periodically lurked this forum over the last year, but just recently decided to make an account (first time posting on Reddit at all for that matter) to engage with the community. 

I am 31 years old and about to finish up my first semester in a Mortuary Science program for my A.A.S. Before this I completed a four-year degree in philosophy at another university and was originally planning to go into law, but after working in DC for a Congressman through an internship I won and seeing what my life was going to be like I decided law was not for me. I have always had a long interest in funeral service though (truthfully, long before my interest in anything else), but I was discouraged at the time by an ex-girlfriend who told me she would leave me if I went that route instead of Uni because she refused to be known as “Bride of the Embalmer”. 

In addition to introducing myself, I also wanted to use this post to ask a favor of one (or more if there is interest, more the merrier) of the funeral directors here. I have an assignment coming up in a couple of weeks where I need to interview a funeral director and while it would be easy enough to drop by any of the funeral homes in this area and knock some questions out I would like to get some perspective from people outside my immediate region. If anyone is interested I would appreciate it and you can either reply here or shoot a direct message to my inbox. I will keep it simple and straight to the point, probably just ten questions or so that you can answer at your convenience over the next few days.  

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out and I look forward to interacting with everyone in the future!"
dume5e,1,2019-11-10,PLAN,We_Broke_Up,u_We_Broke_Up,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_We_Broke_Up/comments/dume5e/plan/,"\*\*\* **(1) Lifting 3 times a week &amp; eating healthy** (spaced out for recovery, intense full body workout for 30 min to 1 hour, quick cardio warm-up and cool-down, chewing food slowly, more veggies and protein &amp; little to no over-eating)

\*\*\***(2) Mindfulness Meditation every day** (short 10 minute sessions while on the bus or on my bed or walking, right now I'm getting into a kuru meditation class so I can pick up the basics, also being mindful in daily life, noticing thoughts &amp; therapy pdf on meditation)

\*\*\***(3) Gradual every day progression of approaching &amp; group discussions** (1h30 a day exposure to more stressful things so I can digest the experiences, 1 hour per session to get rid of social anxiety, finish book that helps with group discussions, [https://www.goodlookingloser.com/anxiety/program-index/approach-anxiety-program-week-1-1](https://www.goodlookingloser.com/anxiety/program-index/approach-anxiety-program-week-1-1) &amp; group pdf, 30m on POF)

**(4) Going out to 2 events a week minimum** (practicing social theory to have fun &amp; meet people who I vibe with, the two events are to socialise while still focusing on my goals &amp; having fun ex. networking event, computer science event, marketing club event, or a music event, SOMETHING RELATED TO MY PURPOSE SO I'M FOCUSED, being GENUINE the whole time)

\*\*\***(6) Therapy once a month** (my therapist told me I don't have any problems that stand out, so I use the sessions for meditation advice and an emotional outlet, and insight from someone older who has more emotional awareness)

\*\*\***(5) Studying 3 hours a day. 1 hour a day on a business hobby** (LINKEDIN + WEBSITE RIGHT NOW, making sure my college grades are up to par, and either building up my linked-in page, making a website, or executing a business side-project and slowly building a team through the people I meet at events for my business hobby. I have two other hobbies (music and writing) which I've put to the side for now because I've noticed that doing too much at once will lead to paralysis and getting nothing done. The time for those will come I feel, as I build more life experience and have more mental bandwidth.

**(6) 1h30 a day on chores.** (don't forget friends' birthdays, haircut, renewing cards or paying bills/fees, dealing with tax forms/cheques, buying things/clothes on amazon, cleaning up the room &amp; throwing out trash, washing clothes, refreshing on driving before my driver's test or even treating that as a break, checking emails &amp; signing up for activities to add to my calendar, checking my network and setting up meet-ups etc.)

**(7) If dates don't flop, then I'm going to invite them to events/places I'm already planning on going to** (if I'm already planning on going somewhere or doing something fun, I'll invite her to that. If they ruin my good vibes, they can leave because my time is limited anyways. This whole approach thing is more for self-improvement, but if I get a chance to escalate I'll go for it, no rationalising. I need to know I can conquer my anxiety when I need to.)

**(8) Self-help videos and pdfs while I take the bus to class** (listening to ToddV, CharismaOnCommand, Eckhart Tolle, Book Summaries, Books on Social Dynamics etc. with my earphones on or reading self-help pdfs, but I'll take the earphones off when outside of the bus, so I can notice opportunities to speak to people and just be present. If I see a rare opportunity on the bus, I'll go for it though.)

**(9) Hygiene &amp; Fashion 45m a day** (this already became a habit and doesn't really feel like a chore. Showering feels good. It feels nice to feel and look fresh. Cutting nails or trimming hairs takes 20 mins at most. I put on my contacts after showering, and I'm starting to develop some styles that fit my look and my significant drop in weight since lifting).

**(10) Meeting up with mentors/partners 2 times a week, 2h at a time** (this isn't likely happening anytime soon, only until I start building up my business side project and linkedin network. But it's going to happen eventually and I'd like to account for it.

**Logistics:** BUSING TO SCHOOL (KNOWING WHEN BEST TO USE EARPHONES), UBER WHEN IT'S LATE, STAYING AROUND IN PLACES WITH PEOPLE, AND NOT STAYING UP TOO LATE BECAUSE I'LL ISOLATE MYSELF.

**Goals:** website/linkedin and finding a business idea (a niche problem that's scalable), being present/grounded, can manoeuvre myself socially (can be genuine in conversations, can approach ANYONE while being comfortable, can manoeuvre myself in a social group/circle) , GPA over 80%, 180 pounds and close to ripped, no approach anxiety, better fashion and more fitting, one programming project.

Wasting time or having fun (outside of fun events, lifting, meditation, or the business hobby):

(1) Allowing myself only 2 days/week to spend a 2-3h reading self-help articles, the news, or posting on reddit.

(2) Skimming through interesting movie clips, documentaries, podcasts (ex. joe rogan), or comedians (ex. dave chappelle, bill burr) or shows (curb your enthusiasm, black mirror, rick and morty).

(3) Taking walks to ground myself and self-reflect

(4) Taking naps in the middle of the day

(5) Making a song for fun as an emotional outlet. Nothing serious, I don't do this much because I'm busy.

(6) Talking to friends on discord or facebook or texting people, mostly logistics (I barely have friends these days that are close).

(7) Checking up on family and showing that I care so they feel good. It doesn't really do much for me but I do it so I don't feel guilty. Also good social and empathy practice.

(8) Maybe travelling this summer.

(9) Getting a full-time internship job in the summer. Maybe a good opportunity to travel and live alone."
dunvyy,18,2019-11-11,"No, I don’t do nude photography",puppersstealmyfood,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/dunvyy/no_i_dont_do_nude_photography/,"When I was in college a few years ago I was struggling to find an internship for my photography degree. I started by asking my teachers if they knew anybody looking for an intern. I was about to give up completely when one of my favorite teachers suggested asking a past student of hers named Jack. I’ll skip the boring details about the hiring process but I ended up working at a company that photographs kids playing in sport leagues. My job was essentially busy work. It was still a fun job because I had really nice coworkers to talk to when we weren’t too busy and I got to sit and edit all day. Everything seemed fine until my internship was about to end.


Looking back on it now there were a lot of red flags I should have noticed but, I was too naive to notice. I was the type of person to think everyone is nice with no ill intention towards others. Thinking back on it now makes me sick. On multiple occasions I worked with Jack alone before anyone else was in the building. He used the excuse that we had more work to do than others or that I needed to know how equipment worked. On one occasion Jack asked if I ever took nude photographs of people or of myself. I know that should have been a huge red flag but since we were both artists I thought it was a normal question. I don’t remember exactly how the conversation went but I do remember him describing underwear in way too much detail. He even asked me about my love life (at the time I was dating my future husband). I’m pretty sure it made him mad that I was taken even though Jack was getting married soon. He even made a special desk that was literally in front of his. It was positioned so that we were facing each other. It made me feel like a little kid having to be watched over. Now I just think Jack did that so it was a cover for him to keep looking at me. 

My coworkers also started pointing out how Jack was always praising me and my work. They mentioned it so much that it was starting to get on my nerves. They would say I was his favorite person and he never treated anyone else like that. At the time I didn’t know that owner and Jack were fighting about my job. Jack was aggressively fighting for me to become a part time employee. After the owner told Jack she wasn’t going to change her mind he walked out on the spot.

A few days later I get a text from Jack asking if I could come outside with his personal belongings (I think it was something obviously replaceable like a pack of gum). A little confused, I gathered his ‘things’ and walked outside with his stuff. Jack hands me the work keys, I hand him his stuff, and then he tells me that he fought really hard for me to stay at the job. He told me this while his fiancée was sitting in the car behind him. It was so weird because he never introduced her and he kept saying how much he will miss me. Jack tells me to ‘keep in touch’ and finally drives away. So pervy/creepy boss let’s never meet again.

dur7wz,5,2019-11-11,I [M21] was mistreated by my girlfriend [F20] throughout a 2 year relationship and am now trying to undo who I've become.,afraz_ashik,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dur7wz/i_m21_was_mistreated_by_my_girlfriend_f20/,"In my first year of college, I fell for this girl who I happened to share a mutual friend with. We used to hang out, became closer and she put down her walls for a person for the first time in her life. I expressed my feelings for her. She said she could never date someone because she broke her mom's trust when she found out about a previous relationship and she needed time. She said her mom was the most important person in her life, since she lost her dad when she was just three years old, and had no siblings. I trusted it. I gave her time. But we were getting close during this time. Even physically a bit. We went on a lot of dates, and were both falling for each other. It was a very good time we both had that semester. During the vacations, we went back home. When our mutual friends asked her what was going on between us, she said we were just friends, and she showed one of the letters I wrote her like she felt creeped out by it. I used to write them only because she used to love it. And when our friend told her that he's seen us kiss once, she said it was just once and she slapped me for that. But it was something that was happening everyday. I felt very bad that she felt embarrassed to own up to the relationship (even though we hadn't declared it officially). That's when I stopped talking to her and she said she couldn't stand what she did to me or see herself in the mirror anymore. Her mom found her crying once and she told her mom it was because she broke my trust. 

She came back after vacations, I still loved her and I decided to forgive her because everyone makes mistakes. And then we started dating despite all of our friends advicing me against it. Little did I know there were 3 guys she dated in between that time she was with the last person her mom knew about. So this relationship was not delayed because it would break her trust. It was because she was dating a junior of hers while we were getting close and kissing everyday.  Basically she was cheating on the guy with me. I found all of this out after I started dating her. And from that time on, I've caught her lying too many times. Finding out things I never wanted to find out. And I kept forgiving her thinking one day she'll turn around. I found her sending questionable photos to people, lying about her past, lying about meeting other people and so on. And every vacation she breaks contact with me and calls me only when she needed something. Keeps giving me excuses, and at the start of each semester, I forgive her because I loved her that much and we start over again. She was also terrible in bed. Bad stamina, no clue what to do and had vaginismus. But I never forced her to do anything and never asked her for more than anything she could give. She knew I was adjusting, keeping my desires aside and felt bad about it. I consoled her saying that sex would be less satisfying if both of us didn't feel so comfortable and intimate and hence I didn't mind these obstacles.

In between, lots of fights happen but we somehow solved them and went on. After one point fights were being solved because she used to threaten me with suicide. She told me how she found no point in staying alive if we weren't together. I knew it was manipulation but I still gave in. We dated for a little more than two years. But I never felt she truly cared about me. I was only waiting for her to turn around one day. And I was striving hard for it. Making up for her lack of friends in college by spending every bit of my time with her, even ignoring my friends. And I tried to defend herself against everyone who blamed her saying that it was probably something no one would understand because she grew up without her dad. Her mom was a very materialistic person who didn't bother teaching her any morals but taught her how to dress up and shop and eat out at restaurants. The only time I can say she sincerely cared about me was during the period after a motorcycle accident I had, which fractured my jaw bone. I was on a liquid diet, barely able to move from bed, but she was there beside me, everyday. But our problems kept on mounting. There were shimmers of happiness in the relationship that we treasured, and I got excited about thinking she's coming around, but it never took her more than one vacation to completely shut me off from her life and let my hopes die again. 

After a point we were in our final year, and knew this wasn't going to last. We were about to leave the university town where all our memories had only been of each other. I guess we were holding on because it would be too unfamiliar a place without the other person. This attitude seeped in, and our problems stopped getting solved because things were about to end in a few months anyway. But it was a hard time. I had one of my favorite cousins being married off to a person I disapproved of and one of my closest friends losing her dad. These were two of the best people I had known in my life and seeing both of them going through the worst I could imagine, I was diagnosed with clinical depression. She was the only one I told this to but she thought it'd be a better idea to go partying than sit with me and talk that night. We had a huge fight, with me insisting I wanted to break up. She figured she couldn't reason a way to stay, so she started forcing hugs and kisses on me. I told her to stop till the point where I was yelling but she didn't. I felt disgusted and the only thing I could think of was to hit her. And I did. That's when I realized I was totally out of control. I would never have even thought about doing something like that. We continued yelling at each other through the night and her chest was aching where I hit her. I took her to a hospital when the pain was too much and stayed beside her for the next two days when they were running tests. Everything showed up negative and two of her friends who were present felt it was a false alarm. After we got back to her apartment, I told her I couldn't do it anymore. 

 She went home to her mom for some issue with her visa and I blocked her while she was away. Once she returned I went to see her for closure and she just told me she doesn't want to continue because whatever was between us, she had faked it for 2 years. She faked a personality, she faked a relationship and now she finally has a chance to be herself. I recently found out that she made out with someone during her class party and that's why I wanted to just get rid of all memories of her. She says she was in pain but all I see is her partying. She tells me she cannot show it outside when she's sad, but everyday I see her attending parties, drinking, smoking weed and so on. I don't know if the story about her class party is true, but I cannot ask her and find out because I can never trust her. She can probably live with whatever she's done, but I can't. And honestly it looks like she will only go down that path and will never make an effort to ever change. I've tried. I've tried my best for two years and waited for her to come around. I was just not able to give up on her.

 Currently I'm seeking counseling help and recovering from depression along with meditation. I  had a phase where I couldn't go to sleep without drinking or smoking weed for about three weeks. I snapped out of it because I was working hard on my career for the past 3 years here in college. I was part of a Formula Student team where I also served the post of a driver. And here I was almost going to bin my chances of getting a job or internship because of the emotional turmoil I was in. But luckily things have worked out and I secured an internship during this phase in a company I most wanted to get into. 
 
I stopped drinking and smoking up, took up meditation. Started going on early morning runs. I despised the life she chose and I wanted to get fit for an upcoming Formula Student competition. It is very hard pulling myself out of bed everyday, but I have a very supportive friend who has gone through similar things and keeps me motivated. I refrain from telling things to my other friend who is dealing with the loss of her dad. It's not that I am invalidating my pain because hers is a lot more, but just that I don't want to worry her any more than she already is. I think I've made progress regarding depression but I'm continuing my counseling sessions because I've also turned into a toxic person now and towards the end I have mistreated her as well. I want to make sure I never do this to anyone ever again in my life. 

She's accused me of being insecure, but I had nothing to trust her. She kept promising me she'd do something to build my trust after all she'd done but never made an effort. And she kept telling me whatever she was doing was never enough for me and I had a problem with everything. Well, that's why I partially take blame for this but I believe no one would ever not have a problem after going through something like this. I'm not justifying myself because this relationship should've never happened. But I find it hard still to figure out where I went wrong and why this never worked out. I share a good rapport with her mother who still texts me despite knowing we broke up. Today I texted her saying I didn't want to talk to her anymore because I didn't want anything that reminds me of her daughter. She asked me what was wrong and though I didn't want to say it, I ended up confessing the whole thing to her. I feel bad thinking what if this makes her life worse, I just need someone to tell me what all I've been doing wrong here because I've started to hate myself over this.

TL; DR  Toxic relationship with the history of partner cheating, forgave her everytime thinking she'll come around. She didn't, but somehow I still end up feeling bad about it. Going through an intense personal struggle to get over this. Making progress but not all the way there yet."

I'm a university student, looking for a part-time job to not only help my grandparents with putting me through university but also, to make my CV stand out for future internship applications\~

That is why I reach out to your kennel! I understand that your last female dog has passed away recently. ㅠ.ㅠ

It must be such devastating news for the male dogs!  —  I've spent long and hard thinking about how I could contribute to your kennel and while doing so, on a western message board, I received the recommendation, that I could try replacing the bitch you've lost, so that your mutts neither suffer from a reduction in fertility nor increased aggression. 

I think that is very important for a breeding kennel, no? Considering how important both of these are to the pedigree of a renown kennel.  —  The men were so friendly in recommending me how to best help, and they even voiced that, in their opinion, a cute Korean girl would be for sure  liked by all the big dogs!

Therefore,  I was thinking, maybe I could wear my old school uniform and let them dry-hump on me. Many of my panties are very soft and hopefully shouldn't cause pain to the dogs.\~

When I was young I often roamed around on all four and went \*wang!\* \*wang!\*. I think I can be a convincing dog for them and I would like to contribute to your great kennel and help you make this amazing breed more popular in Korea!

Please consider hiring me, I will try my best to become an asset to your kennel and earn myself a letter of recommendation for my CV.\~

yours respectfully,

I am a student ( early twenties) who changed of major a lot I went from law to English littérature to linguistic. 

Along the way I did a few internship and realized that I’d like to work in the startup industry either as a VC or just in an incubator or as a business developer. 
I have lot of ideas that I realized require the knowledge of software and thought that given my weird CV now I could work as Mobile app developer or software architect this would help me to get into the industry pretty easily and work on my own project independently . 

I am also pretty fascinated by algorithms. 

Now my problem is that since I’m starting again I wanna pick the right degree . The one that will really fit me . I wanna work and stay in the UK maybe move to America later . 

I always have been bad at math and logic . Always scored low in high school in these subjects even while working my ass off . To the point where I gave up and only picked subjects to avoid them . 
But now I’ll need it to attain my goals . 

If I had the academic ability I’d go for computer science but I don’t wanna waist time again . So my question are 

Can I be good at it and score high of I work hard ? Or it would be difficult regardless , if math doesn’t come naturally to me . 

Should I maybe go for information technology system/business information system ? 

I hesitate with studying economics aswell even though it doesn’t open the same door . 

What would you suggest me ?"

I’m looking for a JO bud to have both sexual and non-sexual conversations with. Having someone to regularly chat to and cum with would be fun.

It gets slightly frustrating having someone come on for a few minutes and disappear. Having a person to chat with regularly and know their kinks makes the whole experience much more interesting. Whether you find the intern hot or you feel like showing off your girlfriend, we can talk about it!

Guys or girls everyone’s welcome, whether you’re straight, bi or gay.

Here are a few interests of mine to see if you like any of them.

I’m 28, into fitness and sports. I love fit and athletic girls more than anything else. I’m an ass guy to the core but do like my fair share of boobs. A few kinks are blowjobs, squirting, anal and fake tits, black girls are super sexy too. I also have a huge thing for Indian and Asian girls too. Pretty exotic I know.

dus8oh,1,2019-11-11,Coworker relationship dilemma,ThrowRAKITGuy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dus8oh/coworker_relationship_dilemma/,"Hi guys,

I have a bit of a problem with a new person in the team. It's by no means a conflict, it's just me with my abysmal social skills not really sure how to react. However, before getting straight into the question, let me describe myself as it would be quite important later on.

I'm 28yo with huge social skills problem. I was heavily bullied by my peers when I was 12-15 and this makes it extremely hard for me to start any relationship with literally anybody (sex doesn't really matter). I have 3 friends  I contact with on, so called, daily/weekly basis. As a result of my past I'm very withdrawn person. However, I used to be extrovert when I was younger (going into kids discos, having many friends and so on) and I generally like to talk to people, but it just takes some time for me to start any conversation. The people I had good contact with previously were the same who participated in this cruel adolescent fun called bully so my trust to people equals by default to 0. I have also no experience with girls, over my not so short life I've never been in any relationship but it was never a priority to me.

Because I couldn't count on other people, I'm so used to working with myself that I built some sort of self-confidence in actions I'm taking. I've been working for an IT company (with quite steep learning curve as we're using startup, unpopular system) for over 3 years. We have huge rotation (we rely a lot on interns who usually feel it's not for them) so this makes me an expert within the team and the guy who usually knows the answer. I was quiet for my first 1.5 years but once I was confident with myself, I started to take the floor during meetings or inofficial conversations. I was also responsible for introducing new people to the system/team as I love to share my knowledge, help people (this makes me feel I'm needed and someone wants to talk to me) and I was also starting from intern position so it makes it natural for myself to help new guys follow the same path within the team. I always put the team in front of me, I'm that guy who likes to be in the background, not the go-ahead person. However, I can understand people feeling I'm the confident one, but in reality it's just a mask.

3 months ago two new interns joined the team (one of them being the person in topic). I picked them up, the conversation (or, lack of it) was really awkward so we only shared our names. During next few days one was talking literally to everybody, the second was quiet. As they are both new, they tend to speak to themselves. They are the only women in the team, 80% of the team are male and we generally know each other quite well. They finished their training and one has still spoken to everyone and worked at the same time, second was picking her tasks and doing them.

The guys in the team (including myself but because of work load) don't really speak to the quiet one, so we don't really know her. That's why I decided to start talking to her after work, generally make her feel a bit more comfortable in the team and so she's not excluded from the group. If I was her, I'd definitely need someone to talk to me at the beginning, the person I can feel they're friendly and ready to help (or casually talk to, doesn't really matter). I got it into the stage when she's happy that I'm walking with her to bus station (we're going opposite directions) and we're talking without any problems. When leaving the office, I take the other exit and follow her downstairs, so the guys don't really see us going at the same time (and don't make 'funny' comments). However, I noticed she's quite stressed when we're close in a meeting or talking in work. Recently I even started to sit further away from her so she feels better and apparently it works. Disclaimer, there was no argument or whatsoever, at the same day she can speak to me after work about literally any topic and I see she's not that stressed as in workplace.

We had a team meeting after work last Friday, we went drinking (I don't drink at all and came there by car) and speaking. I was on the opposite side of the table, it came out naturally when we were taking sits. I saw one friend talking to her and I was happy about it because she started to talk to the others. However, I also noticed she was looking at me from time to time, more often once it was getting late. When I saw her getting ready to leave, I thought about driving her home but although I left literally 15s after her, she was gone when I was at street level. Frankly, I felt like TIFU, mainly because I left the girl after few beers alone when I could clearly help her get home in much more comfortable and safer way than long bus trip. I should have offered it to her during the meeting but I was afraid to do it in public.

The problem I have with her is that I wouldn't mind if we're a bit closer than colleagues but it's not my goal when talking to her. All I really want for her is to feel comfortable in the team. I would never push if she's not interested and it may make her feel awkward in workplace. However, I can almost feel (remember my abysmal social skills, so it's by no means confirmed, I may be overreacting) that she's feeling a bit weird close to me anyway, so the difference would probably be marginal.

I know it's hard to give any reasonable answer but based on this, can you at least give me any hint what could I do or how could I behave? I can't really lay my cards on the table because I don't really know what cards do I have and it's hard for me to talk to her normally. My idea is to at least ask her out because our after work conversations don't last longer than 10 minutes and they happen max twice per week."
duss8l,68,2019-11-11,Advice on switching specialties,voldemort10,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/duss8l/advice_on_switching_specialties/,"Hello fellow sleep-deprived friends,

I’ve posted before about how I’m not super happy as an anesthesiology resident. The day to day flow of things is fine but I’ve realized I hate being in stressful/acute situations. I’ve encountered a lot of these over the past few months and I’ve found myself thinking “god I would never want to be the attending right now” during these situations. I recently had an outpatient pre-operative clinic rotation and found myself to be happy, and felt I liked that environment better. Im tired of the disrespect I get from other specialties and especially nurses (both OR and PACU). I wouldn’t be unhappy never being in an OR again. The procedures aren’t as exciting anymore. Some days I feel a sense of anxiety and dread thinking about going into work. These all seem like red flags to me. 

I’ve spoken to my program director (4 months ago), who was super supportive and told me I could switch into IM next year (but told me I should take time to think about this decision obvi). There were parts of intern year I hated but I liked IM rotations for the most part (I had 3 ICU rotations, 2 general medicine wards months and 1 consult month). I’m leaning towards switching but I wanted to give myself the rest of the month or so to settle on a decision. I would be losing a lot of time and I may have to repeat intern year. I could also possibly switch into IM at another institution

What do you guys think? I figured I would ask here for a few other opinions since I can’t exactly ask my co residents and my parents aren’t in medicine :(. Thanks for your help!!"

duvw71,3,2019-11-11,AITA for calling my partner an asshole?,esrjpj,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/duvw71/aita_for_calling_my_partner_an_asshole/,"Hey yall,

Didn't know I would one day turn to the court of public opinion, but I need an unbiased voice: AITA...?

My partner was invited to a brunch to celebrate completing internship applications with a couple of friends. She invited me, but I told her that I already have other plans unfortunately--I was signed up as a volunteer to distribute food at the food pantry. It was upsetting to her to know I may not attend, since both were at the same time, and I asserted that handing out food at the pantry is pretty important to me. After a bit of a back-and-forth about values and why hers/mine are important, I told her it was most important for me to go and support her, and that I would do that instead of volunteering.

The day before the brunch, my partner told me she doesn't even want to go to this event, and it's just a casual get-together (later she tried to play this off as sarcasm or joking, but I definitely didn't pick up on that). I told her that I've already sacrificed something I was doing in order to go, so it's pretty important to me that we follow through. She was upset that I said I made a ""sacrifice""; my response was that I had indeed made a sacrifice, and I hope that that reflects how important this event is for me. She accused me of not wanting to go, and I spent the next day leading up to the get-together defending myself and trying to convince her that I gave up something important to me because supporting her was even MORE important to me than what I had planned.

This continued after the get-together, with me becoming defensive of my decision to come for support. Finally, parked in the parking lot of a grocery store, she told me she wished I didn't even come! All I could muster to say was ""fucking asshole"" as I left the car to go grocery shopping for us. I blew up. After cooling down, I figured my partner (a training psychotherapist) would notice she had said something hurtful, instead she was the one hurt and seeking solace. In hindsight I could have dealt with this better; am I a loose cannon or is she being unreasonable -- who is the asshole?

TL;DR

My partner wanted me to attend a brunch and I had plans to volunteer at the food pantry; I gave up these plans to support her. She later told me she didn't know if she wanted to go, so I reminded her that I made a sacrifice so we that I could be there for her. After brunch, and after trying to convince her that I indeed wanted to attend and it was most important for me to support her, she told me she wished I hadn't come to the brunch -- I replied ""fucking asshole"". In your humble opinions, AITA?"
duw6ul,281,2019-11-11,I will not let alcohol destroy my life,jarde44,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/duw6ul/i_will_not_let_alcohol_destroy_my_life/,"Today is Monday, my last drink was Thursday night.

I am married with a 9 month old son, but last for the week-and-half my wife took my son with her on a business trip. I assured her I would be fine, I knew I would have a busy week at work anyways so even if they were home we wouldn't be seeing much of each other. She left feeling comfortable that I would be fine.

My week was stressful as expected, with work and recently starting an online master’s degree program. Thursday, I got to a point at work, thinking about everything I still had to do, and how little I had accomplished that week where I was starting to feel like a panic attack was coming on. I eventually calmed down a bit, finished up at work and headed home. That night I drank about half-bottle of vodka and a beer. As I had done every night, give or take a few drinks depending on the night, since my wife had left. Friday was similarly less productive at work, and I still had schoolwork to do. Friday, I knew my wife, who doesn't like when I would get drunk, was coming home on Saturday, so I began to plan for how much alcohol to buy on my way home from work to ensure I could get drunk without having leftover alcohol in the house. At this point I had a bit of a minor epiphany, I thought, “how deceitful are you going to be with your wife?” so I made the decision to not buy any, after all, there was still half a bottle of vodka left in the house anyways. I got home and fell asleep on the couch from a stressful week. Upon waking up my epiphany became more clear. I started thinking back to all of the times that I had gotten too drunk and upset my wife. The time that I threw up all over our bedroom carpet. The time that I broke the toilet paper holder off the wall when stumbling around the bathroom. The times I just got so incoherent that she angrily left to sleep in the guest bedroom, and so many other times that alcohol had led to me genuinely upsetting my wife.

This led to me further evaluating my relationship with alcohol and I realized it had never been good. My first time drinking, on my 21st birthday, got so drunk I threw up. While in college I got drunk and lost my wallet the night before a flight back to school after a summer internship. After getting to my first duty station (I’m in the military) getting drunk wandering around in the middle of the night in Montana and coming out of my blackout miles from home, sitting in the driver seat of a car that was not mine. Thankfully the keys were not in it, thankfully the owner who saw me in her car didn’t call the police or worse. At my next duty station in Korea, the reliance on multiple bottles of wine after each shift in order to “fall asleep,” topped off by crashing my bicycle so badly that I had to lie at work about how I got a black eye and why I was limping.

I continued to follow this downward trajectory at my next duty station where I was fortunate enough to meet my wife. While we were dating I rarely felt the need to drink, doing it mostly when she wasn't around. In hindsight I could see that her coming into my life was able to take that downward slope and level it out a little bit. But as time progressed, we got married, we moved to another duty station, I could see that slope getting steeper and steeper once again. We had made an agreement about a 18 months ago that I would only drink on the weekends (or if we went out for special occasions), and that I would stick to beer instead of whiskey. Over the last few months I have been sneaking extra drinks. Hiding a bottle of vodka in the garage and taking a swig whenever I grab a beer. Lying to my wife.

Finally I realized, my stressful week was not because of the work I had to do, it was because of the fog of being hungover everyday preventing me from being as productive as I could have been, coupled with the drunkenness at night preventing me from being able to do anything at home.

I realized, finally, after 12 years of problematic drinking that I am not able to control myself when I drink. I have to stop, I have to get help, or I will not continue to get lucky and not get caught doing stupid things. That if I keep lying to my wife I will destroy our relationship. I will destroy my family and my career and everything good I have in my life for the “fun” of blacking out and waking up hungover.

I threw the half-bottle down the drain. On Saturday, I told my wife as we drove home from the airport. She wasn't surprised; I was an idiot who refused to see that I had a problem. She was hurt that I lied...I think she can forgive me but I can’t continue to drink. Today is day 4, wish me luck."
duwr0s,25,2019-11-11,[DISCUSSION] So... I got some incredible news today! Motivation Monday?,cyclopssummers,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/duwr0s/discussion_so_i_got_some_incredible_news_today/,"Hi there! I apologize for the length of this post but wanted to share some exciting news. I am a computer science senior/masters student at an Ivy League college, in a program specialized in computer graphics/CGI/VFX/Game dev. We’ve also got a pretty well-known cinema program. (I started out bioengineering and pre-med.)

So, I've always been interested in writing, and my first club involved me writing movie reviews and going to screenings. That combined with my X-men blog landed me my first internship writing video essays and editing videos for a very popular YouTube channel about movie analysis. I loved it. Also, having no prior experience in computer science, I did not feel I had the skillset for an engineering role yet. (Lots of people at my university have been coding straight out of the womb.)

I had also spent my freshman year in a rather awful relationship with this guy in a fraternity. He would gaslight me which made me unsure about how to speak up for myself and was arrogant to his brothers. I was great friends with the guys in the house, though, and began writing a TV comedy about a fraternity as a result of the memories I had there. I had the pilot done by the end of the year, and my now-ex dumped me 2 hours before my formal at the end of the year, which left me all dressed up and sobbing. I spent most of my time coding and doing homework, so it was really just a cruel thing to do on the night I’d most been looking forward to. His brothers really ripped into him for it, and they stayed with me to keep me company and made sure I was okay. It took a long, long time for me to recover from that.

However, it lit a fire under my ass and that summer I wrote season 1 in its entirety. Sophomore year I took a class in intro to screenwriting and TV writing. I also wrote half of season 2 and planned seasons 3 and 4. It was designed to be a 4 season show for each year in college. Had fraternities outside read what I had written- they said it was something wholesome, hysterical, and very different- and to keep going. The pitch with my concept art won a venture capital award from my school.

I then made it into the engineering honor society (top 10%) in my school. The next two years I got internships with big technology companies. I struggled because I knew it wasn't what I wanted to do- (almost everyone at my school ends up at Google and Facebook). Not that there's anything wrong with that- just wasn't for me.

In my junior year I took advanced screenwriting and was quickly reminded about the ivy-league attitude. I was in a situation where everyone's mom or dad was a ""big producer"" or had all these ridiculous ivy-league connections. I noticed they hardly put in the work because they didn't need to- they showed up late and never finished anything. At the time, I had a movie I wanted to write but was scared to write it because it was too risky, I had never written a feature before, and I felt awkward about table-reading it in class. I had a list of movies I wanted to write, and I crossed that one out, despite that I knew it was the strongest.

One day we were talking about a Broadway play in class, and I commented that I enjoyed the soundtrack. The girl next to me said, ""well my mom is a producer and all the producers don't like that play. But you'd have to be in the Broadway community to know that.""

Once again, I had a fire lit under my ass and wrote the first draft of my screenplay (that I had previously crossed out) in a month. I worked as hard as I could because I had no ins, no connections to the media business. I ended up winning best screenplay at my university. This screenplay went on to do well (and is still doing well) in several well-known competitions. It most recently made the semis of a large contest and is still being judged. When I found out, I was in class and teared up because of the countless hours I worked on it and what those characters really meant to me.

Literally the next day, I received a call from a major big-6 company who not only wanted to offer me a full-time position in the media production technology pipeline because of my work in computer graphics, but also a screenwriting first-look agreement.

I’m also doing a full storyboard of my TV series pilot, and it’s turning out to be a ton of fun as well as a huge time commitment. I wake up early every day to work on it.

Anyways… I feel like this was a huge step forward and I’m kind of in a state of shock right now. I’ve read lots of advice on this sub so just wanted to say thank you to this awesome community."

3. For some reason we have to find companies for internships ourselves, can you give me any tips on searching in English? Or maybe you know some viable options? (Electronics, electrical and electrical engineering)

Thank you so much!"

I would like to introduce myself. I am Daan Kromhof (Dutch). I am an International Business Student at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Groningen. As of now, I’m writing my bachelor thesis as an intern at BUKU. 

BUKU is an online platform that allows subscribers to access high-quality educational books 24/7 from a large range of publishers. BUKU has asked me to perform research into the market of higher education in Kenya. More specifically to analyse the current atmosphere of higher education in Kenya and to find out whether the solutions that BUKU offers are interesting for the Kenyan market of higher education.   I have been asking numerous universities if they are open to an interview regarding my research and most universities are. But the moment I mention that the interview will be conducted through a video conferencing platform they don't respond or when they do, they do not show up for the interview on the given date. The moment they agree on the interview I send an interview consent form, in which I state that the data will be used for educational purposes and that they can alter anything.  


I'm stressing a lot since I know that the universities will be closed in December and that I need to gather my data before that. 

Most universities are not responding to my e-mails but I believe that this platform is also really interesting for the universities as well. Already made contact with Embassy there, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education Kenya and Netherlands African Business Council for further help regarding my research. My question is what should I do? Any tips? Should I perhaps call them and conduct a telephone interview? 

Any tip is more than welcome!

Thanks in advance!

Sincerely,

Daan Kromhof"

duy5qw,10,2019-11-11,21 m/f should I end my 2 1/2 year relationship,le0lady,secondary_survivors,https://www.reddit.com/r/secondary_survivors/comments/duy5qw/21_mf_should_i_end_my_2_12_year_relationship/,"Buckle up this is a long one. Please forgive me I am new to this reddit thing. So my s/o and I met 3 years ago in school. We were in the same classes and both were in other relationships at the time around 8 months pass and we both decide to call it off and pursue each other. 4 months later we are dating and happy and finish schooling and go on separate internships 1000 miles away from each other. 

Months prior his ex had decided to do her internship at the same location. But, we decide to try and make long distance work. We kept in touch as bf/gf for the next year over text, FaceTime, 5 visits (which was not cheap). 10 months in to this I find pictures of him and his ex on social media and confront him about it. He swears it was only hanging out and one kiss that he says was a mistake because he was lonely. I always knew that his ex was really upset about the break up and would lash out and do crazy things such as passing out at school or come knocking and crying on his door and making up medical issues for him to feel bad for her, crazy lies and posts on social media etc. in one word their relationship was toxic. But after all this I decided to listen to my heart and forgive and try to forget. 

We move in with each other 1 yr and 5 months into our relationship and I’m so happy with him, we have the best connection, we grow with each other and help each other in any way we can. We grow in our jobs together and take amazing opportunities as a couple. We adopt a pet. Sign leases and move to a new state together etc etc. about 5 days ago I find out during a deep talk that he has not been completely honest with me.. he had seen his ex on and off for 7 months of us being in that long distance relationship and slept with her 5-10 times, claiming that she was super insistent and had it out to ruin us and and he was vulnerable emotionally and not the same person as he is now. He says he deeply regrets it and claims responsibility and is ate up by it every day. And then he decides to tell me about some terrible sexual abuse he had experienced when he was a child at the hand of a trusted adult (and has not told many people at all). He says he shared all of this because he wants to heal and move on and he says he understands that the second confession does not totally excuse the first. I have never seen a man cry so much. I am absolutely devastated that the level of trust and honesty I thought I had in my relationship was not what I thought I had. 

I am devastated that he could do this to me. To me this means he never loved me the same way I love him. I feel like the past 2 1/2 years of my life was a lie. Some of our closest friends even knew the truth years before I did. I know we are young (both 21 currently) but we both have grown so much together and after all this I still can’t grasp the concept of being without him. I feel like our souls connect on such an extreme level. But I am an extremely proud and honest person and I don’t know if I could ever find the heart to forgive him. 

He claims that he still had feelings for her and that we moved on too fast from our exes but why drag me in to it then? Why couldn’t he have just let me go? I asked him yesterday to open his phone and he was super hesitant but finally agreed after I said I would leave him. I found texts to her from a week after he told me they just kissed. He told me at that time he had blocked her and cut all ties which was a lie. I have not found any evidence of them talking for 1 1/2 years. I look her up on social media and find she has a new bf and looks happy...but why am I still suffering? I have no idea where to turn I feel so lost. Should I try to forgive? We have 6 months left in our lease that I can not afford to pay on my own. 

I have never dealt with someone or know how to deal with someone who was sexually abused as a child? Should this be a factor in my decision? I want to make sure he has the support he needs but I have to think about my feelings also. He has agreed to come forward to his family and seek therapy and claims he will do anything to make it right. I don’t know what will be enough to make me stop feeling like this. 

TL:DR- my (21 f) s/o (21 m) cheated on and off for 7 months of the first year of our LDR with his ex and wasn’t truthful until 1 1/2 years after distance ended and we built a life and an amazing connection together. And also came forward about some childhood trauma he had been internalizing."
duy7hp,5,2019-11-11,Worried about moving in with boyfriend. What do I need to know regarding his financial situation?,cryptidbook,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/duy7hp/worried_about_moving_in_with_boyfriend_what_do_i/,"My boyfriend and I (both in our mid 20s) recently discussed moving in together but I have some concerns. I want to make sure I have all the information in order to make an informed decision. Neither of us have lived on our own before.



What information do I need before I make this move? I would like to know his income, his typical monthly spending, and his planned expenses for school. Is this reasonable?




My boyfriend told me that he does not know how much money he makes in a year. He told me that he does not have his W2 or last year’s tax return. He gives these documents to his father who does his taxes for him. He doesn’t seem to look at his pay stubs. For months he told me that he earned $12 or $13 per hour at a fast food place. We looked at the pay stub together recently and found out that he was actually earning $11 per hour. 




In July he began working at an internship earning $10 per hour for 37 hours per week in addition to working at the fast food place. He plans to quit the fast food job in December but doesn’t have another job lined up yet. He says that he wants to continue working at the internship for 3 years to get experience. 




He has a 529 plan from his parents to pay for college but hasn’t taken classes in a year. He said that the 529 “doesn’t cover everything” and he has to pay for some expenses out of pocket. He will be 26 in two months and doesn’t have plans for getting his own health insurance once he is no longer eligible to stay on his parents’ plan. His credit score is 547 and he is only able to get a secured credit card. He lives with his uncle and his uncle’s significant other. His uncle has asked him to move out by December 2019, but my boyfriend doesn’t have concrete plans for where he will live next. My boyfriend doesn’t track his spending. I have offered to help him make a budget several times, but he never follows up. He says that he has some savings, but my guess is that it is less than $2,000. As far as I know, he has no debt.




I lent him $900 for car repairs (engine) over the summer. I did this because he didn’t have the money and was about to sign up for a loan with a ridiculously high interest rate to cover the cost (I think it was 50% interest after three months, but I don't remember exactly). However, he now needs $2,000 to repair the air conditioning and he is not able to afford it.





I am very anxious about moving in with him. I like to plan ahead but I don’t have a clear picture of his financial situation at all so I don’t know what we could afford if we lived together. I have no clue how he will be able to afford rent, living expenses, insurance premiums, and college classes. I don’t know how he will manage classes and two jobs. It is possible that if he does not find a second job in January, he may end up only earning money from the internship. I worry that he doesn’t have an emergency fund large enough to cover things like medical emergencies or car repairs. I’m not even sure if he plans to get health insurance. 




A one-bedroom apartment in my area is at least $1,400 but it is much more common to see $1,600 or more. My boyfriend wants to move into a two-bedroom apartment.




I work full time and earn $50,000 gross at my current job. After taxes and deductions, my take home pay was $38,000 last year. However, I will be contributing $2,700 to my FSA for healthcare expenses in 2020 so my monthly take home will be lower. I currently live with relatives. I have a 12 month emergency fund, track all of my spending on an app, and have a FICO score of 796. 




What are some important things that I need to know before we agree to move in together? I worry that he can’t really afford to live on his own right now, even if I am paying half of the living expenses."

Yet despite all of my hardest work, I feel like I've made 0 progress. I served 4 years as a Marine and followed it by getting my BA. I worked part time jobs for cash and did quite a few internships based on the career I wanted.

I had to take a test to get into the grad school I wanted...took me a year and a half but I scored in the 98% and got into a great school. While I studied for the test I worked two jobs that were related to the field.

I'm now 1 1/2 years into the 3 year program  and just feel done. I'm not making any money, I have no more will power to do the best work I can, I have very few relationships (friends or romantic) because I moved halfway across country to go to this school.

I feel like no matter how much I have worked I am just spinning my wheels in the mud making no progress. I've gained a ton of weight because I quit smoking cigs but also don't work out because I have been dedicating all my time to chasing my career.

I am just done, I can't get myself to lift a finger any more and I feel lazy, fat, lethargic and have constant panic and anxiety attacks.

I hate it."

That is why I reach out to your kennel! I understand that your last female dog has passed away recently. ㅠ.ㅠ

It must be such devastating news for the male dogs!  —  I've spent long and hard thinking about how I could contribute to your kennel and while doing so, on a western message board, I received the recommendation, that I could try replacing the bitch you've lost, so that your mutts neither suffer from a reduction in fertility nor increased aggression. 

I think that is very important for a breeding kennel, no? Considering how important both of these are to the pedigree of a renown kennel.  —  The men were so friendly in recommending me how to best help, and they even voiced that, in their opinion, a cute Korean girl would be for sure  liked by all the big dogs!

Therefore,  I was thinking, maybe I could wear my old school uniform and let them dry-hump on me. Many of my panties are very soft and hopefully shouldn't cause pain to the dogs.\~

When I was young I often roamed around on all four and went \*wang!\* \*wang!\*. I think I can be a convincing dog for them and I would like to contribute to your great kennel and help you make this amazing breed more popular in Korea!

Please consider hiring me, I will try my best to become an asset to your kennel and earn myself a letter of recommendation for my CV.\~

First time post, it will be pretty long, and I appreciate any advice :)
Since I was 16 my relationship with my mom has been pretty rocky.  She puts me down, constantly compares me to my older (favourite) sister, and on occasion our arguments got physical.  My mother is narcissistic, paranoid and will do anything to prove she is right.  A number of reasons, including those above, caused my mental health to deteriorate, causing self hard and suicidal thoughts.  I have since been doing incredible.  I am 26, a full time nurse, i have an amazing boyfriend, and we recently purchased a home together.  Since i moved out my mom has made it her mission for me to come back home, so she could continue to control me and my finances.  she hates i do not rely on her as my sister does (to manage my money, or my independence) I paid off my student loans, bought a car, and moved out.  
She continues to berate me and tell me ""it's okay if i cant do it and to come back home.""

RECENTLY, my relationship with her has become intolerable.  
In May of this year, my boyfriend's dad was selling his vehicle, and my parents were in the market for a car (because the perfect child was given one of their cars). Mine and my SOs parents met, test drove the car, communicated with each other, and decided to purchase.  The car was sent to their mechanic for the safety, repairs were needed, my mom agreed to the repairs and for the price of the repair.  
Right off the bat a repair was a stone chip in the windsheid (which was there during the test drive) but she is convinced my FIL put the chip in himself after they agreed to purchase the car.  My FIL took money off the purchase price of the vehicle because he felt bad the cost of all the repairs necessary for the car, however my mom thinks its because he is guilty for putting the stone chip in. 
My FIL works straight nights, and can have a quick temper.  With my mom pestering him for days on end with endless questions, they met to finalize the purchase.  This was in early August.  My FIL forgot the winter tires, and my mom went off how angry she was he forgot them, to which my FIL ""screamed"" (i put in quotes because this is her story) at my mom that he is tired of dealing with the car and he just wants to finish the sale and move on.

Flash forward three weeks, my parents ask me to come to their home so they can tell me their story about the car.  apparently some repairs that were done for the safety were done previous and she doesn't understand why they are needing to be done again.  When my mom took the car to the MTO, the woman at the desk sent her to an appraiser and the car was appraised at 800 instead of the 1000 purchase price - so in her eyes they were scammed and taken advantage of.  
She then began to cry and said because of the way my FIL ""screamed"" at her, you act in the way you are raised and she is worried my boyfriend yells at me and abuses me the way my FIL did to her.  (for context, although biased because he is my partner, my boyfriend is the kindest person, and is basically a human golden retriever)
During this argument, she decided to bring up my mental health from 10 years ago, to justify her statement.  Saying she was afraid I am with him because I don't think I can do any better, and to remember when my self esteem was so low I would do anything for anyone. 
When i left their house, 3 weeks passed with no communication. Four days before a doctors appointment I get a text asking if I was home.  I was originally supposed to bring her to and from her appointment, however I did not feel comfortable doing this given the last conversation we had.  I felt I was convenient to her, as she only reached out prior to her appointment. (this isnt the first time they come to me out of convenience - we live approx an hour apart and the only time they come to see me is when they've already driven half way for another purpose) 
The day of her appointment I did not attend, and later in the evening I got a phone call to tell me how much of a disappointment I am.  
Two-three weeks go by, with one phone call that is, in its entirety, a screaming match.  At first i fought back, then I ask for an apology, then just an acknowledgement that my feelings were hurt, and now I just sit and listen while she yells and talks down to me.  
This brings us to now.  My mom has decided to involve my sister, who texts me ""are you ok"" fishing for my side of the story.  Appearing like she cares for me, I found out yesterday, just as I suspected, my sister read everything I said to my mom.  
I don't feel I can trust anyone.  
My sister lives in PEI while she is completing her veterinary internship and she is going to be in Ontario this coming weekend.  After 2 weeks of her not replying to a text I sent, and being attacked by my sister, I received a snarky phone call last night asking ""if I even care about the family and if I'm going to show up to see my sister"" 
My sister has expressed she feels the need to have a family sit down, although she doesn't need to be involved in the least.  I told my mom i would check my schedule and get back to her, trying to end the conversation, but she pushed to find out I am off work this weekend (I end a night shift Saturday morning) She then proceeded to scream at me, asking if I even care about the family. 

I don't know what to do.  
I still love my family, but I can feel my mental health slipping, I can feel myself going backwards.  If i go there, I know i will be sat down and berated, told all the ways I am wrong, how I have disappointed them, and how I should apologize for the way I have acted. 
If I don't go, then my mom will say I am the reason the family fell apart."
duz92j,4,2019-11-11,I think I'm caught in a love triangle,gav1414,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/duz92j/i_think_im_caught_in_a_love_triangle/,"Good afternoon everyone,

I never thought I would resort to reddit for advice however here we are, so I hope some of you will take the time to read my post and offer some advice. 

So earlier this year I met a girl in an office setting as she was an intern and I was a full-time employee of this company. We hit it off well to say the least and the more we got to know each other the more I realized that I could see myself with this person in a long-term relationship one day, however I kept these feelings to myself. At this point our relationship was just seeing each other at work and the occasional back and forth texting, as we had only known each other for a few months at this point.

 This went on for a few months until her internship ended and she graduated from university. After she graduated, she remained in town with plans to gain employment with our company. We continued to text for a couple more months several times a week as she had still been unable to gain employment with us. 

Around two months ago I invited her to a casual dinner after not having seen her for about two months and we hit it off yet again, it was as if we had been talking and seeing each other every day. Around this time I realized that I was interested in her from a romantic standpoint. About two weeks after I realized this, we went out for drinks and I revealed to her that I was interested in her romantically, and she reciprocated this feeling back to me. She said that she had been interested in me for some time, however she didn't think that I was interested in her. She then revealed to me that she had been seeing a guy for around a month now, but she also said that she wasn't really interested in dating him at this time. (It's important to note that this guy is also a member of her friend group, and they are together quite a bit with the group.) I didn't think much of it at this time, so I invited her back to my place and we ended up sleeping together that night. It's also important to note here that she basically blew him off the entire night, and she made him aware that she went home with me from the get-go.

 A few nights later she came over to my place, and I made it known to her that I see myself with her in a long-term relationship. She agreed that she liked me, but said that she does not want to commit to anything right now. She said that she has liked me for a while and one day could see herself with me, but cannot commit to anything right now due to this other guy she is seeing being in her friend group. She said she can't just end the relationship so abruptly with him out of respect for him. She said that she also does not want to be hated by her entire friend group. I agreed with her on this and we agreed to continue hanging out but would not enter in to any committed relationship right now.  

So for the last two months we have been hanging out about once a week and sometimes sleeping together, while she is also hanging out with this other guy, who she is also probably sleeping with. While we are hanging out weekly, I am the one who always asks if she wants to hang out, not the other way around. I don't think she has actually asked me to hang out without me mentioning it. We are texting basically daily now, with both of us initiating the first text equally. Our conversations are really good, however it bothers me that she has not really asked me to hang out first. Furthermore, since I made my feelings known to her, I am falling more and more for her each week. I feel like she was more invested in me before we began hanging out together, now I believe it is the other way around. I want the relationship and I don't think she is even close to that right now. 

I've found also that as the weeks have gone on, my emotional health has really taken a hit with the anxiety of wondering on any given night is she sleeping with this other guy. I have thought numerous times about just cutting back tremendously the amount of time I text/spend time with her, however I'm afraid of losing her to this other person if I do this, as I think she likes both of us equally. (It should be noted that I have actually never met this other guy.) There is one big problem with this though, she is most likely going to start working at the same company as me and we could be co-workers very soon. I feel like if this happens the odds will be in my favor here. I also truly believe that she wants a relationship with me and once this other guy graduates university and moves out of town, this will give her the freedom to not have to directly hurt his feelings. The other guy will be done with university next May. 

So I need some advice. I really do like this girl, and I'm willing to be patient to get her if what she is saying is true. What I don't want is to be drug along in a love triangle with no foreseeable end. Admittedly, these last two months I have been an emotional wreck, and I'm not sure how much longer I can do this. I'm not going to give her an ultimatum, as I want her to be able to decide on her own, but I am spending way too much energy on this and am nearing my end. What should I do? Thanks in advance for the advice. (Also, I am 29M and she is 23F)."
duzkv0,97,2019-11-11,Discussion of Ep. 87 especially Hades' behavior,BoboTheOwl,Lore_Olympus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lore_Olympus/comments/duzkv0/discussion_of_ep_87_especially_hades_behavior/,"Ep. 87 represents a major change in how Hades deals with Persephone, and I believe it is because he now [knows she is not a full member of TGOEM.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lore_Olympus/comments/du5ntz/chapter_84/f72grqk/) Hades is both actively courting Persephone *and* auditioning her as Queen, and she is doing very well.

First, Hades is now evaluating Persephone as a potential Queen. One of the most important things Hades requires in a Queen is a partner who can help govern the Underworld. Governance, even by non-A' holes, requires making decisions benefiting some people over others, and sometimes people get hurt. Perhaps the biggest risk of taking Persephone as queen is that her innocence will prevent her from making the hard choices, or&amp;mdash;worse yet&amp;mdash;get in the way of Hades making hard decisions.
*
He tests Persephone by presenting unvarnished reality, and seeing how she reacts. He does not equivocate at all that he had, in fact, popped the paparazzo's eye and broken the paparazzo's legs. A *bad* outcome for Persephone as queen would be an inability to accept the premise of Hades' behavior. Persephone understands and accepts the need for action, but disputes his conclusions with equally valid arguments. In other words, Persephone debates with Hades by appealing to the same logic Hades must use to govern his kingdom, thereby demonstrating she is capable of being queen. Perhaps better, she comes to a different conclusion from Hades, meaning she wouldn't just simply echo Hades' views, making her a valuable counsellor.

Second, Hades is actively courting Persephone. Up until this point, Hades has never initiated emotional or physical intimacy. Aphrodite puts Persephone in Hades car leading to her spending the night at his home &lt;Ep. 4&gt;. Hera assigns Persephone as Hades' intern &lt;Ep. 31&gt;. Hecate leaves Persephone with Hades for the tour &lt;Ep. 52&gt;. Persephone spontaneously arrives at Hades' brother's house. &lt;Ep. 78&gt;. Hades occasionally exploits the intimacy, but (other than at the party when he attempts to talk to Persephone without knowing her age, or really anything about her) he never initiates or escalates the intimacy. 

In &lt;Ep. 87&gt; Hades is all about the intimacy, and doesn't shy away from it. He takes Persephone to his private hideaway. He has ~~dinner~~ lunch with her. He takes her concerns seriously, voices his own concerns, and even admits vulnerability when he says he probably did attack the paparazzo for his own reasons. Most importantly, however, Hades *extends his hand to Persephone who then takes it* and says that the last thing he wants to do is hurt her. That is a profound admission, though not quite a confession of love. Rather than back away from the emotional intimacy, or fear it, Hades embraces it.

Hades also appears to be explicitly replacing Minthe. Minthe makes a big deal about Hades preparing Minthe food, but not Persephone; Hades prepares Persephone food. Minthe stays in an apartment Hades (apparently) provides for her; Hades provides a space for Persephone. Most obviously, Hades creates the *exact same dress we see Minthe wearing at work &lt;Ep. 33&gt;* for Persephone. I suspect this is all intended to be taken as subliminal, but to a reader (and to Minthe) the meaning should be obvious. ""Good riddance to old rubbish; there's a new queen bee in town.""

There seems to be a fair amount of game left to play in the Hades and Persephone relationship, but &lt;Ep. 87&gt; represents the point where Hades is playing for keeps. Persephone may not have completely figured out the score yet, but seeing the pomelia on the table clued her in, a little. There is a whole drawer of Persephone memorabilia speaking to his feelings for her at Hades townhouse. The banter between Persephone and Hades also indicates that she, too, is thinking about the long game including her reputation and power, and they both recognize that she is more powerful than the 'toon has let on. (Not many people could release the dead, I'm just sayin'.) I am fairly confident the speech bubble at the end is Persephone's, and it will be interesting to see what she apologizes for. Regardless, it seems that Hades *has* ""figured it out"" as Hera put it, and is starting to make his play. He did not expect Persephone to show up at work, so his reaction is unplanned, but his response represents a change in his attitude towards Persephone from a tempting minx to someone he could marry. &lt;Ep. 87&gt; *is not Hades ""taking his shot""* but he is getting into position."

I wanted to give you a chance of seeing the impact it made\~)

To whom it may concern,

I'm a university student, looking for a part-time job to not only help my grandparents with putting me through university but also, to make my CV stand out for future internship applications\~

That is why I reach out to your kennel! I understand that your last female dog has passed away recently. ㅠ.ㅠ

It must be such devastating news for the male dogs! — I've spent long and hard thinking about how I could contribute to your kennel and while doing so, on a western message board, I received the recommendation, that I could try replacing the bitch you've lost, so that your mutts neither suffer from a reduction in fertility nor increased aggression.

I think that is very important for a breeding kennel, no? Considering how important both of these are to the pedigree of a renown kennel. — The men were so friendly in recommending me how to best help, and they even voiced that, in their opinion, a cute Korean girl would be for sure liked by all the big dogs!

Therefore, I was thinking, maybe I could wear my old school uniform and let them dry-hump on me. Many of my panties are very soft and hopefully shouldn't cause pain to the dogs.\~

When I was young I often roamed around on all four and went \*wang!\* \*wang!\*. I think I can be a convincing dog for them and I would like to contribute to your great kennel and help you make this amazing breed more popular in Korea!

Please consider hiring me, I will try my best to become an asset to your kennel and earn myself a letter of recommendation for my CV.\~

yours respectfully,

We are working to automate this process programmatically. The requirements was to do it in c# (since that is our tech stack). I got it working in a very brittle manner by having a Template build, using the GetBuildDefinition method in the BuildHttpClient and serializing that object into a JObject and changing the respective properties (such as triggers, name of build, etc) and then deserialized that back into a BuildDefinition object. 

With some pretty extension research, I have not been able to find a different way to do it. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

The World's a Stage: The League of Legends is the top rated show in The entire world hundreds of thousands of people watch, stream and pirate the show every single week to find out about their favourite characters and champions. Perhaps there are some saucy behind the scenea romances we don't know about between a champion and an intern. Perhaps one of the champions is dating some big sports star or perhaps the paparazzi catch a few giving a fan the best night of their life. 

 Out of the Screen: based on my other prompt, what would happen if you took a female champion who was head over heels obsessed with their player and brought them into the real world? How would you explain their sudden appearance to friends and family. How would they fit into this modern world of ours?

The Legendary Whore House: some say during the Harrowing if you find yourself at a crossroads between Noxus and Demacia a Darkin may appear and offer you a chance to enter a door into the Legendary Brothel. You pay a sum of gold and whoever you ask for is brought up to your room to willingly give you all that you desire~

Your Prompt: maybe none of these appeal to you but you really wanna see your favourite Champion getting rammed, fucked, eaten out and covered with cum. That's fine by me we can discuss kinks and come up with a pervy situation!

Kinks: large cock size and cum loads, rimjobs, sloppy blowjobs, slutty clothing, oil play and lots more so hit me up let's have a chat."

At university, my coding experience is limited to DR.RACKETT, a language which I haven't seen being used in mainstream CS environments. So my question is, how do I go about building showcase-able personal projects? Object-oriented programming is an option that my teachers suggested, but how long does that take to pick up, and has it been over-done?

_______

""Congratulations! We'd like to extend you an offer for the AMWF summer internship program! Please find your offer letter attached. Reply to this email with your start date and end date and please fill out the relocation form!""

You were ecstatic when you got that email. AMWF was one of the leading technology companies in the cloud computing space. Their position in their space, coupled with their San Francisco high rise office, insane perks (massage room, library) and high pay made their internship program one of the most competitive in the world. And you got in.
______

You got out of the elevator to the 50th floor office of AMWF, ready for your first day. You headed to the receptionist, a pretty blonde lady wearing a tight, revealing dress, and told you who you were.

""Ah, yes! One of the interns!"" she exclaimed, handing you a guest pass and instructing you to head to a meeting room called Cybertron, where your mentor would be meeting you shortly.

On the way, you noticed a few things. One, the office seemed to be composed of two distinct types of people, tall, fit, handsome Asian men and white women dressed in revealing clothes. You wondered who your mentor would be as you sat inside Cybertron, a meeting room with an expansive view of the city's financial district.

_______

A few minutes later, a [pale, blonde woman walked in, clutching a laptop and a coffee cup. She was dressed in a tight skirt, heels, and a black crop top. She looked more like a whore than a professional.](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg) 

""Hi! You must be *your name*!"" she beamed, sitting down next to you at the conference table. 

""I'm Rosie, and I'm going to be your mentor here at AMWF, "" she opened her laptop, typing away for a few seconds before turning her attention to you.

""Since you're my intern, it's my job to make sure you're getting all the support and help you need, "" she giggles, scooching a bit closer to you. You notice she's booked two hours for this meeting room.

""So, first things first, which one of my holes do you want me to service you with first, *daddy*?"" she purred.

Hi! I'm Rosie and I kind of look like [this](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg). I'm looking to play your mentor/cum dump during your internship at AMWF. I like dirty talk, name calling, raceplay (Asian dominance &lt;3), big cocks, lots of cum, impregnation, and cheating.

dv4ynh,1,2019-11-11,How can I be there more for my boyfriend?,ak1702,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dv4ynh/how_can_i_be_there_more_for_my_boyfriend/,"This post is kinda long, so the short version is at the bottom. 

Hi, my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years struggles with depression. I suffer from depression and anxiety, so i understand how it really does take a dramatic toll on everything in you. 

He’s currently enrolled into college and this is his third year and he absolutely hates it. He doesn’t have any friends at the university he goes to, but he commutes because it’s only a 45 minute drive from there and back home so he doesn’t necessarily live on campus anyway. He’s always been naturally sort of shy and has struggled with meeting new people, so making friends up there has been really difficult for him. He has me and his best friend which is really the only people around his own age he really interacts with, and I feel like a part of that definitely contributes to him feeling worse because he doesn’t get out as much or has a ton of fun during the week. He’s constantly studying and going back and forth between school and his internship and back home. 

I’ve always been the very idealistic one about things, and he’s been more of the cynical one so at times we do balance each other out, however, I do also feel like his cynicism gets in the way of him wanting to try new things or have faith that he’s capable of discovering his passion. He still has no idea what he wants to do with his life, and I feel for that, and I can tell it puts a lot of stress on him. I just really worry about him I guess because he’s been stuck in this place where his depression just consumes him and it kills me to watch it happen. I try to ask him, “well, when are you the happiest?” To see if there’s anything there he enjoys doing that could potentially give him some inspiration, but he says he either doesn’t know or else when he’s with me, which is a problem because I know that he can’t always depend on me to make him happy. 

I’m one to generally have a tendency to take on other people’s problems and lately it’s been stressing me out while also kinda weighing me down because he has so much potential and his depression is holding him back from embracing his potential. I really do understand how difficult it is, but things aren’t looking really good right now. I love him so much and I’d kill to see him enjoy himself independently of what we do together and find things that inspire him. For example, he loves working out, that’s one of the things he’s incredibly passionate about. He’s an incredible musician too however that quickly burnt out after he was rejected from getting into their music program. 

It’s just really painful for me to watch, and I take on his pain like it’s my own, and I don’t know how else to help him other than to be there and to listen the best that I can. Is there anything I can possibly say to him or I can do to help guide him? He’s just really lost and hopeless about the future and in his abilities to succeed. 

TL;DR: boyfriend’s depression has been bad lately, hopeless about the future and his abilities to succeed moving through and on after college. What can I do to help him or inspire him? How can I learn not to take on his pain as my own so it’s not so overwhelming?"

dv5ds9,4,2019-11-12,I accepted two job offers. One i'm currently employed at and the one I really want. What do I do now?,itontoyo,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/dv5ds9/i_accepted_two_job_offers_one_im_currently/,"Hi, so for starters I am a college student who is graduating next semester.

I interned with Company A this past summer. I liked my internship, and wanted to continue it into the school year but the only way I had seen prior interns do this was if they accepted a full time offer at the end of the summer. I wanted to apply later in the fall, but felt pressured to apply during the summer to maintain the internship. So I applied for a full time position, received an offer, and accepted it. I did not sign any binding contract for that position.

I am not really sure if the job I do at Company A is what I want to do after graduation, I like it for now just maybe not forever. So I applied to other places and got another offer from Company B with similar pay doing something I think is more interesting. I accepted the offer from Company B and plan to follow through.

It has now been \~2 month since I accepted my offer at Company A. I still work there, and I need to keep my job there until at least April because I have bills I need to pay. I am afraid that if I retract my acceptance from Company A they will fire me (interns are a big time investment, and if I don't stay what do I really offer?). How do I handle this situation in a way that I can keep my job until April without burning bridges?"
dv5jkl,419,2019-11-12,Why Rocket Launchers are Good OR How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the EXPLOSIONS,Nukesnipe,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dv5jkl/why_rocket_launchers_are_good_or_how_i_learned_to/,"I see a lot of fake news getting spread around about rocket launchers, and yeah, they're not in the best spot ever.  They were too powerful with auto reload and could do with a pretty significant damage buff now that they and GLs aren't both full auto.

But I'm not here to talk about how rockets could be improved, I'm here to tell you about two rocket launchers everyone is sleeping on and that are actually so goddamn good they'll give you a priapism so fucking hard you can break Crota's shield with it.  First up:

***Two-Tailed Fox***

""But Nuke"" I hear you say.  ""I'm not a fucking weeaboo!""  Yes, you are, I've seen your Jojo memes.  Now sit down, because you shouldn't be standing for how amazing TTF actually is.  First, what is it, for those of you who saw it was a rocket launcher and immediately vaulted it?  Well, basically, it's a rocket launcher that loads one rocket, but fires two tracking rockets.  One is void and suppresses enemies it damages, while the other is solar and deals damage over time.  Here's the kicker, though.

**Both rockets deal full damage.**

This isn't a case of your rocket's damage being split in half and spread between two rockets, you're doing two full rockets' worth of damage for every rocket you yeet downrange.  So, functionally, you're getting double the ammo reserves of other rockets, even considering that TTF can carry one fewer than others.  While it doesn't have cluster bombs or impact casing, you don't fucking need them because every shot does twice the base damage of other rockets... and you get some DoT from the solar rocket.  This beast is so good, it's my go-to for single-target damage if I'm taking a rocket launcher.

And as a quick aside, why would you ever take a rocket over something like Izanagi or Whisper or a grenade launcher?  Well, my friend, it's because of something called...

**Burst Damage.**

Everyone talks about sustained DPS, but sustained deeps isn't the only damage value that exists.  Burst damage is how much you can deal in as short a time as possible, such as, say, the time it takes to shoot a rocket off.  Rockets excel in burst damage, and are good in situations where you have to stay mobile and can't pull out your folding chair, whip out your fishing rod and drill holes into a god's skull with your sword that has Outlaw as its trait.  What's a boss that has this situation?

**Zulmak.**

I wrote a pretty substantial guide on how to solo Pit of Heresy, and currently I'm sitting at two solo flawless clears, with another non-flawless, planning to go for 69 solo flawless clears.  All three of those used Two-Tailed Fox to kill Zulmak.  Sure, maybe Izanagi could have three-phased him instead of four-phase, but Izanagi requires you to line up your shot and can't be done midair, like TTF can.  TTF lets you pop off a pair of rockets, and then immediately get moving to put the crystal between you and Zulmak, and also keeps you out of the reach of the thrall Suicide Squad.

But what's the other rocket launcher?  Well...

**Heretic.**

I'm not gonna lie, I brushed this one off at first too.  Then I got a Demolitionist Epicurian and started playing around with it, and realized something amazing.  **Demolitionist reloads your weapon when you throw a grenade.**  Obviously I, and a lot of people, slept on this, because Demolitionist is usually on things like primaries or specials that don't struggle with reload speed nearly as much as, say, a rocket launcher.  And sure, Shining Sphere also has Demolitionist, but Shining Sphere is worse at boss damage than I am at connecting emotionally with my friends and family for several reasons.  First, it's adaptive frame, so lower damage per rocket and second, the perk selection in general is fucking terrible.  Snapshot sights?  No Clusters?  *In the bin!*

So, Heretic.  Occasionally, someone at Bungie will do a line off an intern's ass and do something stupid, like putting a trait that's normally in the second slot in the first slot instead.  This can result in pretty interesting rolls, like the Dragonfly/Rampage Ringing Nail or Kill Clip/Rampage Kindled Orchid.  And here, we got Demolitionist in the first slot of a rocket launcher... with *Cluster Bombs* in the second!  Halle-fucking-lujah.  Throw on an Impact Casing if you get lucky, and this thing fucking shreds.  Unlike weapons like a Spike Grenades/Full Court Love and Death or a Firing Line Tranquility, you do need to build around Heretic, but it is *nasty* if you do.  As a Warlock main, I'll just point out the two big combos for Heretic, and both are with old, forgotten exotics.  Good job, Bungie!  You're making old gear relevant for new builds, genuinely a good job.

**Sunbracers.**

The OG Sunbreakers, these had a resurgence when Monte Carlo came out and people realized you could have infinite grenades.  Well, guess what's also good with infinite grenades?  That's right, a rocket launcher that reloads instantly when you throw a grenade!  Put on your flaming Titan rubber gloves, my dudes, because after you bitch slap a thrall and see that lovely *Sunbracers Ready* pop up in your corner, you can go to town.  Shoot a rocket, yeet a solar grenade, shoot a rocket, yeet a grenade, boom, yeet, boom, yeet.  You can get 5-6 rockets off in the 5 seconds that Sunbracers are active, and you can do some *insane* damage this way.  The other exotic is...

**Starfire Protocol.**

These are even less relevant than Sunbracers, but have some pretty good synergy with Heretic.  Most notably,  you don't have to kill a minor to get it going, as you already get a spare grenade right off the bat.  So just there, you can dump three rockets in mere seconds without having to do anything else.  But then, you drop an Empowering Rift, and you get a spicy boost to damage just from that, of course.  But damage while in an Empowering Rift while wearing Sunbracers gives you grenade energy, so as you shoot rockets, you're getting grenade energy back, letting you shoot more rockets.  You can, in my experience, get about 4 rockets off before you really have to start slowing down, but an Empowering Rift lasts much longer than Sunbracers.  But wanna hear something even better?  

**Starfire Protocol works with Well of Radiance as well.**  

As well, nyuk.  If you're with teammates on middle tree Dawnblade, as long as they stand in your well, your ability regen goes through the roof, which means that you have even less downtime on your rockets.  And since Well lasts 30 seconds, you can absolutely dump all your reserves before it goes away.  It's even stronger in groups of enemies, as the cluster bombs can kill minors and Demolitionist can give you grenade energy back!  And since you're throwing grenades, if you're fighting Taken, Hive or Fallen, you can put on the appropriate Armaments mod and chuck grenades into the crowd to get extra ammo, extending your damage even further!  And as a final aside, Starfire works with Fusion grenades instead of Solar.  Solar don't stack their DPS, but Fusions do damage as explosions, and do stack.  So you're getting a bit extra DPS just from your grenades, too!

What about other classes?  I haven't really experimented with them, but I've heard good things about Armamentarium an bottom tree Sentinel, and someone mentioned top tree Striker.  I have no idea about Hunter though, feel free to comment about both!

**TL;DR Altars is dropping one of the best, most fun rockets in the game that actually does DPS comparable to grenade launchers or sniper rifles with the right build, and it'll only get better if Bungie gets off their butts and buffs rocket launchers.**

Thanks for coming to my Toland Talk."

""Sweety, I'm so sorry,"" she said with a very sympathetic look ""I know I was supposed to take care of you tonight, but Liz just called while you were in the shower and she really needs a friend right now. I'm gonna grab a few drinks with her.""

""Ugh..."" I sigh, ""OK. OK.  But, I've been saving it up all for you this week and I'm about to explode!""

""Well, since I'm the one bailing, I'll let you use the on-call tonight"" she replied.

""Who is it tonight?"" I asked as my mood quickly started to change for the better...

_____________________________________________________

OK. So for this RP, I want you to play two women - my wife and the on-call girl who I get to use a few times a year when my wife gives me permission. The on-call girl is always someone we know, and my wife set them all up.

My wife is a very organized woman. So basically, she put together a calendar and gets every day scheduled about two or three months in advance. All of them know the deal - if you're on call, you MIGHT get a call from me and if you do, you're supposed to come by and give me head, no questions asked, until I explode.

So, for tonight, I want you to respond to my question about who it is with one of the following and I want to play the night out with you, my on-call woman:

Amanda: My wife's super-slutty friend.

Jill: Her mom was a huge slut when I was in college and I used to fuck her. My wife's firm just hired Jill and told me about her...about how slutty and sexy she was. I asked to see a pic and I immediately recognized her. Long-story short, she was just as slutty, maybe even more, than her mom. So when my wife asked her about me, she jumped at it...and she knows her mom's history with me, but she doesn't care at all.

Brittany: Another co-worker of my wife's - actually an intern. She just turned 21 and is a big-titted, blonde slut. She's been 21 for three months and still never paid for her own drink.

Lizzy: One night when I was allowed to use the on call, the woman who was on had to bail. My wife made me a Tinder account to find a replacement...Lizzy was it. And she was good. My wife liked her, so she stayed in the mix.

Gillian: Has a GREAT rack and an almost unmatched enthusiasm for sucking cock. She's a friend of my ex-girlfriend that my wife has met a few times cause she hangs out at some of the same places we do and we always say hi. My wife quickly recruited her when she saw how slutty she was dressed.

Bridgette: Married woman about two doors down. She is a super MILF with a great body and her hubby is away a lot. She'd never get permission from hubby to do this so she'd rather hope not to get caught and ask for forgiveness if she does.

Ashley: A thick, sexy, super slutty former co-worker and hookup of mine who happens to still live nearby.

Your Idea: Tell me/show me another character you want to play.

A Porn Star: Through my wife's firm, she represents many in the entertainment industry, including the adult industry. Her clients that I'm into are: Dayna Vendetta, Angela White, Abbey Brooks, Audrey Bitoni, Vicky Vette, Dylan Ryder, Leslie Zen, Tory Lane, and Jenna Haze. You can pick any one (or more).

So if you're still with me, get in touch, and tell me who you want to play. I can show you what I envision any of these potential characters look like, but am also open to suggestions you have! I can also give you more background on the type of character I want my wife to play too, but you can probably already gather that she's sexy, confident, and always looking out for me.

With the right partner, I think this can be a lot of fun, so get in touch soon and light up that orange envelope!"

Last weekend, he had a school trip at same time like an internship. Never we expected that at those 2 nights of trip, there would be parties. It's not his nature being in a party and interacting mostly with other girls because we're trying to avoid being attracted honestly. Well before the trip happened, and something happened between us, we had a fight. Because of that we couldn't talk well for 4 days, it was our longest time not talking as well. So before his trip we weren't completely fine and mostly him because he was hurt he told and me too ofc. When he came back from trip and finally he was talking again to me. He sent me audios and I noticed his voice didn't sound fine. He told me directly that I feel so weird, at first I thought maybe because of more than a week not talking to each other that's why he felt like that, I felt same too. But then he kept saying that and added that he feels so confused as well. I felt so nervous and I felt like something happened from the trip. 

Me and my partner since day 1, we talked about a lot of things and agreed on many things too like about having friendships with opposite gender or being too close with others. We both have same different thoughts like that, though others I know would say it's fine having other friends from opposite gender. So since we knew each other well about those things, what he told me recently about the trip was too unexpected for me and him too. He told me honestly that he felt attracted by other women in the school trip, some even trying to invite him alone in their bedrooms but he never accepted any. He told me that he was so controlling himself not to, and it felt so bad for him same time like a hell and big temptations, because of girls and alcohols. But then he told me that he had fun meeting new people and he had great time with them. It just made me confused how he could say that he felt enjoyed but then he felt bad. About being attracted by others, he mentioned that some girls were even inviting him to drink but he doesn't, and he accidentally drink alcohol because it had same color. That added to his bad feelings. And also that those girls were wearing like those kind of attractive clothes. He kept saying I felt confused and so weird, and that it felt like he was out of his comfort zone. Since he never do like that, drinking alcohol, being with girls around trying to flirt or seduce him, and doing parties. 

When I heard this directly from him and it just broke me inside, because I was thinking he's that kind of too loyal person that never hangs out with girls nor see them. I am too towards to him so loyal to that point I don't have any male friends, because I want to avoid attractions as well and problems. We talked before that we can't ever avoid interacting with other people, mostly opposite genders, when we'll be in school or work, because it's everywhere and we know it. We were thinking maybe it's just because we didn't talk well these days then he suddenly had a trip. And maybe he was even trying to not think about me in those times he was having times with those new people he met. And also because of his stress and anger problems these last few months,  the distance, about our future that he was stressing how we can make it happen. He's still studying, but he'll be done next year, while me going to start a work soon. He's being so hopeless that we can make it because of his stress. It affects his physical and mostly his mental health. I've been trying to help him by giving positive reminders, like how we used to do I try always making little sweet surprises for him, trying share things with him even we're apart. He's still feeling the same until now, plus something happened to him in the trip saying he is feeling confused now. What should I do, any advices how should I do with our relationship? He told he wants to be with me because it'll be better. Anyway we met twice already irl. And we spent around 5 months, had a lot of beautiful and crazy memories together for first times. He's actually my first in everything. So it just hurt me so much what's happening to him now. I don't want to lose him because I still feel these feelings for him that saying it's just his mind maybe and his heart is still the same. 

Tldr: I feel so heartbroken my ldr bf was uncontrollably and unexpectedly got attracted by other girls apart me. He's a loyal person to me to the point he never talks or have female friends. He told me everything so honestly and I'm so thankful for that but still breaking me. 
How should I do and deal about these feelings or situations? Does it happen to some of you too? Anyways, he's planning to go today to psychologist. 

Thank you for taking time to read sorry if it's long. I tried to explain all I hope you guys understand!"
dva1tw,30,2019-11-12,I received a transmission from the expedition team sent to explore the “Mountain of Black Silk” and I am terrified.,ItsMeRoyale,RoyalStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyalStories/comments/dva1tw/i_received_a_transmission_from_the_expedition/,"*Some secrets of our world are not meant to be forcefully uncovered. They will reveal themselves when their time approaches. But, when the search for secrets is overwhelmed with self-pride and greed, well, that is when the trouble truly begins.*

It was supposed to be the greatest discovery of the modern era, the next wonder of the world.

I was hired as an intern of a research and expedition agency, named CrypTech Corps, and I was tasked with monitoring the travel status of the exploration crew led by Professor Zora to the newly discovered Mountain of Black Silk, once thought to be a legend of ancient tribal lore. The remote mountain was believed to contain artifacts, jewels, and priceless forgotten fabrics from merchant sailors who inhabited the secret area; they were using the mountain as a storage depot, deep within its core. CrypTech had brought all this information to the crew beforehand. They assured that this was a straightforward mission and nominated Prof. Zora to be in charge much to her reluctance.

From what I’ve heard with my time on the internship, CrypTech handles these types of findings, locations thought to be of mere myth, and sends expedition teams to investigate after months of conducting research through countless studies.

The Mountain of Black Silk is located on one of two distinct islands connected by a thin strip of land that acts as a natural bridge. After weeks of preparation, I joined the main unit of researchers as we were transported via helicopter to the shoreline of a small tribal village. The locals, during our brief encounter, somehow knew where we were heading to. They kept repeating words in their own language with abrupt tones filled with fear and anxiety, but due to my unfamiliarity with their dialect, I was unable to understand what they were saying.

From there, we took a boat to the island opposite to The Mountain of Black Silk and set up basecamp. Both islands were made up of thick forests and foliage save for a smaller clearing on the first island that hosted our basecamp. The expedition was anticipated to last about one week, and we made sure the environmental conditions were right for our hiking crew. Meanwhile, the mountain could be seen from a distance, barely hidden by the canopies of the tall trees. We flew our tech drones overhead the day before the hike to scout out the area. From the footage, I could see the mountain very distinctly.

I was expecting to see it covered with the so-called ‘black silk’ referenced by the lore. Instead, I was greeted with a traditional, but a quite large, mountain. Dark jagged rocks stood upright here and there, forming together a towering peak that was *cocooned* by a layer of mist. I maneuvered the drone to do a full 360 around the natural structure until I noticed a set of stone stairways carved into its side, leading up to a small, dark tunnel covered by pillars of rock. Professor Zora had told us that this was the entrance into the Mountain of Black Silk, and it was the only way in or out.

After the brief was given the next morning, Prof. Zora, accompanied by six other researchers, began their journey. I stayed behind at basecamp, monitoring their progress from a workstation. Oddly, the signal channels on our radios and phones were blocked. The professor had briefed that the mountain was hindering the signals, or rather, something *in* the mountain was. So she had taken with her a mini-tablet, directly linked to my workstation, as our only form of communication.

The drones followed the crew until they arrived at the base. One by one, they followed each other up the stairs as they ascended the wall of rock. The winds had started to pick up and the stairs were quite narrow, so the team had to be wary of not slipping into a sudden plunge. They finally reached the mouth of the tunnel. I watched through the drone camera as they all entered, the torches disappearing into the dark oblivion. The drones were too big to fit into the tunnel but could be stationed by the opening. All I had to do was wait. The team had agreed to meet back in five hours, give or take.

However, five hours passed, then seven, then ten.

By the late afternoon, we had hurriedly compiled a search team from basecamp to enter the mountain. Before the team was set to go, I received a transmission from Prof. Zora’s tab device. I opened the file in the workstation and was completely shocked at what I read:

&gt;DO NOT SEND HELP. DO NOT SEND HELP.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pete, LISTEN to me. The rest of the crew are dead, at least I believe they are. God, I really hope they are.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don’t know what those *things* are doing to them. I don’t want them to suffer through *that*.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please, do not send anyone in. *It* knew we were coming.  
&gt;  
&gt;….  
&gt;  
&gt;I can feel *it* pulsating, Pete, the echo of a thousand heartbeats vibrating within the chasms of this abandoned abyss.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can hear *it’s* hunger, an ear-piercing roar of tortured voices searching for an escape, aching for peace.  
&gt;  
&gt;*It* lives within the walls, Pete.  
&gt;  
&gt;*It* is multiplying…W*aiting*.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fumes in here are unbearable. The air is burning my lungs, and I think the oxygen is almost up. Shit, we should have turned back when Monty coughed off the blood. There was so much blood…everywhere…  
&gt;  
&gt;We kept going deeper, running into a maze of countless tunnels. We were picked off one by one.  
&gt;  
&gt;….  
&gt;  
&gt;I can see the walls *moving*.  
&gt;  
&gt;A swarm of black, glossy, spiny tendrils is covering every bit of it. Black worm-like threads hang from the ceiling above, millions of them, wriggling in tiny translucent sacks letting off tiny chirp sounds. Dripping from them is a mix of dark juices, thick as blood, covering the entire floor. The liquid gives off steam accompanied by a horrendous odor, an intolerable nauseating sensation that has forced me to heave yesterday’s dinner into one of the corners.  
&gt;  
&gt;I need to find a way out. The walls have trapped me in here, and the last bit of sunlight from these cracks is already fading.  
&gt;  
&gt;….  
&gt;  
&gt;I do not know how long I can take it.  
&gt;  
&gt;The villagers were right…those transcripts were right…  
&gt;  
&gt;Why did we not listen, Pete? Why did *they* convince us to come?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Who are they really? They are hiding something from us. It was a trap. And we fell into it.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Find the truth about them, Pete. Escape while you still can.*  
&gt;  
&gt;….  
&gt;  
&gt;I’ve stumbled upon Monty. Or what’s left of him.  
&gt;  
&gt;He looks to be getting…*digested.* A clear cocoon has formed over his cadaver and I can barely make out his figure through the dark liquid that’s filling up inside the hollow cage.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am afraid the rest of the crew have met his fate as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;....  
&gt;  
&gt;Pete, I've figured out what happened to the merchants who tried to hide their fortune here. I can see the worms feasting on their encased, rotting carcasses as I gaze up.  
&gt;  
&gt;*They lied to us. They knew it all along.*  
&gt;  
&gt;….  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't think I will make it. My head feels like it is about to burst.  
&gt;  
&gt;My veins have portruded from my arms, swollen from exhaustion.  
&gt;  
&gt;The chirping worms have started to fall one by one from the ceiling, squirming around on the floor, leaving trails of a slimy substance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Every bit of light has been consumed. Every ounce of my energy has depleted.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can feel the tendrils slithering around, searching for me.  
&gt;  
&gt;….  
&gt;  
&gt;*It has found me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;The tendrils have begun to latch onto my legs. I can feel the spines piercing into my nervous system, pain equivalent to burning acid on an exposed bruise.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no treasure here, Pete. I can only see greed, suffering, and a chamber for sacrifice.  
&gt;  
&gt;I see a snare for the oblivious who wander in and a feast for the evil that dwells in here waiting for them.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am sorry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Goodbye, Pete. I am proud of you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Zora.  
&gt;  
&gt;....  
&gt;  
&gt;*Do not trust 3-18-25-16*

That was the end of the transmission.

I did not have time to grieve for Professor Zora. My company had already sent more personnel on the way to the island after the original team had failed to return. I quickly copied the message to a drive and blocked out some parts of the transmission before showing it to the rest of the crew at basecamp. As they looked over it, I stole one of the boats and navigated towards the inland. It won’t be long until they figure out that I am missing.

I am currently in a Latin American country, typing this up from a local internet café. I do not who to trust and I do not know if anyone will believe me.

If Professor Zora is right, this was no standard expedition. It was a set-up. I cannot begin to imagine what the hell is in that mountain, but if my company knew about it, it was a death-trap from the beginning; a way to knock the professor out of the picture and to unleash something that should not have been stirred in the first place.

I am afraid it's time to figure what CrypTech [is really up to](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyalStories/rising/)."
dva6ws,9,2019-11-12,Stramning af volds reglen.. Here we go again.,Jinxtah,scandinavia,https://www.reddit.com/r/scandinavia/comments/dva6ws/stramning_af_volds_reglen_here_we_go_again/,"Så er vi her sgu igen...

Vi har bare nogle edgelords i denne sub der ikke kan styre sig, og konstant vil teste grænser. Det er ikke længe siden at vi bannede 3 brugere for brud på volds reglen, og nu er vi her igen igen igen.

Efter intern diskussion i mod gruppen har vi set os nødsaget til at stramme denne regel endnu mere. Det er ret irriterende, og ikke noget vi har lyst til, men der er bare nogle mennesker der konstant vil se hvor langt de kan gå, og smadre subben hvis det er muligt. 

Der er hermed ikke længere tilladt at ønske nogen skade eller død uanset hvor abstrakt det er. Det er fandme irriterende at vi bliver nødt til at stramme skruen endnu mere, men vi ved ikke hvad vi ellers skal gøre, da en alt af en banned bruger bare begyndte at spamme subben til med opfordring til selvmord af uspecifikke personer.

Så siden at dette er sket, og for at reddit's admins ikke skal have en bedre chance for at lukke subben, så er det hermed ulovligt at ønske nogen som helst, om det er specifikt (dette var allerede ulovligt) eller uspecificeret.

Vi synes det er pisse ærgerligt at vi er kommet dertil, fordi vi mener at man skal have lov til f.eks. at udtrykke at en fange på ""death row"" skal dø, eller en terrorist der afventer dom skal have dødsstraf. Men ligesom med tagging reglen, er der bare nogle mennesker der vil gøre alt for at denne sub skal lukkes og slukkes, og bare vil spamme subben til med disse ting, og vi ser ingen anden udvej end at gøre reglen forsimplet, i form af at INTET opfordring til vold er længere tilladt. Vi har af erfaring lært at dette er den eneste måde at gøre det på, for ellers vil nogle personer bare prøve ihærdigt at smadre subben.

Herunder finder du grundlaget der førte til denne regel stramning.

----

For nogle dage siden postede brugeren Hvidmand en kommentar i en [ligegyldig tråd](https://old.reddit.com/r/scandinavia/comments/dtwm5k/my_ten_rules_for_male_dominance_socializing_for/). Man kan se alle kommentarer i ceddit skulle man være nysgerrig på nær 1 kommentar som jeg kommer til at linke til nedenfor.

Kommentaren med tilhørende context var: https://i.imgur.com/WUv9MFv.png.

Denne kommentar var blevet anmeldt. Jeg læste den, og bedømte at den ikke brød reglerne. Der viser sig så at jeg havde overset ordet ""gerne"". Jeg skrev [så den sædvanlige smøre](https://i.imgur.com/vf2WMmq.png), ganske som jeg plejer når ting bliver anmeldt for f.eks. vold eller lign. og vi har bedømt at det ikke bryder reglerne.

Næste gang jeg tjekker reddit, ser jeg at der ligger en kommentar fra brugeren Nostrasmus. 

[Dette er hele context](https://i.imgur.com/WmgEIuW.png) af hvad der kom ud af den. Den opmærksomme bruger bemærker nok at en kommentar er slettet af brugeren selv.

Jeg har dog af erfaring med visse brugere i denne sub lært at man skal tage screenshots til brug af bevis fremadrettet, når disse sletter dem, og beskylder mods for at overtræde deres autoritet. 

Dette er beskeden der lå til mig fra brugeren Nostrasmus: https://i.imgur.com/qU2iYQq.png

Det synes jeg er meget ærgerligt at få smidt i hovedet fra en fast bruger af subben, så uden at træde i mod skoene, spørger jeg om det virkeligt kan passe at han mener jeg skal begå selvmord. Der er jo ikke noget at misforstå, men jeg tænker at jeg alligevel lige vil give ham chancen for at komme med en uforbeholdt undskyldning med tilhørende forklaring. Dagen efter har han så skrevet en tør kommentar om ""Nej, det er ikke rigtig forstået"", og han har slettet sin kommentar. Ikke noget andet. Ikke en PM, ikke en mod mail, ikke noget som helst. Han lader bare som om at han ikke har skrevet det.

Vi har aldrig tilladt i subben at ønske andre brugere eller grupper døde eller lign. Aldrig. Folk er også tidligere blevet banned for lign. ting som ""skyd dig selv"", ""jeg håber nogen vil tage sig kærligt af dig *wink* *wink*, eller ""du vil være den første rotte der hænger fra gadelampen"" eller hvordan ordklangen nu lige lød.

Jeg banner derfor Nostrasmus. Jeg vil sgu ikke finde mig i at en bruger, og så en fast en af slagsen endda, opfordrer mig selv til at begå selvmord. Som en bonus, kan du læse [denne wall of text](https://old.reddit.com/r/scandinavia/comments/dszbmo/hvad_sker_der_for_moderator_jinxtah_for_tiden/f6wrn99/?context=3) mellem jeg og brugeren gulvest, om hvorfor Nostrasmus havde set sig sur på mig.

Brugeren Hvidmand skriver til os i mod mailen som jeg skrev han burde gøre såfremt jeg havde misforstået hvad han skrev, og efter en diskussion i mod chatten mellem Togreiseren og jeg, beslutter vi os for at ændre hans ban til at være en streng advarsel, da det det han skrev var abstrakt, og ikke minded på en bestemt person eller gruppe. Vi gjorde dette på grundlaget af at det heller ikke var ulovligt at f.eks. skrive en terrorist der afventede dom burde få en dødsdom, eller en death row inmate burde blive aflivet.

Du kan læse vores diskussion om det her i mod chatten: [Mod chat log #1](https://i.imgur.com/4NomnNh.png), [Mod chat log #2](https://i.imgur.com/ysePfSV.png), [Mod chat log #3](https://i.imgur.com/iO7GQtT.png).

Nostrasmus skriver så til os i mod mailen at han er uenig, og det er unfair. Jeg uddyber for ham over flere mod mails, og til sidst beskylder han mig for at være nazist fordi jeg har fjernet ham. Det gider jeg så ikke at høre på, så jeg ""muter"" ham, hvilket betyder han ikke kan skrive til os i 72 timer.

I dag dukker der så en ny bruger op i subben, og [klager over Nostrasmus' ban](https://old.reddit.com/r/scandinavia/comments/dv8df7/min_ven_blev_permabanned_for_at_skrive_noget_der/). Det lugter langt væk af at det bare er ham der skriver igen, men jeg forklarer sagen kort. Han bliver dog ved med at køre i samme spor, præcist som Nostrasmus, og jeg gider til sidst ikke mere.

Denne bruger begynder så lystigt at spamme subben til med opfordring til at folk skal begå selvmord. Det kan ses her: [1](https://i.imgur.com/ndml1AU.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/vDYf2rD.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/VCORJMz.png), og runder så af med at skrive direkte i svar til mig at ""[Nogle burde virkeligt tage en overdosis](https://i.imgur.com/4tLsarG.png)]. Der er ingen tvivl om hvad der refereres til her, og denne bruger bliver banned for brud på volds reglen.

Her følger loggen over hvad vi snakkede om mht. denne tråd i dag i mod chatten: [1](https://i.imgur.com/e6M9pfR.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/nl7M8wY.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/MUxFjK5.png).

Right, det var vist det hele. Det kan ske at jeg har glemt noget, eller det ikke hænger sammen. Jeg har ikke lige gennemgået hvad jeg har skrevet, så jeg undskylder lige hvis der er stavefejl, eller mangler. Spørg bare ind til det, i så fald. 

Humlen er at vi desværre ser os nødt til stramme reglen om vold. Vi bryder os virkeligt ikke om det, men da dette er brugernes sub, så vil jeg da også gerne lige høre fra jer. Hvad synes i? Jeg er personligt bange for at hvis vi laver det til en vurdering fra gang til gang, så bliver der for uden en masse ekstra arbejde til os, også rig mulighed for at det bliver smagsdommeri, og det er som bekendt en slippery slope, om du vil. 

Lad høre fra jer, om i mener at vi skal vurdere fra gang til gang, eller om det bare er 100% nul tolerance overfor alt og alle uanset hvad mht. grov vold."

I walked through the door I always sought, I always found. It closed gently behind me.

[I watched again, helplessly, as the twelve-year-old version of myself endured the type of pain that adults fool themselves into thinking they can deny their children.](https://redd.it/dsywar)

I watched my little brother burn.

I saw more of his body this time; the initial shock gave way to an unrelentingly critical doctor’s eye. His charred vertebrae and demolished spinal cord spilled disgustingly onto the ground like discarded butcher’s offal. I realized, vaguely, that Timmy must have landed on his neck, bursting his destroyed innards as his barbecued skin shredded from the impact of the collapsing house. 

It broke more of me than I had thought possible. Deep fissures cleaved my mind in ways that I once would have believed impossible to endure.

But I left the broken pieces of me on the road, and found that I could travel lighter once there was less of *me* to carry. It was, to be honest, brutally efficient. 

In that moment, I understood how the world could change a person into a quintessential shit-bitch.

And, in becoming stronger, I was able to make it through the journey yet again, this time confidently grasping the door on the other side, now more whole because there was less of my spirit.

Smoke hit me first, followed by the warm humidity of an old Missouri summer. 

And of course, there was the scream.

I collapsed on the ground, unable to move any further.

*

I got up, of course, because what else was there to do? I had to choose between moving on and spending the rest of my life completely immobile. I was not going to allow the location of fate’s arbitrary decision to determine the rest of my years, so I stood and I moved.

I endured everything again.

And I discovered just how much of myself could be broken while still moving forward. 

I arrived at the end. I opened the door. 

And I walked into the scream.

*

I once heard that the trees in west Texas are shaped by winds that rip across the open plains. The constant pressure warps them; in time, no matter how great the tree, it is permanently marred by a world that would never relent. The original design of the plant becomes unsalvageable, and the brokenness evolves into an indelible part of the tree’s character. It can never hope to become what it had once intended.

But still, the tree grows.

*

It was easier to travel without the burden of hope, so I discarded its last vestiges upon the seventh opening.

And casually found my way into Dr. Scritt’s office. 

“Close the door behind you,” she ordered. 

I obeyed out of practicality and stood before her.

“Well,” she regarded me over her thin spectacles, “are you going to have a long cry about it, and then talk about what happened? Or will you be skipping the part that has no practical value so that we don’t waste any more of my time?”

I sat in the chair across from here. “I’ve exhausted every tear,” I responded simply.

“Good,” she shot back, “I hope that fact lightened your burden.”

I almost asked her why she was so mean, but silenced myself. People only change if they *want* to change; I had no desire to quarrel with facts that didn’t care if I believed in them.

She eyed me carefully. “You never told all of the story, because you were afraid of what people would say.”

I nodded. My mind was so completely stretched, shocked, *used,* that I had nothing left to offer but stark practicality. “How did you know?”

She looked sad. “Because, Dr. Afelis, that’s everyone’s story.”

I stared at her blankly. 

She sighed. “Each one of us is ashamed about some part of our past. We believe that keeping it a secret allows us to control the thing that is beyond our grasp. This stems from the fact that people are idiots.”

I had no response.

“Letting go of the false belief *means* controlling the past, Ellie, at least to the small extent that we still can. You’re not losing it by dropping the illusion.”

I took a deep breath. “I feel like admitting it-”

“Makes you a shitty person, yes, I know,” she responded with a roll of her eyes. “But *admitting* the truth does not make you a shitty person. It’s what you *did* that makes you shitty.” She flared her nostrils and was silent.

Without neither preamble nor permission, I began my explanation. “Timmy and I had been fighting,” I heaved. “I’d just received a new laptop. Since I was twelve and he was six, I got many of the things that Timmy wanted but couldn’t have. I gloated when he cried, because it made me feel like I had more. My dad was a janitor, and we couldn’t afford most of what I thought I needed. So when I *finally* got the laptop I knew I deserved, I taunted my brother worse than I ever had before.” I drew a deep, shuddering breath. “So he stole it when I wasn’t looking and locked himself into my bedroom. I had never, *ever* been so angry. I actually told him to fuck off, which was the first time I’d ever said those words. His favorite stuffed animal, this ridiculous oversized bear, was left unguarded in his bed. So – I stole it, yelled across the house that I was going to destroy it, and ran downstairs.” 

I buried my face in my hands. “I threw it on the stove and turned on the pilot light, and I was *so happy* when it finally caught fire. Timmy ran into the kitchen just as the flames engulfed his bear. I saw just how deeply I’d hurt him, deeper than he’d ever felt, and I was… overjoyed. The pain I had caused my brother seemed so *good* in that moment, and I don’t know why, but I was sure he deserved it.”

I paused.

Then I continued, because there was nothing else to do. “He… he told me that he was going to throw my laptop out the window – that he would lock himself in my room and smash it to pieces on the ground. Then he turned and ran.” I cleared my throat. “So I grabbed the stuffed bear’s leg, which was dangling off the edge of the stove and not yet burning, and I hurled it at him.” I pursed my lips and nodded solemnly to myself. “Why does any twelve-year-old make a decision, other than because it seemed like a good idea at the time? I didn’t *plan* on having the bear hit the wall and land in the trash can, and I had *no idea* how quickly a garbage fire could spread through a kitchen.” I bit my lip until I tasted blood. “But I was old enough to weigh my options. I knew that I had enough time to get up the stairs, but probably not back down again, because the fire had consumed half the kitchen in under twenty seconds.” I drew several shallow breaths. “I also knew that I could exit through the kitchen’s back door to immediate safety.” More shallow breaths. “I had to make a practical decision in a split second. And I was still *angry* in that split second. Angry at my brother, but also at myself – though I was too young to understand it at the time.” I swallowed. “It would be so much easier to say that it was either all cold practicality, or else all hot vengeance. I reasoned like a child, but was mature enough to understand what my decision meant. The reality is that both concepts pulled my mind across a twisted landscape of opposing ideas, eschewing the decency of being all one thing or all of another.”

I dropped my hands to my sides and stared unwaveringly at Dr. Scritt. “I decided to turn my back and run outside. I remember every part of that choice. It *shattered* my heart and my mind badly enough that I know I’ll never be whole again.” I took one more long breath. “But each day I hurt a little more, because I can’t stop thinking of what I would do if I could go back. And I know that I would probably still make the same choice.”

For the first time that I could remember, she broke eye contact first. “Ellie,” she sighed, “why do you think that St. Francis Hospital would have such an [arbitrary set of rules for its interns](https://redd.it/dj5fgp)?”

I responded without emotion. “The rules come from somewhere beyond us. I understand that now. We’re just here to follow them.”

She looked sad. Then, slowly, Dr. Scritt shook her head. “No, Dr. Afelis. That isn’t true.” She rubbed her eyes. “What was the first rule?”

“Never, under any circumstances, share your copy of the rules with anyone else,” I replied robotically.

She raised an eyebrow. “And how does that make any *sense?*”

I stumbled as I tried to remember her words. “You – it was important to see – not all of us were going to make it-”

“That much *is* true,” she responded dismissively. “We’ve seen more than enough evidence of *that* tonight. But you’re wrong about the rule coming from somewhere else.” She stared pointedly across her desk at me. 

I stared back with incredulity. “I… don’t understand.”

“Then you’re starting to get it,” she shot back. “You weren’t top of your class, Dr. Afelis, not even close, but you’re at *least* smart enough to be a doctor. Can you *attempt* to figure this out?”

I quickly calculated the odds of making an ass of myself in ratio to the probability of answering correctly, and remained silent. 

She shook her head in disappointment. “Did you really never make the connections, *Doctor* Afelis? The trial of jumping off of a roof? Judgment from an authoritative janitor? *Multiple* different rules about burning children?”

My jaw fell.

“The first rule prohibits the sharing of rules, because *no one has the same set.* Each doctor is faced with his or her own list of restrictions, and most aren’t up to the challenge.”

I struggled to find the words. “Every – every rule is just for me?”

Dr. Scritt removed her glasses. “People think that this hospital wants to destroy them, when in reality each person is given every tool needed for survival.” She snorted. “It’s impossible to stop most individuals’ desire to kill themselves.”

I stared at her desk in shock. “But – Rule Four – why did it tell me not to touch your Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups?”

She stared at me like I’d been caught masturbating in a fish tank. “Because it’s my favorite candy.”

I nodded slowly. “Mine, too.”

Dr. Scritt placed the glasses back on her head. “You’re going to ask what this place is,” she continued slowly. “I’ve survived St. Francis far longer than most. That’s why people expect me to tell them.” She paused, choosing each of her next words very carefully. “So before you say that you want me to tell you the truth, you should understand this fact.” Here she bored her eyes into mine, and this time it was me who turned away early. “There are things that I can’t know, and things that I don’t know. Embracing these ideas as a strength instead of a weakness is the reason I’ve endured where others have not.”

We were quiet for some time.

“Can – can you see the individual rules on each doctor’s paper?” I asked suddenly.

She smirked. “No. But I can see what’s written on their faces, which is the same thing.”

“I don’t get it,” I responded honestly.

She sighed in disappointment. “[Do you remember when I reminded you of Rule 9?](https://redd.it/drgofj)”

I thought back to our conversation just after Dr. Dorian had died. “You told me that the morgue needed 13 cadavers at all times,” I replied confidently.

“No,” she shot back. “*You* told *me* that. I acted like I had known the entire time, and you responded to my confidence. Each person’s list of rules is their own battle to fight. To be blunt, I’d rather see the doctors fail themselves through inadequacy than see the patients suffer because someone was unable to live up to their own unearned arrogance.”

I blinked. “I’d like to earn my arrogance,” I said.

Dr. Scritt smiled. “The good news is that I think you might have the endurance to survive the unusually lengthy journey it would take for *you* to achieve earned arrogance.”

The door burst open before I could say anything more. I said nothing as a familiar janitor walked confidently into Dr. Scritt’s office.

For the first time, I heard him speak. 

“Three children have been dead for 119 minutes, 13 people are *not* in the morgue, and Dr. Falhar ignored me when I tried to stop him from stealing Dr. Grault’s list.”

Dr. Scritt stood, and I followed suit.

“Wait, Dr. Scritt – please,” I looked at her in desperation.

She gave me a look that told me I had one quarter of a second to speak.

“Is this real?”

She looked away and walked around her desk. “Death is real. Nothing else is guaranteed. Doctors are tasked with delaying the inevitable and embracing the fact that 100% of our efforts will eventually fail.” I walked briskly after her as she followed the janitor out of her office. “If death is the only real thing, then this life is the place where impossible things can happen. Stop doubting that fact. Now grab the sulfuric acid, we’re going to attempt to prevent your fellow interns from killing each other or [any of the patients](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

dvadw4,5,2019-11-12,"[MODPOST] A tale of two China's, negotiations and the blocking of the Sun.",Christi-Cat,SWWP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWWP/comments/dvadw4/modpost_a_tale_of_two_chinas_negotiations_and_the/,"China had underwent a turbulent decade. The Xinhai revolution of 1912 had bought down the Qing Empire and the dynasties that had ruled China for millennia, and Yuan Shikai was elevated to the Presidency of a new Republic in a deal with the devil. Yuan's Presidency was not the turn that many had hoped for. The President ruled as dictator, only checked by the weak parliament dominated by the Tongmenghui of Sun-Yat Sen and  Song Jiaoren. Song was vehemently opposed to the rule of Yuan, and campaigned against the President before he was assassinated in 1913, an act widely believed to have been organised by President Yuan. Tensions between the President and Tongmenghui came to ahead that same year, over the former's illegal organisation of a ¥100,000,000 Loan from European consortium. Yuan cracked down on his opposition, dismissing TMG governors, and collapsing the party internally. Sun-Yat Sen fled to Japan and called for a 2nd Revolution, which was crushed easily. Yuan, now virtually unopposed, dismissed parliament the following year, and replaced it with a 'council of state' staffed by his allies in the Military. Provinces were given a military governor, with control of their own army, alongside civilian administration, firmly routing the beginnings of the warlord era. The final act of Yuan's great drama was the revival of the Empire in 1915. Feeling unopposed Yuan organised the Representative Assembly to invite him to take the throne, declaring himself the Hongxian emperor in an act of hubris. At the end of the year Yunan's governor Cai E secceded from China, shortly followed by Guizhou province and Guangxi Province, starting the National Protection war. With the popular and international response to Yuans declaration one of derision, the 'Emperor' made vague attempts at returning to Republicanism on the 26th of March. The National Protection War would continue, and remained unresolved when Yuan died in January 1916. 

The succession for Yuan was not straightforward. An immediate power struggle broke out between his subordinates. Li Yuanhong was pressed into the Presidency by the Beiyang Clique, as the only acceptable candidate for the Southern Provinces, while Duan Qirai, Premier under Yuan, retained his position. Conflict over entry into the Great War (with Duan favoring entering against Germany, and Li opposing any involvement). Li dismissed Duan in 1917, who intern withdrew his forces from Beijing. In the chaos that followed, General Zhang Xun attempted a restoration of the Qing dynasty. Further problems ensued, as in response, Sun-Yat Sen and the TMG members of the Chinese Parliament (restored august 1916) fled South to join the rebellious southern Provinces, organizing into the Constitutional Protection Junta in Guangzhou, intending to preserve the constitution of the Republic of China, and ensuring warfare between the Northern and Southern Governments once again. Duan Qirai meanwhile returned to Beijing and crushed the restoration, driving President Li out and replacing him with Vice President Feng Guozhang. Duan Qirai was again made Premier, and elected a new Parliament, with election rigging and tampering to ensure a majority of his Anfu Club, the political wing of his now dominant Anhui Clique. Governors and Generals opposed to Duan's growing Dominance in Beijing politics gathered around the figure of President Feng, forming the so called Zhili clique. Feng however resigned in October 1918, due to illness, finally completing the 5 year term of President Yuan. Xu Shichang was elected President in his place, generally viewed as neutral in the growing conflict between the Zhili and Anhui factions, primarily from Duans desire to negotiate with the rebellious southern provinces, compared to the Zhili's push for a military campaign. With their leaders retirement, General Cao Kun took leadership of the Zhili politically, while his protege Wu Peifu took command of military affairs. In Manchuria, meanwhile, the former peasant and minor warlord Zhang Zhuolin was finishing his conquest and unification of Manchuria under his Fengtian Clique. 

Southern politics were no more stable than the North. After the formation of the Constitutional Protection Junta with Sun as its Generalissimo, the Guangxi warlords began to move against the TMG and Sun. Subduing the rump parliament and pushing reform of the Junta into a 17 man body, consistent of mostly Guangxi Generals. Sun, recognizing he was being marginalized and had no military power to counter Guangxi, attempted to transfer troops into the hands of a loyal general. In response the Guangxi drove the remnants of TMG and Guangdong warlords loyal to Sun out of the Province. The revolutionary himself resigned his role as Generalissimo, fleeing to Shanghai to reorganize. Cen Chunxuan replaced him as the nominal head of the Junta. The Junta entered negotiations with the Beijing Government over the reunification of the country, but the refusal of Duan to dissolve his Anfu Parliament has proven a sticking point. As of the Armistice in Europe these negotiations are still under way."
dvae7h,0,2019-11-12,Pet Peeve Tuesday Episode 2,[deleted],adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/dvae7h/pet_peeve_tuesday_episode_2/,"This week I explore some pet peeves from my life. These are my opinions and are open for discussion.

1. Clingy - Okay, this needs some qualifying. Asking to cuddle after sex or contacting me the next day is NOT being clingy, for me. It is when they want to do everything with me all the time always and forever. Men are like women, we work very hard on our main career, investments, family, etc. I am NOT canceling appointments with investors or contractors to sit down and have a long lunch with you talking about your aunt. This doesn't mean we can't chat and have a meal, just not everyday, come on! Not everyday, not every other day. Have SOMETHING else to do in life other than stalk me. Ever happen to you?
2. The Jealous AP - You are my side piece. I am your side piece. If I want to fuck the brains out of my SO I am going to do it. I might think about you I might think about that 22 year old intern that blew me last year. Get over it. On a side note, my limit is two partners, SO and AP. This is mostly because I don't have time to juggle a third, I'm not desperate and it is responsible to my partners. When I take an AP we always have an agreement that either of us can fuck anyone else as long as we communicate that to the other. This is to prevent the spread of disease and it is just responsible behavior. Responsible single people do this, so should we. Don't get jealous over it. 
3. You are NOT irresistible. This one really bothers me. I know men that think they are God's gift to women. \*\*facepalm\*\* Some women adore them, others don't care and some really hate them. Since I have no sexual interest in them let's talk about women with similar egos. A few women think they can have any man they want. Some are very attractive and can get a lot of men, but this is very different than ANY man. I have had very attractive women show interest in me and a handful don't make the cut. Some stink or have other really poor hygiene. This is a deal breaker for me. Some are just jerks, to put it nicely. Sometimes I just don't like the way they look. I've gone on dates (one specifically) with women that other men said are hot but I think they look plain to ugly. It works the other way around. I met with a lady I thought was drop dead gorgeous. She was 5'2"" and a runner. So she had really small firm breasts and amazing eyes. She told me how a man she was interested in rejected her recently saying he wasn't attracted to her. Well, she was exactly my type. If you want to sleep with a lot of men that's fine by me, but don't tell me you are irresistible. 
4. People don't know what they want. I'll start with myself. I normally pursue petite or short women. One of my favorites are the stocky, short moms. They can be AMAZING in bed! When I was right out of college I met a girl that was my height, 5'11"". She was funny and had amazing skin. She was so skinny it looked like she would break in half if she tripped. Needless to say I was really surprised how amazing she was in bed. Mind blowing sex. This is a story I hear all the time. She really wanted a rich man - he was no good in bed. She really wanted to be a cougar, but after a year she decided sex was better with men closer to her age. It seems like some people go looking for one specific thing only to realize that is NOT what they are looking for. Ever been surprised?"
dvammr,2,2019-11-12,My Girlfriend is depressed and I find it hard to help.,Scrubsisagoodshow,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dvammr/my_girlfriend_is_depressed_and_i_find_it_hard_to/,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi there, I get that this kind of thing is probably posted all the time but any interaction I've ever had on this sub has been so supportive and helpful so I would really appreciate advice, anecdotes words of support anything.

Okay so for some context in 19 and in college, I have very mild ADHD to the point where it doesn't need to be medicated (I had hippy parents who didn't want to impact my creativity, like I'm barely vaccinated) but tbh I see it as a positive lime I'm really able to adapt to new situations, it's very annoying to have an argument with me because usually by the end I've realized how the other person might have perceived something I said and often it becomes both of us arguing against me. I think I do this because I don't see arguments as something to be won or lost.

Me and my gf have been going out for over a year and she is also in college. She has suffered from depression and anxiety loads in the past but I never knew her then. It's really hard to see somebody when they are in depression as I've only known them during the beginning or (honeymoon period) of a relationship. Because to me I don't know her as being unhappy whereas to her she's known herself sad for longer than she's known me and been happy. I hate using terms like happy and sad because I know it's much much more than that.

This year in college has been very hard for her and the stress is overwhelming. Having never have encountered true mental health issues in our relationship before I found dealing with this hard. She self harmed one night while I was at work and it broke me. My trans brother has gone through so much and self harmed in the past and my gf was so good with giving me advice on how to speak to him about it and I found I used the same advice back to her. I knew not to give out to her, to offer her support. It just broke my heart to see how many cuts she had. Immediately my brained switched to how I can help and what we can do. It was so hard because every time we were together issues seem so small but then being apart it can easily get so overwhelming.

She was so apathetic to the situation. She didn't seem to care that she had caused herself harm, she said she regretted it only for how it made me feel which broke my heart because she should care about herself she's incredible. I think she was doing this as a coping mechanism. My mental health got worse too and I found the smallest piece of adversity in my life gave me massive amounts of dread and would send me to tears. I had never dealt with a panic attack before but when I was told I might not get an internship I thought i had I broke down in public. This made me realize I needed to practice all the things I was telling my gr to do like go to counselling and try mindfulness.

I don't know how many of you with ADHD have tried mindfulness but it's hard. So hard. but simply just focusing on my breathing and how it goes into my nose and out through my mouth settled my overwhelming feelings of dread and emotion so much. I do it every night and morning and whenever I feel overwhelmed now and it helps me so much. This is where I need the advice. I have tried so many times to get her to practice mindfulness or go to counselling but she would always say she doesn't have time or doesn't want the embarrassment of going to counselling again. I almost understood this but I really tried to hit home how mindfulness isn't a long time commitment and can be done as often or as little as you'd like. I think she doesn't bevel she deserves help. She tried to take CBD to calm her anxiety but unfortunately it coincided with her getting a sever mouth ulcer so wasn't able to do it enough and hasn't started again.

Recently she told me she just wants to feel normal. She's sick of talking about it all the time with me and said she feels like my patient. And I understand, it's hard to feel ok when Im reminding her to do these things all the time and it almost takes the power of them away. I remember when my mother tried to make me do mindfulness as a teenager and I thought it was the most stupid thing ever. But I really need her to try. She has promised to go to the councilor in her college but hasn't. And I don't want to keep mentioning it to her. Her brother who I have a very good relationship with is also actively trying to make her go but she still hasn't. Nor even tried mindfulness. And it sucks because I love her so much and I want her to try these things even if it's just for me but she hasn't and I don't know how to make her.

Im sorry for how wordy this was, If you took the time to read all of it I'm so thankful. You're all wonderful people &lt;3"
dvbsgw,3,2019-11-12,I am new to accounting and looking for advice on how to further my career.,mottlcitizen90,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/dvbsgw/i_am_new_to_accounting_and_looking_for_advice_on/,"Hi! I am looking for some advice on what I should do to help further my career in accounting. My bosses have approached me with a plan for me to take over for our controller in (5) years and I am excited, but also terrified as this is a fairly new career path for me. TLDR; I want to train and educate myself the best I can while working within the limitations of having a full time job and two little kids. 

Backstory...I'm 29 years old, married, and I have (2) kids ages 4 and 1. I fell haphazardly into accounting about 5 years ago. When I found out I was pregnant with my first child (oops) and I needed a job that had set hours and benefits. Prior to working in accounting, the only job experience I had was in bars and restaurants. I was working in a cafe on weekends during the day, bar-tending at night, and going to school for hospitality management in between. I have (3) credits (which is an internship, hence why I haven't finished) to complete my associates in hospitality. Now that I have children I have no desire to go back to hospitality. The schedule just isn't conducive to family life. And I like accounting. 

So I've been working for a family owned service-based contractor for (5) years now. We currently have around 50 employees, give or take a few (40 or so in the field, 5 project managers, and 2 of us in the office). I was hired in to file papers and answer the phones, but the busier we've gotten the more the controller has passed off to me.  Just in the short time I've worked here, revenues have grown from about $2mil per year to $8mil per year and we are slammed in the office most of the time. The workload is pretty intense and I sort of have to be a ""jack of all trades"" since it's just two of us in the office.  I am SO grateful that the owners and the controller have given me a chance. My current accounting duties are pretty standard, but I am learning to do a little more each month. I run payroll and do payroll accruals, enter and cut checks for payables, generate receivables and AIA billings, etc. I pay the payroll taxes as well as our sales and use tax. I keep track of and make contributions to the company's 401K plan. I record deposits and generate monthly statements to customers. For month end it is my job to reconcile petty cash, the bank statement, and the credit card statement. I calculate and pay everyone's union dues and make the appropriate journal entries. I am in the process of learning how to do monthly work-in-progress reports as well as generating the balance sheet and income statement. I am also learning about how our company makes journal entries for inventory and trying to come up with a better way of tracking it (we use a perpetual inventory system but it's a HOT MESS).  That pretty much sums up everything I do on the accounting end as of right now. 

So a few months ago it was announced that there would be some changes within the company. The current owner is retiring, and the current controller has announced she wants to drop down to part time in 3 years and retire in 5. The new owner wants me to transition to the controller position over the next 5 years. I am absolutely ecstatic that they would even consider me for this position, but equally as terrified as I don't even have an associates degree. The controller I work with is awesome and I have learned so much from her - but she's like a full blown adult with an accounting degree and 30 years of experience. 

So now I am scrambling trying to figure out what I can do (besides come to work and bust my butt) to prepare myself for this transition. My boss said he would pay for any schooling I need and I am currently taking Accounting 201. I plan on taking Accounting 202 next semester. My goal is to get my associates degree in accounting, which I am embarrassed to say, at this rate will take me every bit of 4-5 years. I wish I could take more classes, but between working 45 hours a week and having 2 small children, I really don't think I can do more than 1-2 classes per semester. I know I need to be focused and selective about what extra training I choose to pursue. So here are my questions to all of you experienced accountants:

1. Based off the info I have given you about the company I work for, which core accounting classes do you think would benefit me the most? I am currently taking Principles of Accouting (201). The other accounting classes I need to check off my list to get my associates are Principles of Accounting 2 (202), Accounting Applications on Computers (212), Cost Accounting 1 (213), Intermediate Accounting 1&amp;2 (218,219), and Income Tax Accounting (224). Out of those classes, in which order of importance would you recommend I take them?
2. What training OUTSIDE of school have you benefit from the most? Are there any online classes you would recommend? Any youtube channels that are worth watching?
3. I am currently taking classes through New Horizons to become more proficient in Excel. For some reason I REALLY struggle with Excel which is frustrating since it seems a lot of the accounting world uses it. How important is having knowledge of Excel and how do you all master your skills?
4. If things don't work out at this company, will it be impossible for me to find another job without a degree? How much weight does a degree have in comparison to experience? Will anyone take me seriously without some sort of degree? 
5. What is your best piece of advice or encouragement for someone young in their accounting career?

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it this far, thanks so much for reading and I am excited to hear all of your experiences!"
dvbtht,45,2019-11-12,First Hand Account of Dan Crenshaw Event at ASU - National Justice,SwedenYes69,DebateAltRight,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAltRight/comments/dvbtht/first_hand_account_of_dan_crenshaw_event_at_asu/,"Link to entire article:  [https://national-justice.com/current-events/first-hand-account-dan-crenshaw-event-asu-n2042](https://national-justice.com/current-events/first-hand-account-dan-crenshaw-event-asu-n2042)

&gt;The Arizona State University Crenshaw event was not in a lecture hall. We gathered on a palm tree-lined lawn, surrounded by brick and steel buildings of the mega-colossal scale which characterizes ASU's architecture. The Arizona sun, shining at 80 degrees in early November, would have felt like summer vacation to any out of state visitor.  
&gt;  
&gt;TPUSA had set up a table, chair, backdrop, and amplification equipment for Congressman Crenshaw's 'prove me wrong' event. There was a microphone held by a TPUSA intern in front of the Congressman's table. The Congressman relied on the steps leading up from the front lawn of the dorm megaplex to give him a four feet height advantage over the crowd.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;TPUSA set up their event to rely on the general politeness and passivity of Conservatives, and today that began to die. No physical barrier separated the Congressman from the American people. The Conservative students I was with got their first taste of Leftist tactics and a fundamentally Leftist win.   
&gt;  
&gt;15 minutes before the scheduled 12:00 p.m. start, the TPUSA interns asked us to form a line for the microphone. Everyone was in good spirits, as this appeared to mean Crenshaw would skip the typical ""muh Socialism"" speech and jump straight to the Q &amp; A. By a glance at the physiques, bearing, and dress of the men in line, it was clear that the ""dissident right"" made up the majority of the line.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The first tactic TPUSA used to try and throw the Q &amp; A was to pull all the students to the front of the line. Those of us who could show a student ID got the first 15 slots in line. Plenty of Nationalists had to either find another place in the 60-odd person line, or moved to the right side where our crowd was quickly condensing.  
&gt;  
&gt;We had been waiting in the sun for 20 minutes when the Zio-Clops emerged from his cave to harangue us for a long 10 minutes on the dangers of the minimum wage and occupational licensing. Nothing really stood out from his pre-packaged verbal vomit except at one point he mentioned that America was ""America is built on the greatest ideas humankind has ever had. Moral truth from Jerusalem. Rule of law, jurisprudence from Rome. Personal property rights from London."" I figured it was a direct rip by his speech writer from Eric Striker's line that the West is ""Greek Philosophy, Roman Statecraft, and Germanic Engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I was further astonished by the complete lack of Leftists at the event. I know that ASU has a Students for a Democratic Society presence, but to my knowledge not a single Rad-lib even bothered showing up. It is worth noting however that ASU is one of the most de-politicized Universities in the nation. On a campus of 50,000, the Young Democrat meetings seldom break 50 attendees and the Young Republican meetings seldom break 15. The 2016 election split the Young Republicans into two clubs. The ""official club"" is a front from Christians United for Israel and regularly brings in purported Holocaust survivors to campus to shill for war in Iran. There was also a larger MAGA club for the breakaway members, but they suffered when their group chat with no-no words was leaked to the campus newspaper.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first question of the day went to an undergrad meme-lord in a cowboy hat. He asked Cringeshaw about the USS Liberty incident. What was redeeming about this oft-repeated question was how the questioner made it personal. He pointed out that the victims were Crenshaw's Navy brothers murdered by Crenshaw's favorite state of Israel.  
&gt;  
&gt;This of course set off the Zio-Clops, and like Polyphemus before him, he resorted to hurling dumb rhetorical rocks at the crowd. The audience included two dozen or so older adults and they were in for a real treat. The Congressman from B'nai B’rith saw fit to educate the attendees that we were all ""Grawpers "" (anti-semites obsessed with Israel who deny the Holocaust).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To demonstrate this, he asked that first student in line, ""How many Jews do you believe died in the Holocaust?"" Someone in the back yelled ""six trillion!"" while a less generous amateur historian yelled ""six billion!"" I consider it a victory in itself that we pissed off such a self-important, bloodthirsty piece of shit like Dan Crenshaw. But the fun was just beginning.   
&gt;  
&gt;Crenshaw's TPUSA goons quickly put into action their pre-rehearsed plan. The squat Latina running the mic split us into two racially profiled lines. To the left she placed any man with a modicum of testosterone, and to the right she put all non-Whites and a collection of White men who appeared to have never touched a bench press, much less a pussy.   
&gt;  
&gt;Plan B initially called for the TPUSA staffers to alternate questions between the Chad line and the Plant line. The Chad line got two more questions in before the TPUSA interns stopped taking our questions entirely. Hilariously, TPUSA had some pretty expensive video equipment and at least two camera men, but they decided not to stream the event. One manned a fixed camera pointed at Cuckshaw, the other carried around a mobile camera and focused it in on the audience to film our reactions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I got the same energy from that cameraman as I would from an Antifa holding a camera 5 inches from my face. My gut instinct was confirmed when Crenshaw stated, ""now it's time for a Come to Jesus moment."" ""You don't have the luxury of the time I grew up in, where nothing is online, where we weren't tweeting, and we weren't on Facebook, and things like this weren't being filmed. You guys live in that reality, and you're young and your upset and emotional. Years from now you’re going to regret this, you're going to regret being on camera and saying some of the things you're saying""  
&gt;  
&gt; I'd never been threatened with doxxing by a United States Congressman. But when that cuckold was being shouted down by 50 other young men, the threat lost its sting. Doxxing threats sound a lot scarier when you're already hiding in the basement. It is no surprise that when the kid who asked Charlie Kirk about Israeli Dance parties, drunk on victory, used his newfound fame to ask his Groyper friends to do things besides hide behind their avatars, he was denounced as a Fed by the online irony crowd. Whatever. IRL Activism is like sex versus pornography. Yeah you can get your rocks off online, but nothing beats the real thing.

So I'm going to make this post as kind of a field report/question.

I'm a 21 year old Chinese American guy. I wear glasses since my vision is bad. I'm around 5'9.5"" or so around 13% body fat 137 lbs so I guess I'm one of the more skinny guys in the class.

For those interested to see what I look like,  here are some pictures .  [https://imgur.com/gallery/w7OjTOG](https://imgur.com/gallery/w7OjTOG)

And no, I'm not looking to be rated, fyi

I met this girl in my statistics class. Let's call her Ashley. Ashley was very cute, around an HB8, nice eyes really cute dimples and stuff. Blond hair really short around 5'1"" maybe even smaller. I decided to sit next to her in class one day. The first time I sat next to her she told me about herself that she was an industrial engineering major, with a minor in computer science. I myself am a computer engineering major with an internship with one of the big 4 software companies this summer (not gonna tell which one since I don't want to ruin my chances by posting on this subreddit).

The second time I was in class I asked her what was the farthest place she went. She told me Costa Rica and excitedly talked about the monkeys in the region.

Now comes today. It is freezing cold outside, and she told me that class was cancelled for today. I'm like okay, she seemed to be positive today. Did something good happen today? She said idk, I just feel good even though I have an exam later today but my class is cancelled and that  I proceeded to talk to her about stuff like my upcoming big 4 internship and how I was going to Seattle, and what classes she was taking that type of good stuff. I made sure my body language was good (although maybe I don't know exactly what it was like since I have mild Aspergers) my vocal tonality was on point I made sure that my voice didn't go too high, smiled the entire time I was talking . At the end of the interaction I asked her for lunch. She said hmmmm... maybe. I'll let you know with a smile. Ended the interaction right there.

I know that if she was interested she would have said sure and maybe be able to set up a time. But I feel like Ashley was just being nice when I asked her out to eat somewhere.  I won't bring up the topic again to her until like 2 weeks later or so. I've never had a girlfriend or even sex before, so I want to be able to experience this before I graduate from college (I'm a second semester junior).

&amp;#x200B;

What are your opinions, and how can I improve my chances next time I ask a cute girl out?

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Got rejected she is very reluctant to even talk to me again. \*\*depression sinks back in\*\*"
dvc3ga,6,2019-11-12,"My stuggle as a Student (depression, bipolar, narcissism..)",gringo271,narcissisticparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/dvc3ga/my_stuggle_as_a_student_depression_bipolar/,"So i dont know where to start because there are so many things i am dealing with and i just wanted to write them out and maybe someone can relate or give some advice.

So i am a 23 year old student at university and i am struggling with life, uni wise and also in general.

  
so a little background about my life so far:  
When i was very small and my mother was pregnant with my brother she was diagnosed with cancer and lost my brother and even though she was cured last minute since then she couldnt have children anymore so i was the only child. She told me it was a very scary time for her because she was afraid to leave her small child (me) alone but of course i cant remember anything because i was so young but i developed to a very anxious child, i was often afraid of many quite normal things, like signs in the forest, swimming, skiing and many more things.

  
At the time my family lived in a big house which was in a very remote place so we didnt have any neighbors and i also didnt have cousins so i was the only child in the family and became used to playing alone and also was quite happy with it but there was anxiety revolving around everything that involved the ""outside"" world, at least thats how i remember it.

I had a very close bond with my Mother and she always used to comfort me when i was scared and she was reference person with pretty much everything.  
Still at that time i developed some signs of what i later found out was OCD, i was scared that my parents were getting hurt and stuff like that and i always thought i had to pray in order for those things not to happen.  
When i was 10 my parents split up and i think that was the time where feelings started which i thing would now be considered the starting symptoms of depression.   
My Father is a very successful Businessman but i got to see him every other weekend and i always felt very sad when i was with him, i can still remember how i was driving in the car and asked him stuff and he was so absent that he didnt reply and i felt like shit, its very hard to describe but i was always unhappy at that time and didnt know what was going on, now, 13 years later i could slowly begin to make sense of his character and behaviour.

  
My mother on the other hand was always what would now be considered a ""helicopter-parent"", i was with her pretty much all of the time, i even had one year between kindergarten and school where i was just at home with her and i was sheltered and didnt have any disappointments, later i was always the on top of the class, had only As and lived in that ""bubble"" and the feeling of beeing something special somehow evolved, i think partly because i was good in school but also somehow because my parents, especially my mother gave my that feeling which I now hate so much.  


When i entered middle school the first feelings of frustration came creeping in because i realised i wasnt the best in everything anymore, other kids where better at sports and i developed a feeling of ""why does nobody realise how special i am"", even thought now i am ashamed to admit that but that feeling never left me.

I was very frustrated and somehow depressed for the whole time i was in middle/highschool and depression always got better and then worse again, but never to a degree that i wanted to commit suicide or something, i just always felt like shit for month and when i came home from school i was either sleeping away the whole afternoon or watching series or other stuff on the computer.   
That was when this what i now see as addiction started. I often couldnt understand in later times why i didnt do more stuff but since i know those feelings so well now for years i can say it was because i just felt so down.  


It was as if i was numbed most of the time and just holding it together so school, even though i had friends and wasnt unpopular became hell somehow, i was afraid of meeting people in the hallway and slights and stuff influences me negatively, often for weeks/months. I was living with my mom and as i got older i came to somehow despise her a little bit because there where no rules and i began to want a strict person to look up to, it was kind of desperate for both of us and i thing she was/is also depressed, so the years went by and i spent most of it behind my laptop screen, but it wasnt all bad, i played sports and stuff but always quit everything after a year at most.  
I got my first girlfriend when i was 15 and thats when i recognised how i treated her and i think thats when i first got some clues, even not under that name about narcissism because i somehow began to treat her in ways in which my father treated me.  


So fast forward, when i finished Highschool with quite good grades there came the first big mental breakdown because OCD had come back and got so bad that my mother sent me to mental hospital where i stayed for two weeks.  
Before that i already had spoken to a therapist when i was 15 but my father didnt want that happening and ended it.  
After the hospital i began to somehow recover and worked some jobs until university started and felt very good for some months but then the next deep depression came right at the time i started at university and my mother sent my to a mental hospital again and in the end, i broke away from uni after 3 semesters.   
That was when i became clearly hypomanic for the first time, not sleeping much, partying all the time and having an internship all at the same time.   


I started another course of studies and did well the first semester and then i moved in with my father and thats when it went completely downhill. As it got more stressful i began to isolate completely and after the semester I started to google all the things going on with my dad and thats when i found out about narcissism and many things where exactly how he was behaving and i also started to see some of my behaviour in it and when i found out  there is little you can do about it i became so depressed that i completely lost the will to live so i fled to my mothers apartment and at that time she went to a clinic herself because as she told me she became depressed herself, always having to see my struggles and depressions.   
I slept all the time, didnt leave my room and barely ate and when my mother came back she sent me to a mental ward and it was the most terrible time of my life and i really thought about killing myself, already googled the methods but finally came to the conclusion that i cant and wont do it.

I stayed there for 2 months and after that moved in with my grandparents which are very loving and just let me live with them and even though i was still depressed and barely left the house, sleeping until 5pm the whole winter they just left me stay with them and then i found a shared appartment with 2 other guys in the city and moved in with them and rejoined my course of study.  


The other guy living with me was heavy into smoking pot and thats when i also started to smoke regularly, at the end daily.   


I have a girlfriend, and she is an angel. We had our first relationship when we where still in school, after school i ended it and we started seeing each other when i had a better, slightly hypomanic period and she also visited me when i was in the mental hospital. She is very loving and also her Family took me in and i always really feel accepted when i am with her or/and her family, even though i often think i am such a emotional wreck and basically often making her live harder then if i wasnt there.   
We also have very good times and fun and love and she is pretty much the only aspect of ma life thats keeping me going.  


I have quit contact with my Father one year ago when i first moved in with my grandparents. I will try to describe him as good as possible but its very hard because most of the feelings i get from him are not from what he says or does but from the small little, often non verbal vibes i got from him.  
As i said, he is a very successfull businessman and owns his own company and he basically is like kafka described bis father. He is always right with everything and i also never heard him apologise for anything.

I always had the feeling that he, even though he would never admit that openly, i dont think even in front of himself, he dissapproves of basically everything that i did or do and my person in general  
I think he also disapproves of my mother and basically made me feel guilty and ashamed to be her son, like some bastard or something like that.

When i was living with him i also got the feeling that he didnt want me to meet with friends and that i basically center my live around him.   


I still receive money from him in order to pay for education which is regulated by law in my country but i feel super guilty for taking the money and not wanting contact with him, but that feeling was always there, that as the core he disapproves of who i am and what i do and that i am not worthy of him and basically a disappointment which will be disinherited, even though i am his only child.  
He could never handle any critique and was always just offended and like kafka described it in his ""letter to his Father"" i feel i also lost faith in my own abilities and basically i think i am a fraud, at first people think i am competent but in the end everyone will recognise that i will never amount to anything and i think those thoughts make it so much harder for me to feel like or be successful.  


I always have the feeling that, no matter what i will do it will never be even only slightly enough because measured against my fathers success it will always be disappointing. 

That was also how i imagined how life would be as a kid: i saw my father and somehow thought i will also be successfull as he is but now im here and depressed most of the time and on the edge of not making it trough my second attempt at uni.

After taking MDMA this summer i spiraled in what became the most intense manic period and started out quite pleasent because i felt that for the first time i got rid of all the emotional pain which was botteled up since i was 10 but then it spiraled out of control and i got so aggressive at my father that i was afraid that if he would come to me and not respect my boundaries, that i didnt want to talk to him, that basically i would beat him down.

I had aggressive outbursts which lasted for around 30 minutes where i started to sweat and my temperature got hot and i hit against a concrete pole until my hands were bleeding and got aggressive at anybody whom i felt was disrespecting me.

  
It all culminated in me taking cocaine in my flat and feeling that i could control the wind and then again, my mother called the police and i got send to an involuntary stay in a mental hospital for 6 weeks.   


When i came out of the hospital i was still heightened in sense of my mood and it took 3 more weeks until i realized what i had done, spent money, made grandiose plans and scared or put off friends and family and then the shame and self loathing started to settle in.

 in that time i also hat the feeling that there was some kind of divine power in my life which gave me a direction and sort of ""intuition"" and i had heightend senses, felt i was able to pretty much fight anybody if it would have been the case (i didnt put up a fight luckily even though i had some situations which were pretty close) and in general had lots of energy for everything and felt able to do anything, but as it always is, when i came down i realised all the absurd plans and all shit i had done.

I then got prescribed quetiapine in a very high dose and now also lithium.  


I am again back living with my grandparents (at 23)  feeling depressed and ashamed and like the whole world is grey and that my future will be worse and i will amount to nothing basically.   


Thanks for reading this far, i just wanted to ask if anybody can relate somehow or got any tips on how i could improve my situation and not feel in pain all the time."

The scenario for this roleplay is:
I am an new aspiring intern at a records company, trying my hardest to climb the ladder to the top.
The top talent agent offers me to be a personal assistant for a big female celebrity pop star! ( of your choice), during their world tour. 

I jump at the opportunity and say yes signing a contract without reading it. What I didn’t know was signing this contract employee contract actually sold my soul to the pop star for the entire time they are on tour!

The rest of this role play will consist of me travelling on long journeys on the tour bus with you. Where’re I am your toy to keep you amused.  Maybe you’ll decide to show me off to all your fans on stage who knows? I will be completely at your disposal.

I think a celebrity like cardi B or niki minaj could fit the profile well but any suggestions or questions please ask.
I’m also in to quite a few kinks so it would be easier to discuss on kik

I am very new to role play this in depth but I’m eager to try my hardest. 

My kik is Califo3 I’d hope to hear from you"

It's breaking me and making me worried idk what to do, need advice and insights.",alywalid,LDR,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/dvd2mh/my_ldr_bf_19_got_interestedattracted_by_other/,"My bf (19) and I (20) having tough times these last few months. He's being more stressed and depressed about his studies and family mostly, because his family is having different decisions and perspective and so opposite of him. We are in ldr btw,  and sometimes when talking and unexpectedly he would be stressed and it would be pointed out to me, he never did like that at our first year, and it was first times also that he was blaming me about his stress. Last weekend, he had a school trip at same time like an internship. Never we expected that at those 2 nights of trip, there would be parties. It's not his nature being in a party and interacting mostly with other girls because we're trying to avoid being attracted honestly. Well before the trip happened, and something happened between us, we had a fight. Because of that we couldn't talk well for 4 days, it was our longest time not talking as well. So before his trip we weren't completely fine and mostly him because he was hurt he told and me too ofc. When he came back from trip and finally he was talking again to me. He sent me audios and I noticed his voice didn't sound fine. He told me directly that I feel so weird, at first I thought maybe because of more than a week not talking to each other that's why he felt like that, I felt same too. But then he kept saying that and added that he feels so confused as well. I felt so nervous and I felt like something happened from the trip. 

Me and my partner since day 1, we talked about a lot of things and agreed on many things too like about having friendships with opposite gender or being too close with others. We both have same different thoughts like that, though others I know would say it's fine having other friends from opposite gender. So since we knew each other well about those things, what he told me recently about the trip was too unexpected for me and him too. He told me honestly that he felt attracted by other women in the school trip, some even trying to invite him alone in their bedrooms but he never accepted any. He told me that he was so controlling himself not to, and it felt so bad for him same time like a hell and big temptations, because of girls and alcohols. But then he told me that he had fun meeting new people and he had great time with them. It just made me confused how he could say that he felt enjoyed but then he felt bad. About being attracted by others, he mentioned that some girls were even inviting him to drink but he doesn't, and he accidentally drink alcohol because it had same color. That added to his bad feelings. And also that those girls were wearing like those kind of attractive clothes. He kept saying I felt confused and so weird, and that it felt like he was out of his comfort zone. Since he never do like that, drinking alcohol, being with girls around trying to flirt or seduce him, and doing parties. 

When I heard this directly from him and it just broke me inside, because I was thinking he's that kind of too loyal person that never hangs out with girls nor see them. I am too towards to him so loyal to that point I don't have any male friends, because I want to avoid attractions as well and problems. We talked before that we can't ever avoid interacting with other people, mostly opposite genders, when we'll be in school or work, because it's everywhere and we know it. We were thinking maybe it's just because we didn't talk well these days then he suddenly had a trip. And maybe he was even trying to not think about me in those times he was having times with those new people he met. And also because of his stress and anger problems these last few months,  the distance, about our future that he was stressing how we can make it happen. He's still studying, but he'll be done next year, while me going to start a work soon. He's being so hopeless that we can make it because of his stress. It affects his physical and mostly his mental health. I've been trying to help him by giving positive reminders, like how we used to do I try always making little sweet surprises for him, trying share things with him even we're apart. He's still feeling the same until now, plus something happened to him in the trip saying he is feeling confused now. What should I do, any advices how should I do with our relationship? He told he wants to be with me because it'll be better. Anyway we met twice already irl. And we spent around 5 months, had a lot of beautiful and crazy memories together for first times. He's actually my first in everything. So it just hurt me so much what's happening to him now. I don't want to lose him because I still feel these feelings for him that saying it's just his mind maybe and his heart is still the same. 

Tldr: I feel so heartbroken my ldr bf was uncontrollably and unexpectedly got attracted by other girls apart me. He's a loyal person to me to the point he never talks or have female friends. He told me everything so honestly and I'm so thankful for that but still breaking me. 
How should I do and deal about these feelings or situations? Does it happen to some of you too? Anyways, he's planning to go to psychologist. 

Thank you for taking time to read sorry if it's long. I tried to explain all I hope you guys understand!

Rough, dark, corruption, and so much more.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dvdbol/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood afternoon DPP. As the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"

We have a pretty good relationship but our personality often collides with each other.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm going to try and keep this short and sweet, I have a gaming pc that I use daily and what is basically my multimedia entertainment device, because of that I have a lot of sensitive things on my pc. My discord account where I have private messages and my mail etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am having an internship wich causes me to be gone from home from 6 am till 6 pm while my brother is going through his education, as a result of bad planning of the school he has an open schedule and doesn't have school 2days out of 5. He has a shitty laptop that is slow af, and he asked me if he could use my pc since I was at work anyway. I agreed and said he could use it.

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward 2 weeks and when I come home my brother is often playing video game's (my videogames) on my pc and said he just ''wanted to relax from all the work''. I notice that my pc is also becoming his pc because he uses it more than me lately. I got cranky and said he needed to get off my pc and that I did not like that he was constantly using my pc. he shrugged it off and said ''I need to get my work done'' but when I see him he is only playing games.

&amp;#x200B;

I got pretty mad and said he couldn't use my pc anymore and that he should buy his own and that I found it annoying that he has so easy access to all my personal stuff and conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

AITA for not letting my brother use my pc?

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: I got mad at my brother for constantly using my personal pc, and said I found it uneasy if he has easy access to that all. So I banned him from using it."

Top 10 biggest lies Ever Told In History

5: **The Trojan Horse**

If all is fair in love and ­war, this might be the most forgivable of the big lies. When the Trojan Paris absconded with Helen, wife of the Spartan king, war exploded. It had been raging for 10 long years when the Trojans believed they had finally overcome the Greeks. Little did they know, the Greeks had another trick up their sleeves.
In a stroke of genius, the Greeks built an enormous wooden horse with a hollow belly in which men could hide. After the Greeks convinced their foes that this structure was a peace offering, the Trojans happily accepted it and brought the horse within their fortified city. That night, as the Trojans slept, Greeks hidden inside snuck out the trap door. Then, they proceeded to slaughter and decisively defeat the Trojans.

This was unquestionably one of the biggest and most successful tricks known to history -- that is, if it's true. Homer alludes to the occurrence in ""The Iliad,"" and Virgil extrapolates the story in ""The Aeneid."" Evidence suggests that Troy itself existed, giving some validity to Homer's tales, and scholars have long been investigating how historically accurate these details are. One theory behind the Trojan horse comes from historian Michael Wood, who proposes that it was merely a battering ram in the shape of a horse that infiltrated the city [source: Haughton].
In any case, the story has won a permanent place in the Western imagination as a warning to beware of enemies bearing gifts.

4: **Clinton/ Lewinsky Affair**

 In January 1998, citizen journalist Matt Drudge reported a sensational story tha­t turned out to be true. The president of the United States, Bill Clinton, had an affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. As suspicions mounted, Clinton publicly denied the allegations. As if this lie weren't big enough, it turned out that Clinton had lied under oath about the affair as well -- which was perjury and grounds for impeachment.
Here's how the truth came out. Paula Jones was an Arkansas state employee when then-governor Clinton allegedly propositioned her. She later sued him for sexual harassment. In an effort to prove that Clinton had a pattern of such behavior, lawyers set out to expose his sexual affairs. They found Linda Tripp, a former White House secretary and confidant of Lewinsky. Tripp recorded telephone conversations in which Lewinsky talked of her affair with Clinton. Lawyers then probed Clinton with specific questions and cornered him into denying the affair under oath.

During the highly publicized scandal, prosecutor Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton, who finally admitted to the relationship. Based on Starr's report, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton for not only perjury but obstruction of justice. Despite the scandal, Clinton maintained relatively high approval ratings from the American public, and the Senate acquitted him of the charges. However, in the eyes of many Americans, his legacy remained tarnished.

3: **Watergate**

Two decades before the Clinton scandal, another U.S. president was caught in a web of lies, and the controversy had devastating effects on the country as a whole.
In the summer before President Richard Nixon's successful re-election to a second term, five men were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters, housed in the Watergate Hotel. As details emerged over the next year, it became clear that officials close to Nixon gave the orders to the burglars, perhaps to plant wiretaps on the phones there. The question soon became about whether Nixon knew of, covered up or even ordered the break-in.

In response to mounting suspicions, Nixon denied allegations that he knew anything. In front of 400 Associated Press editors, famously proclaimed, ""I am not a crook."" He was talking about whether he had ever profited from public service, but that one quote came to represent his entire political career.
It was a lie that came back to haunt him. When it was revealed that private White House conversations about the matter were recorded, the investigative committee subpoenaed the tapes. Nixon's refusal on the basis of ""executive privilege"" brought the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that he had to relinquish the tapes.
The tapes were exactly the smoking gun needed to implicate Nixon in the cover-up of the scandal. They revealed that he obviously knew more about the matter than he claimed. Upon the initiation of impeachment proceedings, Nixon gave up and resigned from office. The scandal left a lasting scar on the American political scene and helped usher Washington outsider Jimmy Carter into the presidency a few years later.

2: **The Big Lie: Nazi Propaganda**

By the time Nazism arose in Germany in the 1930s, anti-Semitism was nothing new -- not by a long shot. The J­ewish people had suffered a long history of prejudice and persecution. And although Nazis perpetuated centuries-old lies, this time those lies would have their most devastating effects. Like never before, anti-Semitism was manifested in a sweeping national policy known as ""the Final Solution,"" which sought to eliminate Jews from the face of the Earth.
To accomplish this, Adolf Hitler and his minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, launched a massive campaign to convince the German people that the Jews were their enemies. Having taken over the press, they spread lies blaming Jews for all of Germany's problems, including the loss of World War I. One outrageous lie dating back to the Middle Ages claimed that Jews engaged in the ritual killings of Christian children and used their blood in the unleavened bread eaten at Passover [source: Landau].

Using Jews as the scapegoat, Hitler and his cronies orchestrated what they called ""the big lie."" This theory states that no matter how big the lie is (or more precisely, because it's so big), people will believe it if you repeat it enough. Everyone tells small lies, Hitler reasoned, but few have the guts to tell colossal lies [source: Hoffer]. Because a big lie is so unlikely, people will come to accept it.
This theory helps us understand so many of the lies throughout history. Although we've barely scratched the surface of all those lies that deserve (dis)honorable mentions, you can satiate your historical curiosity by browsing the lists below.

dvejhz,5,2019-11-12,"I want to move out from my nparents and live with my BF's family instead, is this a bad idea?",mmke_xx,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/dvejhz/i_want_to_move_out_from_my_nparents_and_live_with/,"Hello everyone! I made a separate post about this on r/relationship_advice but I figured I should also post this here since people in this subreddit might understand my situation to a greater extent. I have asked for advice on moving out a while ago on r/raisedbynarcissists and the majority of comments advised me to move out. Now that more time has passed, a solution to my problem has appeared, but I'm not entirely sure that it is the greatest idea.

My BF brought up the idea of me moving in with his family so that I won't be financially stuck to my nparents anymore. I have been questioning this idea ever since it was brought up by him a few months ago, and I would like to know if anyone has dealt with a similar issue as me. I'm currently in college and I still live with my parents for financial reasons. Me and my BF are both 20 and have been together for 2 years. My nparents have become increasingly difficult to live with for the past few years. My ndad sets a curfew for me at 11pm, doesn't support me financially for college, but always loves to control me by using the ""I give you a roof over your head, my house my rules"" argument, and also uses that to justify his reason for not helping me with college expenses. Luckily, I got the excelsior scholarship this year so I'm thankful I didn't have to take out too many loans as a college student.

My mother is also a nparent, and I've been her personal marriage and emotional counselor for years. My parents have an extremely toxic marriage, my dad always puts down my mom, treats her horribly, and recently he's gotten physical when he grabbed my mom by the throat because she raised her voice at him. I wasn't present for the physical altercation but my mother told me about it and requested advice from me. I've been telling her to get a divorce for 5 years now, but she without fail always forgives my dad after some time and moves on. My dad has also exhibited the same behavior towards me, but in my case, my mother tells me ""well, it's not that big of a deal, it's not like he actually hits you or abuses you so just move on and don't provoke him."" As more time goes on, my toleration for my parents continues to drop lower. And ideally I would absolutely love to get out of my situation, but I also have to be realistic.

 I currently have a part time paid internship, and majority of my savings will be used towards my study abroad trip to Spain during the spring of next year. I have to study abroad since it's a requirement for my major. I currently don't have a job/internship secured for the upcoming summer, I would prefer an internship but my fallback is to get a regular job of course. I cannot afford a place of my own at the moment, and realistically, I probably won't be able to afford my own apartment until after I graduate and get a full time job. Living in NY while being a full time student and having a part-time internship that pays minimum wage will not be enough for me to live on my own. If I were to move out by next year I would probably have to work two jobs, but that would most likely take a toll on my grades and my relationship.

A few months ago, I had a serious discussion with my BF about me moving out of my parents home to come live with his family instead. We are both going to Spain to study abroad for a semester in the Spring of next year, and the plan is for me to move in with his family once I come back. Although the idea sounds wonderful, I'm not too sure how well it will play out and if I'm just rushing for a solution to my current life at home. I spoke to my BF about my concerns, and he said it shouldn't be a problem because his parents and his little sister love me and that his parents are on board with helping me out of my situation, and they are the one's who actually brought up the idea in the first place. I know that his family cares about me, and I know they really are willing to help since I've spoken to them about moving in before. They don't agree with the way my parents treat me, and they want me to feel happy without feeling financially stuck to my parents. Also, I do not want to be financially dependent on my BF's parents. Even if they offer their help, I don't want to be tied to another family financially, and if I were to move in, I would definitely find a job beforehand to support myself. I haven't spoken to my BF's family about the details such as rent, but I do plan on having that covered. This solution is the only one I can afford to make, and it is also the quickest solution as opposed to waiting another two years. 

It all sounds like a good plan, but what if it will actually end up being a terrible idea that can lead to a breakup between me and my BF? I brought up the idea to my mom since she always tells me ""well, if you don't like the way your dad treats you, maybe you should start looking for ways to move out."" I told her that I will probably end up moving in with my BF's family since I cannot afford a place of my own at the moment. My mom exploded at me saying ""I will NOT have you embarrass me like this by leaving me for another family, that's not moving out."" That conversation didn't go well with her... Fast forward to about two weeks later after that argument, my mom's close friend stops by to visit and of course my mom tells her about my idea to move in with my BF's family.

I had a civil discussion with my mom's friend, and she told me about her experience when she moved in with her BF's family to get away from her parents. It did not go well for her, she broke up with her BF and the family hated her afterwards. Overall it was not a pleasant experience for her, and she warned me to be aware of what could happen once I burn bridges with my parents. I understand where she's coming from, but she also has no clue about how my parents treat me or what I've had to deal with. On the other hand, I've tolerated my parents for several year now, and maybe moving out is too rash or not well thought out. I feel lost, I can't tell if I am being irrational or afraid. I understand that moving in with my BF's family could possibly cause a strain on our relationship, and that it probably is better if I just got my own place, but that would mean waiting for a longer period of time to finally move out. My BF and I will most likely live together after college anyway, so I personally don't think moving in will cause major relationship problems, but then again I can't predict the future, and what seems to be a great solution now could potentially be a bad decision in the long run. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm just being stupid, or maybe I should have another discussion with my BF's parents. I don't know how to continue with my decisions."

dvfxat,4,2019-11-12,I’m at a crossroad - should I apply? Is dental school worth it?,[deleted],DentalSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/DentalSchool/comments/dvfxat/im_at_a_crossroad_should_i_apply_is_dental_school/,"I’m a recent graduate from UW in biochem. For years, I struggled to decide if dental was for me, and a lot of hardships discouraged me - I couldn’t find any experiences to get a taste of dentistry, and I wasn’t doing as well in school as I hoped. After graduation, I was working as an intern for a dentist who I felt took advantage of me. I wasn’t properly trained or paid but I was expected to function like a professional DA right away. I was commuting and working for 10+ hours a day on my feet and I wasn’t being paid for the first 500 hours. Most of my time there, my grandma was in the hospital. I went to work and did my best until she passed away, but soon after the dentist scolded me for lack of positive attitude and effort. I decided to quit because it became clear I wasn’t a good fit with the rest of the staff. I now have a great position volunteering at a nonprofit clinic where I’ve been able to learn, feel appreciated, and click well with the other volunteers and staff.

I think what makes the decision hard is that I’m where I thought I wanted to be. I have probably 200+ volunteer hours now in nonprofit and private practice experience. I have two LOR from professors, and I’ve built up relationships with dentists who can write my other LOR. I’ve worked with students and a professor from the local dental school because they come in to use our clinic. I’m an experienced writer tutor and already have a draft for my personal statement. All that’s left for me is to study and take the DAT, hopefully crushing it so I can make up for my subpar GPA (3.2).

I’ve tried to be honest with myself about why I would apply. After the positive experiences, I don’t hate dentistry and I think I might actually like it a fair amount. I could see myself being content with doing it for the rest of my life (although I know assisting is not really the same). It’s a safe and stable career to have and I know to a certain extent what my career trajectory would be. I’d have a desirable lifestyle and autonomy. However, I have a lingering fear that I’ll regret it or that I could be just as happy in life doing something else with less debt and school. I’m looking for full time jobs right now, but arguing with my parents cast a lot of doubt upon me. I have no idea what job I can even get or where that leads me, but dentistry feels familiar and safe. I don’t want to make a bad decision just because I’m scared, but I feel like my mind is being clouded by my fears about both options. Fear of commitment and struggle from dental school and the fear of financial struggle and career instability of starting my professional career.

I didn’t do that well in undergrad. I struggled a lot with my mental health and usually ended up cramming for exams. I felt like I could never get ahead of the curve because I was either stupid or just had the worlds worst studying technique. I know that when you’re practicing, you don’t really need to have all of the hard science memorized, but the first two years are incredibly intensive science courses. 

I apologize for my long ramble, but I guess what I’m trying to ask is if there’s anyone out there who had these same doubts and went through with it. Do you regret it? Did you dramatically change your old studying habits and pull through? How do you manage your mental health and motivate yourself when there’s bound to be burn out? And to those who didn’t necessarily have the same worries, is dental school worth the debt and mental stress of being a student again? I’d love to hear honest and realistic thoughts from recent students because so much information online is just older dentists who either loved or hated their jobs to a fault."

Some background on my brother, he's a few years older than me and has a full time job in a different city than our parents and owns his own condo in a large city. He's really uptight and always expects everyone to not beat around the bush and follow his rules. I really hated that about him, but he's also very nice and helps me financially with paying for school/other expenses and spent a lot of time getting me an internship.

Housing is expensive where he lives so he let me live with him in his apartment and I crash on his couch. But the thing is that he's really invasive. He expects cleanliness all the time and what's worse is that he always wants to know who I'm interacting with all the time. He wants to know who I text, who my friends are at school, who I hang out with at work, literally everything about me is his business. I get like 0 privacy. One of my childhood best friends, my brother hates. My friend is a nice guy and all, but he's been caught a few times with weed and didn't really make it to university, but other than that is a nice guy. My brother tells me to cut him off immediately and never talk to him and my brother sometimes threatens to pull the plug on everything that he gives me if I don't listen to him. He's probably given me over $40,000 worth of money (mostly used to pay for school, so I'll have little debt) and laptops/phones, etc and he brings it up every time I refuse to listen to him. He has these weird ideas that because we're second generation children of low income parents who are now heading into the upper middle class, that we should avoid messing things up for us with the company that we're with. I think that's nonsense and I think that I'm smart enough to make my own decisions. He says that I'm too young to understand these things and the best that I can do is just listen to him. He literally vets every one of my friends and tells me to cut off like 3-4 people. Complaining to my parents is point-less because they just tell me to listen to big brother.

I do appreciate what he does for me, but how do I tell him to back off my personal life?

tl;dr my brothers helps me out a bit, but wants to control my life and tells me its for the better. How do I get him to give my privacy."

dvhm28,0,2019-11-12,I [32 M]hate my unsympathetic disrespectful sister[28 F],basementmath,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dvhm28/i_32_mhate_my_unsympathetic_disrespectful/,"TL;DR - summary at the bottom

Firstly, me and my sister was raised by my mother who is a widow and an immigrant to this country. Our family went through a lot but my mother went through the most.

After graduating high school, I attended community college while I started work. My focus eventually became work instead of schooling because I couldn't neglect my mom who was trying to feed the family so I stepped up and worked extra and brought money home. It wasn't much but over the period of 3 years(when I was 19 to 21 ish) I brought home at least $25,000 to $30,000 if not more. Then we went through a bad financial decision where I had to contribute for 2 more years while I worked to pay bills for some financial mistake my mom made for our family.

After we got over that period, I worked for about 2 years, I was looking for an opportunities for greater things then I decided to go back to school, this time, aiming to transfer to a University of California system school. Long story short, it took me about 2.5 years to while working time to time, earned 3.7 GPA and with an essay with compelling story, I was able to transfer to one of the top UC schools where I am here now. I am studying computer science and I am trying to become a software engineer when I get out of school. I did my first internship this past summer, I am trying to land another internship in order to ensure a job, a well paying job in the silicon valley by the time I graduate.

I had jumped over a lot of hurdles to get to where I am at. Contrary to me, my sister, went to a university(also a UC) straight from high school. Long story short, she had typical college life, where she didn't need to wait tables or make food deliveries while she studied unlike myself. She also got herself a masters and a job afterwards. I am proud of her.

However, she completely neglected my mom and blocked all forms of communication over an argument we had 2 years ago. Despite having a job and a masters degree, she told me that she's interested in working at a coffee shop or making food deliveries in the gig economy, which was what I had to do in order to get by, not because I had time left over and I didn't have anything better to do. After I got mad at her, she told me ""Your sacrifice never benefited me""

I have not spoken to her for a year. My mom asked her to apologize but she refused and they didn't talk for almost a year. Then, this past 4th of July, she called my mom, complaining that she is controlling, she is old enough to do whatever she wants. She paid a visit while I visited my mom for holiday weekend and she told my mom that she hasn't done anything for her. I had already been upset with what she had told me before, she preceded to tell me ""stop acting like a victim"" and an unapologetic attitude of ""You keep getting mad, I don't know what to tell you""

She thinks she had the hardest when she had it the easiest. She didn't have to jump through hurdles like I had done, didn't contribute to the family like I had, which she HAS benefited since I started working and brought home money when she was in high school.

I developed mild depression when I was stuck at a dead end job, working two jobs, making payments and I was in distress and when I would write things on facebook, when it really was distress call, she'd block me, calling me a drama queen and completely unsympathetic, self-centered, entitled, unavailable family member.

The day she showed up, she said such things, I was angry and I was shouting at my face, she tried to fight me. My mom was holding me back, I didn't want any trouble and did not want to hurt her so I held back and she took full advantage of it, trying to kick me and punch me although she couldn't hurt me much.

Although it was more equivalent of little kid trying to act tough knowing that my mom is trying to stop the fight and knowing that I think of my mom and hold back, it angered me a lot. I still have this anger and it comes back to me time to time and I lose sleep.

Instead of losing sleep over such desire of petty revenge, I need to apply to internships and study for midterms. But at the moment, today and yesterday, I was only half as productive because of this thought.

What stresses me out is that my mom would tell me about her and how rebelling she is, when I repeatedly asked her that thinking of her gives me anxiety and brings back anger and it's distracting.

I am clearly the opposite of what she called me. I clearly have not victimized myself, I work hard, I go to a good school, I do everything I can in order to have a better career in a long run and I have been successful at it (building networks with colleagues, having internships and group projects on my resume) and what I did for my family clearly mattered and I just feel insulted because I didn't get the recognition I deserve. It's not about money, it's more about my pride. I am heavily ISTJ so glory is my trophy, money is second.

TL;DR: I worked in order to bring home money to my family and started college at a late age, I work hard, go to a great school(considered public ivy) and working towards getting a good high paying job after graduation but my toxic sister tells me that my sacrifice for the family never benefited her and I act like a victim, when it's the complete opposite. I feel insulted because she was never there for me when I was going through hard times and depression when I was stuck at dead end jobs working long hours to help my family. Instead of sympathizing, she saw me as a drama queen and had me blocked on all forms of communication for years and now she is neglecting my aging mother while she is rebelling to her."

I don't know if I should just forgive her and try to make things work or end it.",ConstantFloor9,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dvhts8/my_24_gf_21_kissed_another_man_and_it_was_more/,"There's about a 3 year age difference between us. I'm her first boyfriend and really guy she's done anything with. She's my 3rd girlfriend, and 1st one to last more than a few months. We're both college students, and while we're together during the schools year, during breaks we go long distance even though we both live around 3 hours apart in the NYC metro area. Last winter, after about a year of being together, she went to her parent's country to visit relatives for a couple of weeks. While there she went out dancing at clubs with her cousin and friends and she had danced with one guy in particular. This guy knew she was in a relationship but still tried to feel her up and kiss her while dancing. She didn't stop him though, she let him do it and only moved her head when he tried to kiss her on the lips so it would go to her cheek. I don't know about you, but to me, if you're in a relationship with someone, if someone else doesn't respect that you tell them to fuck off. She didn't do that, instead she told me about it like it was a normal thing and it was fun, that she imagined she was dancing with me instead. She got mad at me when I was upset and couldn't understand my problem, she laughed at me when I told her it hurt me. But I forgave her when she came back and we stayed together. Things got better and we decided to move in together off campus. We signed a lease with both of us on it.   
This past summer she was on an internship for her degree, again it would be difficult for me to visit her during it. We stayed in regular contact while she was doing it and really bonded with her roommate. Then there was a guy in the internship that she connected with. One night they pulled an all nighter watching netflix together which turned into cuddling, groping and grinding, but nothing more. The guy ghosted her after and she couldn't figure out why. But that didn't stop her from talking to me about, being preoccupied thinking and talking about it when we hung out, when I spent a crap load of money to hang out with her after not seeing her for 2 months, and all she could talk about was him. She got depressed when he deleted her from snap, and it took over a month for her to stop talking about him. I didn't tell her what happened hurt me, because I didn't want to be laughed at again. I did tell her the guy ghosted her because she didn't fuck him, and that's what the guy was probably looking and when she didn't put out he wasn't interested. But I don't think she understood because she still was hung up on him. We had already singed the lease and put in our deposit plus first/last months rent, and with classes starting so soon there was no time to try to back out or find somewhere else to live. We had sex the first night we moved in, but then sex dropped off. I had posted on here about a month ago about how we hadn't had sex for awhile, it went a month before we finally had it.  
In an attempt to hopefully respark our sex life, I told her she could kiss or screw one guy one time only, hoping that maybe the lack of sex was because she was bored of being exclusively with one guy and by getting off nsa with someone new it would bring her back to me. That didn't happen. She made out with a guy she's been friends with for awhile, and it wasn't for fun, it was because he made her happy, and I don't anymore, but she won't tell me why. And to me, that feels like cheating. I gave permission for nsa fun once without emotions attached, but once she attached emotions to it, it's like I don't measure up anymore, it's more than just attraction or that it's fun, it's getting something emotional that I don't give and she isn't willing to talk with me to try and fix that. When I told her that was the only time, she twisted my words so she could continue making out as sex hadn't happened, when that isn't what I had said. Also according to her, I am not allowed to do the same, only she can.  
And now i'm stuck. Do i forgive her and move on, or find a new place to live now and move out and either break the lease or come to some arrangement with her."

dvi69s,1,2019-11-12,[m4a] a few ideas,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dvi69s/m4a_a_few_ideas/,"
Hey there, I have a few ideas in mind tonight but I’m fairly open minded. Ideally looking for someone to play a dominant female but could be persuaded if you want to play a submissive female. I’m also open to dom males but the role would have to be something I really like. If you have ideas in mind then feel free to suggest them but I’ll list a few below I enjoy:

Celebrity roleplay- variety of options here but would ideally be you playing the domme celeb. My personal favourite is to play your personal assistant but again I’m open.

Someone I know- again a few options but the premise is you play someone from my personal life and we have an encounter and build from there.

WWE roleplay- you play one or several of the women from the WWE and I, a new intern am inexperienced and easy to boss around.

Superhero/villain- mainly into the girls from batman but happy for marvel characters to. The idea is either you save me and I owe you or you capture me and have your way with me.

Teacher/student- basic but you play the teacher and I play the student 

MHA- you play one of the girls from my hero academia, open minded with ideas for this

If you have your own suggestions please feel free to pitch them but if you like one of mine then let me know.

Message me your asl and what your interested in, bonus for anyone that will play more than one character."

As the title states I studied to be a chemical engineer and loved it, because I always had a special interest in process improvement, data analysis and quality.

Currently I work as part of a quality team where it is just me and my boss so there's not a lot of opportunity for growth and that's mainly why I'd like a change. I was also the defacto manager for about two months whenever my previous boss quit and there was another guy working with us.

I've been involved with a lot of things given the size of my department like internal auditing, maintaining third party certifications, supplier quality, dealing with customer complaints, FMEAs, at one point started a Process Excellent program that fell through due to a lack of interest from management.

I also know some programming as I did an internship where I did data compilation for a PhD student and know some AutoCAD and Sketchup, I can also speak Spanish and I'm working towards getting a Green belt on Lean.

Lastly I like my community and volunteer pretty often, so I would hate having to move out of Houston, so if you have any leads that might sound like it might be a good fit, please let me know I'm pretty open about I'd be down to try.

Thank you."

From what I have seen from the store for the core game, all expansions, and all extra characters it would cost:

* Too many bones - $130

* 40 Days in Daelore - $25
* Age of Tyranny - $25
* Gasket - $25
* Ghillie - $25
* Nugget - $25
* Tink - $25
* Dart - $25
* Gearloc Council internship program (Q1 2020) - $30
* Splice &amp; Dice (Q1 2020) - $50	

Grand Total - $475. Now don't get me wrong, I can afford it, but $475 can buy a lot of games on my wishlist. Does Chip Theory Games ever offer discounts via bundles, coupons, or holiday sales to soften the blow this great game makes on my game budget? If so, how can I be notified about them?"
dvjufs,1,2019-11-12,"Why is your major useful, what do you plan to do with it?",FrankExplains,uofu,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofu/comments/dvjufs/why_is_your_major_useful_what_do_you_plan_to_do/,"I'm curious to hear from y'all, graduates too.

As usual, I'll start. I'm an Information Systems Major in the Business School.

The IS major gives you a decent introduction to several different aspects of IT: Databases, Networking, Programming, etc... The classes alone aren't enough to get a real salaried job, but coupled with a relevant internship where you can apply and expand on what you learn in class it becomes very useful.

The real benefit of the classes are:

* Finding a field of IT that you want to specialize in, and
* Knowing enough about the other fields to have a productive conversation with someone who did specialize in it.

Which is kind of how the entire business school works. You take classes in all different aspects of a company so that you can talk competently with other departments.

I find the major very valuable, despite it's higher cost (it's like $350-450 a credit instead of the normal ~$230).

As for what I want to do with it; unfortunately I was pretty far into my major when I discovered programming and kind of wish I was a CS/CE major, but oh well, I can teach myself. With my internship and a few more years of self-taught programming experience I'm sure I'll be able to find a job in something I enjoy and pays well.

What about you, what makes your major useful? Would you recommend it to an incoming freshman or an undecided student? What do you want to do with it?"
dvk2fp,1,2019-11-12,Reddit_Meta.3 - Making Your Own Reddit Content,ShadowWolf525,WeirdGeneratedStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdGeneratedStories/comments/dvk2fp/reddit_meta3_making_your_own_reddit_content/,"**Reddit is a big platform filled with mentally insane people using it every single day.** As such, it's important that you make your content stand out from the crowd by finding a unique angle or idea that doesn't exist elsewhere, but which will attract people and generate lots of traffic. Here are ten tips for creating your own Reddit content.  


Make the Most Out of Reddit Submissions  


In an ideal world, everyone who visits your website is a potential customer for your product. That is a pipe dream for most websites, though, so if you want to make a lasting impression on Reddit, try to do something extra, like writing about something that's relevant to your brand.  


For instance, if you're a high-end luxury clothing company and you want to reach out to an audience of guys who spend a lot of time online browsing the latest brands, why not take a page from Miley Cyrus and ask them to share it on Reddit?

**~~Reddit is filled with all kinds of content, from videos to photographs to~~** ~~news. And a good many of these photos are of women being sexually assaulted or harassed.~~  


~~Here's the list. If you know anything about the photos (or if you can provide additional information), please contact us.~~

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Reddit is filled with all kinds of content, from videos to photographs to** news. In addition, the community is also full of a lot of comments, where users are free to post whatever they want.

It's important to take the time to read these comments and comments threads, as they can give you a lot of insight into the people that participate in a given subreddit.

In this blog post, I will present you the Top 25 Reddit Comments.

What is Reddit?

Reddit is a social news website and online community. It is used to share news and information of interest to the internet's users. The community is called a subreddit, or a sub-forum of the website.

In general, the subreddit consists of a set of posts, which have a specific topic.

When a user comments on a given thread, they are usually doing two things.

First, they are commenting on a post, which is a particular topic of interest for the users in the subreddit. These comments are moderated and voted up, while those that are downvote brigaded, or spammy, are downvoted to oblivion. This is where the term ""reddit moderator"" comes from.

Secondly, the content of the post in question is upvoted, meaning that it gets more upvotes than downvotes and is deemed valuable by users who follow that particular post and are interested in that topic.

Thirdly, the commenters that downvote the post are not users of the subreddit. These users can't downvote a post simply because they disagree with it, so they are not commenting in good faith, they are spamming.

**Fourthly, the downvoters themselves are not the problem. In fact, this is what's great about the comment system**. It's not like Facebook, which encourages you to share the things you agree with in the hope that you'll feel good about yourself, but with Reddit, you get to vote up things that you hate.

The thing is, though, there are also the downvoters who have the potential to change the voting system. And, frankly, that's not a great idea.

The way Reddit works, the first thing that happens when someone comments on your post is that you get a little box pop up at the bottom of the screen. If the box reads ""liked"" by at least one other user, the upvote count will increase. If it reads ""dislike,"" the downvote count will decrease.

**~~What that means is that in order to get a negative~~** ~~rating, a company must have more than 20% of its shares owned by non-US citizens.~~

~~A quick check by the New York Times shows that the United States does indeed lead the world in the percentage of citizens that hold shares in companies. But, that's just one piece of the overall picture of the United States.~~

~~One important part of the picture is the country's capitalization ratio, which is essentially a gauge of a country's capital stock, which is, by definition, its stock of stocks. The capitalization ratio is calculated as a ratio of the total stock of stocks outstanding to the capital stock of a country, so, for example, if the capital stock of a country is $100 billion, the share of capital stock is $100 billion divided by $100 billion.~~

**~~In other words, if a country's capital stock is $100 billion, then its capitalization ratio is $100/100 = 4.5~~**~~.~~

~~Here is the chart to make this simple.~~

~~Here are the key points to remember about capitalization ratio.~~

~~Capitalization ratio does not have an exact value. It changes over time.~~

~~Capitalization ratio measures the number of shares that a company has outstanding.~~

~~Capitalization ratio is a percentage of market capitalization.~~

~~It's also important to understand that there are various ways a company's capitalization ratio can be calculated. It might be based on an actual share count or it might be based on a valuation methodology.~~

~~For example, a company might be capitalized at $20, but it might be capitalized at $80 based on a valuation.~~

**~~The key to capitalization ratio is knowing what it is, how it is calculated~~**~~, and how to read the chart. Here are some resources to get you started:~~

~~The Key to Finding the Key to a Good Capitalization Ratio~~

~~It's all about understanding the fundamental key to capitalization. For example, in this post I'll explain the key to finding a good ratio and how you can use it to see how effective your marketing channels are.~~

~~Why Is a Good Capitalization Ratio Important?~~

~~One of the biggest issues with many online businesses is the ratio. It's all about the capitalization ratio – that is, the percentage of monthly sales to marketing budgets. In most cases, that ratio is way off. It is important to see what that ratio is so you can adjust your marketing efforts. It's important to understand why it is important, since there are some people that claim you should ignore it.~~

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What that means is that in order to get a negative** upvote, you need to make a comment that is really, really, really negative and really, really long. So basically, if you want your comment to get a negative upvote, make a really mean comment.

Now, I don't want to give away any spoilers, but there's a couple of really, really nasty things that can happen if you comment ""thanks"" or ""I like"" something on Reddit.

First, the comment may be removed.

**Next, the** comment may be modified.

Finally, the comment may be deleted.

So the reason why this is the case is because in order to delete a comment you must do the following: 1. Delete the comment.

2. Delete the comment from the original site.

Then the site can continue doing business as normal.

However, if you want to delete the comment from one or more other sites, you would need to find out how to do so.

That would probably mean going through the commenting system and looking at the ""other sites"" list. This is a lot of work. If a site has a private discussion, you will not be able to find out how to delete it until you can prove to the site that you have ""access"" to the private discussions.

There are other methods.

You can use a bot.

You could use your IP address.

**You can use a** search engine.

You can use a tool like Sentry.io.

The key is to not have a history of comments.

You could always do a history of your IP. I would not suggest doing that, because it could be a sign of other problems.

However, if you have a public profile, and have not been ""removed"" yet (i.e. if you have not been banned), I recommend that you do.

**~~To do a~~** ~~good job in the workplace you should have the opportunity to try different positions,"" says L.A.-based lawyer, educator, and author Linda S. Pang, a member of the California State Bar and the author of ""Becoming a Legal Career Expert"" (New Directions, 2015).~~

~~She offers these tips:~~

~~1. Keep an open mind about whether you want a specific job or you're looking for more responsibility. When you start looking for a job, you have to remember that what you do for a living doesn't have to be the same thing you do when you're alone with your thoughts.~~

~~2. Seek an internship that is both challenging and meaningful, and not too far from your home.~~

~~3. Learn the industry rules. ""The law is a business,"" she says. ""You have to obey the rules of your company.""~~

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**To do a** search, type the following command in the Command Prompt window:

C:\\&gt; %SystemRoot%\\system32\\rundll32.exe Search ""HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE""

The HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE key will have many subkeys. The first one will have a file called ""RegEdit"" with two subkeys. The first one is ""HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER"", with the name of the user who is logged on. In the Registry Editor, right-click on this key and then click on New, or press Ctrl+N. Name the new key ""SearchReg"" (note that this name should be different from ""HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE"") and then click OK.

In the Registry Editor, navigate to the ""SearchReg"" key and create a new text string. **For example, the following text string would create an entry for** the name of the user:

""Samantha J. Koehler""

It also accepts values. For example, this will create a new entry for the last name:

""T. M. Stiles""

You can also set the default date and time that the name will be set to for all new entries:

""default\_date\_format""=""MM/dd/yyyy""

The first argument to this is the string that will be used for the name. It is followed by an optional format specifier:

""default\_date\_format""=""$date\_format""

The last argument is the date format that will be used for all entries:

""default\_date\_format""=""$date\_format$date""

If you wanted to set the date format on an individual entry, you could do it like this:

**""default\_**date"" = datetime.datetime(1970,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)

You can also specify a custom date format by passing in a string (in date format) instead of a date. You can also pass in an empty string (empty string or None ).

**For example, if you want to format entries with a custom date format:** xtdate -format %d/%m/%Y %Y-%m-%d %Y-%m-%d . The ""%"" can be a percentage or an absolute date (using %Y or %m ) or can be an ISO8601 time string, using the %Y or %m formatting option.

If you specify a date format and then specify -format without a time string, an error is generated.

See also strftime, which is the equivalent of xtdate -format %d/%m/%Y %Y-%m-%d %Y-%m-%d.

When a time string is used, the time string must be valid according to the RFC 3339 time standard. This means that time strings must consist of only numbers (the digits 0-9).

**The following time formats are available:**

**YYYY-mm-dd HH**:MM:SS.SSS

DD-mm-yyyy hh:mm:ss

YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.SSS - \[HH:MM:SS.SSS\] \[HH:MM:SS.SSS\]

DD-mm-yyyy hh:mm:ss - \[HH:MM:SS.SSS\] \[HH:MM:SS.SSS\]

YYYY-mm-dd hh:mm:ss - \[HH:MM:SS.SSS\] \[HH:MM:SS.SSS\]

The format can be specified as:

yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss

yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.SSS - \[HH:MM:SS.SSS\]"
dvk32w,18,2019-11-12,My Total Drama Headcannons,Motroid127,Totaldrama,https://www.reddit.com/r/Totaldrama/comments/dvk32w/my_total_drama_headcannons/,"I thought I might as well share some of my headcannons to the Total Drama subreddit for better or worse.


1. Cody probably knew about Chris's singing rule and tried to avoid singing in order to get away from Sierra's bullshit as well as the competition. However, Chris realized that without Cody, Sierra might start to cause major problems and didn't enforce it. He probably knew Sierra was the Amazon's triumph card and didn't want to eliminate Cody since he was her balancer. This might have been the reason why Chris didn't want to enforce it for those reasons. With a few exceptions like DJ avoiding singing in ""Sea Shantey"", it would've resulted of Chris letting DJ stay regardless if he didn't. 

________________

2. Izzy is secretely a plant/undercover intern for Chris and Chef during the seasons of Total Drama. The RCMP was hoax in order for her to leave the game early that way Heather and Lindsay's alliance stays strong. Her coming back in the merge was a Chris decision and for her to cause trouble. She isn't what she seems and was pretending to act crazy. All of her relationships were her acting undercover and in real life she doesn't have any interest in the game or Owen.

_______________

3. Duncan was secretly pretending to like Courtney in All-Stars just to annoy her. He really had no intention of getting back together with her whatsoever and was just him poking fun at the fact that they aren't dating. 


_____________



4. Chef is Chris's caretaker and the reason he hasn't left the show is because of that particular reason. No matter how much Chris torments Chef, he cannot leave his spot no matter what.

______________

5. Scuba Bear is highly trained animal made by Chris and the producers. Whenever things didn't go as planned for Chris, he needed Scuba Bear do his bidding. He had some plans that were successful and might have failed. For Example:


- A plan that succeeded was that he sent Scuba Bear after Cody in order to save Heather from elimination. Cody was an easy target and didn't have a social partner, so his plan ended up being successful.


- A plan that might have failed was kicking LeShawna off of the season. Chris knew she didn't make enemies for that reason. He had Scuba Bear try beat her in the log race in order to keep Eva; **a secondary antagonist** in the game to keep the target off Heather. This however failed and Scuba Bear had it's limits. LeShawna was stronger than he thought which probably explains why he did what he did in ""Haute-Campture"" once he got her unfairly kicked off. 

________

6. Heather probably had a cellular device hidden when she came to the Island. Off-screen she would talk to an intern in a secluded location to give her the secrets and facts of what's to come. For example, that said intern told her specifically where to find the invincibility pass in the treasure hunt episode. This might've given her the confidence to kiss Trent because she knew she'll get the invincibility pass later.

_________

7. Sierra insanity in All-Stars was her going through a separation anxiety over technology. Once she lost her phone, that might've triggered a phantom experience that made her think the person she loved was there. Cody was always on her device and without seeing his face on screen, it lead to her believing that Cody shouldn't be forgotten. Cameron was only one to actually socialize with her on the team and he was her official Cody. 


So those are my headcannons and I was glad I can share with you. Majority will think some of these aren't true due to how complicated they are. Make sure to let me know what you think of these headcannons and If they're are any serious headcannons that involve the show, please share them if you will?"

Haven't you?  Then you met me and I literally screwed up your plan because you did fall in love with me.  That is why you said that after you got to FL.  You wanted to see how you felt. Was it actually me or what I did for you? you said.

**YOU SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED YOURSELF BETTER TO ME** .....you always left me guessing and thinking the worst of you.

I  cxompletelygot it today, I came in the way of  your transition plans.  When I doubted your love for me because of unexplainable things you never told me why.  I could see at times that you were literally fighting a battle in your head.  I could see that.  That is why I thought you should go do that internship.  To grow to mature not to have the most extensive profile on fet.  Well, FL did not end up as I expected and could have ended up so much better for both of us if **YOU COULD ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE**.  You keep it all in and say nothing and expected me to understand.  Well, I couldn't and I broke up with you because of all your 1/2 truths and omissions . WTF . 

WE could of had it all if you had just talked to me.  I am on the same page as you and want the same things but you never asked and I tried so hard to pull it out of you.  I would have had the threesome.  You said NOOO and you leave me and go into an open relationship. I am as kinky as you but you played so innocent.

Well, you should have talked to me.  I do believe you loved me know.  But you made me jump through hoops to understand it and wouldn't explain yourself ever.  So I was left to filling in the gaps and that ended us. SO, I know that I understand this more - our failure was on YOU and your inability to communicate EVER.  YOU J on YOU. I am broken by this.  Let's face it the transition would have surfaced in a few years after the novelty of us wore off. I will always love you as I have said before

As you knowI have no one to leave my life to in the event of my death,  I am still going to leave it all to you.  I have your SS# and your current address but soon you will move again and soon I will not know your female name.  I assume the attorneys will find you by your SS#.  Take care of L.  I am getting another soon.

I have been crying for two days over your transition. I am all over the place. You did not tell me on purpose to hurt me.  What wer you going to do bring that frame back to me as woman in 5 years and surprise me.  NICE!   This is all more thab I can take. Over two years,  I get a divorce, a dog dies, my boyfriend of a year is gone, another dog dies, lost a business due to the divorce and now I find out my ex bf, the love of my life is suddenly and surprisingly transitioning into a woman. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.  THIS IS MORE LOSS THAN ANY HUMAN CAN TAKE.  I seriously hope the widow maker comes in my sleep tonight.  It is too much.

**YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.  YOU ARE SELFISH.  I love you and just wanted to marry you and have fun in life.**"

My anger and jealously practically rolling off my body. I want to be her. I want to be the one on your arm. The one who gets to be openly affectionate. 

I finish off my glass of champagne and sit it down dramatically on the table. I’ve lost count on how many glasses that makes now but I’m definitely a little drunk. I let out a slight huff and I look up to see you give me a *cut it out* look. 

It all stared several years ago when I started out as an intern for your company and worked my way up. Now I’m the VP of Marketing and I’ve single handedly double your profits over the last two years. Helping you rebuild your company. Being the person that was able to put your vision to work. 

Naturally, we’ve spent a lot of time together. Our chemistry undeniable. Like magnets until we finally gave in 4 months ago. Since then we’ve spent a lot of late nights in the office with me bent over your desk, blowing you in the parking garage, and sneaking to my apartment for long lunches. We can’t get enough of one another and I want you so badly right now. 

Tonight is huge for the company. A big investor dinner for our clients. Your wife had insisted on coming and you only told me right before. I’m pissed but I still only want you. Our time together is rushed and secret but our chemistry is real. I think tonight I’m finally realizing that I want more than sex. 

I huff again and get up from the table. I’m being unprofessional and I know it. I practically stomp over to the bar and get a refill."
dvlpz7,6,2019-11-12,How to not compare in a competetive world?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dvlpz7/how_to_not_compare_in_a_competetive_world/,"Hello Reddit. I always find myself comparing my abilities to others, and in fact, my school encourages it. They say it's a dog-eat-dog world, and no one will hire us if we are at the bottom of the class; only the shit jobs hire them unless they've done something notable like create the next big startup. Ever since I was 9 years old, I was compared to those who were more successful than me, and my professors/parents still say I should. After all, if you want to be hired for job X, you have to be better than the thousands of people who applied for the same job. Only then will you get it. They're right. I applied for about 2,500 internships and got only 1 interview in which the interviewer said that he misread my resume and thought I was in my Masters and not Bachelors, and proceeded to politely terminate the interview early. When I took this comparison to the extreme, I have to be better than everyone else I'm competing with, did I ever get some results. By forcing myself beyond my limits, I got the average grade of the class, putting me in the top 50% of my class. I noticed that my university registry for companies seeking interns, my resume got more views on that alone.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, how do I not compare myself in a world that values competition and comparison in order to get the best jobs and opportunities? When I had the standard growth mindset of ""just be better than yesterday"", it doesn't help when you're miles behind your competition. For example, ""I'm better at math today than yesterday"". So everyone else in my class and most are improving faster than me enabling them the best internships. But when I forced myself to the brink of collapse because I had to beat the class average, I finally turned up some results.

&amp;#x200B;

Given this, is it worth not comparing myself to my peers if that is what will get me a better life? Or at least the life I want?"

I have so much sadness, physical tenseness, restlessness in my body (I am physically exhausted and worn out from stress and over-exertion—I overdid the exercise for three months to relieve stress) and mind (I feel stressed, even in my dreams in my sleep every night). I have never felt so stressed and hopeless in my entire life, and this period has now lasted for over half a year. My stress and deep sadness are affecting me physically, and my head feels so chaotic I don't even feel rested from sleep anymore. Before breaking down in point form the principal concerns in my life right now, I will describe myself and my life situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I am graduating my undergrad this year, which will mean I will have completed my double major in just under three years. I have been so focused on school since I began and admittedly in the moments where there was a ton of work and commitments I loved it and found purpose and passion in it. I'm currently applying for grad school and the professors and graduate students, who I have built a significant relationship with, have a lot of faith in me. So, my life since having moved away from home has been devoted to academic pursuits, which have turned into personal and personally fulfilling ones. Now here are the issues; In the short time frame of my undergrad:

* I have made zero significant friends/friendships who I can talk to regularly and about personal struggles and accomplishments, or even just to spend mindless time with whenever I need loosening up. It makes it even harder that my sister, who is only a year younger and is too in university is surrounding my a tremendous amount of friends and people who care so much about her, and she always has people to do things with. I have made many many efforts to socialize, and almost everyone who knows me would tell you I am very high energy and always happy, and very attentive and thoughtful. But I always am the one to reach out, and I am let down far more often than not.
* My family doesnt think I work hard enough, and I have a strong impression my own dad thinks my grad school pursuits are a waste of time and money despite me knowing exactly what I want to do and have already established connections with potential supervisors. My grandpa thinks Im lazy and that I should be going to law school, which I have no desire to do at all. Everyone in my family and even my friends seem to have an opinion of what I want to do and I have minimal support from the people who supposedly care about me. I likely will invite only my mother to my graduation, if I decide to even go to the ceremony because undergrad has just been nothing but sadness and sprouts of me making myself happy through achieving personal milestones (that nobody celebrates despite me wanting to share the moments). My family also neglects me, and I have reached out more than once to make things easier for a relationship to grow but I get emotionally hurt and insulted every single time. I cherish the people in my life and I express it openly, and I feel so strongly that these people do not cherish me back.
* I am 20, and I am being diagnosed with my third autoimmune disease. To reverse the first two I changed my diet in the most drastic way (zero carb) and regained my health. Now, despite the diet and exercising every day and sleeping more than adequately, I have hypothyroidism. So these drastic and constricting lifestyle changes (which were worth it), are no longer enough. I think the intense stress I experience is making my health problems worse.
* Because of the health problems, despite consistent diet and exercise, I have gone from being shredded my entire life to gaining 20 pounds and there is nothing I can do but wait for my endocrinologist appointment (months away) to figure out a solution so I can get back to my setpoint and solve all of my hormonal abnormalities. But it is HARD. My appearance, which to some extent does matter to me because of how diligent I am with my lifestyle (always have been), changed so fast, and its hard to take in that this is what I look like despite working so hard and there is nothing I can do about it right now. For those who have hypo and are not yet on medication, they know that over-exercising and undereating still does not lead to weight loss. I can confirm this because I have tried it for a whole four months.
* In spring 2019 I was in a sexually abusive relationship for three months, and I didn't open up about it until two months after I ended it completely. In this relationship my ex boyfriend gaslit me, forced me to do sexual things despite me having zero experience and now all of these 'acts of love' are ruined for me because I feel so used and disgusted and sad. I was taken advantage of but he doesn't think he is wrong. He still calls me a prude to his friends. My own dad blamed me, and I had no friends to turn to, and my sister did nothing to console me or to make me feel better. She blamed me for being with him. To this day I am traumatized and my self-confidence in interpersonal relationships that are more personal have plummeted. I feel so inadequate and like Im too much for people.
* I've learned that people don't care about my passion for my ambitions and the work that I do. People I interact with make me feel bad about myself because of my lack of sexual experience, or because I'm 'too uptight' with my lifestyle, or because I'm not as fun, or for whatever other reason. I feel like my worth to all of these people is little.
* I am burnt out, and nobody seems to care. This summer, the first summer I will have off since highschool (since I take full time course load in summer in university), I wanted to take one month to travel somewhere inexpensive and to chill out before going back to grad school, which will be intensive. Every family member told me I was being lazy and that I should be 'working towards my future', so no more break, and I am getting a four month internship. I know that whatever work I do I get immersed in, so I won't hate it and will likely really like it, but I will be further burnt out and have no support from any friends or family to lessen this inner conflict, stress, and restlessness I have been experiencing, and which only continues to grow.
* Nobody in my life sympathizes with me. People don't even listen or at least try to understand.
* I just feel so uncared for, so undervalued, and so unloved by the people in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

There are more things, but I will end the list there. I went to go see a counselor, but that nothing for me at all. I can't just cut people out of my life because then I will be completely alone, and I could not live with ignoring people or being passive-aggressive or distant. I just can't live with that because I care and in the end I would want to go out of my way o fix things. I tried taking up a new hobby, and I get super immersed in the moment. But in the day I still get really sad and all of my original problems still exist and they hit me because they actually affect me often.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has experienced super low lows in their lives (which I am sure many of you have) and can understand my situation based on what Ive shared, please please give me some advice and offer suggestions on how I can try and make things better. I feel so conflicted."

I'm asking for a friend. My friend recently graduated (second bachelors) from Computer Science. He did his degree remotely in the states, and was also physically away from Canada so he didn't do any internship. He is Canadian and speaks fluent English.

It's been almost 5 months since he graduated and he's having a ton of trouble finding a job as a software developer. He's probably applied to over 200 jobs, but probably got less than 10 email replies, with only 2 or 3 of them proceeding to an on site interview.

Fellow Toronto people that are in the field right now, how do you guys decide to contact a candidate? I can understand if he fails an actual technical test, but he's not even getting calls. We've been joking he's probably cursed, but jokes aside it's getting pretty depressing... any insight / suggestion appreciated."

Arnold Jenkins was an accountant for Benton enterprises, and had been for years. He worked directly with Edmond Benton, the 72 year old founder and owner. The man refused to retire, and showed no signs of slowing down.

When Arnold’s daughter Hannah graduated college, he begged her to take an internship at the company, insisting it was a great opportunity.

“Dad!” She argued, “I don’t work for that Pervy old man! Everytime we have dinner at his house he tells me how ‘ripe’ my body is getting, saying I look like a younger sexier mom.”

“Sweetie, I know it’s difficult but that’s part of life for women in business. I’m sorry, but it won’t get easier. His recommendation will go along way to get you ahead of that stuff. Please consider it?”

“Ugh, fine. I’ll consider it.”


She did consider it, and with prospects slimming, she took the secretary job to just “grin and bear it”, as her father always  advised. Arnold didn’t see her in the office at all really, but he was assured she was doing a great job. In fact, the company set her up with an apartment in a nice part of town, nicer than Where the Jenkins family lived. After 6 months, mr. Benton invited Arnold to the links for a round of golf.

“How does that man get around on the course?” He wondered as he walked along the greens from the car to the golf cart, “I hope I don’t have to let him win..”

As he approached the readied golf cart, he saw a very young, very shapely brunette near the back. Arnold assumed this was their caddy for the day, and he took note of her perfect figure. The woman turned to face the approaching man, wiping the aroused smile off his face.

“HANNAH!? What are you doing here? What are you wearing?”

His daughter flashed a wide, white smile and placed a hand on her hip.

“Jenkins! I’m so glad you could make it. What do you think of my outfit? Too much for an old man?”

Mind reeling, Jenkins stumbled back..

“What..? Mr Benton? How?”

“Jenkins, my good man! You didn’t really think I could play golf in my old body, did you? Of course I’d take Hannah’s body today, even though it’s not my usual time.”

“Usual time?”

“Why yes! Why do you think I pay her so much? We swap bodies a few hours a day most days of the week. It keeps my mind and perspective fresh, but I have to I admit I usually don’t leave my chambers during our little swaps.”

Benton moved Hannah Jenkins body with such confidence and familiarity that Arnold knew what he was saying was true.

“She’s shaping up to be quite a good golf girl, you should know” Benton continued, “Far better than my last assistant. I’ll admit, I used to hire young men but as you get older you get curious, and curiosity may kill the cat, but satisfaction in your daughter’s body? My dear Jenkins it saved me.”

“This has to stop... please...”

“Stop? Why would I stop? Hannah loves this job. It’s so easy for her. I even let her run a board meeting in my body last week. She’s really good, this is the perfect arrangement. Now get in the cart already.”

“No! I need to talk to my daughter, now!”

“Jenkins, you’re up for a promotion. Don’t be proud now. Get in the cart or I’ll see if Diane from HR is walking around in that little stud suit of hers. She’d be a much better driving partner, I think.”"

Sorry just a disclaimer I'm on my phone and the full story is kinda long, sorry for any typos.


I work in a small engineering firm and I'm a new hire, 3 months in. This is my first real job outside of a 16 month internship where I basically did nothing, so it's my first taste of real work and crazy office politics. There's a lady (38F) on my team here who's had basically a 3 year long feud with our boss, they talk equal shit about each other to me.


Im basically the liaison between sales and engineering departments, so I have to do reporting to the sales dept on how engineering is doing. Stupid me, I didnt know not to name drop. I wanted to report about her struggles in good faith because I consider her a friend and basically want to make engineering dept run smoother and protect our dept, but it ended up being her accusing me of being a liar and backstabber (literally her words) in front of my other coworkers. It really hurt my feelings because I felt attacked, but I know that good intentions dont always have the right result and I think this was one of those situations.


I ended up going to the warehouse in the back and cried to my parents on the phone for probably a total of 1.5h.... right, a very productive use of my work hours. Crying isnt billable time haha... I had to review some quote with my boss and ended up telling him what happened. He consoled me and told me this has happened a lot in the past with her and other workers. I got teary again and he got up and said ""Come here"" and HUGGED ME. And then he KISSED THE SIDE OF MY HEAD. I heard the lip smacking sound. It was a quick peck and kiss but wtf I was so stunned and caught off guard that I didnt refuse the hug and I'm afraid my acceptance or lack of action may have given him some wrong signal that I'm open for this type of relationship with him. I was literally shocked... and I feel disgusting... 


Even the things he said after, ""Treat me like your older brother, I will protect you."" ""Dont cry at your desk, come to my office and close the door to cry"" something just doesn't feel right. My gut is telling me something isnt right but I dont know what to do about it.


I told my mother about this. She said unfortunately it's really common and shes had to quit jobs in the past because things like this have happened. If anything escalates idk what will happen. We basically dont even have HR here because the firm is small and hes been working here for 8 years so I dont want to cause trouble. I dont even know who to talk to about this.


I cant work around him the same way, everything he does or says makes me so uncomfortable and idk if I'm overanalyzing things now but it just feels like the way he acts is suggestive of something unprofessional. My plan is to keep my head down and do my work and create distance with him. 


Maybe he was just trying to be like a fatherly figure? He has young kids, like 8-yos, maybe this is how he treats them??? He lived half his life in Syria, maybe things are different there? I'm trying to come up with excuses to normalize the situation but I really just... cant...... I dont know the intention behind his actions or if this is considered sexual harassment or what because I was too shocked to refuse him I just feel like I handled it really poorly and got myself into this weird situation and I dont know how to take it or who to go to I feel violated and I want to protect myself and not let this go any further. Guys please help am I reading too much into this and what should I do?"
dvmtlj,2,2019-11-13,Long Distance all over again.,goobatooba,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dvmtlj/long_distance_all_over_again/,"My [F21] boyfriend [M21] and I have been dating for two years. When we first started dating we spent about 2 (ish) months together until I went off to college in another state 9 hours away. From the time my freshman year had ended we saw each other maybe 5 times across 8 months. Obviously I understand that is a lot better than what some people deal with. But of course that distance really took a toll on our relationship. 

After that year, I literally go to Europe for 6 weeks for the summer. Thankfully I got to see him for one week. But again, the pattern of seeing each other to not is really hard. 

I then transfer to his school. So for about a year we’re back to being able to see each other whenever.

Then again, I go back to Europe for another 6 weeks for the summer (my parents live there). This time he doesn’t get to visit me. And this time is much harder than the last. 

Since then we see each other all the time, as usual. 

Today, I just learnt that he is going to be out of the country for 6 months (Jan to June). I am honestly kinda freaking out. 


I knew that this ‘move’ could happen but I honestly didn’t think it was gonna happen. I know I am being very selfish since the reason he is leaving is for an internship, but I can’t help to think that this is gonna be the end of our relationship. 

I mean I have four weeks in between not seeing him for Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, or his Birthday.

Again, I know I’m being selfish and but over-dramatic but I just can’t imagine that we will keep a long distance relationship over this. 

TL:DR - bf and i have had a long history of long distance to short distance relationships. now after the longest we’ve been together (same school), he is moving away for 6 months. I feel like this is the end.

So I recently got invited for an interview for a Scientific Aid position at the Water Board and I just had a few questions and seeking some advice. A little about my background, I recently graduated with a BS in Environmental Sciences  with a focus on hydrology and water quality. I have previous intern experiences working under my professors assisting with various projects involving government agencies like the water board, county, etc. which is the extent of my relevant work experience. My original thought is that these experiences would at least make me minimally qualified for ES positions as I did pass the exam with a 90%. However, I've been applying to a ton of ES positions and have heard from only one which encouraged me to keep applying. 

To keep things short, my questions are:

1) Is going the scientific aid route better than trying to take my chances at landing a ES position given my background?

2) If I were to be offered the position, should I take it and gain more experience? (I am just concerned financially wise. I know it would be a short-term struggle hopefully leading to a more financially secure job later down the road after\~1year? But I need a job that can pay the bills $16 is not a lot and I currently make more than that as of now at my current job. Also from my understanding, Scientific Aids do not receive benefits?) -- one of my bigger concerns

3) Is it possible that they may offer me wage equal to or more based on my experience and current job? Or is the range salary set in stone?

4) Any tips or advice for preparing for the interview? Is it mostly technical questions or general interview questions? (I know I should review and understand the Duty Statement at the very least)"

First off, are MS IS students allowed to do an internship? As I understand it, students wishing to do an internship during the program must register for ""CSCI-GA. 3870 INTERNSHIP IN COMPUTER SCIENCE"" course. Given the title of the course, I am not sure if students pursuing MS IS are allowed to register for said course and if they are not, then they can't intern correct?

I understand that two semesters worth of full-time study must be completed before an internship is to begin (NYU mandate) but my question is, can an internship be taken during Spring or Fall semesters while also taking regular courses at the university?

Since I will be joining in Spring 2020, the earliest I can start an internship is Fall 2020 and that is if I am able to take three courses during the summer. If it is not possible to take courses in the summer (I hope it is!), then I cannot intern before Spring 2021.

Please advise."

I've been a subscriber of this subreddit for a while, and tried some of the budgeting sheets that were shared here, but there don't really work well for me, and find myself just winging it weeks later.  Also apps like Mint and  YNAB are for US and Canada. I'm In Nigeria so I can't really use them.  
&amp;nbsp;

My main question are:

* how would I go about creating a budget that actually suits me, and ways to stick to it? 
* how can I realistically budget for costly expenses (Like say, a new PC) That would literally take me over a year to buy even by saving 10% Monthly)?
* how should factor in expenses that only occur once in a while (clothes and the like) into a budget?
* What absolutely must be in a budget, and not be compromised?
* What can I do to make sure I do not compromise the absolutes?
* How can I realistically track my spending's, so as to know areas to focus on.

What Pretty much clawed my *savings* was having to get 2 new phones in the space of 5 months, after the other ones were stolen.

The Only Debt I owe is the money I borrowed from my brother's cash I'm keeping, so as to buy a device that I had been wanting, and found it on a sale. 

This is about half my salary, which I'm planning to pay back on my next paycheck (is this a good Idea?), I've always not liked the feeling of owing people.

To put into perspective, all this is for a monthly salary of **$176.4000 USD** when converted from my local currency.
 
I currently Live with my sister, so for the moment, I don't have to worry about an accommodation but is something I should, as she'll be relocating sometime next year.

I'm currently working on a career change in Art so I could do some freelancing gigs or make some passive income on the side, but, I'm still developing those skills to where I feel confident using them for a client.  
&amp;nbsp;

I would really appreciate your thoughts, as I really want to break this cycle. I've been listening to self help Audio books and podcasts on career and skill development which have been great help, but I realize, I'm still not very good with money.

dvteyc,5,2019-11-13,Will starting off in industry negatively affect your career growth?,LOUsername97,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/dvteyc/will_starting_off_in_industry_negatively_affect/,"Hi everyone!

I am a Senior about to finish my Bachelor's in May. I already have well over the 150 credits needed to get the CPA certification and plan on starting the exams in June or July.

I am currently working as an accounting intern in a publicly traded corporation about 10 min from my house. However, I found out recently that I will no longer be allowed to intern for them in a few months since all employees they've kept for a year or more are legally entitled to benefits. For this reason, they have offered me a part-time/permanent position that will allow me to work part-time as soon as my internship contract expires and will automatically be converted to full-time after graduation. The pay is ***very*** good, and would allow me to continue to build experience while in school as well as accrue benefits. They have also offered to pay for my CPA exams and CPE courses afterwards. Busy times would mean like a 50 hour work week.

I also have an offer from a larger mid-tier public accounting firm in the city. The pay is slightly lower and non-negotiable. Work-life balance is said to be manageable, but expectedly hectic during busy season. They offer the standard CPA/CPE reimbursements that all large CPA firms offer as well as bonus incentives for passing the exams within a certain time frame. If I take this offer, I will be unemployed for the Spring semester as well as a few months in the Summer (maybe even Fall), since this position offers a later start date.

My dilemma right now is I don't know which offer to take. While the industry job is calling my name because of the price tag that comes with it, my worry is that I won't get the career advancement I want. A lot of senior/manager level jobs, even in industry, list 3-5 years public accounting experience as required, and if I start there, I worry that, should something happen to me that would require me to leave the company, I will not be able to have another job. I am not sure if this is a valid concern since I do plan on getting my CPA regardless where I go.

My question is, is it absolutely necessary to have public accounting experience? And if so, would it be too late for me if I want to start in industry and build this public experience later?

Thank you!"

Space-submarines move under space.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/dt6p4o/wp_spaceships_move_through_space_spacesubmarines/)

&amp;nbsp;

Humanity is full of ideas that seemed good in their time, only to reveal their true evils at a later date. Leaded gasoline, the Titanic, the Woopee Cushion - all had their moments at the top of the world, however briefly, before their true natures were known. 

And as they say, history repeats itself. So, when humanity first discovered the realm beneath the waves of space, they saw it as nothing other than a convenience. A new, faster way to explore and expand - among the stars man would now truly thrive! Little thought was given to the possibility that something or someone had beaten them to their discovery and was potentially waiting in its unknown depths.

Upon the discovery, government contracts were quickly signed and ships were hastily created that could ferry man through this new realm of possibility. The one truly surprising benefit, and one that nobody appreciated, was the world's uniting in order to best effectively take advantage of this new form of travel. The UWSS' - United World Space Submersible - fleet was the first truly joint-global initiative. But it was only so because everyone knew its truly potential for making the next elusive dollar. Humanity was no stronger for it, and in fact was blinded in their greed. Perhaps a little more awareness, a little more self control, would have spared them from their fate.

The UWSS Constantinople was the 8th ship launched from Earth, sent on a scouting mission to the Andromeda galaxy, to find a potential off-world base for the humans. The mission would only take a week of man's time due to the nature of the realm through which they were travelling, and the first few days went smooth as could be. Surrounded by complete and utter darkness, it isn't as though there was much to get distracted by, anyway. 

Of course, when a light *does* impossibly appear, it only makes sense why such a craft would find the distraction tantalizing. All that ran through the mind of the ship's captain was that this could be a means that led to the end of his own glory. *The next impossible discovery - and it could be mine!* he thought. And so, with the detour only expected to add a day or two to their journey, and with plenty of fuel to spare, they made their way to the source of the light.

""Is it some kind of star?"" some of the crew would wonder aloud to each other. ""No, some kind of quantum fluke, I bet,"" said others still. One young crew member who was hardly anything more than an intern offered an alternative theory. ""What if it's alien?"" The others laughed at this poor soul for being so foolish. The majority of the crew saw themselves in the same way humanity did upon their initial finding - as pioneers. The first. The best. The only. 

As the ship grew near their goal, the source of the light could be seen a bit more clearly. A think bluish-green line, with a dark spot in the middle. Nobody knew quite what to make of it. It reminded some of a black hole shooting jets of matter from either end, but others persisted that such a thing could not exist here. Hours passed and the discussion continued, until it became clear as to what they were dealing with.

It was soon noted that the light source was getting bigger, but not because they were drawing closer. It's margins had grown both up and down. Fear began to take hold of the crew as they pressed forward, as it was clear that it was now responding to their presence. Rumors began to spread aboard the ship, until they finally reached the ears of the young intern, who made his way to the bridge to see the light on the main screen.

Loud discussions were underway when he finally arrived. ""We should turn around!"" someone shouted. ""No!"" the captain rang out. ""If we're in danger, it's already too late!"" He may have been right, of course, but it was his hubris and greed speaking rather than his brain. These conversations were of little importance to the intern who was at first mesmerized by the sight on the screen. He had never seen anything so beautiful, he was sure. But that appreciation and beauty quickly turned to horror, as he remembered his theory about what it was, and the pieces began falling into place.

""It's an eye.""

It first came as a whisper, with only those close to him able to hear, but it was enough to grab their attention. ""What did you say?"" one of the officers yelled, which quieted the majority of the bridge.

""It's something opening it's eye,"" he offered once more.

In silence all eyes turned to the screen, and the image now became clear. Some kind of bio-luminescent creature was out there. Like a moth to a flame they had been drawn in, and the realization now set in among them all.

""We're dead..."" the captain said under his breath.

Almost as if on cue, the creature shot out several tentacles that wrapped around the ship, beginning to stress it to the point of total failure. Panicked screams rang out from every mouth aboard the ship, except that of the intern. He simply gazed at the large, beautiful eye in wonder. Death was assured, but what a magnificent death it was - killed by a creature so far beyond understanding, yet real. 

The creature slowly wrestled its meal into submission, but it could tell it was being thoughtfully watched. It peered into the ship, and saw one calm body among the distressed panic. In an unknown tongue but with a sentiment that still came across clearly, the creature and the intern shared a moment. ""I'm sorry,"" the creature said, or rather implied. 

""It's okay. You were here first.""

The creature closed its eye as it strained its tentacles, and the ship ruptured into a million little fragments. In all the panic and terror, they were able to get a final message through - the last that would ever leave or enter this strange realm below space. 

""Beware the Kraken."""

Black women have been at the forefront of advocating for progressive platforms this election season. Let’s honor their work and commitment to equality by becoming aware of the racism that exists in feminist spaces

I had the fortune to attend the March for Black Women on September 29th. I went with a crowd of Black women, men, and allies from my college campus, holding up cheeky handmade signs and trying desperately not to get lost. This journey was a few miles walking and being greeted by a small sea of Black women felt refreshing as if we stumbled upon a long-awaited oasis. We seamlessly joined the crowd with smiles, feeling reinvigorated and ready to march. The gathering was microscopic compared to the Women’s March of 2017 but there was a shared energy that buzzed between us. The raw emotion in hearing Black women reveal their most painful stories to a crowd of strangers turned sisters-in-arms was palpable. Their voices offered solace for the burdens my classmates and I carry as Black women in this country. It was beautiful despite running on CP time.

In my group of fellow student activists, there was a noticeable shift in mood as Eleanor Smeal, a representative from the Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF), came on stage. There were looks of confusion then immediate disinterest as this white woman took the microphone. Who was this woman? Why should we care about what she has to say? I was the only one familiar with the name as I went to an FMF conference a few years ago. It was unsurprising to see FMF, a feminist organization supposedly at the forefront of women’s issues, be met with such apathy from a group of Black feminists. This disconnection between Black women and predominantly white feminist organizations(PWFO) is not just present in my classmates but something that is seen across the country.

A few days prior to the march I was selected to speak on a panel with other Black women engaged in community service and social justice. We all complained about White feminism and its inability to consider women like us. White feminism does not mean any and all white women engaging in feminism but rather refers to a prevailing understanding of feminism that centers whiteness and works to reinforce racial hierarchies. White feminism is an offshoot of white supremacy that needs to be challenged and dismantled if we want to achieve women’s liberation for all instead of for some.

Black women face similar issues in Black liberation circles as Black men look to reinforce patriarchal structures that would continue to oppress Black women. Kimberlé W. Crenshaw’s framework of intersectionality gives voice to this issue: Black women cannot separate their womanhood from their Blackness or vice versa. Because of this, they face a doubled oppression that is created at the nexus of these identities. Black feminists from Alice Walker to Sojourner Truth have been acutely aware of these issues that have persisted for centuries. The March for Black women is important to me because each year I am reminded, very starkly, how Black women are excluded from movements, whether the feminist movement or anti-racist struggles. Our seat at the table is precarious, marginalized, and conditional.

As a proud NOW intern, I walk a line between PWFOs and Black women’s justice organizing. As I move through predominately white spaces on campus, in feminist organizing, and in social justice in general, I am confronted with a reality that looks different from some of my white friends and colleagues. As white feminists paint the old white men in Congress as their biggest enemy, my own experiences interacting with liberal white women have proven to the contrary. It was the white feminists who called me aggressive, rude, and ignorant. It was the white feminists who donned blackface masks at J20 to protest Trump with racist mammy figures. It was the progressive white women who constantly demanded I choose between my race and my gender, demanded a silent obedient ally to their agenda. The old white man in Congress works hard to silence me politically, the faux-ally white feminist works harder to silence me socially.

I was also told I bring up race too frequently or spoke up against their ignorance too often. These experiences of disrespect are mirrored in my classmates who are also familiar with racism from women who call themselves allies. Their instant distrust of the Smeal and of PWFO has nothing to do with Smeal personally or specifically the FMF, but rather their experiences of being sidelined within feminism movements. Smeal speaking at the March wasn’t the issue, FMF participating in the march isn’t a problem. The issue was that even in spaces for us, white women have a voice.

Black women are perfectly comfortable creating spaces that are for, about, and center us, but suffer from a lack of resources and funding. Despite these challenges organizations like the National Council of Negro Women founded by suffragist Mary Mcleod Bethune have been supporting Black communities for decades. I believe that if PWFOs want to engage girls like my classmates, who have a clear passion for feminism and equal rights, they need to reckon with their personal role in painful histories and the real, active racism within this country and in their organizations today. Reconciling and facing these truths is the first step to building better bridges that engage Black women.

i'd go up in the early of the morning because school was too far away(we have a ranking system and my rank was good and my family did not want to waste it in neighbourhood highschool so i signed up for a better but a far one) and after school there was no one to talk to. 

do not want to get in the details but when i was 11 my doctor told me its because of the things i've been through and etcetc, she said ""you matured early"". it was not the answer i was looking for.

my classmates were ok i deleted this part over and over again and im thinking again, they were bunch of idiots. none of them can not even get to the college and ended up sitting home doing nothing(you really have to work hard to go college in my counntry. maybe im mad because i worked after the school in 2 jobs so... sorry for outlashing.

conclusion: was not in the same frequency with literally no one.

and im looking back again. seeing nothing from my past, seeing that abyss, letting it overtaking me, not killing me but making me wish i was.

and i still am, hanging out with myself. going cinema, eating with myself.

its been so long since i talked to somebody like i forgot how to do small talk or ask someone to ""how was your day"" and when i tried to do it looks awkward.

and i am angry to myself because of that, i guess.

last year i started to run because of a long and a really bad day.

after 5  months, i was doing 400mt for 55-65sec. then signed for the gym in my campus. going there just to do some deadlift and squats since they are the only things i can smash on the floor and no one says that after a lift.

now im running and going to the gym 3times a week. just to get some steam off.

and the thing is nothing changed. 

when i was kinda young (i know i still am, u get the point) i thought it will al be gone if i worked hard and open my way to somewhere else someplace new and having a new start.

but it is not happening. i learned coding, got a intern job, lost 40 pounds, always read some books, trading with cryptos...

 i never thought i'd be the guy to do those ""things"". and yet i still have that abyss crawling through my spine.

i can't sleep very vell lately, do not know why. im waking up in the middle of the night and im sweating like hell.

whenever i try to talk myself it just go down to ""you're nothing"", ""if you were you'd be doing something"", ""you have no one to call"" ""no one to say hi to""  ""your being does not even matter"".

and end of the day. after that hellish sleep i am having.

it all start over and over again.

dvvh5o,17,2019-11-13,I think Jason has quietly taken over the back office,Carriepants931,howardstern,https://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/dvvh5o/i_think_jason_has_quietly_taken_over_the_back/,"This weasel went from lowly intern to what I think is probably the most influential figure in the back office. 

He has a few modes of influencing.

With Howard directly- Howard respects Jason's opinion. He will let Jason on the air to give his opinion on things and Howard treats it with an aura of competency and respect unlike say Richard, Sal or even Memet. 

Through Gary- Gary respects Jason but Jason clearly doesn't respect Gary. This was outlined by a short on air argument they had a few months ago where Jason totally challenged Gary's authority and Gary had nothing. It was shocking really. I remember the quote from Jason to Gary ""Do you really want to go down this road?"". Imagine ever saying that to your boss. On the other side Gary is almost always team Jason when it comes to supporting office opinions. Gary helps empower Jason. Does Jason help empower Gary?

Through spreading rumors- He's the ultimate fucking weasel. There are countless situation where he's spread rumors that have caused major discord. This shows further control of the atmosphere from this guy that used to be just a lowly intern. 

Through Brent and other producers- I suspect a lot of the content coming from them has Jason involved in some way because I know Jason and Brent are really close and most the content aligns with their political beliefs. 

I suspect Jason is the most influential person backstage currently at the Stern Show because of all this."

dvwv37,115,2019-11-13,They don't want to get to know us - that would be far too normal!,[deleted],JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dvwv37/they_dont_want_to_get_to_know_us_that_would_be/,"Jumping right in! The flair says ""no advice wanted"" because DH and I are on the same page with things (even the more serious issues that are currently happening but not mentioned in this specific post). That being said, it's fine if someone gives it anyways.

I'm just barely 5'0 and have no hips - just stating this for context. For the first three years of dating DH, I got shirts and cardigans from MIL, who loves to bestow full wardrobes as Christmas gifts. Gratefully, I wore them to internships and work and thought MIL was very generous and thoughtful. Then, on our first Christmas as a married couple (two months after tying the knot), I received many Talbots blazer jackets and pants in sizes 8 &amp; 10. Given my height, the blazers blazed down past my knees. She'd never had trouble the years prior, but suddenly I needed to let her know so that ""she knows for next time."" It's been like that since.

My parents brought us up Jewish (Reform). My brothers and I had the Bar/Bat Mitzvot celebrations at 13, but after that none of us continued to pursue religious studies and none of us consider ourselves religious. My parents can't read or speak any Hebrew; my mom didn't have a Bat Mitzvah and my dad converted when he married my mom. Neither of them have pushed us to be religious in our adulthood. They usually have combined holiday festivities because my two SIL's and other various aunts and uncles are other religions. So, no one in my immediate family is overly religious. But with DH's parents and family, my being Jewish comes up regularly. At their annual Easter gathering, one of MIL's siblings always grilled me about Passover. DH's grandparents have made thoughtful custom cards for the holidays - DH gets a Christmas one; I get a Hanukkah one. MIL will still add a piece of paper to the Christmas card they send us to single out Hanukkah for me. This past Easter she asked DH if we did anything and specifically asked (stumbling to say the right word) if I made matzo balls or if we had matzo. She has texted me Hebrew before (e.g., an attempted variation of ""L'Shanah Tova"" for the Jewish New Year). When she and FIL visited this summer, she said she didn't see any Catholic churches in the area (FYI, DH hasn't considered himself Catholic since he was in middle school), then said she also had looked for ""temples"" for me. How thoughtful. A couple years back we were talking about military topics (DH was in the military), and FIL pulled the ""no offense to you, reflectb4yousnack"" when discussing soldiers' animosity toward ""sharing foxholes with *a Jew* back in the day."" It doesn't matter how many times we politely explained that I'm not religious.

And so we continue; what's in a name? Somehow, someone on MIL's side gets something with my name wrong each year. As MIL always likes to be the gatekeeper, and her parents and siblings run to her for info about DH and myself, I have to wonder what she tells everyone (we've found that she'll tell different things to different people), and why it seems like they take turns misspelling my name year after year. I've seen at least three or four different spellings of my name, with one being flat-out *another* name that's a bit similar. Just this year, after I made and sent a personalized gift for DH's grandparents (MIL's parents) for their birthdays, they sent us a thank-you card with my name spelled wrong. Last Christmas, one of MIL's sisters shipped us a package to DH's first and last name, and separately, to my first and maiden name. There's no way she would have remembered my maiden name after five years of being married, much less get the spelling of it right because my maiden name is even more unusual than my apparently impossible first name.

I've gotten a large artist sketch pad when IL's were convinced I was a budding artist - FTR, I gave zero reason for that. She signed me up to receive a 15-month subscription of *In Style* (without telling me, so I had no clue for a while as to why I randomly started getting them) because, in her words, she wanted me to get ideas and inspiration (it's true that I'm 0% about fashion; alas, that's who I am). Even the ""Cheap Thrills"" section in that magazine made my jaw drop to the floor. Oh, and it wasn't until she found out I *don't* wear cosmetics that - you bet - I now get cosmetics from her every year.

I obviously could go on forever, but the cherry on top? They've now been saying it would be nice for us all to ""talk and get to know each other"" (regarding calls and visits) - with MIL going as far as to pitch a fit that I don't sit in on their phone calls to DH anymore (so that means I'm ""mad at them"") and they want to ""get to know me."" **I guess ELEVEN YEARS hasn't been enough time to try that out.**

MIL, enabler/mouthpiece FIL, and her family are sleeping under rocks when it comes to knowing me, but the rocks are quite GREY these days due to our efforts."

So, I'm a 29 year old Portuguese Doctor, I've been working for 2 years as a E.R. General practicioner in Portugal, I didn't choose to enter a speciality for various reasons, including but not only the lack of assistence and work schedules as an intern in Portugal. 
So 2 years ago me and my girlfriend, also a doctor, decided that we would try to do our speciality in another country and we picked switzerland.

I know How to speak portuguese, english and spanish. And I currently have a b1 in french which this december Will upgrade to b2 ( the minimum requirement), my gf already has b2 she was better at french than me. So she managed to get her papers before i did!

Last week she had an invitation to go to an hospital which she Will accept.

The thing is that I am not currently prolific enough in french to pass an interview. So my idea is that I go with her, and try to get a job in something like Starbucks or anything of the sort

Could you give me any Advice of how should i do it? What do i have to do in order to search for a job and get papers ready? How much time can I spend there without a visa, etc. 
My idea is to improve my french and afterwards get a job in either an hospital or in the pharmaceutical companies.

Thank you very much for your time. 

Any help would be great."
dvxgt1,5,2019-11-13,Trying to use my jungian shadow and persona to narrow down my mbti type. Most focus is on the shadow.,onyxx8,MbtiTypeMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/dvxgt1/trying_to_use_my_jungian_shadow_and_persona_to/,"What type range would you put me in the range of based on my jungian shadow behavior. I think this may reveal inferior functions. The list of bad habbits and behavior I'm embarrassed of:

\- Binge eating :I'm still in shape but it's really bad and I feel extremely bloated and uncomfortable

\- Elitism: My family is wealthy and I feel subjective pride but never want to share it with people but sometimes it slips out and I feel like a horrible person. It won't be any definite form of bragging, but it might be something like. ""Yeah my dad's lawyer can drive us up he's great."" I want to emphasize that this elitist behavior is the limit of my conscious philosophical take on the notion. I recognize that I am not better than anybody. I feel less competent than most people.

Elitism Pt II: I have a bad habbit of being very verbose and pretentious and I try to constantly make power moves in conversation to show that I'm smarter than other people. It's often appreciated but it's something I find becomes more present the more I try to repress. It's like I compulsively give advice and am spiritual bypassing and can never catch myself in the moment. I never realize it until after it happens. But I'm aware of it.

\- Bossy/Rational: At work I can be really catatonic and wired and will sort of just direct people like a robot. I'm an intern so it definitely stands out when I do this, and people still listen to me. But it's embarrassing.

\- Materialism: I'm addicted to novelty but try to hide it with a modest mask I try to show the world. I use an expensive card holder but feel guilty every time I pull it out in front of people. When I'm alone it's a nice thing to appreciate. The fine details are satisfying. I really strive for a balance between minimalism and quality in my fashion choice, but I tend to move towards the ladder.

\- Clingy and overly attached to people: I think I've pushed some girls away by being too emotionally intense too early on. I have a bad habbit of treating my friends like therapists.

\- Egotistic pretentious intellectual: this one speaks for itself

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to emphasize that this is shadow behavior.

I think my persona(how I should appear to people, at least how I think people think of me, how I want to be thought of) would be this:

\- sensitive and intellectual. (double edged sword if you read the shadow part)

\-  stoic. Like stereotypically. Think of a super dry and monotoned person that is super long winded with how he talks. I think that's how I appear to people.

\- Perhaps once a day someone (not always the same person) will comment on a smirk I have. I can't control it. They tell me it looks like I'm not paying any attention to what their saying. But that's not true I'm definitely a good listener. I just look disengaged. I have a hard time staying present, but I'm working on it. I still try to give quality responses that are either empathetic or logical. But this can be my boss giving me instructions. For some reason I get an uncontrollable laugh even though I'll go and do exactly what they tell me. It's like life is just funny. idk Maybe this is shadow behavior but I don't really see it as bad.

\- Responsible.

\- insightful

\- Extremely philosophically liberal and a little impulsive and random

\- Conversationally empathetic. Humoristically callous. Very satirical.

I still have a couple years left in college and I have accepted a summer internship with a company that I very much admire but they offer relatively less than  other companies. 
I knew that I was going to accept the first company's offer no matter what, but I can't help feeling that I missed out. 

I realize that this is going to be the same feeling that I get after I commission. After all of my regular college peers go off to work for big corporations and get paid the big bucks, I will go into the Air Force (for 4+ years) getting paid a relatively low salary (compared to similar positions in the private industry). 

I say all this with the best of intentions and no disrespect. During my time in AFROTC I have grown to love the Air Force and there is a reason I'm still in after Field Training and two years. 

With all this said, I am more interested in opinions from the 17X community, but anybody can answer this. What things related to your occupation have kept you satisfied with where you work and have kept you in longer than you expected? 

TL;DR: To 17x: What makes you satisfied about your job and not quit to work in the private industry?"
dvymyk,101,2019-11-13,My Sexy Yoga Class: A Reddit [SUCCESS] Story [mf],DC_Yogi,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/dvymyk/my_sexy_yoga_class_a_reddit_success_story_mf/,"To be honest, when I made my first r4r post about a sexy yoga class, I didn’t think we’d actually do any yoga. Maybe the interested girl would wear some yoga pants, maybe we’d joke around and I’d have her bend over, that’s about it. But I clearly touched on something for Veronica, and she was very intent on playing out the fantasy I had outlined.

You can check my post history, but the r4r post basically advertises that I’m a certified yoga teacher who’s interested in playing out some of the more uncouth ideas I have during class. Veronica messaged me, told me she has a very similar fantasy, and that she’d love to explore it with me. We chatted for a little while, moved to kik, and exchanged pictures. She’s 23, pale skinned, and partially thanks to yoga, has a wonderful, petite body. A flat stomach, cute round ass, and A cup breasts. Long brown hair and this big smile that’s a delight to see, especially when she laughs. She explained that she was finishing her undergrad in DC this fall, and was moving away soon, so she wanted to do something ‘crazy’. That she had never really had the chance to, thanks to her fear of being recognized by someone in one of her classes or at her internship. Of course, I was happy to help.

For the record, I’m 30 years old, 5’10 and athletic, covered in tattoos and body hair. A dense beard, olive skin, short black hair, and brown eyes all thanks to my Italian heritage.

We texted quite a bit over the course of that week, traded cooking pictures, etc. Once we got on the topic of yoga, we didn’t really leave. Turns out, our fantasies were two sides of the same coin. She always feels so vulnerable during a yoga class, having her body in such compromising positions and in such tight clothing, and she’s always wanted some of her teachers to give her the sort of *extra* hands-on assistance that most male instructors shy away from, for obvious reasons. I, on the other hand, would never actually do anything untoward during an actual class, but I frequently daydream about taking advantage of said compromising positions and tight clothing, not to mention the whole teacher/student dynamic. Our conversation got lascivious and we were counting down the days until we could meet.

This past friday, we finally did. We decided to go out first to make sure no one was a serial killer, and had two drinks each. I’ve taught ‘normal’ classes before, but nothing like this, so the alcohol helped the conversation flow and, once we got back to my house, made the porno-esque situation a little easier to handle. Plus, the kiss and the light fondling we shared outside of the bar helped diffuse the situation quite a bit. I led her to my loft on the top floor, and let her choose from a couple mats I have, as well as provided her with a couple blocks and even a blanket. I wasn’t sure how far we would get into the class, but I figured I’d just use one of my go-to sequences and improvise where it felt right. I went to go change into gym shorts from my jeans, and I took off my henley to reveal just a tank top. She pulled off her baggy sweater to reveal a tight light blue tank top with, judging by her already hard nipples, appeared to be no bra. She was wearing a pair of grey yoga pants, too, and to her credit, only blushed slightly as I eye fucked her.

I started it off like any other class, but with my single-pointed focus on her and her alone. I led her through the warm up section and the sun salutations without much physical interaction. I generally don’t provide hands-on assistance, especially with women, because I don’t want to get in trouble or cross a line, but in this case, I just wanted us to get comfortable and maybe build a little desire. Once I guided her into the closed hip section, I amped things up a bit. A couple fingers tracing the strength in her back leg during crescent lunge, my hands straightening her waist in warrior one. I began slowing down the connective sequence of plank to up dog to down dog, standing behind her for most of it. She knew I was staring at her ass and did her best to give me a show, swaying a little bit, sticking it out more than necessary. In downward dog, I ran my palm over her ass and, despite her best efforts to keep her breathing steady, could hear her gasp. I had her remain there as I squeezed it and traced my fingers between her legs over the warmth of her pussy. She muttered, “Fuck,” but I wanted to tease her more. I had her go through the other side of the closed hip sequence, cupping her breasts when I could, tracing the waistline of her yoga pants as she began to wobble a bit. During mountain, I stood behind her and pressed my body into hers so she could feel my bulge on her ass. She smelled a little sweaty, but I love that natural, musky scent of a woman. I wrapped my arms around her and kissed the side of her neck, and she shivered. She turned around and kissed me, placing one hand on my chest and stroking my chest hair above the hem of my tank. I suggested that we go to my room, and she agreed. 

We left everything set up in the loft as she followed down the stairs in a hurry. I closed the door behind her and kissed her again. I could feel a ferocity in her as she pulled up my shirt, and saw it in her eyes as she ran her hands through the hair on my chest. I helped her out of her shirt and eased her back onto the bed as my mouth attacked her breasts. Her nipples were big erasers between my lips and she moaned as she gripped my head by the hair. I kissed my way up her clavicle and her neck, and she grabbed my ass and grinded herself into me as her tongue explored mine. I repositioned so I could slide a hand between her legs, first over her damp thong. She cursed some more and bit my lip, driving her hips upwards to meet my fingers. I made my way down her body and felt the way her abs clenched against my mouth. I peeled her pants and her thong off in one fell swoop, admiring her toned legs as I kissed her calves. My eyes drifted to her pussy, all bare but for a dark brown landing strip. I left a trail of saliva along her inner thigh and eventually parked my head above her pussy, breathing on it and letting her squirm. God I love that smell.

I kissed around it, probing her smooth lips with my tongue and wrapping my arms around her thighs. She squeezed my hands with hers as I delved into her slick folds, finally getting to taste her. I moaned and slid my tongue in as far as it could go, my nose pressing against her clit. I explored with different speeds, focusing my tongue on different areas around her clit, until I found a combination that made her eyes roll back in her head. Wresting one of my hands away, I traced her slit and pushed a finger in. Then another. She put a hand over her mouth and cursed again as I added a third and found her g spot. Her hips began writhing, trying to get my fingers in just the right spot, but I held off. I let her dictate the movements while I doubled down on her clit. My tongue thrashed against it and she grabbed a pillow to put over her face. Her abs tensed up and I heard her say she was going to cum, so that’s when I began curling my fingers. She howled into the pillow as I felt her pussy contract, her ass raising from the bed as she gushed down my chin and onto my hand. Her face was contorted in ecstasy as she finally came in a silent scream. I let her down easy, pulling my hand out and grabbing at a condom in my bedside drawer.

She looked up at me with dazed eyes as I rolled the condom on and pushed her knees into her chest. The tip of my cock slid up and down her pussy until I began focusing on her clit. I had intended just to tease her, but she was going wild, so I kept at it until she squirted again, this time taking my cock in her fingers and pulling me inside of her. I was not gentle. I fucked her as hard as I could, my hands on the mattress on either side of her head as I pounded into her again and again. No dirty talk, just wet slapping, panting, and the creaking bed as we looked into each other’s eyes. She was almost sneering at me, as if showing me she could take a pounding and make me cum before she busted again. Fuck, that expression was too hot. I knew I couldn’t maintain if she kept at it. I pulled out and grabbed her by the hips to turn her over onto her hands and knees. Again, no pretense of warming up. We were both ready. I lined it up and slammed home, watching as her hands tightened around a ball of bedding. I had both hands on her ass, using them to balance as I thrusted into her relentlessly. Her head dropped to the mattress and her eyes were squinted with intensity as she came again. I pulled out and reached around to rub her clit, feeling her juices all over my fingers. “Fuck I need to ride you,” she panted, and she unsteadily moved to the side to repostion.

I laid down in the wet spot as she climbed on, lowering herself onto my dick. She moved back and forth at first, grinding her clit against my pubic bone and placing her hands on the headboard behind me. I had my hands on her hips and matched her movements until she switched up. She began going up and down, sliding over nearly my entire length, and I knew I was done for. I simply relaxed and let the orgasm wash over me as I emptied into the condom. She slammed home one last time and swiveled her hips, milking me of every last drop. She stayed there for a minute or two, running her hands through my chest hair and playing with one of my nipples as I looked up at her with a glazed grin. She eventually got off of me, cuddled up to me under a sheet and we watched some Netflix before she had to go. 

Hopefully, we get to meet up again before she moves. If not, good luck with grad school!"

dvz6dx,0,2019-11-13,Please Review My Plan To Move To SF And Find Work As A Software Engineer,highlypaid,sanfrancisco,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/dvz6dx/please_review_my_plan_to_move_to_sf_and_find_work/,"Hi all,

I have wanted to move to SF for a long time, and my lease recently expired in Miami. Right now I'm just chilling in Mexico City and about to head out to my next destination, which I'm thinking will be SF. I start grad school with Georgia Tech's OMSCS in January as well. I'd be grateful to hear any input on your opinions of this plan, and how I could improve it.

I'd also like to preface this by saying that I have lived in Miami well under the poverty line for 7 years, most years making roughly 25k, and always living paycheck to paycheck. For most of my time in Miami I spent 50-70% of my income on rent.

I graduated with my BS in CS almost a year ago and professionally don't have much experience besides a 4-month long internship working as a Python dev for a shit ""fintech"" startup. Florida's job market has not treated me well in terms of my field. I have enough savings to survive two months frugally in SF or probably Oakland. My short term goal is to get any work, like gig economy stuff and amazon warehouse as soon as I get there. I will do anything to make some income as long as it doesn't endanger my health. My medium term goal is to immediately start applying to lots of positions for software engineers with the goal of being employed within two months. Going back to Miami and getting a 50k/year dev job is \*not\* something that interests me, and Florida in general is not something that interests me. I was only there so long because of in-state tuition.

When I arrive in SF, I plan on networking heavily and going to meetups/events as well. Looking for any advice on the feasibility or non-feasibility of this plan, and how it could be improved.

TL;DR: I don't have a job or place to stay right now but I have enough savings for two months. I feel like I literally have nothing to lose. How doable is it to quickly find work as an entry level software engineer in SF with a CS degree but not much experience?"
dvzp0g,9,2019-11-13,What is a young journalist to do if he can't find an internship?,kaylim2601,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/dvzp0g/what_is_a_young_journalist_to_do_if_he_cant_find/,"One of the things that has been beaten into my head since I went back to school is how important internships are.  

Taking that advice to heart, I applied practically everywhere. I even managed to get two interviews with a major company that I was ultimately turned down for. 

However I am about to enter into my final semester of college and have found nothing. I feel a bit depressed about this because on paper I've done everything right. I've written and photographed for campus publications. I became the news section editor at the campus paper.  I've freelanced for a huge variety of publications some local, some not. Ive had footage published on a local television's primetime slot. I've networked with other journalists and reached out to folks about jobs an such.

I hope this doesn't sound overly bitter but I've watched my fellow classmates, many of whom are younger and much less experienced then I, get these great internships which makes me wonder what is wrong with me and what am I doing wrong?

I have such a strong passion for journalism. One of my heroes is Marie Colvin, the great war correspondent. I'm hoping one day to report about international human rights because I think that is where journalists are most needed. I just really hope that my goals aren't dead on arrival. 

Sorry this is mostly a cathartic post but if anybody has any advice I'll gladly take it."
dw00qn,9,2019-11-13,In 2012 my middle school found out i was watching really bad porn and some people who knew could call me out and ruin my life.,Sanctuary710,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/dw00qn/in_2012_my_middle_school_found_out_i_was_watching/," 

As you can see from the title, this is a pretty serious struggle and worry ive had for years. I'm not the best at organizing ideas and conveying emotions through my writing so i guess i'll explain what happened chronologically first and then move to today.

I've always been a quiet person. In my younger years, I had a friend in elementary school. He was the only friend I ever had. This friendship would continue until middle school. I moved into the same neighborhood as my friend and would be starting middle school from this new home. Into the second semester of school when I was around 12 I started acting on my sexual feelings by going online. I discovered porn. I don't know or remember how but eventually i came across beastiality. I really regret finding it today. The new school year would be starting in the fall but my friend and me sort of drifted away.

In October almost 2 months into the new school year a lot would change. Sometime around mid October we were getting back from a field trip. During the bus ride back to school i thought there were people mentioning my name and laughing. In fact the entire day i felt this negativity come from the other students towards me. When i departed the bus my worst fears were reassured. Students were lined up at the windows of the buses laughing and pointing at me as i walked up to the school entrance, the entire grade was laughing. I felt scared and anxious. Talking about it now is getting my heartbeat up. During the next few months people in school would laugh and joke about me. I noticed that everything they said to me whether in class, lunch or PE would be sexual in nature. They would say that I'm a naughty boy or that i liked girls. Eventually I noticed that what they would say to me would be about what i watched the previous night or weekend. I realized that they were laughing at me for the porn i was looking at. I had no idea how they found out at the time but now I suspect it was through wifi or something my friend installed or changed on my computer he asked to use once. To this day I believe once I started veering off of the regular type of porn into the more taboo stuff my friend decided to cut ties with me. It just seems so surreal thinking about it. My entire school found out i was viewing dark and weird stuff such as bestiality and other fetishes. Over time the rumor about me spread and I noticed people around me start acting differently or avoiding me.

The next year there was even one time were my mom and my friends mom planned for us to get back together again. My former friend brought another friend to go with us to a park. In the car ride back home with his mom and mine in the front seat and the three of us in the back he said: ""Don't touch his right hand, he masturbates with that one"". I could not believe he said that, it just hurt so bad afterwards. That he could casually say something about me so vulgar in a car with my parents and his friend made me feel like he really didn't want me. It also confirmed my thoughts that he was the one watching me view porn on my computer. During the rest of middle school i stayed alone. I never told my parents or any staff at school in fear that the people that were picking on me would hate me more and make fun of me more. Towards the end of middle school I started seeing a psychologist from the county that would work with the school system. After meeting with her many times i was diagnosed with a form of autism. I didn't know what it was at the time and it did not make me feel any better. Because of the diagnosis, the next year i would be transferring to a high school with a special program for kids with autism and other disabilities.

I felt a bit of relief after transferring to a high school where I would no longer see or have kids picking on me. In the program the class sizes were smaller and we would have two mainstream elective classes. Nothing much relating to the past happened in HS. Eventually I adjusted to it and the program area would feel like a safe home base of some sorts from the mainstream students I felt anxious about. In high school I was still afraid to talk to people but not like before. I would ask questions more and respond to anything anyone asked of me. I was still afraid to make friends with people because of the guilt of my past I had hanging over me. I started seeing a therapist at a county center. I really wanted to talk to people more and maybe have a friend again. Long story short it never happened but I continued with my life.

In the fall of 2017 i realized i would be ending high school in a year. Upon that realization I realize what happened in my past and what some people know about me. I go into a really deep depression. Everywhere I went the events of the past would replay in my head. It started killing me. Seeing that my graduation was coming up in about 8 months i wanted to get into a hobby that i could study and eventually translate to a future job. I started writing some ideas down and researched some things I liked. But all this would be squashed by my past and the fact that a large amount of people knew what i looked at online. I just grew even more sad. There were nights I couldn't sleep and i just stayed up thinking about everything. November of that year was particularly bad for this stuff. Later that month I would have a horrible experience. I wanted to see justice league and my mom got us tickets. As we got into the theater and sat down some kids in the front row started turning around and looking back. They were looking at me in the eye and pointing and laughing. These were some of the kids from my past. This was too painful. I was uncomfortable during the whole duration of the movie and tried to leave quickly after it ended. My problems just wouldn't leave, literally. I felt like I was living in a nightmare that fall. Everyday my mind would remind me of the past and how now nothing I do matters because there are people out there who know some of the things I looked at and could ruin me if they wanted. My distress continued on into December when i finally decided to tell my mom about what i was going through.

It was a hard process telling my mom of what happened. It came out slowly in the car where I would just break down. There was one night where most of it came out though. I was at the basement she was renting and i told her of what happened in the past. It was very uncomfortable and I remember asking her if i said too much. We decided that I should go see a therapist again to talk about these issues. We found one and I started attending the sessions. Eventually with the help of my mom we talked to my therapist about what happened in middle school. I started attending the sessions alone and i opened up even more to my therapist then I did with my mom. Sharing information such as what i looked at or what people made fun of me for was hard. Overtime i got more comfortable telling him stuff. He said that therapy is non judgmental and he is here to help me. Eventually i told him about what I looked at and we found that my guilt of viewing it was stopping me from doing a lot of things. I told him that when I am at my community college or an internship or just out in the world in general I always have this guilt looming over me subconsciously of the stuff I've viewed online. I feel disgusting and that I'm not good enough to talk to other people. Like i don't deserve them. He said that im a very good to talk to and likable. I still feel guilty though.

Although therapy has helped with how I look at my past and gives me a place to talk about my social issues regarding autism im still in a deep depression that feels like its getting worse after almost 2 years of attending sessions. In a lot of sessions I tell my therapist that I really want to connect with other people online and irl to share some of my interests. One session I opened up to my therapist about one if these interests and he said that it's good to have this hobby and that its a great way to meet people. He complimented me and was really happy for me and while I was happy too for a bit I was still unhappy. I'd like to have a channel or a page and build a hobby off of it but I'm afraid that if I get more involved in this community that someone from my past might see me in it and call me out and think he's doing some kind of justice. My therapists response is usually that people from my past will forget about me and they'll be too busy with their lives to even call me out. Today I still encounter people from my past who used to make fun of me randomly around my county. A lot of times they'll stare and smile at me menacingly and turn their heads robotically as i make my way across an area were at. It just hurts that after all these years they haven't forgotten about me and they still act like their middle school selves around me. I also tried explaining to him that people these days from my generation are very attached to keeping up with internet media and culture and we all sort of have second lives online. Me and my therapist obviously have some disagreements on how likely it is for me to be exposed in the future. I respect his input and advice he's giving me but i feel like he doesn't see the whole picture. The reason I am particularly afraid is that the art and writing i'm interested in involves animals and that anyone from my past could see it and me online one day and draw a line from it to the stuff ive seen online. I am also politically active and want to get involved to bring economic and racial justice to the country but am afraid that if I organize something like a workshop for my preferred candidate I could be found and exposed there. There is just so much stuff going on today that I want to participate in, make memories and be a part of but the stuff people know I've seen online and the risk of being exposed or called out is making my life meaningless when I want to live my life.

I just feel like I don't have the freedom to do anything because im afraid of my past coming up. It also doesn't help that I have existential fears about there being nothing after this life and I may have just ruined or messed up the remaining time here. I don't want my life to be defined by my past. The thought of my entire life being ruined because of something illegal I looked at online is terrifying. I have dreams I want to reach as well generally experience life like a normal person. I'm ready to move on and just want a normal independent young adult life like anyone else. I'm just not sure if the world could forgive me. It feels like a nightmare right now, everyday i wake up and i feel like theres no opportunity or freedom to live my life because if I start to do something like my hobbies or attempt to make friends it could all be torn up by people trying to expose me. I regret everything i have done and wish i never saw any of that stuff online. I feel that what i liked watching is unforgivable. I love animals and would never hurt them. I feel like no one except for my therapist would want to help me and be my friend in this world. I honestly see no way out or hope for a better future for me.

Sorry if this is too long and if some of my writing is confusing. It was really difficult opening up about this and clicking the post button. I am a bit afraid of the replies i might get tbh. Thanks for any thoughts or advice you have on this.

TL;DR: My friend and eventually entire middle school found out i was watching porn in which the acts performed were illegal. I was picked on in school for it and activity from my computer camera and screen were seen by my bullies for years. When high school came I was transferred to a program in another school in the county because of my ASD diagnosis. When my time in HS started nearing its end I realized what happened in my past and how it could affect my future artistic endeavors. I was already pretty sad from being lonely most of my teen years and that realization put me into a depression. Eventually i told my mom and we found a therapist for me to go to. I told my therapist everything after a while and we dug deep into what I was watching and why. After a few months I realized my exact fear and tried to tell my therapist that i'm afraid people from my past could find me online and try to expose me and get me ousted from whichever sub culture/artistic community I'm participating in because of the things I used to see. I see no way out of this and feel like I've ruined my entire future."
dw045k,1,2019-11-13,Is demanding a better break up for me (25F) from my ex(24M) being selfish of me?,popopokers,relationships_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/dw045k/is_demanding_a_better_break_up_for_me_25f_from_my/,"I just really have a hard time sleeping at night due to our break up so please reddit community help me let go.   
In 2018, I met my  second ex in a prestigious graduate school as we were both facing possible expulsion due to low grades. He made it through, I didn't, but for some reason this is the exact time we started seeing each other and falling in love. He asked permission from my first ex (they are mutual friends) to date me, and I know it hurt my second ex to cut that relationship a bit.   


For the next few months, I ended up back in my family's company working to try and have something of my own while he went back to school. I would say it was great, except of course that my ex seemed to miss not just me but companionship from anyone (at a time where most of his friends will have difficulty reciprocating because they're busy as well) so I became worried about his overall psychological wellbeing and whether or not I could actually truly satisfy him. I asked him to do more things and meet more people... and the next school year he decided to become more active in school. I think overall if you ask him our relationship was great for these few 6 months.   


But then by Feb 2019 I decided to enroll in a different graduate degree in a different graduate school. At first this was fine, but for the first time in a year I had the opportunity to be around people who were my age and in the same boat as me. Particularly there was a male friend I made who eventually became my thesis partner due to an interest in the same thesis topic. My ex told me this man liked me romantically, but I figured it was nothing and I truly just wanted a friend. I spent time hanging out with this friend going to another's school library and at first we watched a movie together However, after a few months this man told me he was attracted to me at a point where I could no longer change partners. I reduced time alone with him beyond studies and things, but we continued to talk online and later when this man was going through his own problems, I tried to help him with that.  My ex grew jealous of the fact that I shared many things with this man, even if I reassured him that the things I share with this man is different from the things I share with my ex.  


At the same time my ex is going through the same issue of loneliness, and I'm trying to figure out my career via different internships as well doing well in school. I tried to be the same for my ex, but honestly even without this male friend it was hard that we couldn't see each other physically all the time and that my ex himself was too busy to be present during dates. Also my ex never really talks about his life in general you have to pry it out. He speaks in sentences and paragraphs... versus me that is over communicative. So I guess our online conversations and maybe real life conversations you could say we were truly one sided biased towards me. Although I tried to bring him to speak about his stuff, its hard to relate to a one sentence.  


Cut to 12 months in, I bring up a bit more properly about my feelings of us growing apart and that while the relationship is worth saving, there was a feeling of lack of reciprocity in passion and effort on his part. I ask him to take a break ( I was thinking a week or so ) so that we can both recenter and later see each other in a better light. He agrees, but I panic because I know he reads taking a break as a break up so I ask him to take me back minutes after.   
He broke up with on me a day before our 14th monthsary... But couldn't say why and what happened. He just said he didn't love me anymore and found it hard to see a future together given me exploring dreams that were different... He didn't say what I did wrong, and yes I want him back but also in the last few months he was even more uncommunicative about his schedule and feelings so it was hard. And to move on, I keep thinking he has to talk to me properly. Is closure from a break up talk something Reddit thinks I can get? Can we end up back together?"

I don’t know how to do a proper cross post, but hopefully this doesn’t post again twice over there

I’m listening to Watching Movies With The Sound Off and Swimming and just wanted post about my appreciation of Mac Miller. 

I got introduced to Mac Miller relatively late, my friend showed me Faces when we were freshman in college. Faces really resonated with me and I felt like I could relate on a level because he was rapping about our lifestyle and mindset at the time. Faces is still my favorite Mac Miller album, and is one of my favorite rap albums of all time. 

Fast forward half a decade later to now, and I’ve since dropped out of traditional college, moved to LA, and I’m school for Audio Production. One of the things I appreciate about Mac Miller is in addition to having hella bars, that he played multiple instruments and was deep into mixing and production. Dude was hella talented. 

I just had internship interview on Friday at Conway Recording Studios. We talked about how Mac Miller basically lived there for months on end when making Swimming. I’m listening to Swimming and really hoping I get the internship."

I had two questions for current CS students.

**1.** CS 3354 - Object oriented programming &amp; design. Do you need prior knowledge of java for this course? Would it be good to pick up the language basics during the winter break? I told my advisor that I was looking to do this class next semester, and she was recommending I take it after I've taken computer architecture. Will I be super lost if I don't know java (at ACC, I've taken python, C++, data structures, and currently enrolled in computer organization and design)? I was hoping to work on a resume project for future internships, but I don't want to fall super behind in that class.

**2.** CS 3339 - Computer Architecture. So I guess my current Computer Organization and Machine Language class (ARM architecture) has the transfer equivalency for CS2318, assembly language here. So the advisor was recommending that I do CS3339 asap as it's a foundational prerequisite for higher courses. However, in my ARM class we've barely done anything with assembly language, and we've only glanced at LEGv8, a simple teaching assembly language for ARM. I saw that CS2318 teaches MIPS here at Texas State. Am I screwed? Do I need to re-take assembly class? Is it used for any other classes? I feel like I don't know assembly language at all :/

Thanks!"

So I’m currently in my third year of undergrad as a wildlife ecology student. Throughout the year I have been trying to figure out what I want to do for a future career. I just made the decision to start all of my prevent prerequisites and I still need to find more internships/job shadows with vets. 

Since the summer I have really thought about becoming a wildlife vet. I really enjoy the hands on experience with wildlife and I would really want to continue that throughout my future career. I also love the medical aspect of it and caring for wildlife. 

But I have recently seen an ad for a MS in conservation medicine. It seems really neat but if I’m going to be honest I don’t know a ton about it. I really want to know what would be a better route for me DVM or conservation medicine. 

I love wildlife and want hands on experience with wildlife but I’m having trouble figuring out what’s best for me. Especially since I don’t have lots of vet internships (only one that was during the summer at a wildlife rehabilitation center) So I was wondering if anyone here could help me out?

Is the cost of vet school worth becoming a vet? Since vet school is difficult to get into and finding a wildlife vet job is also difficult would it be better to go the conservation medicine route?"
dw2aap,3,2019-11-13,My (F29) boyfriend (24) will probably break up with me this Sunday. What can I do?,Letguarddown,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dw2aap/my_f29_boyfriend_24_will_probably_break_up_with/,"We have lived the last 3 months together as he got an internship at my city. Before that, we were in long distance relationship of more than one year. We met in person and had sort of summer fling but decided to give long distance relationship a try and it went well! We visited a few times and I felt supported and happy with him. The last 3 months have been also great: I got my first job after graduation and we could finally spend time together. Of course we fought sometimes too like all the couples but it did not seem to break his love for me.

Then he went back to his country, moving to a bigger city (only 2 hours flight to my city) to start his master there, while also working part-time at a company. He is the type of guy who is very ambitious and serious at work and I am attracted to him because of it. I am myself also hardworking and we support each other in realising our goals and dreams. We know long distance would be difficult but we were kind of like: we have survived 1.5 years, so another 1.5 years would be doable before we could close the distance.

In the meantime, I decided to quit my job as it was too stressful. But I got saving and also a plan and did not feel like that fact would stand between us. 2 weeks ago we have decided that I would go to his city for a visit. The visit was not as happy as we planned: everything was super expensive there (top tier European capital), weather was shit, his landlord was nasty to me and I was a little disappointed with the fact that he did not prepare anything for my belated birthday which he promised about. He seemed absent minded the whope time, not especially engaged in our city dates which made me sad and nervous. We got into some fights but it did not seem too bad.

Yet when I was back, he just sorted of disappear, first for two days, responding less and less to my texts and not returning my calls. I was very sad, and got quite sick as well after the trip (got to see doctor and took antibiotics). He was kind of absent the whole time, saying he needed time to think about ""things"". When I did get hold of him, he finally let me know he thought his feelings changed and he did not feel like talking to me anymore... I was very shocked and disappointed, first at the fact that he just withdrawed and disappeared on me, and then that he said his feelings changed.

He told me this Sunday he would let me know his thinking. I am thinking he would just officially declare the relationship over then... The signs are quite clear, even though he still said he missed me and he still got feelings for me. I am willing to put more work in the relationship and see it work, but if he decides to give up on it, then I guess there is not much I can do.

My question is: is there anything I can do in this case? Just wait? The fear in limbo state is crazy. Also, what sort of questions or issues that you think I can bring up to him to give the last honest try to save the relationship, or at least have a good closure for both of us?

TL:DR Boyfriend of 1.5 years, mostly in LDR, is suddenly declaring his feelings for me changed and he suggested to talk this Sunday. How could I prepare for it?"
dw2atz,31,2019-11-13,Kamen Rider Ex-Aid: The Best Doctor Drama I Have Seen,R-Ken,KamenRider,https://www.reddit.com/r/KamenRider/comments/dw2atz/kamen_rider_exaid_the_best_doctor_drama_i_have/,"**Kamen Rider Ex-Aid**

Alright right off the bat I want to say that I love the opening song for this series. That song slaps like my drunken step-father with his belt. That aside I was unsure about going into Ex-Aid when I started this journey because I personally didn't like the way Ex-Aid's suit looked especially with the eyes. Over time I got used to the suits and came to like some of them. The thing that got me to watch the show was how many people I saw that said it was good and of course all the Dan Kuroto Shin memes. I just had to see what all the hype was about and I got to say I was not disappointed. I never was a fan of hospital/doctor dramas but this show did it very well by making the interpersonal conflicts and issues being a cause for their harm and the reason they could die if it was not sorted. 

**Main Riders**

Don't get me wrong but the main rider Emu is good and I like him but there wasn't much to him in my mind. Yeah he is the new, young, naive, and inexperienced intern that is super hopeful but the guy is also a doctor and doctors have to make tough calls on things which he just didn't do. Luckily this is a TV show because things just so happen to work out for him somehow. As for his suits I they were just ok for me. I didn't like any of his suits and thought they were cool looking. Even Hyper Muteki had me scratching my head debating do I like this as a final for or not. The show really shined for me with the supporting cast and other riders. Hiiro had good character growth when he had to overcome his stuck up ways of being a genius surgeon and face the truth about how you can't shift the blame and anger to other people when you had a part in things in the first place. He also had the best suits in the show for me. Taiga was my favorite rider in the show. His backstory and motivation for fighting and him being to first person to become a rider is so damn good. His development to actually allow people to get closer to him and allow people to help him. Kiriya was an alright dude and it almost felt like he was just there for me. He definitely had the coolest Henshin pose/sequence out of all of them. His suits though were my least favorite out of all of them. Mainly due to the helmet which I did not like at all. There wasn't most growth to him expect that he had to tell the damn truth. With Poppy I am very confused about how I feel about her. I personally don't like those colorful, idol, high pitched voice types. The way she spoke with the popipapopi stuff was kind of annoying to me too but I have to admit she was there and contributed a lot to the team. Her heart felt moments and actions were some of the best in the show especially at the end of the show even though they again had to give her the happy ending which I didn't like. It was cool that she became a rider but again I just didn't like the suit. 

**Villains**

As for the villains I liked them. Graphite was a cool villain and I wished he got a rider form because that would have been cool. Parado was so damn cool. The dual gashats and his whole attitude and personality I just loved. His development and learning the value of life was so good and it touched me. His forms were cool also and having the dual games and colors suit him too. Now for the man of the hour and my 1 true savior Dan Kuroto Shin. This guy I was not dissapointed with and all the memes I saw beforehand I understand now. He played everything perfectly. Even when people tried to get over on him he just kept coming back on top. His suits and entrances are also some of the best I have seen. Both his suits were awesome and really good looking. The other bad guys were alright and there but I got to say that Cronus entrance and first henshin was so damn cool and it sent chills down my spine. Cronus was a big walking dues ex machine in my opinion that was the definition of cheating. 

**Final Thoughts**

All of these thoughts are just from me watching the main show with 45 episodes. I know there are movies and specials that tie into the story and continuity like the Dr. Pacman movie and other movies that continue the story like True Ending and the Another Ending trilogy which I plan to watch. For now though just based on the main show I liked it a lot. Unlike other shows though where the fights boosted the stories I liked the story and the fights were just kind of there for me. Overall though it was a really enjoyable ride and I can see how it was a good time to be a Kamen Rider fan when it came out because Build came right after it and that show was amazing. My final thoughts and opinions on the show is that it is a really good show that has some of the best story and drama where the fights were alright."

There may also be a slight difference in tone since I am considering stopping halfway through this post to run and gather supplies for making a grilled cheese.

More than anything, **I've missed connecting with new people**. I feel excited and inspired when I meet someone I seriously connect with, and that hasn't happened in a long time, even in a platonic context. I want to feel challenged, I want intelligent and **thoughtful** conversation, I want to feel myself grinning from ear to ear at some dumb thing in a funny conversation. I am *craving* adventure and someone who pushes my buttons, so I'll drop a bit about me.

**About me:**

* 21F in the states, currently in school and very involved/busy so I value my time just as you value yours.
* Pursuing a degree in finance, moving to NYC in May/June for an internship at an IB. An intermediate goal is to go for my MBA at an Ivy League/equivalent and go for my CFA charter.
* I spend a great deal of my time listening to a wide variety of music (from $uicideboy$ to Black Sabbath and from Senses Fail to Bassnectar), traveling when I can, learning new things (currently learning Python), and interacting with people. I have a growing record collection as well, let's hear what ya got.
* I love live music, good food, a stiff drink and a well-rolled blunt (or freshly packed bowl). I enjoy skateboard culture and punk music, but love when I have to throw on my suit and head to a meeting. Futurama, The League, Always Sunny, Billions, Silicon Valley, King of the Road, and Succession are among some of my favorite shows.
* Since most of my time is spent making decisions, working hard, etc. I'm very submissive privately and in platonic settings, it can sometimes come off as apathy -- I promise I'm probably just tired of having to stimulate the conversation like it's the European economy (too soon?).

***Bonus points for you:***

* I absolutely love accents; especially UK accents. Extra super bonus points if you clean up nicely, and if you end up looking like Tom Hardy in Legend then we can just get married immediately, so.
* If you're someone who takes charge, especially intimately -- but only if you actually mean it, some of the people who claim to be into certain things are just rubbish.
* If you'll be willing to show me around NYC and/or show me an unforgettable adventure elsewhere.
* If you're extremely goal-oriented/driven, but you still have half a soul.
* If you have fantastic memes or tantalizing conversation skills that don't require them.

**TL;DR** \- I'm looking for connection and some whirlwind adventure in NYC or elsewhere, I have an array of different interests and tendencies -- I'm a sucker for accents and goals. Pictures on request as long as you do the same :)"

The code challenge was ""FizBuzz"" and I took around 10mins to solve it. I was only able to solve it because my interviewer suggested that the order of my if statements was wrong and that could be the problem. I fixed it and then it was working. I used a for loop and if statements. I just feel like I shouldn't have any problems at all in this kinda of very simple coding challenge. Do you think I could get the internship even though I didn't get the solution correct at first attempt and needed my interviewer's hint to finish it?"

Realistic future: Amazon making HQ2 practically in my backyard, so I think my likelihood of getting an internship there over the next coming summers is very high. I don’t want to go to graduate school, at least not currently. Once I graduate(2023) I expect to go into working some kind of software engineering job(2023.5), where my goal is to accumulate a very respectable amount of money in order to eventually branch out into entrepreneurial work(possibly father’s real estate business). Now this is where I start getting into the ideals. Ideally I will have found a SO during my time working in the software engineering field, otherwise I fear my odds of being alone for the rest of my life will increase just due to the kind of person I am. Assuming wifey and me got the big bucks in the bank, we move to the suburbs ~10-20 min outside a major city somewhere warm(Ex. Austin. Although I do fucking love VA) with a large plot of land(~2028). Build custom house designed by wife and me, have kids(~2030 for first kid?) (idk how many, but ik I want at least 1 boy. I could see myself having 3 kids maximum, like my parents did). Kids grow up, I’m 48 when my first kid is 18, assuming 2 year apart for each kid, I will be 52 when my 3rd kid is 18. Wife and I have fulfilled our societal expectations of reproducing, and can now live out the rest of our lives happily with a great family. 

Alt plan assuming wife=met, money=acquired, and year=~2028: Stay in Arlington,VA keep working multiple more years in the tech field in order to afford building that custom house in Arlington/cities close by. Same kids plan. 

This was just a fun thought experiment for me, hope you guys can learn more about yourselves pondering your own futures!!"

I'm heavily considering moving to Burlington VT, but I'm worried there won't be a lot of opportunities to get a job in UIUX. Does anyone have experience with the city? Would it be a possible to get a job there (or a remote job? although I expect that's much less likely directly coming directly out of school).  I'd be moving there with my boyfriend who would also be working, which would give me a bit more flexibility as well at first.

Over the summer, I interned at a lab, where I helped the researchers with some of their projects and also designed one of my own that I worked on under their guidance. It was a fairly interesting project in a field that I am really passionate about, so I decided to enter it in a nationwide science competition. At the end of my internship, I talked to the PI of the lab and the researchers I worked with, and they were all okay with me doing the project, so I started filling out the application for the competition. 

One of the requirements was a recommendation letter by a science teacher, so I asked my AP Chemistry teacher, who also wrote my college recommendation letters, if she would it. She told me she was really busy this year, since she was teaching a completely new class that she had to design the curriculum for, but she’d be willing to help me out, so I thanked her and added her to the online portal. 

A few weeks ago, the PI of the lab reached out to me and said that in the past, another lab in their organization had issues with this competition over proprietary concerns - in other words, the competition essentially took ownership of all projects and papers submitted by the entrants - and they told me that they were no longer willing to submit the project to the competition. This sounded really shady to me, and I was a little disappointed, but I figured that it is what it is, and decided to put it out of my mind and focus on college apps and school. 

I was really busy and stressed out over the past two months, and I guess I just didn’t know what I would tell my chem teacher, so I never ended up talking to her. I kept putting it off for the next day, until yesterday, I got an email from the competition saying that she had submitted the recommendation letter. So basically, I made her put in all of this work for a competition I’m not even participating in, when she had a ton of other things to do, after I already made her write my recommendation letters for college. 

She’ll probably never find out that I didn’t even submit an application; this competition is very selective and only a few people advance to the next stage. And to be fair, I genuinely didn’t know that I wasn’t going to participate in this competition until a few weeks ago. But I still think it was wrong of me to not talk to her as soon as I found out. 

AITA for not telling her?"

Unfortunately, a lot of conservatives believe in preserving industrial jobs and bring back manufacuring jobs to the US. This is neither practical, nor going to happen in the age of climate activists.

My personal take is: There will be a few people who are left behind who are already in their jobs currently as we start to move towards a more technological society. However, AI can't do everything, and I think it's important to note the difference between AI and automation.

AI is Artifical Intelligence, capable of making human-like decisions or performing human-like intelligent tasks that's it's been trained to do (usually via a Generative-Adversarial network). Example being those face-tune apps that can predict what you'd like like when you're older (look up TwoMinutePapers on YouTube for some awesome AI/Neural network basedprojects btw).

Automation is simply programming a machine or set of machines to do a specific task or set of tasks over and over. A physical manifestation of an algorithm per-say. This is inevitable as we progress as a society.

While AI may constitute a large portion of the job market decades from now, it's still in its infancy comparatively, and we still cannot simulate the complexity of the human mind. Automation is inevitable. The printing press removed the need for scribes, the industrial revolution removed the need for many people wasting time away doing something that could be more efficient, etc.

The difference this time, is the gap in intelligence needed to fill the labor market and those who are being replaced.

That said, my personal solution would be to have some form of government aid for anyone displaced by this new market for a FIXED amount of time (somewhere between 1-5 years while unemployed). In this time, people would have the ability to learn a new skill, or find a new passion to be invested in, and raise their status of living.

As someone who's currently studying computer science, and who's taught others programming before, I can say with confidence that a vast majority of people can learn the very basics of a programming language within 1-2 years, enough to land a job or internship with a company. Programming is just logic, and humans are ingrained with things such as ""if this, then that"" and the like. There are intracasies that people won't understand, but this is just one example of a market that may have a less intelligence cap than people may think it has. (Especially with languages like Python, writing code has really never been easier).

I am moving to Columbus, Ohio soon (Jan 1)! This move was unexpected but will be happening. With that, I need to start looking for a job. I currently don’t have a job and live at my parents’ house since I am in the middle of a career change, but I’d like to work if a place would accept me. 

I am on the cusp of starting my programming classes. I finished 6 classes in a 1.5 months, and have 1.5 months left until I move, so I will have some coding classes done by then. 

Will I have any luck with my minimal experience finding an internship or entry level job this early in my degree? While I don’t have all the coding knowledge, I believe I can fit the rest of the job requirements (I’m a former teacher so communication and organization skills are high). 

If I can’t find anyone to take me this early for a job related to software development, I have backup plans. 

Thanks for your input!"

Throwaway because my son uses reddit and can probably find my main account. 

Ok so to start it off my son has recently turned 14, and he has apparently developed a taste for “name brand” clothing. When he said this, I was assuming maybe $50 $60 shoes. Well, the current pair of shoes he wants I think it’s called yeezies, is $350! He wants these shoes because of the “cool design”, and I think he just wants to fit in. We live in an upper class neighborhood and he goes to an affluent school. His friends having the latest clothes, gadgets, eat at expensive restarunts, etc. Most of their closets are worth over $5,000! We are also well off, but not to the level of his friends. I also feel he gets his “taste” for expensive clothes from his father. The reason he wants these shoes is so his friends and him can take an “aesthetic”(he’s words) Instagram photo. I can afford them, but I can’t fathom spending that much! 

We all moved to the us a few years ago, and me and my husband grew up very poor, sometimes having no lights. I don’t want to deprive my son, because well he’s a great son. He does all his chores, is in advanced classes, self studying 2 AP classes, working in an internship, all while being an all A student. He mentioned buying used shoes for $200 and I immediately said no way! because in my culture and religion I cannot do that. He also cannot get a job as he needs to focus on studies.

Whar should I do reddit? Should I spend the money on him for the shoes?(I can afford it) Or should I say no? I want him to fit in, but I don’t want to break the banking too...

Update: it has been decided. We decided with making his own custom shoes, since my son is starting a clothing brand next year, he needs experience in designing it. So, instead of buying those expensive shoes, we will buy $30 white shoes and his dad will help him make a cool pattern that he likes(his dad used to be a fashion designer). He loves this idea right now, so we will try it! Thank you all for your input"
dw4gnk,0,2019-11-13,MARVEL FANS RUINED ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE,Hellblazer_666,comicbookmovies,https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookmovies/comments/dw4gnk/marvel_fans_ruined_zack_snyders_justice_league/," 

In what comes as no surprise, Kevin Feige's Marvel zombie audience is apparently responsible for ruining Zack Snyder's *Justice League* movie.

I refer to them as ""zombies"" because they eat up everything Marvel even if it's not any good and follow the masses much like a brain dead zombie.

The info comes from Snyder's *Justice League* storyboard artist on Twitter, Jay Oliva, who also happens to be known for directing some super cool DC animated films.

""I’m sure a lot of important WB execs are noticing what’s trending on social media. Why would an intern have to 'bug' a higher up about it?"" Olvia responded to a fan on Twitter. ""Don’t you know what interns do at a studio? Execs have smartphones and are constantly on social media. Btw I worked on the SCOOB movie.""

Olvia continues with the mention that apparently the WB execs were influenced by social media to make *Justice League* more like a goofy Marvel movie.

""In fact this whole mess is BECAUSE of execs reading social media and believing it to be the gospel truth. The whole 'it’s too dark, needs more jokes, it’s colorless, it should be more like Marvel, etc' you can trace back to the bandwagon of social media. So yah I think it works,"" Oliva said.

DC films are better darker, leave the goofy stuff for Marvel

It's unfortunate that DC execs chose to listen to the Marvel zombie type fans, who are arguably the vocal minority, especially on Reddit and Twitter.

We can simply point to the recent *Joker* movie as an example of a dark comic book movie that was a huge success which laughs in the face of the Marvel fans -- *Joker* happens to be the most profitable comic book movie of all time, even more profitable than Disney and Marvel's *The Avengers: Endgame* and *Infinity War*.

The good news is that those WB execs that messed things up with Zack Snyder's *Justice League* appear to no longer be involved with the DC movies, as new execs are in charge -- execs that ironically have been involved in WB's popular and successful horror films (though there is question [if *Wonder Woman 1984* is facing problems](https://cosmicbook.news/wonder-woman-1984-spoilers) due to the Marvel approach as well as [James Gunn's apparent goofy take on *The Suicide Squad*](https://cosmicbook.news/james-gunn-teases-goofy-suicide-squad); worth a mention is that *Shazam!* didn't do all that well).

Regarding Kevin Feige's Marvel movies, they recently came under fire by legendary directors Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola for not being considered ""cinema,"" as Feige simply releases the same movie over and over again for the most part with zero stakes.

""I was asked a question about Marvel movies. I answered it. I said that I’ve tried to watch a few of them and that they’re not for me, that they seem to me to be closer to theme parks than they are to movies as I’ve known and loved them throughout my life, and that in the end, I don’t think they’re cinema,"" [Scorsese recently said](https://cosmicbook.news/marvel-movies-not-art-all-same-scorsese).

Zack Snyder also refers to Feige's MCU as ""popcorn"" flicks.

So here comes the story of my journey into the sugaring world and where it led me so far. The purpose of this piece is to offer as much background as possible in hopes of obtaining the most I nformed and relevant advice to my specific situation. Thank you to those who choose to participate :) Here we go 

*Intro*

6 years ago, upon beginning my new life as a college student at an elite university in one of the most expensive cities in America, my family residing abroad abruptly sank into some serious financial hardship hence were unable to take care of my college education as planned. So there I was, a foreigner in America locked into a pricey lease at a luxury apartment building with college tuition payments in the thousands of dollars.

*Taking Charge* 


Up until that point, I had lived a privileged life by any measure.  Regardless, determined little me decided to buckle up and make it work. If other people worked to pay for their own education all the time, why couldn’t I ? So off I went looking for multiple jobs, selling my luxury items and acquiring 2 roommates for my one bedroom apartment. I started taking charge of my life and did what needed to done.

*The downfall*


Fast forward down the timeline, I succumbed to some pretty serious medical issues which required extensive treatment. Honestly, I believe it was partially due to my drastic change in lifestyle. Suddenly juggling thousands of dollars in bills, college, a work schedule and anxiety I had never experienced   before thousands of miles away from home had taken a toll on me. Luckily, my insurance covered most the medical bills however, I would have to retake &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; pay again for the classes I couldn’t complete during that semester on top of losing my jobs while being essentially bed bound for months. My situation was looking really dire. 

*Interlude*


I took the following semester off to recover from my financial loss and prepare for the following one. Then my birthday came around  and one of my super fancy college friends gave me a gift card to my favorite high end restaurant worth several hundred dollars. So after a particularly rough week I slipped into some nice clothes, did my hair and make up and just like in the good old privileged days, went to have a fancy dinner except this time by myself. That was the night when I who previously had 0 exposure to sugaring, encountered my first sugar daddy. Heck, at the time, I had no idea what the term event meant.

*Welcome to the sugaring world*


So halfway through my dinner walks over a tall older gentleman casually telling me that if he were the one on a date with me he would never have stood me up. To which by that point tipsy sassy sarcastic little me responded something along the lines of “I didn’t realize we were still in an era where women aren’t allowed to roam around freely. Are you going to be my savior and pretend to be my owner so I don’t get in trouble Sir ?”. — or something along those lines and to my great surprise he actually thought it was hilarious. So right then and there we sparked a friendship. 

This is the part where I have to point out that I had always been attracted to a certain type of older guy but the society I lived in would frown upon it so I was never in the right conditions to satisfy my curiosity prior.

The gentleman and I exchanged numbers after the extended dinner (he left them a hefty tip and we stayed past closing time) and off on our separate paths we went. He came back in town for work a few weeks later and took me out for dinner and drinks. The third time, he told me he would like to fly me into a neighboring city as his contract in my city had ended to which I hesitantly agreed contingent on me having my own hotel room and the ability to change my flight ticket if I felt uncomfortable. He happily obliged so off I went in business class and checking into a five star hotel — I felt like at that point God just wanted to remind me of how good I use to have it just to take it away from me again. But regardless, we still had a wonderful weekend and finally became intimate. I had a blast and so did he... I think... lol 

*The Dilemma*


So upon getting back to my town and unpacking my luggage, I found several hundred dollar bills in an envelope addressed to me with a note thanking me for coming and asking me to please accept the “modest offerings” for my Uber ride from the airport to my condo. I had never felt so many mixed emotions at the same time. On one hand this was well over my share of rent  for legitimately enjoying myself ; On the other hand, not too long ago that didn’t seem like a lot of money to me and “WTF do I look like to you ? a prostitute t?” — my thoughts were all over the place. 

*Coming to terms*


So after getting a grip of myself I texted him semi humorously to ask whether he had every taken an Uber that cost that much. Awkward conversation but I liked him as a person and didn’t want to push him away for something so silly on the surface. He clearly meant no offense. So we came to an agreement centered around the fact that I worked so much and needed more time to focus on being successful academically and of course he wanted to spend more time with me. Eventually I made so much that I only worked one part time gig and was ready to finance the following semester faster and more comfortably than anticipated. My guardian angel was finally doing his/her damn job I thought.

*Accepting my benefits*


So I re-enrolled in classes the following semester and was ready to bulldoze through the curriculum requirements straight to my degree. Somewhere along the line I was able to you know... have my own place to myself again (kick out my roommates) and take barely paying internships to start padding my resume. I had inadvertently become certified sugar-baby. 

*The sudden end of an era*


Although I knew we would never be together as he had a very busy life hopping from continent to continent for work, was considerably older than me and already had a crazy baby mama back home, I still really enjoyed being his companion whenever he was around and travelling with him.

Fast forward a couple of years down the line and a few months prior to receiving my degree, this otherwise high in fructose low in drama  relationship suddenly turned sour. I ran into his baby mom in the hotel lobby, she recognized me and ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE. The misery and hatred in her eyes for something I couldn’t even quite comprehend at the time as they were not together was too much for me. Heck I didn’t even know she was around at all and WITH THEIR KID. Again, this was too much for me — my slick mouth stayed motionless.  Eventually him and I had a conversation, he covered my final college tuition payment and off we went in on our separated paths with nothing but sweet memories to cherish and not a modicum of harsh feelings.

*Today*


Now, post graduation and after working in my dream field (albeit for entry level salary) for a little while, I am starting to miss that Relationship’s dynamic. Not him in particular as I had forced myself to take my distances to get over him and did so effectively. Although we do now text once in while, I miss having an older boyfriend who enjoys taking care of me as much as I enjoy reciprocating. Not only that but I find it hard for guys my age to retain my attention. I truly believe older guys of a certain caliber are my ultimate preference. Although  in an atypical sort of relationship, it actually works in my favor overall besides the financial benefits. I have some new legitimately respectable goals that I certainly can achieve by myself but the process could be considerably accelerated and made more pleasurable  with a touch of sugar dazzle. So here I am for the first time dipping my fingertips into the cyber sugar bowl. 

*New beginnings*


After some deep pondering,  I decided to create  an SA account. I made the effort to write an elaborate profile as to give Potential SDs a good idea of the type of lady that I am as well as outline what I have to offer to make their lives better. I clearly state that this is the type of relationship I actually prefer being in versus doing it out of being desperate or purely having financial necessities. I also stated my preference for exclusivity. I understand it is a mutually beneficial relationship so it isn’t about them giving me money to f*ck but rather us finding a happy middle ground where both of us put effort into making each other’s lives better and happily do so while preserving each other’s discretion. I used a few faceless pictures and long distance shots that never made it to my social media as public pictures to broadcast my style, physical attributes and recreational activities then set pictures with clear shots of my face in a bikini on vacation etc in my private gallery to give them a good idea of what to expect. Nothing raunchy just a “what you see is what you get”. 

*Are those bumps on the road or simply the wrong road?*


I really did not expect what followed after my profile went live. Even to a newbie like me, it was obvious that most of the messages that I received were either from scammers, Johns, time wasters, Splenda daddies etc which was confirmed to me upon stumbling into this subreddit.

*I need your help — Is it me or is it them ?*


Now here is where I would please like your input fellow sugarlifestyle redditors.  Based on my history, I believed I had developed a true understanding of what it meant to be a sugar baby but after being on SA for about a month, I am starting to wonder whether it is the right approach for me and if it isn’t, I would please like to receive some suggestions on what would be a better fitting one for me based on my history. Are my expectation too idealistic or is it indeed possible to build such a SR off SA ? 

*Your tips = My blueprint / What more can be done ?*


Following the advice given in your other threads(thank you for that), I expressed my preference for in person meetings versus endless texting to get acquainted. I clearly stated that I appreciate gifts until we both agreed to settle into an arrangement. However it wasn’t mandatory as I truly prioritized compatibility and a long term arrangement vs wam bam thank you ma’am for immediate money followed likely by some immediate ghosting.

Are there better precautions or approaches I can take ? I am certain a few will suggest a profile review but that’s too risky for me given you know... My nascent professional career and the possibility of causing irreversible damage to my family back home. 


*Meet ups*


- Met a potential SD for lunch and really hit it off. He was simply clad but obviously very knowledgeable on many topics which is very attractive to me. He enjoyed my inquisitiveness (i think it boosted his ego) and sense of humor. He gave me a hundred dollars for my transportation, picked up the tab and waited for my Uber to get there although he was running a little late for a meeting. Later in the day I received an offer for an arrangement I would gladly accept contingent on me moving into a place by myself which he obviously would help me out with. He worked a lot so we mostly texted about everything in general including my apartment search etc. When came the time to pay for the moving costs of the apartment  we had selected as per our agreement, he asked me for my PayPal twice, periodically texted me about his relatives’ recent health problems then ghosted. After two weeks I texted him letting him know it was a pleasure meeting him, wishing his relative a swIft recovery but letting him know that he was unfortunately too unreliable for me to settle into an agreement with — he never responded. Was I out of line ? 

- Have been messaging a gent on SA who CashApps me when he wants me to log in and chat. He says that I am way out of his budget but that he really enjoys being able to message me and so do I so it is still ongoing. No pictures no anything, just stories of how my search is going and general life.

- Have been messaging an older guy who clearly stated in his profile that he didn’t offer allowances and pointed it out when he reached out as it was in conflict with what was in my profile. We quickly agreed that it wouldn’t work between us although we were attracted to each other and he often calls me here and there to catch up. Truth be told, I kinda want to f*ck him but I kinda know going down that road wouldn’t be a wise decision on my part. So for now I am sitting this one out. Why wouldn’t he pour some sugar on me if he really likes me that much especially since he seems capable of affording it. Make an exception to your rules zadday and it’d be on and popping lol ;p


- Some guy messaged me expressing a lot of interest and even offered to meet up the same day. It was on the weekend and I would be available that afternoon so I agreed to have a drink later. He messaged me throughout the day and although he was fully aware that I wanted an allowance, he started hinting at how he loves supporting his girls but isn’t comfortable with literally giving them money. I told him if by that he meant that he doesn’t want it to be transactional — I concur. But it slowly drifted into him telling me how women are all the same, even wives would sleep with their husbands’ best friends for the right amount of money etc.. I told him we could agree to disagree but prior to meeting up, I would really appreciate if he could clarify what he meant earlier about supporting his girls without giving them money. I just wanted to know whether he still was offering an allowance or not as I was getting confused by his conflicting statements. He flipped out on me and told me that I ruined the best opportunity I would probably ever find on that website by making him already feel like it was transactional and offering me parting gems such as “if you as so cautious of people screwing you over, you will attract people who will screw you over!” — I couldn’t follow his logic so I thanked him for he advice, bid him farewell, cancelled our meet up and deleted him on SA. Besides the rant on women (I assumed he was just hurt before and lashing out... just needed someone to listen even if they didn’t agreeing with him— which is understandable), I really enjoyed the debates we had started via text but his ambiguity screamed red flag to me so I bounced. 


*Take the mic* 


So I would really appreciate you guy’s point of view and suggestions on the whole situation. Are these interactions normal ? Am I doing it right ? How much time of sorting out through this mess does it take to find the type of sugaring I seek ? Does it exist at all on that website ? Is there a more effective way to weed out incompatible people, time wasters, Splenda daddies, tricksters etc ? I have a pretty good grip on scammers as they are easy to identify but I still wonder about what happened to the first one who offered to help me move to a new apartment ? What was his end goal? Honestly, I am just asking for some clarity and some advice from people who can read better into this situation than me. Perhaps looking in from the outside you’ll easily identify what needs to be done etc... 

I really appreciate you reading it all the way to the end and look forward to reading you invaluable advice. Thank you"

She groaned and slammed the pillows over her ears and head in attempts to try and fall back asleep. That was when the realization came to her. She slowly lifted her head out of the pillows and looked at the clock in horror. It read 12:01pm. “Ahhhhh!! I slept in again!” She yelled face planting back into the pillows before quickly jumping out of her rather large bed and onto the soft carpeted floor. “I have to get ready! I’m already late as it is!” She said hurriedly as she turned on the shower and yelped a little by how cold it was. Today was important. It was the day U.A. Academy as well as the other hero schools were meeting. Today was the day for the students to show  many of the heroes their abilities for yet another round of internships. Either to have old ones kept and or a new one. She quickly hopped out of the shower and threw on her Hero Uniform before bounding down her stairs and running out the door, hair still wet from the shower.

At the hero internship event:
A sea of busses were parked or were parking outside of a massive indoor stadium like building that would have arenas to test abilities and rooms to talk to people privately. Ida, as usual, was the first to stand up from the long bus ride and attempt to get everyone in order. “Everyone please stand up and get in a single file line so that we can exit the bus in an orderly fashion!” He pushed his glasses closer to his nose before making hand motions for everyone to get out. Aizawa have a tired sigh as he waited for the students to form a circle around him. “I’ll be short, but clear. As you all know your here to be recruited by a hero to work under them during this semester. I expect you all to be on you best behavior. Understand?” He said slipping his hands into his pockets. The class nodded before taking off into the crowded stadium. 

“I wonder if I’ll get someone worth an internship this year? In the past I’ve never chosen anyone…”  Rumi thought to herself as she slowed down as she arrived at the back of the stadium. “Made it just in time,” she said smiling as she opened the doors and sat herself on a nice leather chair and relaxed, watching all the students stream in from a good distance from the main attractions. Most of the other heroes and agencies had table and or booths set up to get the kids attention, but not Rumi. She would do her usual routine of waiting around to see if anyone strong enough would approach her and prove themselves. It was a pretty stubborn and dumb tactic, but she refused to do it differently. 

Hello! If you have come this far, I hope that by know you’re somewhat interested in what I have to offer.  As it states in the title, I’m wanting to do a MHA roleplay. I’ve loved watching the anime and enjoy reading the manga as well. I’d like to say I’m a literate roleplayer, as I can do multiple paragraphs plus, but I tend to try  and match my partner. What I’m looking for is anyone who is able to at least write on average 3 paragraphs. The more, the better, but if not, it’s all good. Storyline wise, you can bring any character you want to the table. Whether it be your own oc or canon, I’m looking for someone to play as a Student under the rabbit hero. The story can be more relaxed, romance, and or action. I’m fine with either or. And if your not satisfied with just one character, or don’t know who you want to rp as, I’m also looking for someone to play Hawks and more of a romance kinda rp. But again, bring anyone you want. Now, if you’ve come this far, congrats. I’m done with all these paragraphs. I have Discord and would prefer to rp there. If you interested, please comment or message me. 

Thanks for your time!"

I have a GPA of 3.75 / 4.0, I know it doesn't matter too much but that might be the only thing worth mentioning about me lol. I got a part-time job as an academic tutor in some kind of institute near campus (If you lived in Melbourne u might know what I am talking about lol), it didn't really help me too much with my own career. I'm desperately looking for a paid / unpaid internship to gain some industry experience.

However, after went through linkedin / seek / indeed, I found most IT internship (mostly unpaid) comes from recruitment agencies, should I just pay around $3000 to get a volunteer position?

Also, I found it bit tricky as an international student since most position asks for a PR or citizenship.

ANY ADVICE would help!

Thanks in advance!"
dw9uc4,16,2019-11-14,Danganronpa: An Alternate Side:Future,CYCLOPSCORE,danganronpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/dw9uc4/danganronpa_an_alternate_sidefuture/,"As continued from an alternate killing game where *Makoto* convinces *Sayaka* not to kill *Leon*, changing the results. In the end, *Leon*, *Mondo*, *Yasuhiro*, *Celeste*, *Hifumi*, *Sakura* and *Byakuya* bite the dust, and the survivors are now *Makoto*, *Kyoko*, *Sayaka*, *Mukuro*, *Kiyotaka*, *Chihiro*, *Aoi* and *Touko*. *Junko* is also killed as per the original continuity. Link to that story is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/do5nll/danganronpa_re_an_altered_killing_game/

**This is the status of the survivors when Side:Future begins:**

- *Makoto* is still in hot water for trying to save the Remnants in the simulations. Survivors are still *Hajime, Soda, Sonia, Akane and Fuyuhiko*, everyone else still in a coma. He also has a new prosthetic arm made by *Chihiro* after losing his arm during the new events of Chapter 5.

- In this continuity, *Kyoko* finds *Yui* and *Licorne* still alive (amazingly) amidst the wrecked world by chance and manages to piece together old memories. A happy reunion, really. They opt not to join Future Foundation, but become interns in *Byakuya’s* stead.

- *Mukuro* was first detained when the Future Foundation first got to her, until they affirmed she was absolutely no longer *Junko’s* lackey. Even then, everyone is still suspicious, especially *Munakata* and *Juzo*. She thinks she has brainwashed one of the members in the past. As a side note, she also expresses minor deja vu when she sees that *Takumi* (The Killer Killer) was a former member in the Future Foundation. She also is part of the 13th Division under *Kiyotaka’s* supervision. Madly loyal to *Makoto*, prompting her to butt heads with *Kyoko* and *Sayaka*.

- *Chihiro*, having made an android body similar to *Miaya* after the altered events of Chapter 5, takes over her as the seventh head, and uses *Alter Ego* to make a simulation for the Remnants in Jabberwocky Island. *Izuru* gets wind of this, and does a favour to capture all the Remnants, setting SDR2 into motion. Despite his talent, *Chihiro* cannot hack into the Future Foundation’s system due to certain softwares and firewalls stopping him from doing so. On a side note, *Chihiro’s* new body is much taller, but still bishonen in nature.

- The 13th Branch has been open for some time, thus *Kiyotaka* takes this role as the head, being the most morally grounded out of the newcomers. He serves as the moral high ground for the entire company. Makes good friends with *Gozu*, but butts head with the amoral *Juzo* and *Munakata* at times, especially when the *“Kiyondo”* personality is in the light. He also thinks that *Ruruka* ought to be sacked.

- *Sayaka* and *Aoi* serve as the lesser members, part of branch 11 and 13 respectively. *Sayaka* initially does not join the Future Foundation, but seeing that people have truly forgotten all about her as an idol, and also unable to be comfortable with *Kyoko* and *Mukuro* being so close to *Makoto* all the time, eventually joins the foundation. The two would be the first to complain the lack of recreational activities in the Future Foundation, and seek to do something regarding this, though nobody would really want a Karaoke Room or a Swimming Pool at this time.

- Like in canon, *Touko* is not allowed in the Future Foundation and only serves as an intern. The group sends her to find survivors in Towa City, and she finds *Komaru* and *Yuta*, setting the events of Ultra Despair Girls in motion. Without *Byakuya*, *Touko* is more flirty to Komaru than normal. They still end up trying to rebuild Towa City with the reformed *Warriors of Hope*. They are still trying to find *Monaca*. *Haiji* also faces charges of... unknown crimes.

**Class-78’s Future Foundation Layout:** (ft Interns, Killer Killer and Misaki)

**Leaders:**

**Branch 7:** *Chihiro Fujisaki* (New), *Miaya Gekkogahara* (Old)

**Branch 13:** *Kiyotaka Ishimaru*

**Branch 14:** *Kyoko Kirigiri*

**Branch Members:**

**Branch 6:** *Takumi Hijirihara, Misaki Asano* (Both Left)

**Branch 11:** *Sayaka Maizono*

**Branch 13:** *Aoi Asahina, Mukuro Ikusaba*

**Branch 14:** *Makoto Naegi*

**Interns:** *Komaru Naegi, Toko Fukawa, Yui Samidare, Licorne*

The Final Killing Game still happens, and here are everyone’s new forbidden actions / NG Codes:

**Makoto Naegi:** Having a heart rate above 120 [In other words’ overexertion or exercise].

**Kyoko Kirigiri:** Having blood contact the watch.

**Sayaka Maizono:** Speaking above 60 decibels.

**Mukuro Ikusaba:** Makoto surviving the Fourth Sleeping Phase [Looks like she has Kyoko’s original forbidden action].

**Kiyotaka Ishimaru:** Running down hallways [Seems like he has got Makoto’s original forbidden action].

**Chihiro Fujisaki:** Hacking into any of the foundation’s systems.

**Aoi Asahina:** Eating any high-sugar foods, including donuts.

**Kyosuke Munakata:** Opening doors.

**Chisa Yukizome:** Kyosuke dying.

**Juzo Sakakura:** Telling lies, especially regarding his sexuality.

**Ryota Mitarai:** Using his own phone or computer [In other words, using his talent].

**Seiko Kimura:** Using Steroids.

**Koichi Kizakura:** Holding hands with a girl.

**Kazuo Tengan:** Sweating excessively.

**Ruruka Andoh:** Letting anyone leave the game area. 

**Sonosuke Izayoi:** Eating anything of high cocoa content, namely chocolates and coffee.

**Miaya Gekkogahara:** Talking or speaking a single word.

**Daisaku Bandai:** Getting punched or kicked [Aoi’s original forbidden action].

**Great Gozu:** Removing his mask.

What are your ideas on what happens in the altered Final Killing Game? Who lives? Who dies? Your ideas?

PS: I also mentioned Takumi and Misaki because I wonder that if Side: Future was rewritten, they might have came back to bail them out or something. You decide. Also, the overall reason of including both Kirigiri Sou and Killer Killer inside, because I felt that this would truly make this arc the endgame for Danganronpa.

Also, pictures of Future Foundation Kiyotaka, Chihiro, Mukuro and Sayaka for good measure.

dw9w94,81,2019-11-14,[OC] Brief Writeup on 12 Top Candidates for Head Coach Vacancies in 2020,PM-ME-A-PRIME-NUMBER,nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dw9w94/oc_brief_writeup_on_12_top_candidates_for_head/,"Hey r/nfl! With November upon us, we really are starting to get a sense for which teams are impressing and for which teams are disappointing. The head coaches of the teams that disappoint could find themselves at risk of losing their jobs. The Redskins have already fired their head coach, and the Falcons, Browns, Bears, Cowboys, and Dolphins have all arguably underperformed, so some of these teams and more could be in the market for a new head coach in January. With that said, I decided to take a look at twelve highly-qualified guys sure to generate plenty of interest in league circles for head coach jobs. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Pete Carmichael, Saints Offensive Coordinator (Age: 48)

*Career History: Browns Tight Ends Coach 2000, Redskins Offensive Assistant 2001, Chargers Offensive Assistant 2002-2003, Chargers Assistant Wide Receivers Coach 2004-2005, Saints Quarterbacks Coach 2006-2008, Saints Offensive Coordinator 2009-2019*

Pete Carmichael has cultivated a reputation for being one of the most creative offensive minds in all of football. As a 28-year old, Carmichael got his start as an assistant in Cleveland under his father, OC Pete Carmichael Sr, before spending four years under HC Marty Schottenheimer in Washington and San Diego. Carmichael then landed a job under new Saints HC Sean Payton in 2006. As the Saints' quarterbacks coach from 2006 to 2008, Carmichael was tasked with improving the play of QB Drew Brees, who had been written off by some after a tenuous tenure and gruesome injury with the Chargers. Carmichael did so with flying colors, as the 27-year-old passer improved from being cast off in 2005 to making First Team All Pro in 2006. Brees then went on to have successful seasons in 2007 and 2008, prompting the Saints to promote Pete Carmichael to offensive coordinator in 2009. Success shortly followed, as Carmichael's 2009 offense would finish ranked number 1 in total offense, and, despite a defense that finished ranked number 25 in total defense, the Saints won the Super Bowl that season. Since that historic 2009 season, Carmichael's offense has hardly taken a step back. From 2009 to 2018, the Saints' offense ranked number 1 or number 2 in total offense seven times, and Carmichael has not been afraid to tailor his offense to his personnel. Carmichael's offense puts pressure on safeties and prioritizes favorable down-and-distance combinations in the passing game by emphasizing the short-passing game and the screen game, it puts pressure on linebackers by ensuring that its running backs and tight ends have extensive route trees, and it primarily utilizes zone blocking. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Brian Daboll, Bills Offensive Coordinator (Age: 45)

*Career History: Patriots Defensive Assistant 2000-2001, Patriots Wide Receivers Coach 2002-2006, Jets Quarterbacks Coach 2007-2008, Browns Offensive Coordinator 2009-2010, Dolphins Offensive Coordinator 2011, Chiefs Offensive Coordinator 2012, Patriots Assistant Coach 2013, Patriots Tight Ends Coach 2014-2016, Alabama Offensive Coordinator 2017, Bills Offensive Coordinator 2018-2019*

Brian Daboll may not be the hottest head coach candidate amongst casual fans, but it has become clear over the past decade that he consistently excels in situating his unit to succeed and getting good development from his personnel. Daboll started out as a defensive assistant under Patriots HC Bill Belichick before taking a job as the Patriots wide receivers coach from 2002 to 2006. During his tenure, Daboll not only developed young WR Deion Branch into an above-average starter, but he also got above-average production from relative unknowns including WR David Patten, WR David Givens, and WR Reche Caldwell, as well. Daboll's work with mediocre talent earned him a position as quarterbacks coach of the Jets, where, in 2008, he coached QB Brett Favre to a Pro Bowl appearance at the age of 38. Daboll then got an opportunity to be offensive coordinator of the Browns under HC Eric Mangini. In 2010, with QB Jake Delhome, QB Seneca Wallace, and rookie QB Colt McCoy at the helm, Daboll got creative and converted RB Peyton Hillis from a fullback into a halfback, resulting in a breakout season with over 1000 yards rushing and over 400 yards receiving. Moreover, that season, Daboll got good production out of aging T John St. Clair and IOL Floyd Womack, who complemented T Joe Thomas and IOL Alex Mack to form one of the better offensive lines in football. Daboll then had two single-year stints, one with Miami and the other with Kansas City, as an offensive coordinator with low-quality quarterbacks. Daboll then spent 2014 through 2016 as the Patriots tight ends coach, and TE Rob Gronkowski made First Team All Pro in two of those three seasons. This performance earned Daboll a job as the Alabama offensive coordinator in 2017, where he coached good seasons from QB Jalen Hurts and freshman QB Tua Tagovailoa on his way to a National Championship victory. Buffalo hired Daboll to be its offensive coordinator in 2018, and despite perhaps lackluster statistics, its offense was dynamic with rookie QB Josh Allen's big arm and running ability, with WR Zay Jones' big-play ability, with the emergence of undrafted rookie WR Robert Foster. Additionally, QB Josh Allen made big strides with his mechanics, as his footwork and arm angles were definitely more consistent in his rookie years than they were at Wyoming. Daboll's offense seems to have finally taken off in 2019, as the additions of WR John Brown, WR Cole Beasley, IOL Mitch Morse, and IOL Jon Feliciano and the further development of QB Josh Allen have allowed for Daboll to have more freedom in his offensive playcalls. Daboll runs a hybrid offense between traditional Erhardt-Perkins dropback concepts and modern West Coast misdirection and play action concepts, which allows him to specifically mold his weekly gameplans to his opponents and his available personnel. 

&amp;nbsp;

#John DeFilippo, Jaguars Offensive Coordinator (Age: 42)

*Career History: Giants Offensive Quality Coach 2005-2006, Raiders Quarterbacks Coach 2007-2008, Jets Quarterbacks Coach 2009, San Jose State Quarterbacks Coach 2010, San Jose State Offenvie Coordinator 2011, Raiders Quarterbacks Coach 2012-2014, Browns Offensive Coordinator 2015, Eagles Quarterbacks Coach 2016-2017, Vikings Offensive Coordinator 2018, Jaguars Offensive Coordinator 2019*

John DeFilippo has been around the league for a while, and he has cultivated a reputation for being a so-called quarterback-whisperer. DeFilippo got his start with the Giants as an offensive quality control coach in 2005 under HC Tom Coughlin, where he worked to develop second-year QB Eli Manning into one of the more reliable quarterbacks in football. DeFilippo's work with Manning landed him the title of quarterbacks coach of the Raiders in 2007, where he worked under HC Lane Kiffin and OC Greg Knapp to develop rookie QB JaMarcus Russell. Though Russell never became a franchise quarterback, he did have the best two years of his career in 2007 and 2008 under DeFilippo before falling off in 2009 without DeFilippo. In 2009, DeFilippo took a job as the quarterbacks coach of the Jets, where he worked with rookie QB Mark Sanchez. DeFilippo spent two years with San Jose State before retaking the Raiders quarterbacks coach position between 2012 and 2014. In 2012, DeFilippo helped to orchestrate a good year from QB Carson Palmer, who threw for over 4000 yards for the first time since 2007. DeFilippo worked under OC Greg Olson with second-round rookie QB Derek Carr in 2014, who performed well in his first season despite a lackluster supporting cast. DeFilippo's work with Palmer and Carr earned him the Browns offensive coordinator job in 2015, where he worked for a year before becoming the Eagles' quarterbacks coach under HC Doug Pederson and OC Frank Reich in 2016. DeFilippo helped transform QB Carson Wentz from a raw North Dakota St prospect into a proficient passer off the bat in 2016, and then into a Second Team All Pro in 2017. Further, in 2017, after Wentz went down with a late-season injury, backup QB Nick Foles filled in masterfully, leading the Eagles to a Super Bowl victory. This impressive feat led to DeFilippo becoming the Vikings offensive coordinator in 2018, where he led QB Kirk Cousins to a career high in completion percentage and WR Adam Thielen and WR Stefon Diggs to career highs in receiving yards. In 2019, DeFilippo became the Jaguars offensive coordinator under HC Doug Marrone, and history repeated itself -- this time, QB Nick Foles went down early with a serious injury, and backup QB Gardner Minshew took over without missing a beat. DeFilippo is a pass-happy coordinator who has been around a diverse set of offensive minds, including Brian Schottenheimer, Greg Olson, Tom Cable, Doug Pederson, and Frank Reich, so he has a wide arsenal, including run-pass options, Air Raid concepts, screens, and varied shotgun looks, to tailor his offense particularly to his quarterback's skillset. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Matt Eberflus, Colts Defensive Coordinator (Age: 49)

*Career History: Toledo Outside Linebackers Coach 1994-1998, Toledo Defensive Backs Coach 1999-2000, Missouri Defensive Coordinator 2001-2008, Browns Linebackers Coach 2009-2010, Cowboys Linebackers Coach 2011-2017, Colts Defensive Coordinator 2018-2019*

Matt Eberflus hasn't necessarily always been amongst the so-called hottest candidates, but his work, especially over the last few years, may warrant head coach consideration. Eberflus got his start at the age of 23 as a defensive assistant at Toledo in 1994, where he would stay for seven years before becoming Missouri's defensive coordinator in 2001. That year, Eberflus produced the great IDL Justin Smith, who became the number four overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft and played 14 seasons in the NFL. Under Eberflus', the Missouri defense improved for four straight seasons, culminating in a dominant which yielded less than 20 points per game on average. Eberflus had a respectable tenure as defensive coordinator at Missouri before moving to the NFL and becoming the Browns linebackers coach in 2009. Eberflus spent two seasons under HC Eric Mangini and DC Rob Ryan in Cleveland before following Ryan to become the Cowboys linebackers coach in 2016. That season, under Eberflus, 24-year-old LB Sean Lee recorded over 100 tackles, and EDGE DeMarcus Lawrence recorded 19.5 sacks and made First Team All Pro. Further, Eberflus worked to develop young LB Bruce Carter, who eventually became a good starter for the Cowboys. In 2014, following LB Sean Lee's season-ending injury, Eberflus was forced to start LB Bruce Carter, LB Anthony Hitchens, a fourth-round rookie, and LB Rolando McClain, who was previously seen as a draft bust and had spent the previous year in retirement. Nevertheless, Carter, Hitchens, and McClain still performed well as a unit in 2014 under Eberflus, as the unit combined for 8 interceptions and 15 pass deflections, and each starting linebacker recorded over 80 tackles. In 2016, the Cowboys promoted Eberflus to defensive pass game coordinator, where he took on some playcalling responsibilities. That year, under Eberflus, LB Sean Lee recorded 175 tackles and made First Team All Pro, and the Cowboys went 13-3 and won the NFC East. In 2018, the Colts hired Matt Eberflus to be their defensive coordinator, and he immediately began to implement a turnaround. In his first year with Indianapolis, Eberflus transformed Indianapolis' defense from being ranked number 30 in total defense to being ranked number 11 in total defense, and he coached second-round rookie LB Darius Leonard to make First Team All Pro. Eberflus' defense has continued to perform well in 2019. Matt Eberflus has a wide defensive arsenal from working with other defensive minds such as Rod Marinelli, Kris Richard, and Monte Kiffin, and with Indianapolis, he runs a zone-heavy, 4-3 defense with frequent blitzes and a high percentage of cover 2 calls.

#George Edwards, Vikings Defensive Coordinator (Age: 53)

*Career History: Cowboys Linebackers Coach 1998-2001, Redskins Linebackers Coach 2002, Redskins Defensive Coordinator 2003, Browns Linebackers Coach 2004, Dolphins Linebackers Coach 2005-2009, Bills Defensive Coordinator 2010-2011, Dolphins Linebackers Coach 2012-2013, Vikings Defensive Coordinator 2014-2019*

George Edwards has bounced around the league a lot since his first NFL job in 1998, but he has quietly been very successful. Edwards got his start in Dallas in 1998, and he shortly developed LB Dexter Coakley into one of the best coverage linebackers in the entire league. With Edwards as his position coach, Coakley made the Pro Bowl in 1999 with 4 interceptions, 1 forced fumble, and 6 tackles for loss. In 2002, Edwards was responsible for overseeing a dominant Redskins' linebacking crew under DC Marvin Lewis that included LB Jim Trottier and LB Lavar Arrington, the latter of whom recorded a career-best 11 sacks that season. At the age of 36, Edwards got his first chance to run a defense with Washington before catching on with Cleveland as their linebackers coach in 2004. Edwards' career really took off from 2005 through 2009 as the linebackers coach of the Dolphins, as he oversaw a dominant linebacking group consisting of LB Zach Thomas, EDGE Joey Porter, and EDGE Jason Taylor. Edwards helped coach the Dolphins through a 4-3 to 3-4 scheme switch, and he developed LB Channing Crowder from a round 3 draft choice into a good starter on day one. Edwards' developmental abilities landed him a job in Buffalo as defensive coordinator in 2010 and 2011, where he ran a dynamic defense with young stars such as IDL Kyle Williams, IDL Marcell Dareus, LB Paul Posluszny, S Donte Whitner, and S Jairus Byrd. Edwards then spent two years with the Dolphins before reuniting with HC Mike Zimmer in Minnesota. In 2014, Zimmer and Edwards transformed Minnesota's defense from being ranked number 31 in total defense to being ranked 14 in total defense. In each of 2016, 2017, and 2018, Zimmer and Edwards' defense ranked top 4 in total defense, constantly shape-shifting their vast array of talent including EDGE Danielle Hunter, EDGE Everson Griffin, IDL Linval Joseph, LB Anthony Barr, LB Eric Kendricks, CB Xavier Rhodes, S Harrison Smith, and S Anthony Harris to specifically attack their opponent. Edwards runs a 4-3 defense with lots of MOFC coverages and pattern-match concepts, and he likes to crowd the line of scrimmage and the A gap to make offenses have to account for the threat of the blitz.

#Mike McDaniel, 49ers Offensive Run Game Coordinator (Age: 37)

*Career History: Broncos Coaching Intern 2005, Texans Offensive Assistant 2006-2008, Sacramento Running Backs Coach 2009-2010, Redskins Offensive Assistant 2011-2012, Redskins Wide Receivers Coach 2013, Browns Wide Receivers Coach 2014, Falcons Offensive Assistant 2015-2016, 49ers Run Game Coordinator 2017-2019*

Mike McDaniel figures to draw some interest for head coach positions due to his associations with great offenses and great offensive minds. McDaniel spent three years as an assistant under Gary Kubiak in Houston and two years coaching in the UFL before finding an assistant job under HC Mike Shanahan and OC Kyle Shanahan in Washington at the age of 28. The Washington staffs that McDaniel was a part of were loaded with great offensive minds aside from the Shanahans, as well, as they contained quarterbacks coach Matt LaFleur and tight ends coach Sean McVay as well. In 2011, with QB Rex Grossman, RB Roy Helu, WR Santana Moss, WR Jabar Gaffney, and TE Fred Davis as the primary skill position players and with a patchwork offensive line riddled with injuries, the Redskins ranked number 16 in total offense. The Washington staff would showcase its versatility over the next two seasons, as it molded its offense to fit the skillset of young QB Robert Griffin III, finishing ranked in the top 10 in total offense in 2012 and 2013. McDaniel was promoted to wide receivers coach in 2013, and he coached WR Pierre Garcon and WR Leonard Hankerson to career highs in receiving yards that season. In 2014, McDaniel followed OC Kyle Shanahan to Cleveland to become their wide receivers coach. That season, under McDaniel, WR Andrew Hawkins set a career-high mark for receiving yards despite being thrown to by QB Brian Hoyer and QB Johnny Manziel, and undrafted rookie WR Taylor Gabriel emerged as a dynamic receiving weapon. McDaniel then followed OC Kyle Shanahan to Atlanta to become an offensive assistant in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, WR Julio Jones led the league in receiving yards, RB Devonta Freeman and RB Patrick DiMarco made the Pro Bowl, and the Falcons finished ranked number 7 in total offense. In 2016, the Falcons had a historic offense, as QB Matt Ryan won the MVP award and made First Team All Pro, WR Julio Jones made First Team All Pro, IOL Alex Mack made Second Team All Pro, they ranked number 2 in total offense, and they made Super Bowl LI. This showing earned Kyle Shanahan a head coach position with San Francisco, and, as Shanahan did not hire an offensive coordinator, Mike McDaniel is considered to be his top offensive assistant in San Francisco as his offensive run game coordinator. In 2017 and 2018, Shanahan and McDaniel's offensive unit finished ranked in the top half of the league in total offense, despite starting QB CJ Beathard, QB Brian Hoyer, and QB Nick Mullens for a combined 24 out of 32 games. Shanahan and McDaniel molded their offense around TE George Kittle, whose 2018 receiving yards mark is currently the all-time most receiving yards for a tight end in a season. The tandem managed to get good production out of relative unknowns such as RB Matt Brieda, WR Dante Pettis, T Mike McGlinchey, and IOL Laken Tomlinson. Finally, in 2019, with starting QB Jimmy Garoppolo, Shanahan and McDaniel appear to have put together the pieces, as their offense is amongst the most prolific in the league this season. Mike McDaniel comes straight from the Shanahan branch of the West Coast Offense, so he could be expected to run an outside zone running scheme, to heavily utilize play action and misdirection, and to stretch the field with screens and bootleg throwbacks, while also tailoring his offense to fit his personnel. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Josh McDaniels, Patriots Offensive Coordinator (Age: 44)

*Career History: Patriots Personnel Assistant 2001, Patriots Defensive Assistant 2002-2003, Patriots Quarterbacks Coach 2004-2005, Patriots Offensive Coordinator 2006-2008, Broncos Head Coach 2009-2010, Rams Offensive Coordinator 2011, Patriots Offensive Coordinator 2012-2019*

Even as a young coach, Josh McDaniels has a diverse, successful coaching resume, having spent time on offense, defense, and as an NFL head coach, and having won six Super Bowls. McDaniels got his start in 2001 under HC Bill Belichick as a personnel assistant for the Patriots at the age of 25. McDaniels would spend three years as an assistant for the Patriots, mostly on the defensive side of the football, before being promoted to the Patriots quarterbacks coach in 2004 at the young age of 28. That year, under McDaniels, 26-year-old QB Tom Brady had the most efficient year of his career up to that point, and the Patriots went 14-2 and won the Super Bowl. McDaniels spent 2005 as Brady's quarterbacks coach before his promotion to offensive coordinator in 2006. During McDaniels' first stint as the Patriots offensive coordinator, McDaniels' unit finished ranked top five in total offense twice, including a historic 2007 season, where his offense finished ranked number 1 in total offense, and the Patriots went undefeated in regular season games. This success prompted the Broncos to hire McDaniels to be their head coach in 2009. McDaniels spent two seasons as the head coach of the Broncos, and the Broncos finished ranked in the top half in total offense each year, despite starting QB Kyle Orton and a pedestrian offensive line in the vast majority of games. McDaniels' Broncos would finish 4-12 in 2010, largely due to a defense which finished ranked number 32 in total defense, prompting the Broncos to fire McDaniels. Josh McDaniels then had a one-year stint with the Rams in 2011 before returning to be the Patriots offensive coordinator in 2012, a position in which McDaniels remains currently employed. From 2012 to 2018, McDaniels' Patriots finished ranked in the top 10 in total offense in six of seven seasons, QB Tom Brady made the Pro Bowl in each season, the Patriots averaged over 12 wins per season, and the Patriots won the Super Bowl three times. McDaniels' offense has continued to perform at about the same clip in 2019. McDaniels runs the Erhardt-Perkins offense perhaps better than any other offensive coach in history, creating mismatches with deceptive formations and personnel groupings and consistently staying ahead of his opponents with mid-season and in-game adjustments, so he should continue to garner massive interest for any team with a head coach vacancy in 2020. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Urban Meyer, Former Ohio State Head Coach (Age: 55)

*Career History: Illinois State Outside Linebackers Coach 1988, Illinois State Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers Coach 1989, Colorado State Wide Receivers Coach 1990-1995, Notre Dame Wide Receivers Coach 1996-2000, Bowling Green Head Coach 2001-2002, Utah Head Coach 2003-2004, Florida Head Coach 2005-2010, Ohio State Head Coach 2012-2018*

Urban Meyer probably falls into the category of college coaches that could get an NFL head coach job easily if they express interest, and for good reason. Meyer got his start at the age of 23 as the Illinois State outside linebackers coach in 1988. Meyer would remain an assistant coach for 13 years before landing a head coach position with Bowling Green in 2001. Meyer improved Bowling Green from a 2-9 team to an 8-3 team in year one, and he went 9-3 in year two averaging over 40 points scored per game. Meyer then went on to orchestrate a similar turnaround in Utah, improving the 5-6 team to a 10-2 team in year one and going 12-0 in year two while averaging over 45 points scored per game. Meyer's quarterback in 2004, QB Alex Smith, came in fourth place in Heisman voting and became the number one overall selection in the 2005 NFL Draft. Meyer's work with Bowling Green and Utah earned him a premier head coach position with the Florida Gators from 2005 to 2010. During this 6-year span, Meyer went 65-15, winning 2 BCS Championships and producing four offensive round-one draft picks in QB Tim Tebow, WR Percy Harvin, IOL Maurkice Pouncey, and IOL Mike Pouncey, along with other notable offensive draft picks such as WR Riley Cooper, TE Aaron Hernandez, and T Marcus Gilbert. Meyer resigned from the Florida head coach position after the 2010 season due to health reasons, but he resurfaced as head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes in 2012. In that very first year, Meyer transformed Ohio State from a 6-7 team to a 12-0 team. Meyer would ultimately go 83-9 with Ohio State, winning a National Championship and producing notable offensive players including QB Dwayne Haskins, QB Cardale Jones, RB Ezekiel Elliott, RB Carlos Hyde, WR Michael Thomas, WR Terry McLaurin, WR Parris Campbell, T Taylor Decker, and IOL Billy Price. Meyer, long-considered to be an offensive guru, prefers to run an offense with a mobile quarterback to incorporate read option plays, but at its core, Meyer's offense is a vertically-oriented, pass-happy attack with a gap-blocking scheme in the run game. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Greg Olson, Raiders Offensive Coordinator (Age: 57)

*Career History: 49ers Quarterbacks Coach 2001, Purdue Tight Ends Coach 2002, Bears Quarterbacks Coach 2003, Lions Quarterbacks Coach 2004, Lions Offensive Coordinator 2005, Rams Offensive Coordinator 2006-2007, Buccaneers Quarterbacks Coach 2008, Buccaneers Offensive Coordinator 2009-2011, Jaguars Quarterbacks Coach 2012, Raiders Offensive Coordinator 2013-2014, Jaguars Offensive Coordinator 2015-2016, Rams Quarterbacks Coach 2017, Raiders Offensive Coordinator 2018-2019*

After many years of being an assistant under some of the most respected NFL minds of our generation and successfully working with many young quarterbacks, it may finally be time for Greg Olson to break through and get a head coach job opportunity of his own. Olson started his NFL career at the age of 38 as the quarterbacks coach of the 49ers under HC Steve Mariucci in 2001. Under Olson, QB Jeff Garcia made the Pro Bowl, and the 49ers went 12-4 and made the postseason. Olson spent 2002 with Purdue before becoming the Bears quarterbacks coach in 2003. Olson then took the Lions quarterbacks coach job in 2004, where he coached QB Joey Harrington to the most efficient passing season of his career. Olson then had a one-year sting as the Lions offensive coordinator before becoming the Rams offensive coordinator in 2006. Under Olson in 2006, the Rams finished ranked number 6 in total offense, and QB Marc Bulger made the Pro Bowl and had the most efficient passing season of his career. In 2008, Olson became the quarterbacks coach of the Buccaneers under HC Jon Gruden. In 2009, the Buccaneers promoted Greg Olson to offensive coordinator, and in 2010, 22-year-old QB Josh Freeman had the best season of his career, as he threw for 3451 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions, and he led the Buccaneers to a 10-6 season. Olson's work in Tampa Bay landed him the Raiders offensive coordinator job in 2013. During his stint with the Raiders, Olson worked closely with QB Derek Carr, who captured the starting quarterback job in his rookie season as a second-round pick. Olson then took the Jaguars offensive coordinator job in 2015. That season, 22-year-old QB Blake Bortles had the best season of his career, as he threw for 4428 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. Olson then took the Rams quarterbacks coach job under HC Sean McVay in 2017. That year, Olson worked closely with 22-year-old QB Jared Goff, who transformed from a presumed draft bust into a Pro Bowl player in a single season. Raiders HC Jon Gruden then hired Olson to be his offensive coordinator in 2018. Greg Olson has consistently proven that he will get the most out of his quarterbacks, so he could generate some interest from teams who wish to develop their young quarterbacks.

#Kris Richard, Cowboys Defensive Pass Game Coordinator (Age: 40)

*Career History: Seahawks Assistant Defensive Backs Coach 2010, Seahawks Cornerbacks Coach 2011, Seahawks Defensive Backs Coach 2012-2014, Seahawks Defensive Coordinator 2015-2017, Cowboys Pass Game Coordinator 2018-2019*

Despite being only 40 years old, Kris Richard's resume might be the most impressive of any aspiring head coach's in the NFL today. As Seattle's cornerbacks coach in 2011 and defensive backs coach in 2012 and 2013, Richard transformed CB Brandon Browner from a CFL player to an NFL Pro Bowler in a year, he developed CB Byron Maxwell from a sixth-round pick to a solid starter, and he developed CB Richard Sherman from a fifth-round pick to an all-time great. During Richard's time as defensive backs coach of the Seahawks, CB Richard Sherman and S Earl Thomas each made First Team All Pro three times, and S Kam Chancellor made Second Team All Pro once. In 2015, Richard was promoted to defensive coordinator of the Seahawks, a position in which he remained for three years. From 2015 to 2017, Richard's defense finished ranked number 2, 5, and 11 in total defense, respectively, and the Seahawks made the divisional round of the playoffs in two out of three years. In 2018, Richard left Seattle to take a job with Dallas as the defensive backs coach and the defensive pass game coordinator, an important position which included the responsibility of playcalling. Under Richard in 2018, Dallas' defense ranked number 7 in total defense, and CB Byron Jones transformed from a safety to making a Second Team All Pro as a corner in one year. With Richard calling plays once again, Dallas' defense has continued to perform at a high level in 2019. Kris Richard, like Pete Carroll, Gus Bradley, and Dan Quinn, is a zone-heavy coach who primarily uses cover 3, and in his front seven he uses a 4-3. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Robert Saleh, 49ers Defensive Coordinator (Age: 41)

*Career History: Texans Defensive Intern 2005, Texans Defensive Quality Coach 2006-2008, Texans Assistant Linebackers Coach 2009-2010, Seahawks Defensive Quality Control Coach 2011-2013, Jaguars Linebackers Coach 2014-2016, 49ers Defensive Coordinator 2017-2019*

Robert Saleh has been all over the country in his 15-year NFL coaching career, and he has cultivated a reputation for being an innovative defensive mind. Saleh got his start as a 25 year old as a defensive intern for the Texans under HC Dom Capers and DC Vic Fangio. Saleh stuck with the team for four years before being named the Texans assistant linebackers coach in 2009. That season, 22-year-old LB Brian Cushing and 24-year-old LB DeMeco Ryans both qualified for the Pro Bowl. Saleh then took an opportunity to coach under HC Pete Carroll as a defensive quality control coach in 2011. Saleh was part of the Seahawks' defensive staff for a dominant three-year stretch, the last of which saw the Seahawks finish ranked number 1 in total defense, resulting in a Super Bowl victory. In 2014, Saleh followed Gus Bradley to Jacksonville to become the Jaguars linebackers coach, a position in which he would remain for three seasons. In Saleh's first year with the team, he oversaw fifth-round-rookie LB Telvin Smith record over 100 tackles and develop into a good coverage player as well. Saleh would then coach LB Telvin Smith and LB Paul Posluszny to successful seasons in 2015 and 2016 before HC Kyle Shanahan poached him to be the 49ers defensive coordinator in 2017. In 2017, Saleh improved the 49ers defense from being ranked number 32 in total defense to being ranked number 24 in total defense. Saleh's unit finished ranked number 13 in total defense in 2018, with 24-year-old IDL DeForest Buckner recording 12 sacks and qualifying for the Pro Bowl. Saleh's defense has gotten off to a dominant start in 2019, pairing a swarming defensive front consisting of EDGE Nick Bosa, EDGE Arik Armstead, IDL DeForest Buckner, and LB Kwon Alexander with a surprising secondary consisting of CB Richard Sherman, CB Ahkello Witherspoon, and S Jimmie Ward. Robert Saleh primarily runs a Seattle 3 defense like the one he learned under HC Pete Carroll, but he mixes in two-deep looks as well with some wide-9 and stacked alignments in the front seven. 

&amp;nbsp;

#David Shaw, Stanford Head Coach (Age: 47)

*Career History: Eagles Quality Control Coach 1997, Raiders Quality Control Coach 1998-2000, Raiders Quarterbacks Coach 2001, Ravens Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers Coach 2002-2004, Ravens Wide Receivers Coach 2005, Chargers Passing Game Coordinator 2006, Stanford Offensive Coordinator 2007-2010, Stanford Head Coach 2011-2019*

David Shaw falls into the select groups of people that could probably generate NFL head coach offers for multiple teams the instant that he shows interest, and for good reason -- Shaw has consistently produced high-level offensive results ever since he started coaching football. Shaw got his NFL start in 1997 at 23 years old as a quality control coach on an Eagles offensive staff headlined by OC Jon Gruden and quarterbacks coach Sean Payton. Shaw followed Gruden to become a quality control coach for the Raiders from 1998 to 2000 before finally being named the Raiders quarterbacks coach in 2001. Under Shaw in 2001, QB Rich Gannon made the Pro Bowl, leading the Raiders to 10 wins and the second round of the postseason. In 2002, Shaw went to Baltimore to become the Ravens quarterbacks and wide receivers coach under HC Brian Billick. Shaw spent four years in Baltimore before becoming the Chargers passing game coordinator in 2006. That season, with Shaw, the Chargers finished ranked number 4 in total offense, going 14-2 and winning the AFC West. Shaw then took the opportunity to become the offensive coordinator at his alma mater, Stanford University, under HC Jim Harbaugh in 2007. Shaw transformed Stanfords offense from scoring 10.6 points per game in 2006 to scoring over 40 points per game in 2010. Shaw was named Stanford's head coach in 2011. Between 2010 and 2018, Shaw's team finished in the top 10 three separate times, his offense scored over 30 points per game four separate times, and he had an overall winning percentage of 0.759. Shaw has produced NFL offensive talent during his Stanford tenure as well, including QB Andrew Luck, RB Christian McCaffrey, TE Zach Ertz, and IOL David DeCastro. If David Shaw were to jump back to the NFL, he would certainly present new challenges for defensive coordinators, as he combines traditional West Coast staples with spread concepts in ways unlike current NFL offensive play callers with impressive flexibility on a week-to-week basis."

Also another main reason why i ordered is because my current monitor only have a HDMI port and no Display port unfortunately tho it does say it supports freesync and using those adapter/converter/Cables is likely my only option atm if i want to use my GPU's Display ports to full use.

What do you guys think ? is HDMI is more than enough or should i get a monitor that supports DP and the Direct Cable itself ?"

The tree seems quite adamant that they must become part of the crew. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]

dwa925,269,2019-11-14,(crazy idea) Great Writer Search,silentone2k,magicTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/dwa925/crazy_idea_great_writer_search/,"Some things have come out of the Wizard's creative lately that have been... not well received. Whether you blame bad writing, an insufficient appreciation of existing cannon, corporate meddling, or other features, it's obvious there's some level of failure or, at a minimum, disconnect involved. But this thread is not to be yet another postmortem on *How Everyone Screwed Up The Thing We Love*. 

I assume most of us are familiar with the three Great Designer Searches. They were chances for anyone (able to work in the US and move to Seattle) to **Prove Your Mettle** and compete for a coveted internship with WotC R&amp;D.  For many of us, working in creative would be an appealing prospect. Apparently Wizards needs freelancers and in-house positions filled. So, why not search for wordsy people with the same method? Give absolute unknowns a chance to showcase their creative chops and love of the Multiverse...

Which, of course, leads to the question; what would this search even look like?

My suggestion is that it could be formatted very much like GDS 3. **Obviously, this is entirely wishful thinking on my part.** But, I'm trying to create a rigorous and demanding a gauntlet for applicants, with reasonable internal overhead. The result would be to find people with the skill and desire to do this job well.

&amp;#x200B;

\-

&amp;#x200B;

**The Trials;**

While I tried to keep this to the three trial format of GDS3, the fact is some things want to come before the big cut. For entirely unproven and unknown writers looking to break into a creative field several skills need to be tested, each of which require a different framework. Further, one of the key skills of a house writer is the ability to switch formats and grind through... so I front-loaded extra writing. This also generates a virtual portfolio of sorts for the potential contestants that falls within relatively clear and defined limits for ease of comparison.

**First trial;** Several short-form essays describing the competitor and their understanding of the Magic system. Very much patterned after the GDS 3 trial 1. The questions focusing on game design should obviously be switched to emphasis on lore. (What Planeswalker would you focus story on rather than evergreen keywords, for example.) As with GDS3, these submissions would be stored and only the top contenders of the last trial would have their submission scored.

**Second trial;** Worldbuilding Elevator pitches - Write three ""elevator pitches"" for new and unique magic sets. Each pitch must be 4 sentences or less and less than 100 words. It must thumbnail a creative seed for a new potential set, particularly what makes it different from existing cannon sets. At least one must be an entirely new world. One of the truisms in art is that the hardest thing in the world is a blank canvas, and part of creative's mandate is to generate new ideas to explore. Like the first trial, these would be warehoused until after the last trial and only the top contenders' used to cut to the final 8.

**Third trial;** Short form piece - given a world, characters, and conflict write a 1000-2000 word piece that hits the listed major story beats. This seems to be one of the main needs wizards has right now; providing content on demand. Like the first trial, this is a time consuming task that demands commitment, but also requires a variety of technical writing skills such as plotting and editing. Yet again, only the top contenders from the last trial would actually have their submissions scored.

**Fourth trial;** The last open trial I have is formatted after GDS3's second trial, and the lessons from that trial. This would be a multiple-choice test about the lore of magic- ranging from the fairly basic (What is the Mending? Who did Urza build the Legacy Weapon to defeat?) to deeper-cuts (What organization of mages was Grandmother Sengir associated with? What planeswalker helped Yawgmoth establish Phyrexia?) and from the old (everything I already asked) to the recent (How did Gideon Jura die?)  One of the big lessons of GDS3's second trial that's been discussed was that they probably needed more questions to get a better spread. Especially with the prevalence of lore sites this would need to be a pretty grueling multi-hundred question test.

Like the GDS the multiple-choice test would cut to the top \~100, whose earlier trial submissions would then be evaluated to cut to a top 8 for participation in the ""show"" challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Challenges;**

Those who survive the culling of the Trials would then get to participate in the ""show"" portion of the event. Like the GDS, these would be bi-weekly challenges testing various aspects of a contestant's ability to do the R&amp;D creative job. It would be judged by various members of R&amp;D and creative. Also, it would give a window into the day-to-day work that goes on in the creative side of the house. The main list of challenges I came up with are taken directly from the functions we know the creative team has;

1. Card concepting - Given a set of cards with mechanics and a given Magic setting, provide a card concept - including name, relevant non-mechanical subtypes, etc. 
2. Art Description - Given a set of cards with a name and mechanics write an art description based on the concept. 
3. Write flavor text - Given a set of cards with a name, mechanics, and possibly art (or art description) provide flavor text that enhances the card design and fits within the available space.
4. Packaging text - Given several long-form descriptions of sets, produce very short (100 word or less) summaries which capture the essence of product and flavor. 

Other potential challenges include;

1. Character concepting - create an elevator pitch (or longer) write up for new characters. 
2. Once more, with flair - More short stories. Depending on the specific positions needing filled asking \~2k words for a chapter or a short story every 2 weeks seems reasonable. Whether this is its own separate challenge/set of challenges or additional to the main challenge.
3. Worldbuilding - given an elevator pitch or core concept (steampunk, Egypt, Horror) world/set, write 2k words that make it seem like a new and different place, somewhere we want to visit, and somewhere that fits within the magic multiverse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which challenges would you prefer as a viewer? If you're a writer, would this be something that interests you? Do you find the trials and challenges daunting? 

Anyway, that's my latest crazy idea in slightly over 1,000 words."
dwao27,3,2019-11-14,dude from my internship keeps badgering me for months to treat the entire team and I'm finally (unwillingly) giving in tomorrow,fisherman_friendo,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/dwao27/dude_from_my_internship_keeps_badgering_me_for/," tldr at the bottom!

After almost 3 months, I’m finally giving in.

A little background information: Internship is a compulsory module in my school. All of us have to spend a semester working for companies that are related to our studies. The only thing is, we don't get to choose as our lecturers assigned them to us.

I was assigned to a rather small company. They are pretty chill, there’s no dress code, no office hours and you can choose to work from home. But since I’m an intern, I do have to follow the 9 am to 6 pm timing. (But at this point I’ve been going to work at around 10:30 am) so that it’s easier for them to keep track of me.

It wasn’t exactly what I had hoped for. I didn’t enjoy doing the projects and I didn’t exactly have a social life since I’m pretty much stuck with a group of middle-aged men. But since the working life was quite chill, I suck it up and went on with it.

Now back to the actual story. After I got my first paycheck, (it was a paid internship and I got around USD 400 per month) I was super happy. And then cue this guy coming to the office. As we didn’t have a fixed office timing, he always comes in the evening. He then asked me if this was my first paycheck. Technically it wasn’t since I had part-time jobs that paid a lot more. He said since it was my first paycheck for my first full-time job, we should have a party. I wasn’t sure of what he was saying half of the time since I was early my earphones, but I just awkwardly smile and nodded.

Initially, I thought he was joking and just awkwardly laugh along. But turned out he was serious. He kept asking me when is the party and what are we gonna have. I just said I don’t know and he left me alone. 

Or so I thought. After a while, he kept on asking me, and in the end, I just said I’ll treat them coffee just so I could go home. He simply just cheered and said that was all he wanted to hear. But the truth is I have no intention of treating them with my broke ass.

It went on for the entire TWO WEEKS. Every single day he came into the office asking me when was the “party”.  I was so frustrated and angry. I’m not sure how it's usually like in other places but I always assumed it would be the other way round, where they were supposed to treat me. Not that I want them too either, I just kinda want to get the internship over and done with.

There was even a time where he twisted my words and it went from treating coffee to treating lunch. Not sure if he was serious, but at this point, it could be anything. I even skipped work just so I could avoid him. I thought maybe he thought that I’m an actual salaried employee and casually told him the pay I got was simply an intern’s pay. All he replied was “So?”. Trust me I almost lost my shit that day.

I later found out it was the office culture that the new kid has to treat the entire office. Apparently he has already “let me off” with just treating coffee since I was an intern.

After a while, it stopped - till I got my second paycheck. And he kept on asking. Eventually, it stopped again for a couple of weeks since he didn’t drop by the office. By this time, I was already 3 months into my internship.

Until last week he asked about the party again. He kept asking me and I eventually gave in and said this Friday.

So yeah, tomorrow is Friday I’m not looking forward to it. I’m not even sure if I’m gonna just treat coffees to everyone or I actually have to pay a whole ass meal. 

I already planned what I want to do with my paychecks - pay my school fees, save up for art materials for next semester (I’m studying in an art school so yeahhhhh) and maybe take a short trip with my friends. 

Am I petty? Maybe, but it honestly pains my heart that I have to spend money on people I don’t care about and never see again simply because of the office culture. The idea of having to spend time talking and socializing is also sending my anxiety to the roof. 

**tldr: guy at office kept badgering the intern(me) for months to treat everyone in the office to coffee/meal, and my petty ass kept dragging it cause I’m not paid enough to deal with this shit.**"
dwap8r,23,2019-11-14,A Detailed Review of Sharper Statements,onelife2reddit,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/dwap8r/a_detailed_review_of_sharper_statements/,"Like many others here on r/lawschooladmissions, I went all in this cycle. I studied for over a year to achieve a competitive LSAT score, researched and targeted my list of schools, and read as many online articles as I could get my hands on. When it was time to begin applying to schools, I decided to hire an admissions consultant to help me package my experiences in the best way possible and to keep the writing process focused and organized.

I reached out to a handful of consultants, including Moshe ( u/sharperstatements ), who ultimately won me over based on many helpful comments and satisfied client reviews I found on this sub, as well as certain qualities I noticed during our initial outreach call that he continually demonstrated throughout our time working together:

1. Moshe is shockingly accessible. He responds to texts and emails within minutes (even at ridiculously late hours of the night) and turnaround on detailed comments and edits consistently came within a day or two. In the week leading up to my app submissions, Moshe went into editing overdrive, often sending several per day. When it came time for his final proofread, he caught issues that I and nine of my friends had missed during our group editing session.
2. You can count on Moshe to tell it like it is, whether an assessment of a piece of writing, your chances at a school, the feasibility of a deadline, your outfit, or a well-researched explanation for why a particular comma doesn’t belong.
3. I never doubted Moshe’s vested interest in me as an applicant or as a human being. He took the time to establish trust and build a friendly relationship from the start, which made me feel comfortable finding my voice and opening up about personal experiences.

I started out with the “Basics Package,” which included start-to-finish help with my Resume and Personal Statement, and later upgraded to the “Foundations Package” to add on my Diversity Statement. Moshe first asked me to write my life’s story and complete a questionnaire so he could get a sense of everything that makes me tick. Then, he helped me write and revise tirelessly. There were 110 document versions in our shared drive by the end of the process, though I’ll note that not every version required major changes.

**Resume:** I already had a working Resume and assumed that this piece would require the least work out of the three. How wrong I was. I have a number of stand-out work and internship experiences, so we paid meticulous detail to the content and construction of each part of my Resume until it sparkled.

**Personal Statement:** I think picking my PS topic was the hardest part of the process. I walked in with a particular idea in mind, but Moshe made a strong argument for writing a story about a work experience I would never have thought to tell. As I began writing, I came to see the significance and narrative strength it brought to my application and, as an added bonus, the process of writing my PS helped me feel more enthusiastic about my current job!

**Diversity Statement:** Discussing my background and upbringing has always been difficult for me, but I knew I wanted to do so in my DS. I sent my first draft over to Moshe, and he left me some tough comments that helped me realize I could either play it safe or open up about some of my past struggles. Without the rapport Moshe and I had established or the confidence I had in his editing abilities and professionalism, I wouldn’t have chosen the latter, but I did, and it led to a profoundly impactful statement.

If I had to say something negative about my experience, it would be that I didn’t see as many pictures of Pebbles as anticipated! But in all seriousness, Sharper Statements is the real deal. Moshe is a shrewd editor, knowledgeable advisor, and all-around good guy. He enabled me to submit an application I feel proud of, and I’m so grateful for all of his help and encouragement along the way.

NOTE: I plan to write a follow-up post in a few months about my application outcomes, so stay tuned! I’m happy to answer questions in the comments below or you can shoot me a DM.

Some background, she's currently in an African city doing an internship with the local university, her and three other interns (white guys also in their 20s) arrived there a few months ago. From what she's told me the local guys there are very interested in getting with, dating, marrying, or being friends with a cute white girl. Basically there's a lot of horny local guys all around and they don't hide when they check her out or want her.

I'd like to chat about my girlfriend getting all this attention, cheating or being used (non-con like) by other guys. This could be with the locals or the three guys she's living with. Let me know if you want to chat or tell me what you think she's getting up to behind my back. Some more details are in my other posts."

I just found out I got accepted to grad school but I can’t decide if I should do it or not. 

Some background:

My strengths are definitely with presentation work. Specifically digital 3D modeling, rendering and other graphical work. Computer programs come easy to me and I use a wide range of them regularly for my projects (much more than most other students). 

I currently have an internship at an in-house architecture firm working on a 3000 acre sporting resort (in development), doing all their 3D modeling rending and a lot of their promotional material. Everything from interior video renders to renders of 1000 acre chunks of the proposals for the property, (they outsourced  this stuff before they hired me but now I do it all myself). 

My weaknesses are with the technical things. Building codes, structurals, construction practices. The nitty gritty. 


Because of this, if I do go for the masters I don’t really ever see myself taking the test to become a licensed architect. I would be doing it mostly for for the better job opportunities and better pay. 

My major con to attending grad school is the 2 more years of loans. I already have almost 200k in loans from undergrad and the though of adding to that scares the shit out of me. 

If money wasn’t a factor I’d attend in a heart beat, but sadly it is.

Is it worth it for me in my situation to go for my masters? Is the better job selection and pay worth adding on to my loans?"

dwcg9w,0,2019-11-14,24 and unsure of how to best move forward,chefgullette,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dwcg9w/24_and_unsure_of_how_to_best_move_forward/,"Okay, so just recently I had some issues arise that made me take a real hard look at my finances and debt situation. I´m now stuck in a difficult spot. I am 24 and about to finish school, have one semester involving just an internship left for my degree (culinary and hospitality management) So far my total debt breaks down as follows:

~25,000 Student loans 
10,000 car loan
4,000 credit card debt (2 cards maxed out, I was young and stupid during a bad time in my life battling depression so I took out the cards in order to finance myself doing a year studying abroad)

My utilization is currently over 100% and my credit score is in the mid 500s (550-575 depending on where I look)

I was doing okay to manage my debt but recently took a major hit and lost the job I had doing rideshare because while I was driving I got into a wreck and my insurance claimed they would not cover the damages as there was an issue from when I set up my insurance that doesn´t cover me when doing so which caused me to be sent through the company I was driving for´s insurance. This came in with a heavy deductible (2500) which I am unable to pay. So i not only lost that job but will be losing the car in which I owe the 10,000 on as well. This has also forced me to take a massive pay cut, going from usually making around $20 to under 10, as well as my commute becoming an hour and a half walk to work. Luckily I was able to move in with a friend so I cut my monthly rent down by over half as well. I guess I am just lost on my best action going forward, whether I should go for a hard reset with declaring bankruptcy now to try and get ahead of my debt or should i try to just ride it out.

Side note:
 Like i said with my job change I will go from being able to make around 1,000 take home a week to now maybe making 1200 take home a month. I am looking for a second job for supplemental income but until I am able to get some type of transportation for myself my options are extremely limited.
My current expenses are
225/month rent
115/month cell phone

Both salaries at $60k, benefits at Data company much better.

I'm worried that all my work in college for supply chain will be lost if I take an entry level job that isn't in supply chain (2 years of SC internship experience)

I am leaning towards the data company because it's in my home city and the benefits are much better - but will this set me back in my career if I take a job that isn't in supply chain?"

Working student jobs in Germany work kind of like internships in countries like the US, but they're paid and your contract usually runs for at least half a year and is open for extension.

I'm really nervous, it's my first job in software development, and on top of that it's not the usual kind of working student job. Usually you'll be hired, added to a team and then given different tasks in a project depending on where they need you, and if you have trouble there, you just get assigned somewhere else. At least that's how it works for most of my friends working at other companies. There's flexibility there, people know you're learning and don't hit you with the heavy hitter tasks.

In my case, I was hired to develop a tool for internal use at the company. Some guy developed a version of this (very complicated) tool about a decade ago, and some of the folks at the company want to have it redone. As far as I'm aware currently, I'm supposed to develop a sort of (functional) prototype or first version that should be focused on looks and usability.

It's a pretty big project, and they're expecting that it will take more than a year to complete, since I'll be the only student working on it, with some senior devs around to give feedback and guidance.

I'm glad I got the job, it's a great opportunity to gain some experience, but I'm also really feeling the pressure. For them, this kind of project is like a footnote, but for me it's pretty daunting. I'll try my best though!

Anyone with similar experiences, starting a job unsure whether you're up to the task?"
dwd8cj,13,2019-11-14,30m - My Sexy Yoga Class: A Reddit [SUCCESS] Story [mf] [20191],DC_Yogi,BaltimoreAndDCr4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaltimoreAndDCr4r/comments/dwd8cj/30m_my_sexy_yoga_class_a_reddit_success_story_mf/,"To be honest, when I made my first r4r post about a sexy yoga class, I didn’t think we’d actually do any yoga. Maybe the interested girl would wear some yoga pants, maybe we’d joke around and I’d have her bend over, that’s about it. But I clearly touched on something for Veronica, and she was very intent on playing out the fantasy I had outlined.

You can check my post history, but the r4r post basically advertises that I’m a certified yoga teacher who’s interested in playing out some of the more uncouth ideas I have during class. Veronica messaged me, told me she has a very similar fantasy, and that she’d love to explore it with me. We chatted for a little while, moved to kik, and exchanged pictures. She’s 23, pale skinned, and partially thanks to yoga, has a wonderful, petite body. A flat stomach, cute round ass, and A cup breasts. Long brown hair and this big smile that’s a delight to see, especially when she laughs. She explained that she was finishing her undergrad in DC this fall, and was moving away soon, so she wanted to do something ‘crazy’. That she had never really had the chance to, thanks to her fear of being recognized by someone in one of her classes or at her internship. Of course, I was happy to help.

For the record, I’m 30 years old, 5’10 and athletic, covered in tattoos and body hair. A dense beard, olive skin, short black hair, and brown eyes all thanks to my Italian heritage.

We texted quite a bit over the course of that week, traded cooking pictures, etc. Once we got on the topic of yoga, we didn’t really leave. Turns out, our fantasies were two sides of the same coin. She always feels so vulnerable during a yoga class, having her body in such compromising positions and in such tight clothing, and she’s always wanted some of her teachers to give her the sort of extra hands-on assistance that most male instructors shy away from, for obvious reasons. I, on the other hand, would never actually do anything untoward during an actual class, but I frequently daydream about taking advantage of said compromising positions and tight clothing, not to mention the whole teacher/student dynamic. Our conversation got lascivious and we were counting down the days until we could meet.

This past friday, we finally did. We decided to go out first to make sure no one was a serial killer, and had two drinks each. I’ve taught ‘normal’ classes before, but nothing like this, so the alcohol helped the conversation flow and, once we got back to my house, made the porno-esque situation a little easier to handle. Plus, the kiss and the light fondling we shared outside of the bar helped diffuse the situation quite a bit. I led her to my loft on the top floor, and let her choose from a couple mats I have, as well as provided her with a couple blocks and even a blanket. I wasn’t sure how far we would get into the class, but I figured I’d just use one of my go-to sequences and improvise where it felt right. I went to go change into gym shorts from my jeans, and I took off my henley to reveal just a tank top. She pulled off her baggy sweater to reveal a tight light blue tank top with, judging by her already hard nipples, appeared to be no bra. She was wearing a pair of grey yoga pants, too, and to her credit, only blushed slightly as I eye fucked her.

I started it off like any other class, but with my single-pointed focus on her and her alone. I led her through the warm up section and the sun salutations without much physical interaction. I generally don’t provide hands-on assistance, especially with women, because I don’t want to get in trouble or cross a line, but in this case, I just wanted us to get comfortable and maybe build a little desire. Once I guided her into the closed hip section, I amped things up a bit. A couple fingers tracing the strength in her back leg during crescent lunge, my hands straightening her waist in warrior one. I began slowing down the connective sequence of plank to up dog to down dog, standing behind her for most of it. She knew I was staring at her ass and did her best to give me a show, swaying a little bit, sticking it out more than necessary. In downward dog, I ran my palm over her ass and, despite her best efforts to keep her breathing steady, could hear her gasp. I had her remain there as I squeezed it and traced my fingers between her legs over the warmth of her pussy. She muttered, “Fuck,” but I wanted to tease her more. I had her go through the other side of the closed hip sequence, cupping her breasts when I could, tracing the waistline of her yoga pants as she began to wobble a bit. During mountain, I stood behind her and pressed my body into hers so she could feel my bulge on her ass. She smelled a little sweaty, but I love that natural, musky scent of a woman. I wrapped my arms around her and kissed the side of her neck, and she shivered. She turned around and kissed me, placing one hand on my chest and stroking my chest hair above the hem of my tank. I suggested that we go to my room, and she agreed.

We left everything set up in the loft as she followed down the stairs in a hurry. I closed the door behind her and kissed her again. I could feel a ferocity in her as she pulled up my shirt, and saw it in her eyes as she ran her hands through the hair on my chest. I helped her out of her shirt and eased her back onto the bed as my mouth attacked her breasts. Her nipples were big erasers between my lips and she moaned as she gripped my head by the hair. I kissed my way up her clavicle and her neck, and she grabbed my ass and grinded herself into me as her tongue explored mine. I repositioned so I could slide a hand between her legs, first over her damp thong. She cursed some more and bit my lip, driving her hips upwards to meet my fingers. I made my way down her body and felt the way her abs clenched against my mouth. I peeled her pants and her thong off in one fell swoop, admiring her toned legs as I kissed her calves. My eyes drifted to her pussy, all bare but for a dark brown landing strip. I left a trail of saliva along her inner thigh and eventually parked my head above her pussy, breathing on it and letting her squirm. God I love that smell.

I kissed around it, probing her smooth lips with my tongue and wrapping my arms around her thighs. She squeezed my hands with hers as I delved into her slick folds, finally getting to taste her. I moaned and slid my tongue in as far as it could go, my nose pressing against her clit. I explored with different speeds, focusing my tongue on different areas around her clit, until I found a combination that made her eyes roll back in her head. Wresting one of my hands away, I traced her slit and pushed a finger in. Then another. She put a hand over her mouth and cursed again as I added a third and found her g spot. Her hips began writhing, trying to get my fingers in just the right spot, but I held off. I let her dictate the movements while I doubled down on her clit. My tongue thrashed against it and she grabbed a pillow to put over her face. Her abs tensed up and I heard her say she was going to cum, so that’s when I began curling my fingers. She howled into the pillow as I felt her pussy contract, her ass raising from the bed as she gushed down my chin and onto my hand. Her face was contorted in ecstasy as she finally came in a silent scream. I let her down easy, pulling my hand out and grabbing at a condom in my bedside drawer.

She looked up at me with dazed eyes as I rolled the condom on and pushed her knees into her chest. The tip of my cock slid up and down her pussy until I began focusing on her clit. I had intended just to tease her, but she was going wild, so I kept at it until she squirted again, this time taking my cock in her fingers and pulling me inside of her. I was not gentle. I fucked her as hard as I could, my hands on the mattress on either side of her head as I pounded into her again and again. No dirty talk, just wet slapping, panting, and the creaking bed as we looked into each other’s eyes. She was almost sneering at me, as if showing me she could take a pounding and make me cum before she busted again. Fuck, that expression was too hot. I knew I couldn’t maintain if she kept at it. I pulled out and grabbed her by the hips to turn her over onto her hands and knees. Again, no pretense of warming up. We were both ready. I lined it up and slammed home, watching as her hands tightened around a ball of bedding. I had both hands on her ass, using them to balance as I thrusted into her relentlessly. Her head dropped to the mattress and her eyes were squinted with intensity as she came again. I pulled out and reached around to rub her clit, feeling her juices all over my fingers. “Fuck I need to ride you,” she panted, and she unsteadily moved to the side to repostion.

I laid down in the wet spot as she climbed on, lowering herself onto my dick. She moved back and forth at first, grinding her clit against my pubic bone and placing her hands on the headboard behind me. I had my hands on her hips and matched her movements until she switched up. She began going up and down, sliding over nearly my entire length, and I knew I was done for. I simply relaxed and let the orgasm wash over me as I emptied into the condom. She slammed home one last time and swiveled her hips, milking me of every last drop. She stayed there for a minute or two, running her hands through my chest hair and playing with one of my nipples as I looked up at her with a glazed grin. She eventually got off of me, cuddled up to me under a sheet and we watched some Netflix before she had to go.

Hopefully, we get to meet up again before she moves. If not, good luck with grad school!"

dwdrht,32,2019-11-14,Went to a Career Fair Last Night and Was Pleasantly Surprised,IncognitoBear,WGU_CompSci,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/dwdrht/went_to_a_career_fair_last_night_and_was/,"Last night I went to my first career fair as a WGU student. Currently I’m on pace to finish 50+ CU’s before my term ends at the end of the month. After that I’ll only have 20ish CU’s left in the program. I asked my advisor if I should consider applying for internships right now she said absolutely. She also encouraged me to pursue entry level positions since I’m so close to graduation. Lo and behold, there is a career fair for Accenture in my city that I see on my LinkedIn and against all self doubt I decided to go.

Initially I was really reluctant. I thought I wasn’t experienced enough to be considered as a candidate. Which to an extent is true. I was also worried that since I haven’t graduated from WGU yet that I wouldn’t be considered for entry level positions like I wanted. Or worse, that WGU wouldn’t even be taken seriously as a school. 

But I went anyways and was pleasantly surprised at my interactions. I was very up front with how WGU works and how the program is fully online. Most recruiters I spoke with were impressed that I was working nearly full time while taking classes so the online format hardly deterred them. Even so, most were only interested in the projects I had listed on my resume. Both of which were projects from classes I’ve taken with WGU.  The scopes of which I was also really upfront about. 

As of this morning, all the recruiters I spoke with have reached out and expressed interest in at least interviewing me. Far from a guarantee I know. However, it was really nice to see that being a WGU student was far from a hinderance and that we’re pretty much in the same boat as any other B&amp;M CS student that doesn’t come a top school.

Hopefully someone is able to take something from this post. Even if nothing comes of my interviews, I just wanted to share the validation I felt from my experience last night and maybe quell some anxieties that someone may have about how recruiters see our degree because it certainly did that for me. I also wanted to try to give back to this sub because it’s the reason I’ve made so much progress these last 6 months.

Tl;dr: Went to a career fair. Recruiters still were interested in me as a candidate despite being a WGU student."

The firms I currently have offers from have all asked me the same thing because I recently relocated/ my weird path/ the different internships - do I know what I want? 
A year ago the answer would have been Audit. Now, having taken a few coding courses and learned more about IT systems, web design, Alteryx, Tableau, etc I have a strong feeling I’ll like my job more if it involves some of those. The thing is I don’t know what to ask for, I don’t know if either of the firms will give me what I want, and I’m worried I’ll be stuck in Audit and will regret not pushing for what I really like to do. It also doesn’t help that I’m not very marketable as I am not a CPA, nor do I have strong experience in this area I want to explore.

dwehto,1299,2019-11-14,[Resolved] Police arrest alleged ‘Potomac River Rapist’ in South Carolina,AlohaWorld18,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/dwehto/resolved_police_arrest_alleged_potomac_river/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/police-arrest-alleged-potomac-river-rapist-in-south-carolina/2019/11/14/2a3b7038-0709-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html


A man suspected in a series of sexual attacks in Montgomery County and Georgetown in the 1990s — one of them fatal — has been arrested in South Carolina, according to three law enforcement officials.

Giles Warrick, 60, is implicated in the “Potomac River Rapist” assaults in Maryland and the District, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition they not be named to discuss the case ahead of its official announcement.

[Police target ‘Potomac River Rapist’]

The arrest could end one of the areas most notorious cases that has long vexed investigators and frustrated victims and their families. The last known attack occurred in 1998 near the river in Georgetown when a 28-year-old biochemist was beaten to death with a slab of rock.

Warrick was arrested in Horry County, S.C., which includes Myrtle Beach. The county police department did not immediately return calls seeking comment.

Police would not discuss what led them to the suspect after all these years.

This article from 2017:

https://www.thedailybeast.com/washington-dc-rapist-why-police-think-he-could-be-back

It was 7:30 p.m. on a crisp November evening in 1997 when Jane L. arrived home to her townhouse in North Potomac, a tony enclave near Washington, D.C. She was walking down the hallway when she noticed what looked like a blanket draped over a chair in her den. When she moved closer, a ghostly figure arose from the chair, tossed the blanket over her head, pushed her to the floor, and sexually assaulted her. The man, who police had dubbed the Potomac Rapist, threatened to kill her before he walked out the front door. Outside on the front steps, the sound of his scream ripped through the night.

“It was like, ‘Yeeeeah,’” said Washington D.C. cold case detective Todd Williams. “It was like someone screaming in victory.”

It would turn out to be the final attack in a series of eight rapes that terrorized the Maryland neighborhood over a seven-year period beginning in 1991. The perpetrator stalked his victims on weeknights near or in new housing developments. Once he gained entrance, he would cover their heads with blankets before assaulting them. He would tell them that he knew them before he disappeared into the night. Montgomery County detectives patrolled the areas for years and set up surveillance around new developments but never caught a break.

Now cold case detectives from two states are starting a full-fledged search to catch the elusive predator. To aid in their search, Washington D.C. detectives are launching a website dedicated to the Potomac Rapist, a cyber tool that is becoming increasingly common as detectives across the country attempt to resurrect old cold cases where clues have long dried up.

Eight months after Jane L. was attacked, unbeknownst to the Montgomery detectives, the Potomac Rapist struck again 24 miles away in Washington. This time, he went further.

It was a breezy, balmy evening on August 1, 1998. 27-year-old Christine Mirzayan was walking to her dorm on the picturesque campus of Georgetown University when she was attacked, sexually assaulted and sadistically murdered. Her body was discovered the following day off a pathway in the woods. Her killer left behind a mess—her skull had been bashed in with a 70-pound rock. In an attempt to make it look like a robbery, he put a brick in her purse and threw it into a nearby canal, where it was discovered six months later by a construction crew when the canal was being drained.

The death of Mirzayan, the daughter of Iranian immigrants and a Congressional fellow with the American Association for the Advancement of Science shocked the tight-knit college community. For years detectives suspected that her gruesome slaying was linked to the strange deaths of Joyce Chiang, a young government lawyer whose body was found in 1999 along the banks of the Potomac River, and Chandra Levy, the Washington D.C. intern who was romantically linked to California congressman Gary Condit and disappeared in May of 2001.

“They thought there might be a serial killer, but it turned out there was no connection,” said Williams. Levy's killer was convicted of her murder last year and sentenced to 60 years. Williams said Chiang died in a botched robbery attempt. 

Then, in 2009, a possible clue to Mirzayan’s murder surfaced. Williams and his partner Tony Brigidini were stunned to learn that DNA evidence linked her murder to the Potomac Rapist, a slippery and cunning assailant whose MO was remarkably different than Mirzayan’s killer’s. The rapes in the Potomac area were all indoor attacks. Mirzayan’s attacker grabbed her off the street and killed her.

Now, with the help of the internet—which barely existed when the rapist began operating—Williams and his partner think they may have a second chance at catching him. At the end of June, the Washington D.C. Police Department plans to unveil a website dedicated to finding the Potomac Rapist, a technique investigators around the country are starting to use to kick-start cold cases. Once they do, longtime residents of the city will likely be stunned to learn that the criminal who made frightening headlines over a decade ago might be once again working in their midst.

“We are trying to get this out,” said Williams. “Clearly we have a serial rapist out there. At this point, we are trying to be proactive and not sit around and wait for someone to call. Somebody knows this guy.”

In the Potomac Rapist, detectives have painted a chilling portrait of a skilled burglar who, despite the populated communities he targeted, stalked his victims for days before breaking into their homes and waiting for them. As his perverse appetites grew, he became more brazen. And as news spread, his attacks seemed to become more violent and theatrical. He would try to engage his victims in a perverse form of pillow talk, asking them about their own previous sexual encounters while he raped them.

“He wasn’t concerned that people were home,” said Williams. “He was confident he could accomplish what he came to do and leave. He took more of a risk as the cases progressed and he became more violent.”

Police are looking at what clues his behavior can offer. For instance, he attacked his victims only on weekday evenings between 6 and 10 p.m. “He is attacking these women at a high-risk time,” said Montgomery County Police Department detective Joe Mudano, who is working with Washington cops on the cases. “The first thing we thought of was he is accountable to someone so he can’t be out all night.” 

As the cops started to investigate they learned that the rapist was articulate and soft spoken, and in the majority of cases, he threw a sheet over his victims’ heads to prevent them from seeing his face. “There’s something in me that thinks that he might have had prior contact with some of the women,” said Mudano. “He does not want to be seen. Maybe there is some distinct mark. He turns them around so they don’t see his face. Maybe he is ashamed?""

The first rape occurred in May of 1991 in a new housing development in North Potomac. The 31-year-old victim had just arrived home from a trip. Police said the rapist cut the telephone cord before he gained access through the basement window. That fall he struck again, assaulting an 18-year-old college student who was babysitting three young children. The teenager told police that she was attacked shortly after her boyfriend went home. Her assailant was lying in wait in the garage. “We aren’t positive whether she was the intended target or the homeowner,” said Mudano.

In November of 1991, he attacked an anesthesiologist in Bethesda, Maryland, gaining entrance through a second-floor window and hiding until she came home. Police said he lured her to the front door by knocking on the wall, then ambushed her as she walked to the door. He tied her up with rope. After her ordeal, he turned on the television and engaged her in conversation. “He told her he had seen her around the hospital,” said Williams. Later, the victim told police she suspected an intruder had broken into her house the previous week and might have eaten food from her fridge.

Although the police pressure was mounting, a month later, he returned again to the North Potomac site and attacked another woman whose husband was away on a business trip. He punched her in the face and warned her to keep quiet so she wouldn’t wake up her children. A neighbor later told police that she saw an African-American male hanging around in the woods behind the victim’s house. She described him as clean shaven with a stocky build, in his late twenties or early thirties, around 180 pounds, and between 5-foot-9 and 6 feet.

“By this point we are sure they are connected,” said Mudano. “They are spread out so much so it is tough to do surveillance. We pulled plain-clothes cops in to stake out different neighborhoods. We thought he had to be trolling, spending time setting things up. We went to all the neighborhoods and gave people a general description of the suspect. No one got a good look at him.”

It seemed like he was becoming bolder. A month later and a block away from the last attack, he barged into the basement apartment of a live-in housekeeper less than 20 minutes after her employers left to go to a movie. But this time, the victim fought back. His rape attempt was foiled, but he viciously beat her with a portable stereo before fleeing. The next-door neighbor told police she saw someone lurking behind her neighbor’s air conditioner 30 minutes before the attack, but failed to call 911. 

The attacks abruptly ended until 1994. Then, he attacked a mother of two who lived near a new housing development. She told police that one hour before the assault she received a call from a man looking for her husband, a used-car salesman. The caller claimed the woman’s husband ripped him off and sold him a car with a faulty engine. “We figure he crossed paths with the husband at one point,” said Murtado. “He says, ‘Your husband is not as nice a guy as you think.’ He called to make sure he wasn’t home. He knew the husband was a car salesman.”

After another lengthy break he resurfaced again in February of 1997 in a middle class suburb of Montgomery County and attacked a 19-year-old girl in the kitchen of her townhouse. Before he left, he snatched a $100 bill from her birthday card.

Nine months later, the Potomac Rapist assaulted his last victim in Maryland, and eight months after that, he killed Mirzayan, a newly married intern with a promising future in biochemistry. The student from California was in the last week of her fellowship program.

“He was outwardly expressing his victories,” said Williams. “With Christine, he reached the highest level of violence he could achieve. But he was also escalating his risk factor as well.”

Williams said it is entirely conceivable the Potomac Rapist has stopped. But, then again, maybe he hasn’t. “Maybe the murder didn’t satisfy his urges and it caused him to step back,” he said. “Maybe he was arrested. Maybe his urges have changed. He may have changed his pattern. We just don’t know.”"

### Abstract

This article, which is partly biographical and partly scientific, summarizes a life in academic medicine. It relates my progress from benchside to bedside and then to academic and research administration, and concludes with the teaching of human biology to college undergraduates. My experience as an intern (anno 1953) treating a youngster in diabetic ketoacidosis underscored our ignorance of the controls in human fuel metabolism. Circulating free fatty acids were then unknown, insulin could not be measured in biologic fluids, and beta-hydroxybutyric acid, which was difficult to measure, was considered by many a metabolic poison. The central role of insulin and the metabolism of free fatty acids, glycerol, glucose, lactate, and pyruvate, combined with indirect calorimetry, needed characterization in a near-steady state, namely prolonged starvation. This is the main topic of this chapter. Due to its use by brain, D-beta-hydroxybutyric acid not only has permitted man to survive prolonged starvation, but also may have therapeutic potential owing to its greater efficiency in providing cellular energy in ischemic states such as stroke, myocardial insufficiency, neonatal stress, genetic mitochondrial problems, and physical fatigue.

We had both landed internships that would turn into jobs. Since working at her job, she has grown bored with in and has been searching since about July for another job. I have encouraged her, reviewed her resume, etc. Now she’s decided she wants to try and get back in the military and become an officer. (She was previously active duty). I told her she should go for what she wants, but she shouldn’t give up applying for engineering jobs. She then said “you make it sound like I haven’t been trying”. I told her that’s not what I had intended but was really trying to encourage her to apply to every single job out there. I followed that up by telling her it took me 2 years of rejection letters to get my internship. 

She then decided to change the subject for a while. And then when she realized she had another 10 pounds to lose, she got upset, and seemed to not what to do it anymore. I decided to leave my opinion out of it and respond simply, but encouragingly that she’ll get there. But have been hesitant on responding again because I’m trying to keep negativity out of my life, and I don’t want to be misconstrued again when I say the same things. I also don’t want her to miss out on an opportunity in our field due to going back into the military. 

So: Am I the asshole for pushing her to continue applying for jobs?"

It's been a month since I decided to give up on it. I never got an internship, and I'm already a senior in CS. 

Everytime I read the application forms, I just cannot shake off the doubts I have in my head. ""Jeez, I got nothing to offer. I'm worthless. Who would want me? Why would I bother doing this? I'm not gonna get anything.""

I know I gotta start somewhere. I just kept thinking the entry bar was too high for me. I never got a call back, an email for interview, anything. I know some ppl applied hundreds of places to get just one. But I always think that unlike others who at least have something to offer and just need to find the right place for it, I on the other hand have nothing. No real experience in software development. No real jobs (except for my on campus job) No real talent/area of specialty. My school performance is sub-meh.

But, today I have decided to pick my sorry ass up and do some real internship-hunting! Still excruciating with the self-doubt, but I got at least 2 applications done."

dwgnak,147,2019-11-14,My Hero Academia's tournament arc is overrated,noolvidarminombre,CharacterRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/dwgnak/my_hero_academias_tournament_arc_is_overrated/,"For some reason,some people say MHA's tournament arc was amazing. But, in my opinion, this is really far from the truth. I'm gonna explain why I think this arc isn't as good as people say.

#**Deku vs Shinso**

Everyone knows what's wrong with this fight: Izuku acts out of character, ignoring Ojiro's advice and falls victim to Shinso's quirk because of that, only to be saved by a power he didn't know he had, and procceds to win. There's not much I can say that's not already been said. 

Horikoshi wanted to have his cake and eat it too: he wanted Shinso to trap Deku with his quirk and to allow Deku to escape from it, but forgot to think of a way for both to reallistically happen with the powersets already and characters already established, so he used an OOC moment to start the conflict and a deus ex machina to solve it

#**Momo vs Tokoyami**

This fight's only relevance was starting Momo's character development, and while I love character development and fleshing out, this could've been done better. What this fight tells us is that Momo isn't a quick thinker like Bakugo, and since her initial plan didn't work, she couldn't think of anything else.

However, I find the whole situation kinda inconsistent to what was shown before, in season 1, Momo made the electricity-proof thing to protect herself from Denki's quirk, while being surrounded by villians. Hell, in the race she made a cannon to blast the robots. You are telling me this girl couldn't plan anything other than ""I will make a shield and a stick"" in the time between the announcement of who she would fight and the fight itself? She could've perfectly made a cannon that shot a net, or anything, really, the only time she couldn't make something because she didn't know it's composition was Aizawa's scarf. 

The way Momo was defeated makes it look like she was dumbed down only to progress her storyline, which felt very forced.

#**Uraraka vs Bakugo**

Let's start by looking this from the meta point of view: Uraraka, a girl whose power relied on touch, vs Bakugo, the series rival, whose power is shooting explosions from his hands, there was no way Uraraka would've ever won. This fight tries to make you think Uraraka will win, only to make Bakugo make a big explosion and defeat her anyways.

The fight didn't have any significance either. Yes Bakugo respects Urararaka now, kinda, but up to episode 4 of the FOURTH season, they havent interacted in any meaningful way, so that respect means nothing.

During this fight, Aizawa calls out on the audience's sexism because Urarararaka is a worthy oponent to Bakugo and they shouldn't treat her as weaker because she is a girl, which makes me ask: If Horikoshi really wanted to give a message about how girls are just as capable of fighting as boys, how come none of the girls get an important battle in which they win?

Mina won against Aoyama, Vines girl against Denki, Hatsume against Iida but then she walked out of bounds, and then the other 2 who advance to the next round are unceremoniously pushed out of bounds by their oponents, who are both boys. Not only do these fight not receive any spotlight, but are treated as *jokes*, Aoyama's belt making his pants get loose, Iida being humiliated by Hatsume for marketing, and vines girl defeating Denki instantly because he was cocky.

Once again, Horikoshi wanted to have his cake and eat it too: he wanted to have this message about how girls are just as capable as boys, without having the cool male characters actually lose a fight against a girl.

#**Deku vs Todoroki**

This is almost universally-agreed to be on of the best fights in the tournament, if not the best. It has by far the best animation of all the fights in the tournament, and possibly the entirety of season 2, but besides the hype, it is not good.

 The fight consists of Todoroki using ice and Deku defending with his finger snaps, with Todoroki having flashbacks of his trauma from time to time, which Deku takes advantage of to beat the shit out of him, until Deku finishes his shonen MC inspiring speech and Todoroki uses his fire to finally shut him up.

My biggest problem, besides choreography, is Todoroki's reaction to Deku's speech. Not the cliche of the MC giving a speech to inspire his opponent ends up working, but Deku uses Todoroki's trauma to make him use his fire.

 Deku tells Todoroki, an abuse victim, to ""stop screwing around""  and use his fire, when he *knows* that Todoroki doesn't use his fire side as a rejection of his father.Deku gives him shit for ""trying to become the number one with only half of his strenght"" while he still had an enormous advantage every oponent but him and Bakugo while still using only his ice, making his fire unnecesary.

MHA fans say the series is subversive, while this fight is clear proof it isnt. If it wasn't a super generic shonen, Todoroki could've used his fire side to warm himself up, and use his ice to finish Deku off, there wasn't much he could do with an arm and ten fingers broken, and 5 double broken fingers. Endeavor, Todoroki's abuser, got what he wanted at the end of this fight.

#**Iida vs Todoroki**

This fight, like many of the fights, lasts barely a minute and a half. Nothing important really happens, Todoroki defeats Iida quickly. What bothers me is the potential for what would've happened had Deku won the previous round and fought Iida. 

You could have Iida win and either: still feel insecure because he could only really defeat Deku after he had big wounds, or have him happy for defeating Deku and then hit him with the news about his brother, quitting the finals and making Baklugo angry because he didn't even get a final fight. It would put more emphasis on Iida's respect for his brother than him quitting on the fight for the third place.

The potential was there make it better, but nothing happened

#**Todoroki vs Bakugo**

As the rest of the filler fights, nothing really happened here, a big deal is made out of Todoroki still not being comfortable using his fire, but the next time we see him he is using it no problem, so it didn't really matter, like the rest of this arc. A really dissapointing note to end this arc on.

#**Consequences**

Since it was a school tournament, not many permanent things could happen. The arc's purpose was so pro-heroes could choose students for internships, with the risk of someone from another class entering 1-A and replacing a student. 

Even though noone chose Deku for his internships, he still went to Gran Torino, who was All Might's teacher, basically the best person to teach him. ANd we hadn't any time with the students of 1-A to care if they were replaced by someone in the tournament, but no one got replaced (even though some 1-B students were much better than the worst 1-A students) so it didn't matter anyways.

This was also the last time I remember Uraraka doing anything, the second to last time Iida did anything (being the next arc the last time) and the start of Todoroki becoming part of Trio.

**TL;DR** It was a pretty underwhelming tournament. Lots of filler battles, the non-filler battle aren't that good, and no real stakes or permanent consequences. I think the only reason this arc is praised is because of the Todoroki vs Deku fight. Overall, boring and predictable, the only expectation that was subverted is that it was going to be good."

dwjg2a,0,2019-11-14,25 M4A (You Playing F) In Search of the Elusive Long-Term Detailed Story,WritingWizard124,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dwjg2a/25_m4a_you_playing_f_in_search_of_the_elusive/,"Good evening!

So tonight, I've decided to take my time and craft a request thread that more adequately states what kinds of things I am looking for in a roleplay.  I've been roleplaying for approximately 15 years now on various chat rooms and forums, though only about 6 or so have involved smut of any kind.  I love writing, and as such, I'm really looking to find a writing partner that will intrigue me, entertain me, inspire my writing, and create an altogether fun story with me.  And I hope that in return, I will do all of these things and more for you in our stories.

Granted, we all know that a lot of roleplay involves smut, and I absolutely enjoy that as well.  But smut without a story is just a bad porn film, and that's certainly not what I'm looking for.  I need story.  I need plot and world building.  Smut is important and fun and all that good stuff, but why are our characters suddenly sleeping together.  I don't believe a good story has a character simply look at the other and decide to sleep with them.  Something has to stir within both characters, and that something is what I try to explore thoroughly in all my writings.

Now, before I get into the ideas that I have, I would first like to say that I am absolutely open to your ideas as well.  This isn't a one-sided thing, and it never will be with me.  It's important that I enjoy myself, but it's also important to me that you enjoy writing with me as well.  And if you find yourself not enjoying an aspect of a roleplay, I never will be offended if you let me know what you're not enjoying about the story, and we can work to curve things toward another direction if need be.  And certainly, I'll be open with you as a partner as well if things aren't really being enjoyed on my end also.  With that being said, I will -never- ghost a roleplay.  There comes a time in any roleplay where it isn't quite as fun anymore, or burnout happens.  I get it.  But I'd feel guilty as hell if I ever just quit a RP without an explanation, and I'll give you that courtesy.  I just ask that you give me the same.

Now, as you can see in the tag, I'm open to roleplaying with men and women.  But the one requirement I will have is that you MUST play the female role.  I consider myself a fairly flexible writer, but I'm terrible at writing female characters, and I definitely want the person I'm roleplaying with to play the female role.  I am a straight male, but I don't mind if you are a male behind the screen.  All that matters to me is that your character is female.

Now for the fun part:

**Limits/Kinks:**



I will eventually put a more detailed F-list on here, but limits-wise, I am not into non-con, gore, bathroom stuff.  The extremes essentially.  I won't say that I'm vanilla per se, but I do tend to enjoy more usual modern slice of life themes.  I love playful teasing, things happening in water (pools, hot tubs, showers, etc.), small things that on their own don't mean much, but add up toward much more.  Teasing, brushing up against one another, accidental nudity, those kind of things.  Beyond that, if something makes sense in the general flow of the RP, you'll usually find that I'm up for it, but if ever in doubt, just ask.



**RP Ideas:**



Again, not an all-inclusive list, and you're more than welcome to offer your own ideas, but here's some ideas I've compiled of late.  I'll continue to add to this list as I discover new ideas that I enjoy.



**Celebrities** - 

I LOVE roleplaying within the celebrity genre.  Probably one of my favorite things to do.  I generally am looking for the female character to be the celebrity in this, though I suppose for the right writing partner, that could be flexible as well.  Currently, I have scenes involving celebrity incest (Dad/daughter, brother/sister, mom/son) and celebrity fan encounters (this one currently takes place at a convention locally to my character).  But feel absolutely free to suggest your own celebrity ideas as well.  I would love to try something new in this genre.  In the latter scene, I'm willing to play an older or a younger fan, and willing to play any ages allowable by site rules.

Some celebrities I enjoy playing opposite of include, but are not limited to (In no particular order): Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lawrence, Kaley Cuoco, Lauren Cohan, Christina Hendricks, Demi Lovato, and sometimes Taylor Swift depending on the role.  Absolutely feel free to suggest some of your favorites as well!


**Teacher/student or coach/athlete** - 

I really enjoy the power dynamic between the two here, but this isn't your cliche ""You're failing a test, so do things for the teacher to get your grades up"" kind of trope.  That's too easy.  That doesn't cause me to think or be interested in any way.  For these two ideas, I am willing to play either the older or younger role, and again, the younger character, I'm fine with that character being anything allowed within site rules.  

My basic idea for both involve a pairing of two individuals who actually get along great.  Perhaps the teacher or the coach has been their teacher or coach for some time, allowing for a better relationship/bond between the two than most of the people their age.  Nothing unprofessional has happened between them at the time the RP starts, but through time, a very inappropriate relationship begins to build between the pair.  I do tend to love writing scenes involving disallowed relationships, which brings me to:


**Incest** - 

Disallowed relationships really thrill me.  Relationships that society looks down on.  And of course, this is the case with incest.  No, not something I'm into in real life, but writing it has always been enjoyable to me for whatever reason.  For these, I've got scenes involving dad/daughter, brother/sister, or mom/son.  Open to other suggestions as always.


**Boss/employee** - For this, I think the easiest way is to post the scene idea that I have:

*I am a manager at a major marketing firm in New York. Basically what we do is try to get various companies to pay us to run their entire advertising campaign for them. It's a big money business, but someone has to do it, and all the stress and burden falls on our shoulders - they just 'show us the money.'

Unfortunately, that does mean a lot of trips away from home; away from family. But I have a loving wife, and she has been very understanding.

A very big automobile company based in California is my next client, and this one deal could pay for all of our operations for the next year and beyond. And so, being the best representative at the company, I'm the one tasked with flying out that way and convincing them to sign with us.

One problem, my assistant. She's tasked to go with me, but she can't do her job properly. She mixes up phone calls, she messes up the calendar. All of the tasks she is assigned to, she can't do. So I fire her, just a day before I would need someone to come with me to help me stay organized.

I try to see if I can borrow other managers' assistants, but they were all booked as well. So it's recommended that I give you a chance, a young intern in our firm. They say you work hard, and on such short notice, I didn't have much of a choice.

So I agree, calling you into my office to talk to you about the opportunity.*



**TV Show/Movies** - 

Of course, I also enjoy writing within television and movie universes as well.  I find this is the hardest category to find a match, as it does require both people to have some kind of a clue about the film or show itself.  With that being said, I've written scenes within shows like The Big Bang Theory, Girl Meets World, Gotham, Game of Thrones, Marvel Cinematic, and the like.  Always open for those, and this list will expand as well.  Also open to your ideas as well.




As stated, this list and this post will be ever evolving.  At the end of the day, I'm looking for ideas.  Compelling stories.  World-building.  If my ideas aren't something you enjoy, don't hesitate to send me some of your ideas.  I might not like them, but who knows, your idea might intrigue me.  As long as they don't break my limits posted above, I might be open-minded toward them.



Please note that I am ALWAYS looking for capable partners.  So if you see this post, whether I'm online or not, feel free to hit me up.  I will respond as soon as humanly possible.  Let's quench each other's literary thirst!"
dwjt02,6,2019-11-14,Google products seems to be getting worse again,edoardo849,google,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/dwjt02/google_products_seems_to_be_getting_worse_again/,"Just a feeling, but I’m thinking that Google is at it again with low quality products, maybe because they are shifting their attention to something else, who knows. I am a long-time gmail, gsuite and gcp user, but the quality of the software is getting worse: it seems that they don’t perform QA, testing or code reviews. A couple of examples:

* Google Keep’s drawing feature breaks constantly both on iPad and on the Pixel Slate: notes not saved or lost, app crashing constantly, etc...
* gSuite‘s example code snippets (for google apps script) are never tested resulting in bugs and code breaking. On many online videos Google always presents these snippets as “made by our interns” which... great for interns, but a paying customer maybe expects something a bit more stable
* Many GCP systems are just a mess: in some instances, especially on cloud functions, Google uses experimental, third-party unstable libraries in production (looking at you, node-grpc), leading to major outages for customers

I feel that bigG is slowly confusing experimentation with sloppiness of execution and, worst of all, that it‘s transforming itself into the Microsoft of the mid 2000’s, while Microsoft of the present is slowly becoming what Google was years ago. Pity."

dwko9s,1,2019-11-14,Am I insane for wanting to go into finance as a formerly nerdy asian,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/dwko9s/am_i_insane_for_wanting_to_go_into_finance_as_a/,"I go to a top 10 college, it's target school for investment banking. I don't want to repeat myself but I am short (5'5), Asian, have a kid's voice, people have commented on how weird my face is because I have an underbite + eczema + acne, its no secret I'm an ugly mofo, look kinda like TrumpSC but not fat, no glasses, better haircut, don't exactly have soft features bc of my underbite. Parents so overprotective and beta that they would be willing to feed me and let me neet for the rest of my life and give me their house when they die. I have my down days especially when my skin gets incredibly bad but other days I roll with it and own it. Basically I'm a work in progress on my insecurities with that shit but we'll see.

I was going to go into medicine or computer engineering, but I was like fuck that shit I don't want to exist in a comfort zone, same reason why I applied to this college which is known for its sports and frattiness instead of some shit like UChicago. I was going to end up at a basic ass college but I wrote a god-tier essay and got in with below average stats and extracurriculars, used to be depressed + porn + video games all fucking day in high school, read some freud thoreau random intellectual shit here and there, philosophical little guy

I'm trying to transform my fucking mind because of how high inhib and overanalytical it is, I just have a hard time vibing with dudes here, I don't really operate well with the banter of the fratty-type dudes or business dudes. No luck with girls so far (yes I am a virgin, never had girlfriend or anything). I think I'm too nice and bad at banter, social intelligence just kinda bad in general. The only dudes that like hanging out with me are nerdy types that are going into careers with no women, I mean they have girlfriends or better luck with women but they run beta game and get away with it because they have at least one attractive trait (tall, good looking, or wealthy/culturally in the know).

Basically I'm not playing to my strengths at all, but I know I need to improve my social skills in general and stop being a lazy fuck, basically, if I'm putting myself on the finance track I need to land an internship sophomore or junior year it will force me to go for it. in some ways i just want to prove these fuckers wrong

I feel like if I get my shit together and just develop those social skills through forcing myself to go for finance I'll get what I want in life, which is to stop being treated like a fucking kid, get money &amp; pussy, sounds superficial but I can do the buddhist monk/master novelist shit after I am finally not treated like a fucking loser by women and society, etc.

I'm hoping that this shit will force me to either fucking die or come out a winner and make fat stacks, I swear there's no chance I'm going to get laid if I just keep hanging out with engineering/computer science types or cultivate any big winner mentality

I've been isolated all my life always the outsider... the truth is it is really just bullshit how attractive affluent tall white dudes will beat me if we're both applying the same amount of effort (and at the competitive level we're talking about they probably are), so is this fucking stupid to go for finance or no. still haven't even found a solid circle of people that has girls in it

HONESTLY, I do not know if I'm going to be able to land an internship if we are going to be clear on this shit, people have an easier time vibing with and being around people that are conventionally attractive than unattractive people, might be hard for me to make strong connections and get on the inside. I legit see this trend on campus all the time, people of the same level of attractiveness hang out with each other

Some days are definitely hell for me, I'm no faggot but anyone in my position knows this shit is fucking brutal, no connections, no one really gives a fuck about you, just an alien looking fucker who is too high inhib and intellectual and belongs in a 19th century psychoanalytic intellectual circle or some gay shit like that.

Thanks for the advice fuckers sorry for the novel. Just tell me your story, i'm here to listen and learn

tldr: I'm playing life on ultra hardmode, is finance going to make me suicidal or no, do I have a chance?"
dwls68,3,2019-11-14,Overqualified at the same time Underqualified.,pengitty,jobadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobadvice/comments/dwls68/overqualified_at_the_same_time_underqualified/,"So some background and please bare with me as this isn’t even everything about me, I am Mexican American (this is important later on) I went to early college classes to get a CNA license with a phlebotomy and EKG tech license when I was in high school, was even offered an amazing start as a part time night shift $13 an hour job at the hospital I interned at from when I was just barely 18 yrs old and barely graduating from both high school and the college, but at the time I had no vehicle of my own and for the most part have a mother, who I suppose meant well but due to a whole complicated reasons of rather shitty ignorance and thinking I was being greedy to not go to college , forced me out of taking the job offer and made me go to a university. (High school made us apply to colleges and I got accepted immediately to a local university.) problem was I didn’t want to go to college, I already had an associate thanks to my CNA, but I didn’t have the support I now have, my mother accused and blatantly lies saying I’m also a college drop out (she doesn’t even know what the word means and both college graduations she wasn’t ever there to see my ceremonies because she preferred going to these paid vacations her make up pushing company did for their top sellers) We live in an area where work is hard to find and is a mix of urban to rural, so commuting is 95% required, even going to college in it of itself was a disaster of a commute with  in just dedicating time to Half an hour to an hour just to be on time and ready for classes.

I tried hard finding work during my full time at college, but nothing panned out, any time I had an interview I didn’t knew I shouldn’t have had my CNA license in the resume because it made me way to overqualified. Graduating with a BA in English, (was planning to be a teacher but the school went through some weird stuff that affected me and 20 other students from our gpas to the school dropping a bunch of classes that students were taking and they never bothered checking to see if someone was involved with those said classes. Meaning? A huge fucked up thing where I and those students had to defend our right to graduate and having to basically take on an unpaid internship with somewhere under the department agreement that the hours working there could count as school hours. I had to do that for a year and a half to graduate. But even then they  couldn’t allow us to get into a teaching program because technically our gpa was affected from them removing and dropping some courses so we couldn’t apply into the program anyways. 

I ended up getting a job at subway which wasn’t too bad, but ended up ending early due to lack of car (commuting to it alone could be over 30 minutes and at the time no one else within my family could afford to lend me their ride and we don’t really have public services to get there so essentially this job was actually wasting my money just for me to drive there to work and majority of my money ended up in just gas and student loan repayment.) after that once I got a car that somewhat worked, I was unemployed for a good year trying hard and going to interviews, nothing seemed to work.

Anytime I went to an interview, I would do well from the feedback I get, but when I ask about an update, I’d be told they went with someone else who had more experience or that I was a bit to overqualified or under qualified for the work, and often an even bigger reason was my bilingual skills were just average for their needs. We live in a 95% Hispanic community so many people just don’t speak English at all and it’s understandable since we are 45 minutes away from the border.

I ended up getting some help with my aunt to work with her at a gas station in the mean time to renew my phlebotomy license, once I renewed it I applied to a center and was finally happy, someone was giving me a chance.

The job proved to be rather toxic, and while it paid good, started to affect my mental health, there were huge turnovers and people quit, rumors flying around that were false and should have been reported to hr (drug accusations and sexual misconduct). The donors that would come in could some times even threaten us or be waiting for us outside the building and almost stalk us and management didn’t really do much, many of us were desperate for work as not many places even pay as much as they do (final pay I had from them was 12.55 an hour, and where I live, that is really good and for many people living here, it was worth getting abused for or treated badly.) however, Nothing any of us did was ever good enough, and if you weren’t best friends with the managers you’d be always looked as unreliable. Our manager even would get so mad if someone tried to go to another job or trying to go to a sister location that If you used her as a reference she’d actually would badmouth you. 

I had to get out of that job, but no place would hire me because of where I worked at, many places wouldn’t hire a phlebotomist (even licensed) if they worked as a donation center. So I went to a tech school, passed with a high gpa in the field of medical administration assistant technology, and after that went through so many Interviews. 

The fact that I did excellent in this tech class that involved anywhere from administration work to medical coding and billing, and even getting a certified coding specialist license to legally work as one, didn’t matter because every job (even the very minimum wage paying ones, which is ridiculous because they required people with 3 to 5 years experience in it but were only planning on giving them the state minimum wage when those with such experience were worth $12 and up)

I sell myself well in these interviews, even justify that while yes I may not have the experience that I was trained in a way to adapt to any medical office and work with them effectively. It still wasn’t enough. My average Spanish was also a huge hinderance for me, I even explained that I can understand it I just have trouble saying it back but that it wouldn’t stop me because realistically I’d use my resources to communicate with someone, and while I would have loved to just move somewhere where knowing Spanish is not a must and isn’t to be as much of an issue, financially i couldn’t even leave my own mother’s home (she refuses I try and move out anyways since I can’t even pay for rent and she’s right so it’s just better this way as she’s willing to assist me in giving me shelter) I have a huge debt from the university and tech school,ended up getting a loan debt because the school requires you to pay it as well as financial aid, my car is just two years old and I have payments on it (I had an older car with no payments but the amount of repair it needed almost devastated me and had me max out credit cards in just repairs alone.), and my family all has their own issues that end up bleeding on to me as well.

People tell me to just learn Spanish, but the time it takes to learn it requires actual TIME to learn it’s not something that can be done in a single f*cking day, and yes I know that I’m Mexican American but there wasn’t really a necessity in my home to know Spanish, but if I could go back in time I’d hit myself, my mom and dad, for not pushing my self and my brothers to learn it. I got lucky though, was offered a great job, despite my weakness and my lack of experience. I worked hard during my first month there, asked questions, but sometimes was ignored, or when I brought up concerns they’d gloss over me or interrupt me thinking they know what I was going to say, and end up giving me completely different advice then what I needed for certain situations. It was a dispatching services where we just send technicians to peoples home for convenience b we still ran insurances and collected payments and did scheduling. 

I didn’t complain, I tried my best, there was maybe three patients i couldn’t understand because for me they had such a thick accent and reception was awful, but I didn’t see it as bad, and tried to work with my office buddy and tried to keep up with the big shots, but apparently my questions made it seem as if I was Lacking confidence (I was just trying to make sure not to step on anyone’s toes while also getting on the same page with everyone because everyone did something different and I wanted to see what was best since I was the main closer leaving me with all the work to myself at the end of the night from emergency calls to scheduling for future exams) Barely into my second month I was called in though, they brought up to me that while I was doing great and responded perfectly with the systems and even grasped it fast. That I just wasn’t up to par with their expectation, and that even though it was a three month training and the usual 90 day probation, that they were concerned that I wasn’t going to be like their 2 year workers. I asked if my performance was bad or that if I had complaints, and it turns out that no I didn’t and that despite my mediocre Spanish, that no patient or doctor has ever complained about me and the techs didn’t either. It was just the very few times (and I mean rarely) they the actual manager was in the office; he would see me asking questions or listen in on the one Spanish patient that ended up being drunk and I couldn’t understand his slurred speech over the phone. I stood up for  myself and explained to the point that the other assistant managers seem to understood and were even going to pause to speak with the manager with the new information they just got directly from me. but the manager just didn’t want to take a chance in me, they let me go, even said laid off due to Medicare or Medicaid (can’t remember because at that point I was trying so hard to fight back tears) was raising their prices affecting them since it’s a small company, they even explained that maybe they shouldn’t have hired anyone while going through this transition with the insurances, and said that in the summer they’ll try to reopen the position and that I would be high on their list.

To be fair, after all that, I didn’t want anything to do with them because I gave up a job, as toxic and giving me suicidal thoughts on the daily as it was, I gave up a job that paid well enough to suffer through it just to stay afloat. I took a chance with them, but that same day, I contacted the school career agency, explained what happened and immediately since then have applied to well over 100+ places. I didn’t hesitate to apply, but it’s been four weeks since I’ve been let go of, I have gone to over 30 interviews, but nothing seems to want me. I was to overqualified for some places, and to under qualified in a majority of them.

I don’t seem to know what I’m doing wrong, and I seem to always have a good interview except for the few that just off the bat didn’t seem to even care to ask me any questions and just dismissed me well over ten minutes into the interview.

If anyone has any advice, what should I do? What has worked for you in to getting that edge on the interview, or that lasting impression to the hiring manager, or even that secret that made you the absolute pick?

Tl;dr : just awful luck and shitty at life, took a chance on a new job and got fired, been struggling to get work but too overqualified and to under qualified, Spanish weak af compared to others as bilingualism is a must in 99% of jobs here. Can’t seem to get someone to take a chance in me. What to do?"

dwml9s,63,2019-11-15,Comprehensive rundown of TXST Computer Science and my experience entering the SW industry,KillingForCompany,txstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/txstate/comments/dwml9s/comprehensive_rundown_of_txst_computer_science/,"I was thinking today that it would be fun to go over my full experience with the Texas State CS program and entering the SW industry. Hopefully some of you will find this useful.

I came to TXST with zero knowledge of CS and chose the school pretty arbitrarily.

I'll run down the experience with all of my CS professors, and how difficult the course is relative to your knowledge going  into it. I'll say this: Don't fully trust ratemyprofessor. For example, Koh has a lower score than many others, but he is one of the best. A lot of the professors that have the least to offer are the ones with the very high ratings. Trust the below. Rather than take the classes in the order on the degree plan, I just took them in the order that the top professors were available (for the most part). I still graduated in four years- I feel like it was pretty optimal.

I took Jill Seaman for Foundations 1 and OO. She was pretty great. I got a B in her Foundations 1 class because I had no prior programming experience and hadn't tried in schooling in ages. She kind of sticks to the textbook too much. I got some help in the library to get over the hurdle of not knowing anything about coding. Difficulty 3/10 and 6/10

I took Vangelis Metsis for Foundations 2 and it was a somewhat negative experience. He didn't seem to know how to teach all that well. The tests were slightly difficult. I only got an A because the grades were heavily curved- I hadn't really gotten the hang of coding yet. Difficulty 5/10

I took Lee Koh for Data Structures and Assembly Language. He's outstanding. He is one of the most difficult professors in the department but he will REALLY improve your programming skills. This is where everything clicked. If you don't take his classes, you are missing a serious opportunity. These are the biggest hurdles of the degree, seeing as how they are relatively early on. His courses are very well planned, and his tests have creative questions that test critical thinking more than others. This man is what you're paying for. I know people who took DS with Hwang and learned almost nothing and got easy A's. Don't do this. Difficulty 8/10

I took Computer Ethics with John Durrett. What an absolute nightmare. He is not a true professor; he is basically abusing the tenure system. I consider what he is doing to be stealing tax dollars. He ranted about his extreme political views ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. He barely discussed CS the entire semester. He didn't even grade most of the assignments and just arbitrarily assigned B's to the whole class. I know this because he accidentally made the grade distribution visible in TRACS. In fact, he visibly struggled to even use his laptop at a consumer level. This man is very possibly the worst professor on the planet. If you think I'm exaggerating, take it.

I took Parallel Programming with Martin Burtscher. It was a very valuable experience- don't miss the chance. He is in a different league as far as lecturing goes. He would fit right in teaching at a top 10 school. The course is not THAT difficult, but it felt nearly impossible to get solid A's on the quizzes. Difficulty 8/10

I took Software Engineering with Ted Lehr. He was very rude at times, and made multiple people cry. I felt like this course was just a dumbed down repeat of OO with some git as well. The semester long group project is a decent way to make friends, at least. Difficulty 3/10

I took Computer Networks with Mina Guirguis. It was a very dense course, with a lot to gain. People struggled a lot in this one. The assignments were very difficult to get high scores on. Definitely one of the better lecturers. Difficulty 8/10

I took Computer Architecture with Lee Hinkle. He is a great guy with tons of industry experience. He is there for you, big time. I knew people were going to his office hours and getting extensive help. I kept him as a connection. Difficulty 6/10

I took Data Mining with some assistant, because the Prof dropped it at the last second. It was a nightmare. I didn't even study because no one else did. I got like a 15 on the final which was the second highest grade in the class (no one learned anything) and ended with an A. I did this because I had 4 other CS classes that semester and was trying to get A's in all of them. Lol. Difficulty 3/10

I took Machine Learning with Yan Yan. It was okay. He was very nice, but his accent was very strong and he was new to teaching. The second half of the semester had very, very low attendance and was basically blown off feeling. Difficulty 4/10

I took Database Systems with Anne Ngu. She reminded me of Koh. I learned a ton. Difficulty 7/10

I took OS with Ziliang Zong. This class was decent. One of the hardest, for sure. You can tell Zong cares more about research than his teaching. I suspect a third of the class or so failed. Difficulty 8/10

I was annoyed that you can't take Analysis of Algorithms as an undergrad here. It's like THE CS class, and nearly all other unis have it as a Junior level course. Ridiculous.

After graduating (with one job as a CS research assistant and no internships), I applied to around 80 jobs on linkedin and glassdoor. It took me several months to get any offers, even with a 3.94 GPA. You probably will want to get internships. That being said, it worked out. I'm loving my job right now, and am very glad that I chose to major in CS at Texas State and take it seriously. Of the 5 people I met in the program that I hung out with occasionally, 4 of them also have jobs in the industry and make in the 65k-100k region, as well. They had GPAs in the 3.0-3.5 range. If you work hard here, it will pay off. When I was going through it, I kept wondering if I was ever actually going to get in to the industry and make real money (I'm a pessimist by nature).  If you stick to it and make decent grades, you will. That said, it can be rough out there to get your first job- the interviews will be near impossible if you didn't truly learn the material (especially seeing as how TXST has predetermined that you aren't capable of taking Algorithms...).

Overall, I had a decent experience. It is what you make of it. Good luck- feel free to DM me."
dwmml5,34,2019-11-15,Wanting to be a NEET again?,[deleted],NEET,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/dwmml5/wanting_to_be_a_neet_again/,"About two years ago I stopped being a NEET. I realized leaving my aparment once a week and sometimes not talking to anyone for 3 months at a time was really unhealthy and my life was going downhill rapidly. I got into therapy and after about 3 months I went back to college, and since then its been a year into being in school, having an internship and really not having any social anxieties thanks to therapy and working on myself. I guess on the outside its better, but I really get a sense of nostalgia for those days of not doing anything except jerking off and sleeping to 2pm everyday. I often find myself defaulting to the idea of being a NEET everytime I have a big struggle and the only thing really keeping me from doing it is remembering how awful it was at the time. Its such a weird dynamic: there is a strange comfort involved with being a NEET, the same routine is what really does it for me. I find my routines typically getting a wrench thrown in them which really puts me in a depressing mood. I guess the point of this is to ask if any ex-NEETs are in the same boat? I'm really afraid that I might end up breaking again and going back to being a NEET, and sometimes I even unconsciously think I'm going to go back to being a NEET.   
And P.S. to all the current NEETs -try not to be down on yourselves buds. As my therapist told me, you're not a failure for being in the position you're in right now. You're going through some mental trauma atm and sometimes withdrawl is all we really can do. We're just physically withdrawling for society, a lot of people emotionally withdrawl, etc. Things can always get better and I highly advise seeking mental health if possible. Its unfortunate a lot of you are in a position that you can't go see a licensed therapist, but I really hope the best for you all. Being a NEET is safe, but its not really living. Stay strong basement kings/queens."
dwojcs,1,2019-11-15,choosing Things to consider before choosing a B.Tech stream.,InvertisUniversity2,u_InvertisUniversity2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_InvertisUniversity2/comments/dwojcs/choosing_things_to_consider_before_choosing_a/,"Every student has a dream of making it big in a stream of interest. Class 12th science students are often thinking of pursuing a B.Tech degree. But it is important to consider the areas of interest and analyzing the pros and cons of it before deciding on which B.Tech stream to choose.

Textile engineering, Marine Engineering, Computer Science engineering, Aeronautical engineering, mechanical engineering, electronics and communication engineering, and biotech engineering are some of the branches of B.Tech. These specializations have an excellent scope in the current scenario of the business world. There are a few things that one needs to consider before choosing a particular stream in B.Tech.

&amp;#x200B;

Area of interest: Before choosing to enroll in a B.Tech degree or a particular stream in it, it is extremely important to understand the individual's interest since it affects the academic record. Passion and a deep interest in the stream one chooses is the key to excel in the future.

Educational Institution: Choosing the right kind of educational institution is extremely important. Once the decision about the stream of B.Tech is made the next set of things to be considered about the choice of college/ university is the next step. The fee structure of the decided stream, the infrastructure available in the institute for that stream, placement offerings for the selected stream, and the internship history for the stream are all some of the points to be considered before selecting the college/ university to pursue B.Tech.

Specialization: A clear thought and approach help in achieving good results. Circuits, mathematics, physics, or any other area of expertise will ensure a career in specializations like mechanical engineering, Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering, biotech, and a few others. Choosing specialization based on one's interest, passion, and career dreams play a vital role in the success of it.

Career aspirations: Once the degree has been completed, students concentrate on pursuing a career in the related field. It is equally important to understand the job responsibilities that are involved in the field of interest chosen at the time of pursuing the degree. Understanding the job role and expectation of the professional demands of the industry about the particular field is vital in making the right choice about the kind of B.Tech stream to pursue, failing in which might lead to a shocker at the time of pursuing a job in the related field. It may also lead to some serious challenges at a later stage of the career.

If you can do it let me know so I can send a message!

Edit: ok sorry guys, my bad I didnt insert more info! 

- Office location: a neighborhood called Ottensen! 
- Duration: January- end of june
- Budget: I would like to spend around 500/600 euros but I think I could go until around 900/1000 if it's a very nice place but especially very close to the office. I rather live very close by and pay more
- about me: I'm 23F and obviously dont speak german haha if it's a cool/young neighborhood I would love it for sure! 

For me either sharing an apartment or having one for myself would be good! Any recommendations of places that could fit this requirements? 

Tks!"
dwrs8r,2,2019-11-15,"[M4f] Looking for a long term chat/rp partner. Details, scenes and more inside. Rough, dark, corruption, and so much more.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dwrs8r/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood morning DPP. As the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"
dwudyg,1,2019-11-15,A Dangerous Descent: The Burnout Crisis in American Healthcare,AnesthesiaManager,u_AnesthesiaManager,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AnesthesiaManager/comments/dwudyg/a_dangerous_descent_the_burnout_crisis_in/," Something significant is happening in our clinics, health facilities and hospitals. Doctors and other health workers are increasingly feeling the effects of “burnout”—that mental-emotional state that signals the approach of a serious breaking point. You haven’t quite quit or gone over the edge, but you’re getting there. Meanwhile, you’re still working, working with patients. It makes for a dangerous mix. Hank William III—who looks and sings a lot like his grandpa—has a song entitled “Lowdown,” a sad saga about a man who has reached his lowest point.

&gt;*Lowdown, once again.  Well, I’m strugglin’ now to get by, my friend.*  
*It’s keeping me up, real late at night.  I just can’t settle down my honkytonk life.*

Except for the honkytonk reference, these lines could very well be written about the physical and psychological state of many of our nation’s clinicians.  In many cases, they’re working longer hours and facing more stresses than previous generations of healers; and many of them are descending into despair.

**A Somber Report**

Last month, a 312-page report was released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), widely considered one of the country's most prestigious institutions.  A committee of physicians, nurses, health executives and leaders in bioethics, neurology and pharmacy spent 18 months studying the incidence and effects of burnout in the healthcare field, and the findings were alarming.  According to the report, anywhere from 35 to 54 percent of doctors and nurses experience burnout. 

That figure is even worse when it comes to residents, with the report indicating 60 percent of interns and residents are buckling under an overload of stressors.  Not only are they expected to work twice as many hours as their peers (e.g., lawyers, other professionals), but much of their daily grind is relegated to clerical, rather than care-related, tasks.

**A Sober Reality**

The committee that authored the NASEM report found that an overall dysfunctional healthcare system has caused clinicians to work longer hours, complete more paperwork, and fear more malpractice lawsuits than ever before.  This is what is leading to the burnout.  The resultant symptoms are as follows: 

* Emotional exhaustion
* Cynicism
* Loss of enthusiasm and joy in their work
* Increasing detachment from their patients and the patients' ailments.
* Higher rates of depression
* Substance abuse
* Suicide

Indeed, the suicide rate among physicians in the United States is twice that of the general population and one of the highest among all professions.  These burnout symptoms are staggering in their scope and tragic in their effect.  It reminds one of the ancient proverb, “Physician, heal thyself;” but increasingly, they are incapable of doing so.

According to the co-chair of the NASEM report, Dr. Christine Cassel, “the system is hurting the very people we have put in charge of healing us as a society.”  The results on the healthcare system, at large, are not much better.  The report stated that physician burnout leads to an increased risk to patients, more malpractice claims, worker absenteeism and turnover, as well as billions of dollars in losses to the medical industry each year.

**A Suggested Resolution**

Dr. Cassel, who is also a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco and the former president of the American Board of Internal Medicine, observed the following:

&gt;*“What this report is saying is that this is a systemic problem that requires systemic solutions. You can't just teach doctors meditation, yoga and self-care. We need big, fundamental changes.""*

The NASEM committee didn’t just diagnose the problem, they set forth 6 goals for resolving the contributors to, and effects of, clinician burnout.  They are as follows:

1. **Create Positive Work Environments**. Health care executives should continuously monitor and evaluate the extent of burnout in their organization, using validated tools, and report on this at least annually to leaders, managers, and clinicians within the organization.
2. **Address Burnout in Training and Early Career Stage**.  The report recommends that schools of health professions alleviate major sources of stress by monitoring workload (including preparation for licensure examinations and required training activities), implementing pass-fail grading, improving access to scholarships and affordable loans, and building new loan repayment systems.
3. **Reduce Tasks That Do Not Improve Patient Care**. Federal agencies, state legislatures, and other standard-setting entities should identify and address the sources of clinician burnout related to laws, regulations, and policies, eliminating those that contribute little or no value to patient care.
4. **Improve Usability and Relevance of Health IT**.  Health information technology (IT), including electronic health records, should be as user-friendly and easy to operate as possible to reduce burnout.
5. **Reduce Stigma and Improve Burnout Recovery Services**. Many clinicians do not report burnout because they fear the potential consequences, including loss of licensure. The report recommends that state legislative bodies facilitate access to employee assistance programs, peer support programs, and mental health providers without the information being admissible in malpractice litigation.
6. **Create National Research Agenda on Clinician Well-Being**. By the end of 2020, appropriate federal agencies should develop a coordinated research agenda on clinician burnout. Research priorities should include identifying potential systems-level interventions to improve clinician well-being.

Others, who were not part of the NASEM report, would recommend other solutions to this growing problem among American health workers.  For example, residents in the United Kingdom are generally limited to working only 48 hours per week.  Some have pointed out that this has resulted in no net loss of training or clinical competency, so reducing work hours in American residency may have beneficial effects.  Still others, such as Vindell Washington, chief medical officer at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, would urge the federal government to severely constrict the amount of regulatory burdens facing clinicians that force them to spend greater amounts of time in documentation. 

That we are in the midst of a serious and growing threat to our health system is beyond question.  Because of burnout, many clinicians are facing real health risks, or are simply quitting.  This, coupled with the growing doctor shortage crisis (discussed in a previous article) will only make things more stressful for our physicians, leading to more resignations.  It will become a vicious cycle.  Hopefully, government and healthcare leaders can come together to formulate creative and sustainable solutions to this impending implosion.  A country cannot allow its caregivers to feel lowdown."

I was just recently offered a spring internship at a congressional office in D.C. I’m very excited, however, I have a few concerns about moving there. I’m trying to find a place to move into from January until about early May and I’m trying to find it cheap. 

I don’t know yet whether my internship pays or not, but I do plan on getting another job nevertheless. I plan on funding it through a scholarship my school offers (if I get it) and possibly students loans since I plan on doing online classes while over there. I have a car and plan on bringing it so options in the surrounding area are available. Any advice on places to look? Cost is my biggest concern right now. 

Thank you everyone! I’m pretty nervous and I just got offered it so everything is still in the air right now and I’m trying to figure it now while I still have time. Thanks again!"

The reason why I thought it would be rather unwise is as follows:

1. A woman is more than likely to want to marry a man who earns more than she does. The more she would earn the less number of men she would have to chose from.
2. A career is likely to demand most of her time, especially through her most fertile years.
3. A career is likely to be expensive leaving her in heavy debt, which intern would mean she would need to take even longer to be in a financial position to think of having children by which time she might have missed her fertility window.
4. As a christian you are to go forth and multiply. A career would delay your child bearing years which means you couldnt have a large family even if you wanted to.
5. It is more likely than not for a person let alone a woman to lose their faith in college or university, so why risk it?

He later said he wanted to call it quits because he felt like we had nothing in common and that I ruined his relationship to God by moving in with him before marriage (which he wanted).*

*A lot of emotional damage later, my appetite was gone and I lost over twenty pounds in less than two weeks, he kept telling me how worthless I was and how much pain I caused him by ruining his life that I tried to commit suicide, he found me and left me there to struggle on my own, then by morning he was gone and I was super ill. I miscarried and didn't know I had been pregnant, so that has been eating me up entirely. Later on he sexually assaulted me then ran away to his parents for a month ""to find himself"". I checked the phone records to realize he'd been texting his woman from his workplace all day. She's supposedly highly religious but dating several guys at once, per what people in the office have volunteered after they noted he took off his wedding band (which he wanted to wear, I never asked him to) and asked me if we're still together, I said he dumped me and they asked if his sudden interest in the woman at the office was the reason, I said perhaps.* 

*He withdrew almost all the money from our joint checking account and left me with $300 for the entire month he was gone (even now he still plays around with the finances when he feels like it). I paid everything on credit because he wanted a domestic partner to handle all the household chores despite the condition of my moving up was getting to return to school and a car. He left me the car while he was gone, told me to ""do things and find some happiness"", but limited me to $300 cash and if I used that, I knew it would jeopardize the account, so everything I did went on my credit cards.*

*His parents told me to find a job, to stop talking to them about what he had done, they were disappointed in me for premarital sex with him and didn't care about anything else. They were glad I miscarried. Seemed sad I survived my attempted suicide. They don't seem to realize he's still lying to them or care. It's the first time in four years I've felt completely isolated. I tried to reach out to my parents and they said I should have married him before moving, that I made my choice and they tried to warn me, so now I'm cut off.*

I am struggling every day.

He tells me about his dates with her doing things I used to encourage him to do with me like eating sushi, which he hates, going for runs in the cold weather, which they both hate, and so on, when he's back in town, which he's coming back tonight and won't be leaving until he returns to our hometown for the holidays (he asked me what my plans were and I just started crying). When he's here he tries to play games like 'peek a boo' with me by putting his hands over my glasses after sneaking up on me from behind. He'll try to have pillow fights with me as I'm texting friends trying to find ways to keep myself occupied when he's here. He's hit me pretty hard in the face a few times, causing my glasses to sting my nose then he'll appear contrite about it  and try to lean on me to check out my face. He keeps trying to tickle me and nudge me, to focus on him when we're alone together, but in public he's aloof and distant. He didn't want me interacting with anyone, telling me he'll support me until I can get back on me feet, so I haven't been on social media anymore for over several months, but someone told me he still has us as engaged on FB. 

I'm just really struggling every day.

After the miscarriage and assault, I went to the gynecologist and reported what happened. I was a mess. We did the usual. They got back to me later saying my results showed signs of uterine sickness leading to a type of cancer that slowly kills the uterus. He and I talked about it after he returned because I was worried about the biopsy they were going to do which was quoted to me around $300. He was apathetic about it, told me he would put money in the account and to charge it to his card. Since then I was supposed to undergo low-stress self-care practices, eat more, do some exercise, and monitor my symptoms. Well, I can tell you that low-stress thing hasn't happened.

Wednesday this week was my follow-up appointment at the gynecologist. I had to undergo a uterine biopsy and cervical biopsy because they suspect cancer and I was completely alone because I have no family up here and the few people I can claim as friends are out of town, but even then I feel so vulnerable lately I don't know if I would have wanted any of them holding my hand while I was screaming through the biopsies because of the pain.

Every time he comes back I go into a state of panic. He knows my phone is unstable, we had talked about replacing it this September before he decided to announce he was breaking up with me, so when I try to go out sometimes it crashes and won't restart, which makes it hard to use Google Maps or Uber for transit. There's so many other shady things he does, but this is already long enough. 

I keep applying to places trying to find a job that'll support me, but I don't have strong skill sets, and with the brain fog constantly making me confused at every decision, I am having trouble trying to learn new things. Sometimes he reaches out to talk to me, but it's only because he wants something I used to keep track of. He unshared all our pictures months ago, then reshared them recently this last week. I don't know what's going on and I'm constantly on the verge of tears. I don't know how to consistently do no contact while we still live together.

How full of HATE. After 4 years together, 1.5 years of that engaged...you had to end it in the WORST way possible. The way you had to know would hurt me the most. You broke up with me via TEXT while we were both in the house on a Friday morning. You absolute COWARD. Your 22 year old Russian intern? REALLY??!!! And what the HELL does she want with a 44 year old man besides your money and a green card?? You have children of your own who are older than that. My own daughter is 21. What were you thinking when you interacted with my daughter? When you hugged her? Cuddled on the couch during a movie? Makes me SICK to think of those days now. I am FURIOUS that you threw me away like a piece of garbage, like the last four years of our lives meant less than nothing to you. You are galavanting around with her like you own the planet, and you feel entitled to it by god because you have paid your dues, and you left me to fucking die. And that is what this feels like - like death. I miss your kids, I miss your presence in my life, in the house, in our bed, I miss our projects, I miss our future, I miss our shared jokes, shared giggles and laughs, all the sharing, I miss your body wrapped around mine, I miss your slippers by the front door....I miss EVERYTHING. AND YOU DON'T GIVE A FUCK. Worse. You have figured out a way to justify what you have done. You have written your own narrative - the one in which \*I'm\* the narcissist, controlling, abusive, too opinionated, didn't put out enough, held you back from wanting to be on stage in front of an audience...etc., etc. None of this is true, but go ahead and pick your narrative, there will always be someone around to believe it! It's hard to describe....this rage. It's harder still to believe it took me 9 weeks to get here. I have only wanted what we had back. Now, I want your entire life to turn to ash. I want you to watch it filter through your fingers like dust and I want you to HURT in a deeply profound and lasting way. I want you to reap what you have sowed - every minute of every day. I want you to look back on this when you are on your deathbed and I want you to feel profound regret for what you did. I want it to be something you take beyond the grave - into your next iteration...wherever or whatever that may be. 

I spend my time online and on Reddit learning about cheaters and narcissists and abuse and toxicity in relationships. I pay for therapy. I buy books. I have panic attacks every day. I can't stop thinking about you being with her and being happy with her. I can't finish tasks. I have no interest in my life. I wake up crying or yelling from nightmares. There is literally no relief from this hell. I am taking responsibility for my part in things: for taking you back the last time you cheated, for ignoring the flags, for not recognizing the flags in the first place, for doing ALL of the emotional labor, for supporting you when you didn't reciprocate, for letting you off the hook when you insulted and belittled me, for letting you put me and my interests down....for ALL THE THINGS. Meanwhile, you have taken ZERO responsibility and you are GETTING WHAT YOU WANT. And because you didn't hit me, I have no recourse! You get off scott-free! Some even congratulate you on your young trophy!!!! 

I am FURIOUS that I have to start over. Somehow rebuild my life. MAYBE find another partner to have a future with. But, you PROMISED me a future with YOU. You broke that promise, but somehow in your mind that's not a real betrayal?!! All's fair in love and war! The heart wants what it wants! YOLO! Amiright? YOU. ARE. INSANE. And delusional and dangerous. You don't deserve me, and you never did. I cannot say this with enough emphasis to make it sound like it feels: FUCK. YOU."

dx0x1q,2,2019-11-15,I [29 M] need advice on how to handle an excessively needy friend [27 M].,uninc4life2010,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dx0x1q/i_29_m_need_advice_on_how_to_handle_an/,"To give some backstory, my friend and I have known each other since 9th grade. So at this point, about 14 years.  We have lived down the street from one another, we were former roommates, we have many mutual friends, we attended community college together, have been on vacations together, and have shared many memories.

Bill [not his real name, but you get the point] didn't have the easiest time growing up, and in a number of ways, he has been dealt a bad hand.  Bill's father is clinically diagnosed bipolar/schizophrenic, has been to prison at least once (to my knowledge), has struggled with addiction his whole life, is on full disability, and currently lives with Bill's other family members several states away. His father was in his life sporadically, but they still do have a relationship with one another to this day.  Bill has told me childhood stories about his father losing his mind when they still lived together, and it honestly sounds horrific to have gone through such a thing.  He once told me that his mother was driving him and his little sister to their aunt's house while crying, trying to explain why they all wouldn't be living with their father anymore.  Bill told me that rather than feeling sad, him and his sister were just relieved that they wouldn't have to be in the same house as their father anymore.  Bill told me stories about how his father would scream and beat him so bad that he could literally feel his anus loosen up like he was about to shit himself.  Apparently, when Bill was a child, his mother would hide in his bed with him, trying to avoid his father's rage, assuming that he wouldn't do anything while she was cuddled up next to their son, only to be forcefully ripped out of bed and dragged across the room in a whirlwind of schizophrenic rage.  I believe that Bill was less than 10 years old at the time this all happened.

Bill's mother, understandably, has her own set of problems.  His mother is a very nice woman, but she has struggled with addiction and mental illness herself for most of her adult life.  She is a recovering alcoholic, she has (to my knowledge) been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and bipolar disorder.  His mother has been able to hold down a teaching job, and earns a decent income, but through poor financial decision, is in an insurmountable amount of debt.  Additionally, she has been forced to take extended periods of time off of work due to mental health reasons, but I'm not sure how this affected her income, as teachers are salaried where we live.  Bill told me that she once bought both a car and made a down payment on a house with a credit card.  He routinely complains about the state of the apartment him and his mother live together in (I don't blame him.  It's not the nicest place in the world but it's very cheap from what I've been told).  When I asked why him and his mom didn't want to move into a nicer apartment together and split the bills like they're currently doing, he explained that her credit is completely ruined from the insurmountable amount of debt that she's currently in, and they wouldn't be able to move anywhere else because the current landlord was willing to overlook her credit and routinely allows her to pay rent late.

Unfortunately, Bill inherited, through genetics or environment, many of the same issues that his mother and father struggle with.  He has been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, bipolar type II disorder (the one where the mania symptoms are not as severe), and has struggled with a cocaine and opioid pill addiction.  Due to the unstable set of circumstances that he grew up in, he's never really had a quality mentor that could help him navigate the complexities of life.  His mother's side of the family lives nearby, but most of them, including all of the male members of the family, struggle with mental illness and addiction as his mother does.  It's speculative, but I believe that there's a hereditary component to some of it.  Maybe I'm wrong to assume that, but I don't know. 

Throughout all of our relationship, as the title indicates, Bill has been needy to say the least.  He is always wrapped up in some kind of crisis, he can't effectively make decisions for himself, he is always broke, despite having a good income from his job, and he is always in need of reassurance that he's making the right choices.  It's exhausting to say the least, especially when it forces me to divert attention away from my own life's priorities.  I'm currently studying engineering, and in my senior year.  Hectic and stressful doesn't begin to describe it.  I'm very limited on time, and there's only so much I can do for him.  

To give you an example, he drove his car off of the road last year into a ditch and totaled it.  It turned out a while later that he had nodded off at the wheel while on pain pills, but he claimed at the time that the road was wet and he lost control of the car while changing lanes.  He called me in a panic, claiming that the only option was for him to just take a loan out and buy a new car for $22,000.  He claimed that his mother was telling him that it was the only option.  I had to spend a lot of time and energy explaining that his mother wasn't giving him good advice and that going an additional $22,000 in debt on top of his already $55,000 worth of student loan debt was a mistake he'd be feeling for another decade.  I told him that he would need to use the money he had, plus a small loan, to buy an inexpensive used vehicle.  He was broke at the time, and the only other option was a scooter.  Public transit doesn't exist where we live.  If you don't have private transportation, you've screwed.  The whole situation threw him so off kilter that he literally couldn't think straight.  He probably called me over 50 times asking me what he needed to do about every conceivable fine detail.  He needed so much help it was practically debilitating.  Everything from the kind of cars to look at, to how much money he should spend, to how to get a small auto loan, to how to tell if the lady selling him the car was lying, to whether he should look at cars without air conditioning, to how to set up an uber account to go look at cars.  It was a lot to have to deal with.

To give another example, after Bill (supposedly) got clean from pills after the car situation, he landed a marketing internship at a large company that manufactures semi-trucks. Again, he called me in a panic, saying that he just fucked his whole life up.  He claimed that the company gave him a three-week notice on the drug test.  Apparently, they do a hair analysis that goes back 6 months, and he had no clue what he was going to do, considering the fact that he smoked dabs and THC vape pens daily.  Simply stopping smoking for a month wasn't going to work.  I did some research, and I told him that a common technique was to shave his head and all of the hair off of his body, as the test requires a minimum of 90 individual hairs of 1.5 inches in length.  By doing this, it forces the company to default to a urine test, which could be passed using a clean sample of urine smuggled in.  Like the car situation, this triggered another barrage of anxiety on his about about what to do.  He just needed reassurance about ever single decision involved.  He couldn't decided for himself whether of not he needed to stop smoking weed before the test in case he couldn't smuggle in my clean urine, despite the obvious answer to that question.  He kept asking if Kratom would should up on a drug test.  Then he asked if his prescription medication would show up as marijuana.  Then, he asked if his adderall prescription would show up as  illicit amphetamine.  He then wanted to know if he could smoke CBD oil instead of weed and whether of not it would show up on a test.  This hysterical nonsense just went on and on, literally up until the very day of the drug test.  He kept claiming that it was ""bullshit"" that any company in 2019 would drug test an employee because ""everybody except you already gets high.""  I had to sit him down and explain to him that not everyone smokes weed, and that he needed to make a decision about the pros and cons of continuing to use weed, and that people who don't smoke weed don't have to deal with these kinds of inconveniences.  He was really resistant to the idea, claiming that it helped his mental disorders.  I told him that might be the case, but that it may also be worth trying to stop for a few months to see if it makes a positive difference.

Again, the needy cycle repeated.  I would get texts in the middle of the night and random calls with him saying things like:

""So you think that stopping weed is good idea?""

""Damn, I never thought to do that.  Should I really stop?""

""Bro, I don't know if I can stop smoking!  What should I do?"" 

""I think I might try CDB instead."" 

""What if I can't sleep when I stop smoking?""

""So you think that not smoking would be good?""

""What if I can't eat after I stop smoking and I start to lose size?""

It's almost like my suggestion infected his brain with uncertainty that he couldn't deal with on his own.  I regretted even talking to him about it at all.  It's just gotten to be too much.  I listed a few examples throughout this post, but the point is that I'm just completely exhausted trying to deal with his needy behavior.  He is just the kind of person who needs constant reassurance and help making even basic decisions.  I thought that he would become more independent as he got older, but that has not happened.

I understand that he has a lot of problems, and I want to see him be successful, but this shit has just become burdensome.  I think that I've given him too much leeway in consideration of his difficult past, addiction, and mental health problems.  To be honest, I feel like I'm enabling him to a certain extent.  

Anyone with needy friends or close family members, what is the best way to go about maintaining a relationship with them while also preventing them from becoming a burden to you in the process?  I just feel like the constant help he requires is taking a toll on me, both physically and emotionally.  I have enough on my plate as it stands finishing my engineering degree, I don't need his problems to pile up on top of mine.

**TL;DR**: Friend struggles with an abusive past, inadequate parenting, mental health problems, and addiction.  He needs help in all aspects of his life and has trouble making his own decisions.  His needy behavior has not subsided over the years, and continues to burden me.  How do I appropriately deal with his constant need for assistance when it has started to become a burden in my already stressful life?"

[Question][Discussion],integral_s,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/dx38js/going_from_night_owl_to_morning_person_but/,"I'm currently an undergraduate engineering student who has, as far as i remember, been a natural night owl. I've tried switching my sleep schedule around a bunch of times to wake up early using various methods, but it has never lasted. There's this common perception that people who stay up late and wake up late are lazy/unhealthy, but what has stopped me from successfully ""fixing"" my sleep schedule is that I feel the most productive and creative very late into the night ( think 12-7am). For my last three evening exams, I basically studied all evening (from \~6-8pm until the next morning, went to sleep and woke up around 3:30pm to go to my exam. Despite the sleep schedule being near-nocturnal, I aced all three of the exams and remembered all the content. Academically, this has been a consistent trend. I've always enjoyed working while everyone else is asleep because theres a continuous block of time with no distractions, but we live in a 9-5 society and I often find myself missing / being late to fixed morning events and commitments. Especially, during summer internships and eventually when I enter the workforce, I'd like to be productive starting from the beginning of the workday instead of only towards the end because of the limitations set by the hours I'm at my desk.

I'm wondering if anyone has successfully switched over from being a habitual late sleeper (who actually gets most of their work done at night) to waking up before 8am while maintaining the same or higher level of productivity? If so, how did it happen and what methods did you use? ( Even when I was forced to be on a 9-5 schedule, I felt really groggy from 9-noon)"

""Sweety, I'm so sorry,"" she said with a very sympathetic look ""I know I was supposed to take care of you tonight, but Liz just called while you were in the shower and she really needs a friend right now. I'm gonna grab a few drinks with her.""

""Ugh..."" I sigh, ""OK. OK. But, I've been saving it up all for you this week and I'm about to explode!""

""Well, since I'm the one bailing, I'll let you use the on-call tonight"" she replied.

""Who is it tonight?"" I asked as my mood quickly started to change for the better...

OK. So for this RP, I want you to play two women - my wife and the on-call girl who I get to use a few times a year when my wife gives me permission. The on-call girl is always someone we know, and my wife set them all up.

My wife is a very organized woman. So basically, she put together a calendar and gets every day scheduled about two or three months in advance. All of them know the deal - if you're on call, you MIGHT get a call from me and if you do, you're supposed to come by and give me head, no questions asked, until I explode.

So, for tonight, I want you to respond to my question about who it is with one of the following and I want to play the night out with you, my on-call woman:

Amanda: My wife's super-slutty friend.

Jill: Her mom was a huge slut when I was in college and I used to fuck her. My wife's firm just hired Jill and told me about her...about how slutty and sexy she was. I asked to see a pic and I immediately recognized her. Long-story short, she was just as slutty, maybe even more, than her mom. So when my wife asked her about me, she jumped at it...and she knows her mom's history with me, but she doesn't care at all.

Brittany: Another co-worker of my wife's - actually an intern. She just turned 21 and is a big-titted, blonde slut. She's been 21 for three months and still never paid for her own drink.

Lizzy: One night when I was allowed to use the on call, the woman who was on had to bail. My wife made me a Tinder account to find a replacement...Lizzy was it. And she was good. My wife liked her, so she stayed in the mix.

Gillian: Has a GREAT rack and an almost unmatched enthusiasm for sucking cock. She's a friend of my ex-girlfriend that my wife has met a few times cause she hangs out at some of the same places we do and we always say hi. My wife quickly recruited her when she saw how slutty she was dressed.

Bridgette: Married woman about two doors down. She is a super MILF with a great body and her hubby is away a lot. She'd never get permission from hubby to do this so she'd rather hope not to get caught and ask for forgiveness if she does.

Ashley: A thick, sexy, super slutty former co-worker and hookup of mine who happens to still live nearby.

Your Idea: Tell me/show me another character you want to play.

A Porn Star: Through my wife's firm, she represents many in the entertainment industry, including the adult industry. Her clients that I'm into are: Dayna Vendetta, Angela White, Abbey Brooks, Audrey Bitoni, Vicky Vette, Dylan Ryder, Leslie Zen, Tory Lane, and Jenna Haze. You can pick any one (or more).

So if you're still with me, get in touch, and tell me who you want to play. I can show you what I envision any of these potential characters look like, but am also open to suggestions you have! I can also give you more background on the type of character I want my wife to play too, but you can probably already gather that she's sexy, confident, and always looking out for me.

With the right partner, I think this can be a lot of fun, so get in touch soon and light up that orange envelope!"

I decided to go with it and I could still look for other jobs in the meantime. So I started my job and really enjoyed it. Fast forward to August where my employer said that they would like to offer a permanent job which I accepted.

My workplace is very much a start up culture. There are a handful of people in the company and I have a lot of freedom e.g. ability to work from home. With regards to payslips/contracts I am regarded as being self-employeed and I file my invoice at the end of every month. The job is in central London.

I have been a permanent employee for 3 months now and I am still receiving the intern hourly rate of £12. I thought that my pay would go up however I have not approached my employer about this. I feel as though I have taken on extra responsibility but I am still junior compared to other employees. 

So my question is should I ask for a pay rise or not, if so how should I go about doing this? I know I have only been working there for a few months however technically I have a new role and I feel that £12/hr (£25k/year) is a bit low for central London. 

Appreciate all your help."
dx644e,3,2019-11-16,My first proper app!,Jamescaampbell,iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/dx644e/my_first_proper_app/,"After around 6-8 months of development &amp; multiple rejects due to guideline 1.2 (user generated data) I have finally created an [app](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ghosttown/id1456561852) that I'm proud of called Ghosttown. 

About the app:
The app “[Ghosttown](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ghosttown/id1456561852)” allows the user to create &amp; find events and activities on a map view. It’s my first time using a map view to show ”posts” or user generated data and I think it worked out very well. The intentions of the app is to allows users to connect with each by posting activities. for example, if you're into bike riding but don't have anyone to go with on your bike ride. You can post ”bike ride” and post the location, time &amp; all the details about where &amp; when you're going. Users around the location will be able to see the activity on the map and if they decide they want to go can click the ”Are you going?” button to inform the creator that they are going (remote notification). They can also message or comment on the activity (or event) to ask a question or clarify information, view the about of people going &amp; favourite the activity or event. For my first proper app ( I say proper because I created the basic List app as I thought it would be a good place to start learning the process of getting an app ready for the app store) I'm pretty happy with how it’s turned out. The only advertising that I have done is create an Instagram account and purchased a $20 promotion for my app on there which I gained 2 or 3 users maximum. Currently, I'm at 130 users which is from mainly word of mouth and posts on my own social media. I know isn't many users but I'm kind of stuck for ideas of how to advertise the app properly. As the app won't exactly work without users posting there own activities and events. If anyone has any suggestions on how to do this please let me know or if you have an suggestions for how I can improve my app let me know also ❤️

About me:
I saved up bought a Macbook Pro in 2015 with the intention of learning to code and mainly have been learning from Udemy, YouTube and a bunch of stackoverflow posts. I really love coding and decided that it's what I wanted to do as a career. I'm only turned 17 a few months ago and have had a few freelance jobs as well as a few internships over the past 2 years."

I’m finishing up my masters in engineering physics and electrical engineering and I am now looking for an exciting  company to do master thesis with.  I would like to focus on machine learning/ statistical modeling / or predictions. It could be a proof of concept type work, recommendation engines, pattern recognition.

I have experience working in python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) and matlab/simulink. Studied advanced courses in control engineering, electronics, maths and physics. Have completed an internship and projects in school related to machine learning. Would like to start my thesis in the spring of 2020 but it could also be done as an internship over the summer.  

Any and all ideas are welcome and appreciated"
dx77ey,15,2019-11-16,Am I the only one who's (maybe irrationally) bothered by how Schmitt is treated?,Heyxerlas14,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/dx77ey/am_i_the_only_one_whos_maybe_irrationally/,"Not just by the interns, but by the attendings too! Not just last episode...but like...all the time?

I know that they're usually awful to interns, but it irks me seeing someone so sweet and obviously defensless being treated a lil harshly
• giving him nicknames

• appearing annoyed every single time he speaks!

• Deluca ordering him to hold that thing for days

And other instances...Nico was the only one who took him under his wing...maybe Link was _a little_ kind at him in 15x23...but anything big

How about last episode? He was breaking down like a child (I'm saying this in a good way) but it seemed like no one cared squat...

• Meredith was stone cold to him...but that's understandable I guess, since she was on trial

• Bailey appeared pretty cold too, but she's the one who he reported this too...

• Jo was the only one showing a lil bit of concern when he was out of the roon crying

No one bothered tho; I get that it was a very important days for Mer, I'm not implying they should've go after him, but they didn't show...anything at all!

But again, as I said, I may be a little irrationally bothered by this as I depise characters like that being ignored or treated poorly...

...But let's get to something everyone will agree (I think)


#The interns

Wow...

• That guy's a douche, he probably has some cunning plan to be the best or smth, sabotaging others (A Shame since Devin Way looks like the opposite of that)

• Parker was so damn out of character...c'mon he's smarter than listening to what an unknown guy has to say

• the worst one tho...Helm; she's his best friend there and the one that knows his gullible nature the most...I get she has a crush for Dr Grey, but I didn't immagine it was so big to actually not looking at his face trying to ask for an explanation; Looks like she prefers someone that doesn't even care a bit for her...alas, usually that's how crushes work many times


All this breaks my heart, because he truly is the character that doesn't deserve this the most

But...I'm hoping they're finally going somewhere with his character and that they'll give him a relevant storyline with this thing, since even as a regular, he barely got any screentime this season...even less than the last one (but yeah, let's add other characters and focus on already seen Drama few people out there want XD)

Someone suggested he'll attempt suicide, but that's too extreme even for him...I think he'll do something to appear as an hero or to """"redeem"""" himself...

Anyways...what are your toughts or predictions?"
dx7xjh,25,2019-11-16,"I've never been in a relationship, all I ever experience is unrequited feelings and it is killing me inside.",kelasiutarid,unrequited_love,https://www.reddit.com/r/unrequited_love/comments/dx7xjh/ive_never_been_in_a_relationship_all_i_ever/,"[1]

The first time I fell in love, I was sixteen and there was a boy in my class. He was an idiot and he always went out of his way to argue with me. We always argued and it became a routine that our classmates and teachers thought it was a common occurence.

What made me fell in love was- even though he always argue with me, he did nice things that made me feel special because he didn't do the same thing to the other girls. He did the nice things quietly that sometimes it went unnoticed by everyone else.

I confessed to him a year later. He was quiet. Didn't say anything at all. He stopped talking to me. Treated me like a ghost. Like I didn't exist. Made me regret ever confessing to him.

I took a long time to move on from him (I tried to move on from him even since I realized I had feelings for him.)

Anyway, we still don't talk now. But I am fine with it.

[2]

The second time I fell in love, I was twenty-one. He was older and a member of faculty. He taught two hardest subjects (in my opinion) and I fell in love with his personality and intelligence.

(Some would argue that it was only a crush, but really, it was an intense one.)

With him, it was a lot of pining. I settled for seeing him in classes, seeing him after classes for consultation, and DMed him to ask how he was doing.

I didn't confess to him. There wasn't any point of it -my friend told me that I was just holding on to him because I was afraid to let the ""feeling"" go, already getting comfortable with a one-sided feeling that wasn't going anywhere.

I agreed. Before I hurt myself further, I moved on.

[3]

The third time I fell in love, I was twenty-three. I was doing my internship, and there was this one guy that really, really came out of nowhere.

I really didn't want to have any crushes. I already where it will end. 

Like I said, I didn't plan to have any crushes. So this guy, we worked together a couple of times. I ride with him after we finished working (with other staffs, of course) and no feeling was developed. He was a staff, and I was an intern. I was going to finish the f-ing internship, the end.

But a month and half after I started internship, a thing happened. We just finished our work and was back at the company building. We were taking the equipments out of the van, and suddenly our friend (who was driving the van, and the engine was still running) step a little on the pedal on purpose, and the van lurched forward. We were startled, of course.

The guy cursed but his sentence was finished quietly. I ignored it. But seconds later he broke the silence.

Him: Sorry
Me: Why? 
Him: I cursed in front of you.

There. I was hooked. I am a girl, and I am a little bit of a tomboy, I guess (my nickname is a male one, given by my male friends). My male friends never bothers when they cursed in front of me. And I cursed too, sometimes. But this guy apologized for cursing in front of me.

We got a leave the next day, so I saw him again on Friday. He was a little sick, and looked like he had a fever. I was just being friendly and nice when I asked him, ""Are you okay? You look sick.""

Normally, a person would answer ""Yes"" or ""No"" but spoiler alert, this guy didn't get the memo.

He f-ing smiled and said, ""Eh, you sound like you have a crush on me.""

I didn't expect that response so I was silent. (I was supposed to have clever comebacks, dammit!)

Fast-forward to about two or three days later, he was still sick but still had to work. He got a flu and at one point he need a tissue but the one near him already finished and another staff was offering to get a new box of tissue for him.

I was passing by, and I heard him said, ""It's okay, I already got a handkerchief."" and f-ing pulled me by my sweater's arm to him.

Needless to say, I was a goner.

The feelings just build up from there. He was a nice guy, easy on the eyes and he fit my type. I collected the moments we had hopelessly, and made efforts to talk and engage in conversation with him (I am pretty shy around new people). 

The last moment that I still keep remembering was during the project I joined before I finished my internship. He was with a senior, dealing with a technical stuff and he called me over to help shade them with an umbrella since it was too hot.

I went over towards them and held the umbrella up. Then he took my hand that was holding the umbrella and pull it close. I assumed that I didn't properly shade them, so I just thought he was correcting me so that I properly keep them under the umbrella.

But then he didn't let go of my hand. Remained that way the whole time the senior staff needed the umbrella. 

I thought he was going to hear my heart beating loudly.

Anyhow. I fnished my internship sometime in December (I started on early September.) He wasn't there on my last day. (And we never meet again after I finished internship.)

As my New Year resolution this year, I decided that I should move on from him, because it was obvious that whatever the feeling was, it wasn't going anywhere. 

It was -it is- an on/off process. 

The breaking point was in August, where I wished him ""Happy Birthday"" through his social media (we followed each other) and he didn't reply. l was hurt, to put it adjectively.

Even when I was in the process of moving on, I still watch his daily life. I am a fan/believer of 'poke the wound until it longer hurts'.

So I would say I was doing fine in the process of moving on. Until in late October, in the aftermath of my convocation, I posted several photos on my social media and tagged my friends.

He sent a follow request to one of my friend after that. Admittedly, my friend is a pretty girl and she is nice. But it didn't stop me from feeling jealous and f-ing insecure.

What broke me was, three years ago, the [1] also sent a follow request to the same friend. But since I was already moved on from [1], I didn't really care then.

(She knew about both guys and knew how I feel about them. And she told me about the requests -both times. I don't know whether she approved them or no.)

But now.

I feel horribly jealous and insecure. Inadequate. Ugly. Idiot.

I've mentioned that I am a believer of ""poke the wound until it no longer hurts"" but currently, I am muting [3]'s updates on my social media because I feel like seeing him hurts me a lot. I am also hiding my updates from him, because I don't like the ""oh he see my update today/oh he didn't see my update today why"" feeling.

So I've come to these existential questions of:-

1) No one ever had a crush on me and I've never been in a relationship.

2) My male friends view me as one of the boys, so it make sense why they would never find me attractive but every other guys I met would instantly attracted to my friends first. My friends are pretty, but damn, was I really that ugly?

3) What is wrong with me? What did I do wrong? What am I supposed to do? 

I always told people that I am alright being alone and it doesn't matter if I never settle down with someone. But internally, I am very, very lonely and I would like it if I have someone special in my life, just to know what is being in a relationship or being in love (with mutual feelings from both sides) feels like.

Thank you for taking your time reading my first (and very long post.)

I just really needed to vent and I don't really want to tell anyone in real life because I am afraid they are getting bored listening to me talk about these stuff.

FINAL QUESTION: What do you usually do when all the terrible feelings hits you?

TL;DR: (F, 24) Never been in relationship &amp; no one ever had a crush on me, good in getting into one-sided feelings. People in the similar situation, what do you usually ask yourself and how do you cope with the situation? And really, does look truly matter?

Edit: Thank you for your kind responses!!! I am still stuck in the process of moving on, but right now I am focusing on myself and in the future, I will be a better person for it. I wish you guys all the best in life!!!"

Some background, she's currently in an African city doing an internship with the local university, her and three other interns (white guys also in their 20s) arrived there a few months ago. From what she's told me the local guys there are very interested in getting with, dating, marrying, or being friends with a cute white girl. Basically there's a lot of horny local guys all around and they don't hide when they check her out or want her. Knowing this I can’t help but think about these guys groping or doing much more to her while she is on the bus, at the bar, or on the beach in her bikini.

I'd like to chat about my girlfriend getting all this attention, potentially getting groped, or being used (non-con) by other guys. This could be with the locals or the three white interns she's living with. Let me know if you want to chat or tell me what you think she's getting up to behind my back. Some more details are in my other posts."

I'm currently a 30 y/o Pharmacist making roughly $57/hour (\~$118,000 annually before taxes) and I have my first review on Monday. I've been a pharmacist for about 2 years, but I've been with this company for a total of 6 years to date (4 years as an intern while in pharmacy school, 2 years as a pharmacist as soon as I got licensed).

Here's my issue - I know for a fact that a girl in my graduating class, who also works for the same company (in the same exact position as me - a floating pharmacist) started at $5/hour higher than me. She interned for the company for about a year, bailed for another company where she worked for about 3 months, then came back and was welcomed at $61-62/hour. So she has really only been with the company for somewhere between 1 to 2 years, where I've been with this company through thick-and-thin since 2013.

I know it's sticky situation when it comes to bringing up co-workers salaries, but it's SO difficult for me to ignore. I'm not asking to get paid more than her, but I really don't view the gap between our salaries as insignificant, and I feel like I deserve to be paid atleast closer to what she makes.

Is it reasonable to attempt to bring this up? I by no means want to get her into trouble for divulging salary information to me, so I'd like to try and phrase it in a discrete way, but I'm having trouble coming up with a plan on how to do so. How would you deal with this situation?"
dx9r3l,11,2019-11-16,Job security &amp; Pros/Cons of being School Psychologist vs Teacher,duffbeerformeee,schoolpsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/schoolpsychology/comments/dx9r3l/job_security_proscons_of_being_school/,"Hello,

I am currently a math teacher in Arizona with an undergraduate degree in psychology. I've been considering school psychology since I started teaching and worked with a few psychologists. I'm in my 3rd year of teaching and next year would be when I apply for a school psychology program. I am currently looking at programs in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Texas. I'm interested in school psychology because I want to stay in education and have an interest in psychology (hence my degree). I'd like to work with students one on one and think the analysis and testing part of the job  would be quite interesting.

However, I have a couple of concerns. Mainly, is the field secure and how easy is it to find a job? Secondly, do you feel that the debt to income ratio was worth it? I'm looking at programs that are relatively less expensive (especially the program in Las Cruces) but have paid off my undergraduate debt and do not want to take on more debt unless the salary increase is worth the debt. I will have some support for living expenses from my husband but will need to take on debt for tuition. We are willing to relocate for school as he can work remotely. I currently make 30k as a teacher (this is because I am at a private school, I'd be at about $40k at a public school) and it looks like school psychologists start at about $50-55k in my area, which seems like a good increase to me but I know salaries can be wildly different from state to state. Do most programs offer a paid internship? 

Finally, what can I do to increase my odds of getting accepted over the next year and a half as I prepare to apply? My undergrad GPA is above a 3.5 in my psych major my GPA was higher. Who did you get your letters of recommendation from? I have done undergraduate research but it's been almost 10 years since I have been in school.  Will letters from school admin and lead teachers help? Should I find a school psychologist to shadow and get a letter from?"

&gt; I am daddy’s little fuckdoll princess.
&gt;  
&gt; Every day, I spend the first part of my day making sure the house is clean, the floors are swept, the kitchen is spotless, and there are fresh sheets on my bed. Making sure everything is perfect, making sure everything is ready just like how daddy wants it.
&gt;  
&gt; In the afternoon, I eat a light lunch, then I run errands, do some shopping, pick up some things for the house and when I finally get home, its time to make myself ready.

dxazoq,2,2019-11-16,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dxazoq/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"18+ looking for 18+ only. All characters are also 18+.

Prompt 1: Young intern/staffer + Young politician

Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door.

Prompt 2: Intern + intern

Who knew that taking a year off from college to work on a campaign could be so tiring? I mean, I knew that, and everybody who even thought about doing it probably did, too, but that doesn't mean that it didn't suck. I never thought that I'd wake up in the morning begging to have a 9am class to go to, but sometimes that felt better than having a 6am policy meeting.

The hardest part, though, was the absolute lack of a social life. Of course, having meetings and events to do most of the day didn't help matters, but we were also shuttling from city to city two to three times a week. You could meet a lot of interesting people that way, but you couldn't really hang out much.

That's probably why you and I became such fast friends. We're the only college students around, and we're probably the two youngest people working on the campaign. Ordinarily, people our age wouldn't be even close to being involved at his high a level in any campaign, but here we are. We hit it off instantly, and we've been friends ever since.

Unfortunately, that's not where it ends. See, I've had a crush on you for almost as long as I've known you (which admittedly isn't that long, but who's counting?). Obviously, I've never been in a position to pursue that.

Until now. For some reason, we needed to cut costs in our latest campaign stop, so they forced everybody to double up in small one-bed hotel rooms. Somebody higher up than us probably thought it'd be funny to put us in the same room.

Hey there, DPP! In this prompt, I'm looking to play one of the two campaign related prompts above. It's pretty open-ended, so you could play a variety of character personalities. My kinks include oral, anal, passionate but ""fun"" sex, young love, light teasing, facials, creampies, kissing, nipple play, and deep throating.P"

The New Intern - Part 1  


Sarah stood in front of her seated boss and waited for his command.  It didn't take long.  


""Strip!"" Jackson ordered.  


She obeyed. *He's seen it all before* she reminded herself. She contrived to keep a bored expression on her face to mask the resentment she felt at being used like this. *I'm supposed to be a journalist!* she thought bitterly. *Not a comfort girl!*  


Her nimble fingers swiftly undid the buttons of her white blouse. Slipping it off her shoulders she let it fall to the floor. Another button and a zipper later her blue mini-skirt fell around her ankles. She was now clad only in her shoes and white lace underwear - but she didn't hesitate to disrobe further. She knew that the faster and more casually she undressed the less dramatic it was - any reluctance on her part merely advertised her discomfort. She unclipped her bra and tossed it aside, revealing her firm C-cup breasts and pale pink nipples. Jackson barely had time to lick his lips before she hooked her thumbs into her waistband and sent her white thong to the floor. Keeping her arms by her sides she made no attempt to cover herself, standing naked before him wearing nothing but her black high heels.  


Jackson looked her up and down, as always. She was a beautiful woman of twenty-six, her blonde hair curled up in a tight bun, her blue eyes a sparkling contrast to her crimson-painted lips. Her skin was a smooth creamy-white, unmarred by any blemish or tan lines. Jackson looked happily at her youthful breasts, her flat tummy and her wide, well-rounded hips. A sight for sore eyes...  


He used to make her wait for the next part, simply to increase her embarrassment, but he had soon discovered this to be ineffective. Sarah knew what was coming and she displayed no anxiety or outward sign of displeasure. Her seemingly casual acceptance of her fate was a little irritating... still, he was going to enjoy this.  


""On your knees.""  


Sarah dropped to the carpet in front of him, face showing no emotion. Looking past her to a strategically-placed mirror he could see her lovely heart-shaped backside - reddened by the paddling he had given her this morning. He smirked in satisfaction at the sight. It was a gratifying reminder that he was in charge...  


""Get to work!"" he told her.   


She reached forward and unfastened his trousers, reaching into his underpants to scoop out his (admittedly impressive) manhood. Her soft hands ran over his hot member, teasing him to a rapid erection before leaning over to take him in her mouth. *That fucking Headmaster!* she raged silently.  


A few weeks previously, Sarah had managed to convince her producer to let her choose her own story. She had gone undercover in a local High School to obtain evidence that male teachers were using the threat of the cane to obtain sexual favours from helpless teenage girls. Her scheme had backfired however: the Headmaster had seen through her deception early on. Playing dumb, he had dutifully caned Sarah every time she was sent to his office, rather than giver her the option of saving her hide by granting him access to her rear entrance. When she had finally (or so she thought) convinced him to make use of her sexually he had revealed that he knew of her plan all along. Since she was neither a student nor a minor he was innocent of any wrongdoing - all her suffering had been for nothing.  


Jackson was privately amused by her failure - yet still angry that she had failed to get a story for him. As she expected he had given her a brutal paddling in front of the whole news team (she had limped for a week) - but that was not the end of it. She was now obliged to report to him every day at 5 o'clock and satisfy him orally. He was well aware of the ""Advanced Blowjobs"" classes she had taken at Monica Glampers ""Boot Camp"" and had made it clear he expected the full deep-throating, ball-tickling, prostate-massaging experience.   


To make matters worse, he had further decreed that each blowjob must last a minimum of fifteen minutes. Since she couldn't see the clock from her kneeling position and her pre-blowjob strip ensured she couldn't wear a watch, Sarah had to err on the side of caution if she wanted to avoid another dose of the paddle. Consequently she was usually on her knees for upwards of twenty minutes in order to protect her tender ass from yet another beating.  


Jackson sighed happily as Sarah  applied herself to his throbbing cock.  He poured himself a brandy and sipped contentedly as her skilled tongue, warm mouth and cool hands brought him to a hardness that only a trained courtesan could achieve.  


""It was a good day today, don't you think?""  


It was a rhetorical question. Sarah couldn't answer with her mouth full - and besides, she had an entirely different view of how the day had been....  


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  


*Friday evening...*  


""Stretch... and hold!""   


The yoga class dutifully performed the move. As the floor space was crowded Sarah found her face in close proximity to Jenni's small, round bottom. Since the uniform G-strings left little to the imagination she was familiar with both the shape of Jeni's buttocks and the pale pink of the cute little asshole between them. The former regularly bore the stripes left by a cane - the latter (just as frequently) had the enlarged and reddened appearance left by a solid rogering. Sarah had first met Jenni during her ill-fated attempt to get an inside scoop on the sexual abuse of schoolgirls.  Like Jenni, Sarah had soon ended up with both a caned bum and a loosened backdoor - yet failed to get her story. The two of them had struck up a friendship based on their mutual unhappiness.  


Jenni's life had changed considerably since the introduction of the Corporal Punishment Act. Regularly sent to the headmaster's office and almost as frequently strapped in public by police for some imagined offence she was accustomed to baring her bottom to receive punishment. At first she had been angry and resentful but after nearly a year of such treatment she was glumly resigned to it.  


Sarah on the other hand had yet to reconcile herself with the new regime. Her hard-won respect in her chosen profession had been totally destroyed the first time she was forced to accept a disciplinary paddling and she had seethed with quiet anger ever since. Her career now depended almost entirely on her willingness to receive CP from her boss. Like Jenni she could say no - but that would mean her instant termination and being blackballed from every news team in the country. Like Jenni she was trapped, an unwilling victim of regular spankings. The two shared a health drink after class while they exchanged stories about their latest spankings.  


On this occasion Sarah was alarmed to see that Jenni bore not only the fresh welts of a caning but also the reddened bumhole that came from the headmaster's preferred sex act.  She asked Jenni about it once they had changed and grabbed their fruit smoothies.  


""Yeah, I got both"" Jenni told her. ""Caned then fucked up the ass. He gave it to me real good too.""  


""What had you done?""  


Jenni shrugged. ""Nothing.""  


""WHAT? He did that for no reason at all?""  


""Oh he had a reason. Last day of school. Said he was sorry to see me leave and was going to give me something to remember him by."" She fidgeted in her seat - obviously she couldn't get comfortable on her sore bottom. ""I'll remember that all right!""  


""But why did you let him? I mean, you didn't deserve it, why let him cane you at all?"" Sarah was dumbfounded that Jenni would submit to such treatment.   


Another shrug. ""It's what I'm for."" Jenni took a long sip of her drink. Evidently it had never occurred to her to argue - being used and abused was part of life as far as she was concerned.  


Sarah frowned. It was shameful what the headmaster had done - but in the new UK there was no comeback to such abuse of power. She decided to move on to a more pleasant topic.  


""Well, at least that's all behind you now"" she said brightly. ""Have you thought about what you want to do now? For a job I mean.""  


Jenni stirred her drink. ""Dunno. Not really good at anything - except  getting spanked and fucked.""  


Determined to shake Jenni's blues Sarah tried several job ideas but Jenni's lack of both grades and enthusiasm ruled them out. The job market was tighter than ever and only the best and brightest could expect to find employment. Eventually she gave up and looked mournfully at her own drink. There was silence for a couple of minutes.  


""How did you get your job?"" Jenni asked.  


""Well, I finished school, did a course in media and journalism, wrote a few pieces for local papers and once I had some experience I applied at news organisations. It wasn't easy. A lot of effort, a lot of rejections."" Sarah chewed her lip while remembering. ""Of course none of that matters now. These days all you need is a pretty face for the camera and a bare ass for the paddle.""   


To her surprise Jenni's face lit up. ""I'm pretty!"" she said. ""And I can drop my knickers anytime. It's all I seem to do these days. Maybe I could get a job with your employer?""  


""I, uh..."" Sarah stopped. She was about to frame a gentle ""sorry but"" speech citing Jenni's lack of qualifications - until she realised that her earlier statement had been absolutely true. All Jackson required from a female reporter was looks and submission to the paddle - and there was no doubt that Jenni had both of those qualities. She was young, pretty, naturally blonde and had a pert little bottom. Her B-cup breasts were high and firm, she was blue-eyed and had flawless milky-white skin. There was no doubt that lecherous bastard Jackson would love to have Jenni on his team. And with Sarah now moving into ""undercover"" work there was an opening for a frontline reporter...  


""Okay... "" Sarah told her friend. ""But you need to know what you're getting into. You won't be a real reporter - other people will write your lines for you, tell you what questions to ask. You'll basically be a pretty face behind a mike.""  


""Sounds good so far!"" Jenni smiled. ""Someone else does the work and I just read the script!""  


""Um, yeah... but Jackson - my boss - he likes to paddle women. A lot. And he does it in front of the whole office.""  


Jenni shrugged this off. ""I get walloped bare-ass in the street once a week. Can't be worse than that.""  


""Well..."" Sarah had to admit, Jenni's employment wouldn't be much different from her current situation.  


""And I'll be getting paid right?""  


""Of course. Starting salary won't be much though.""  


""I'm sure I can suck a few more pounds out of him!"" Jenni laughed. She was frequently on her knees in front of either the headmaster or a police officer - sometimes even the fathers of her school buddies - and her cocksucking skills were superb. Her eyes were sparkling and she looked happier than Sarah could ever remember her being. The prospect of a job had lifted her mood immensely.  


""Well then... "" Sarah couldn't think of any more obstacles ""I'll text you the address. Meet me there at 8:30 monday so I can show you around.""  


""Cool!"" Jenni was keen as mustard.  


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*"

The New Intern - Part 2

*Monday morning...*  


""So that's the tour"" Sarah concluded. She had shown Jenni around the office and introduced her to the people who got in early. Jackson would be due any moment now.  


""Okay"" Jeni was looking optimistic. She had received friendly welcomes from everyone. The men were always happy to see a pretty girl - and they were eager to see her bent over and panties down. The women knew that Jackson would be pleased as punch to have a new girl to paddle - and that Jenni's pert little bum would keep him amused for a while, thus sparing theirs.  


Jenni was dressed for success - a semi-transparent white blouse that clung to her slender body and showed a hint of her small firm nipples.  Her miniskirt was just long enough to cover her firm bottom and her shapely legs were accentuated by a pair of black high heels.  Her hair was tied back in a ponytail that hung almost to her waist, swishing gently as she walked.  She was the picture of teen beauty, and her face glowed with excitement.   


Jackson entered right on time as usual. He glanced around the office and immediately spotted Jenni. ""Well hello there!"" he strode over and shamelessly looked her up and down. ""And who might you be?""  


""Jenni Thompson"" Jenni extended a small hand. ""I'm a friend of Sarah's. She said you might have a job for me.""  


""Did she now?"" Jackson gave Sarah a piercing look as he took Jenni's hand. With uncharacteristic chivalry he kissed it, making Jenni giggle. ""And what makes you think she's good enough for here?"" he raised an eyebrow in Sarah's direction.  


""She's eighteen, she's pretty, and she has a great ass"" said Sarah matter-of-factly. ""That's all you need."" She held Jacksons gaze coolly. ""With me doing undercover work you'll need another frontline reporter. The audience will love Jenni.""  


""I'm sure they will"" Jackson mused. ""But that's not the only requirement. Did you explain to her how we do things around here?""  


""Of course. She's used to the cane, she knows she'll get paddled here. She's okay with it.""  


""Splendid!"" Jackson smiled at Jenni. ""Well then Sarah, if you'll just bend over I'll be able to give miss Thompson here a demonstration!""  


""B-but.. what?"" Sarah was shocked. She had expected that Jackson would test Jenni's resolve with a dose of the paddle - she hadn't expected that her own ass would be walloped!  


""It's 9am, and you aren't at your desk"" Jackson smirked. ""That counts as coming in late!""  


*Dammit!* Sarah felt the familiar sinking sensation in her stomach. She had been so focussed on Jenni that she had forgotten the strict ""on time"" rules. With a resigned sigh she pulled up her skirt. Shuffling her feet apart she bent over, presenting her lovely round buttocks to the whole room. Like Jenni she was fit and toned, but with a fuller woman's figure. A white thong circled her waist and plunged between her perfect ass cheeks. Sarah reached back and pulled it down, exposing her smooth-shaven pussy and small, dark pink asshole.   


""Excellent!"" Jackson nodded in satisfaction. ""Now just wait while I fetch the paddle.""  


Sarah waited, fuming silently. She could hear her co-workers as they took position behind her, jostling for the best view. No matter how many times they had seen her like this the men always wanted more - and the women took pleasure in it too. She no longer felt shame at being on display like this - it was a regular part of life - but the feeling of helplessness always got to her. She could only wait for her punishment...  


""How many does he give you?"" Jenni enquired. She didn't seen to be alarmed - or even surprised at Sarah's impending punishment. Frequent (and often unjust) canings had conditioned her to accept that young women were little more than targets for the firm hand of male authority - and that pretty girls were always first in line for a spanking.  


""Depends on his mood"" Sarah muttered. ""Usually he just swats you until you're crying.""  


Jenni chewed her lip apprehensively. Sarah's paddling was going to be the blueprint for her prospective employment - she was anxious to see how bad it was going to be.  


Jackson reappeared, the paddle in his hand. It was large, wooden, with holes drilled through it to minimise air resistance and maximise striking power. He took position and tapped the hard wood against Sarah's proffered bottom. ""Ready Sarah?""  


""Yes sir"" she replied meekly.  


\*WHACK!\*  


""Aaaaggh!"" Sarah's knees bucked and she fought to maintain her balance. Jackson was using full-force.  ""Thank you sir!"" she said through gritted teeth.  


Jackson looked sideways at Jenni to  gauge her reaction. He was gratified to see that she was neither shocked nor scared - instead she seemed to be studying the effect on Sarah's bottom and calculating how much it hurt. She was well accustomed to both the school cane and the police strap - a wooden paddle was new to her.  Sarah's ass now sported a broad red patch through the centre - a titillating contrast against the pale white of her buttocks.  


\*WHACK!\*  


""NNNNNGGGGH!!!!""  Sarah fought to control her anguish. As a matter of pride she tried not to show how much her paddlings hurt but Jackson was going all-out and the pain was excruciating. Her bottom was  on fire and her glutes felt tenderised already. Holding position required all her willpower. She knew from painful experience that being bent double stretched her bottom tight and made his strikes hurt even more. Failure to keep in place however would lead to more swats. So she was forced into submission: presenting her ass for maximum paddling effect in order to avoid a harsher punishment. ""Th-thank you S-s-sir!"" she stammered.  


The requirement to thank Jackson for every swat was an additional humiliation.  Not only was it galling to feign gratitude each time the hard wooden paddle smacked into her defenceless posterior - the sound of her voice gave him a clear indication of how much pain she was in. Had she been permitted to stay silent she could have clenched her teeth and concealed her suffering. Being forced to speak however gave it away. It was impossible to control her breath while her lungs ached to exhale her agony - impossible to keep the quaver out of her speech while her lip trembled. No matter how hard she tried, Sarah's trembling, hesitant voice betrayed the true depth of her misery.  


\*WHACK!\*  


""YEEEEEEAAAAAAAGGGGHHHH!"" Sarah howled. Her legs buckled and her back arched as she reflexively tried to stand. Her knuckles were white as she grasped her ankles - painful experience had taught her that breaking position was the worst thing she could do. ""OH! OH! OH!"" her desperate gulps for breath could not be kept quiet. Her eyes burned with tears ready to flow - her bottom felt swollen to twice its usual size. She could feel each pounding heartbeat throbbing through her wounded rump - and she knew her punishment was far from over.  


""Th-th.... \*sniff\* tha-ank y-you s-s-sir!"" she managed stammer.  


Jackson looked at Jenni again. He was pleased to see concern written on her pretty face. A paddling was a thing to be feared after all...  


Jenni observed Sarah's beating with growing anxiety. She had felt the cruel bite of the cane at least once a week - and she was no stranger to the sting of the police-issue strap. She had initially assumed that the broad paddle would lessen the pain, but Sarah's obvious suffering was making her doubt this. The superior weight of the wooden paddle gave it a deeper impact - one that tenderised the flesh beneath. This was no superficial sting - she could expect lasting damage from Jackson's paddle.   


Jackson delivered his final blows with all the force he could muster - extracting shrieks of agony from his unfortunate victim.  


""I trust this has been educational Sarah?"" he prompted.  


Several heart-wrenching seconds of sobs and whimpers passed before Sarah was able to gasp out the expected reply. ""Ye...yess... sir"" she squeaked.  


Jackson waited a while, allowing the young woman to tremble in fear of further swats before he finally spoke the words she wanted to hear.  


""Very well. You may stand now!""  


Sarah gratefully released her ankles and straightened up. Her ass was on fire and it was impossible to stand straight. Tears flowed freely down her flushed cheeks. She yearned to rub at her aching behind - but that was forbidden her. In accordance with Jackson's standing orders she forced herself to place her hands on her head. She would have to remain like this - on full display - until permitted to cover herself again. That usually meant a good fifteen minutes of exposure - during which the rest of the office could admire both her smooth-shaven pussy and her bright red ass. She kept her eyes on the ground, unable to meet the leering gazes of her co-workers. She could still hear their snickers and lewd comments however...  


""Well then Jenni"" Jackson directed his voice toward her. ""Do you think you have what it takes to work here?""  


Jenni swallowed hard. Sarah's paddling had been far more severe than she expected - but nonetheless, she knew she needed a job and no other options were available. Drawing a deep breath she looked Jackson squarely in the eye.  


""I can take it sir"" she said firmly. ""My ass is yours.""  


Thrilled as he was to hear her response Jackson managed to contain his delight. He looked her up and down in a calculating fashion. Jenni braced herself mentally, expecting the order to bend over and bare herself - to put her bottom where her mouth was.  


Jackson chewed his lip thoughtfully. He was eager to paddle Jenni's firm round behind - but decided to be magnanimous. There would be plenty of opportunities in the future, and it was important to make a good first impression. Firm but fair after all...  


""Well then"" he smiled with practised charm. ""Welcome to the team!""  


He tucked the paddle under one arm and shook Jenni's hand. The audience cheered and clapped (except for Sarah who still had her hands on her head).  


Jenni smiled brilliantly, her face positively glowing with delight. For the first time in her young life it seemed that her bare-bottomed education was actually doing her some good! She waved her thanks to her new colleagues, while the quietly sobbing Sarah reflected on the old adage that no good deed goes unpunished...  


 \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  


""Oooooooh!"" Jackson moaned. Sarah's lips were wrapped tightly around him, her mouth was sliding up and down the full length of his shaft and he was sliding a couple of inches down her throat as she took him in all the way. One of her hands was gently stroking his balls - the other was pressing just behind his sack, stimulating his prostate with firm rubbing. His mind was full of dark fantasies - dreaming of how he could use and abuse his pretty new employee. Since Jenni was already used to the choice of corporal punishment or sexual submission he knew he would be able to spank or fuck her depending on his mood. It was a good time to be the boss...  


He felt the warmth rise within him and stiffened, his breath now a series of short pants. Sarah recognised the signs of impending climax and redoubled her efforts, sucking and rubbing as fast as she could.  


""OOOOOOHHH YEEEEEESSSSSSSS!"" Jackson exclaimed, revelling in the sensation as his hot cum flowed like lava through his throbbing cock. He grabbed Sarah's head and forced her down onto him, shooting his sticky load down her throat. She took it all with practised ease - her deepthroating skills having been mercilessly beaten into her by eager men and hard leather straps. She held her breath until he relaxed his grip and allowed her to pull away from his engorged member.  


She continued to work him with her tongue, licking him clean as his breathing slowed. *All done!* she thought with satisfaction. *Now for home and a nice hot bath...* She looked up at him and waited to be dismissed. She was unsettled to see that he was smirking at her - not with his usual satisfaction but with a cruel, gloating expression that she knew all too well...  


""Check the time Sarah"" he told her.   


She turned her head to see the clock - and felt her heart sink. *It was only twelve past five!*  


""Assume the position!"" her delighted boss instructed.  


Groaning, Sarah got to her feet and turned around. She bent over and held her ankles, presenting her already bruised ass to his view. She heard him zip up and take the paddle from its hook on the wall. The hard wood tapped against her buttocks, making her cheeks tingle.  


""Are you ready Sarah?""  


""Yes sir"" was the forlorn response. ""Please punish me!""  


*Yes indeed!* thought Jackson happily as he took aim for his first swat. *Today was a* ***very*** *good day!*  


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*"
dxcixg,4,2019-11-16,AITA if I stop interacting with my coworker unless it is necessary?,kayjayhx66,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dxcixg/aita_if_i_stop_interacting_with_my_coworker/,"I (25f) work the same shift every week (Sat/Sun) and since I work in a very small company, I work every single shift with the same person (55M). When I started here 4 years ago (he was there 6 years before), it wasn’t bad because we usually found things to talk about. From 10 AM to about 4 PM it is just the two of us unless customers come in. 

Over the past 4 years, I’ve become very depressed and had to keep working while also completing 40 hours of internships a week. I’m pretty run down and my depression has kind of spiraled to the point where I keep to myself a lot. I started to realize that work would make it worse due to my coworker ALWAYS being negative about everyone. I mean EVERYTHING. Any minor convenience is the end of the world, any weird person is super suspicious, and this was happening constantly. 

You can definitely tell things are different because I keep to myself. I try not to be rude about it by replying and keeping a conversation if he tries to start one. I’ll also bring something up if there’s nothing negative about it. It just seems like every time he talks, it’s negative. 
He’s also undermining me. Today I was talking to a customer at the front desk that was explaining an issue. As I was answering, my coworker jumps in to answer the question. It’s not like I didn’t know the answer. This happens at least once a shift. The only time I ever enter into a conversation while he’s with a customer is if I helped the customer earlier in the day. 

There are times when I feel like a terrible person though when we are sitting in the back room with no customers and not talking. The thing is that he tries to put himself in whatever area I am in, or at least it feels like it. I realize that shouldn’t bother me because he has every right to be wherever he wants, but if I have a customer and he doesn’t, he watches my entire transaction. Sometimes when I’m on my computer he adjusts so he can see what I’m doing and then will comment on it. It’s not a secret, but he doesn’t have to be watching everything I do. 

Even with all of this happening, I start to feel guilty because he has to spend two days with me, and I know the other days he works are miserable because the other workers here are hard to get along with. I hate feeling like I have the burden of making his week better though, I don’t think that should be on me. 

Truth be told, I have started to lift out of my depression by being less negative. Maybe it’s a placebo effect, but it has helped. I just get very caught up in the guilt of him being uncomfortable now, that it seems like no matter if I talk to him or not, my work day sucks.
I don’t want to talk about the situation to him or my manager because of how close everyone is and I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. I am graduating college in May and will be done working here around that time. I just want to get through this, but I’m not sure if I’m being an asshole by keeping my conversations limited.
Sorry this was so long."

Very very tired.,BeNiceToPeople2,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dxcscr/i_am_tired_and_done_with_it_very_very_tired/,"Life is fucking hard for me. And I know the first counter thing I am gonna face is other people's life is harder than you. Yes, but at this moment, I don't care and I don't want to.

I have tried and done a lot for everyone and everything.

So, I go to college thinking that oh, if I do well in college I have good chances of landing a job. 2 years into college I realized people don't care about it at all. You work so hard in every class in every thing and all it boils down to is one number. Your gpa. That one number on your resume which the interviewer looks past by because they want your experience. So, sure all those sleepless nights, all those hard work put in is all fucking useless. Because now I realized that its the experience. So I try one more year, build some projects, build some background. Try to show off my coding skills. And guess what even that doesn't lead you fucking far. Now you have to solve problems to get an internship or atleast a fucking interview. So by the end of third year, I go ham on these interview problems and whatever, I block off every distraction,  I stop watching any movie, any series, any game, any party, any hangout sessions that I usually did. And solve about 150-200 Problems. So then my senior year I apply to companies, try to pull up my gpa, try to study for interviews, give interviews, apply again, study for midterms, and fucking get rejected again, and again, and again. I see people who aren't as smart as me (i know this is overconfidence or being arrogant but fuck it its honest) or aren't as hardworking as me, getting jobs at high companies, while I try to fight depression, pull my life together and end up crying every weekend because of all of this bullshit. Then when I try to contact my family and friends back home, they're like 'oh of course you're having so much fun their, its murica'. How ignorant of you???  I spend my every waking minute trying to get my life together and I either get bombarded with 'oh, you're having so much fun' 'oh, you're smart and of-course it gets you everything' its not smartness. Its not. It is burning yourself, it is hard work. Giving every inch of yourself, and facing 5-6 rejections every week and still keep going.

Noone, noone will understand my struggles because everyone interested in your struggles need some sort of 'glorification' or good drama problems like 'oh I broke up with my boyfriend' or 'oh my boyfriend cheated on me' some sort of gossip problems because if you try to tell them these problems, they say I exaggerate.   
I help everyone so much in everything without being judgemental of all kinds of problems they have but life is fucking hard for me. There I said it.  


And if you made it this far, I am very very very grateful you read it. Let me know your view in comments.

TL;DR: I am tired of everything in life."

I've been holding this in for a good while, because my father stopped calling me and checking in, and that might be for the better. Since I can't really seem to keep my relationships healthy and functioning, I had hoped I could get a load off my chest here. When I say I think my father not calling might be for the better, it's because he's a toxic person. Not completely or unredeemably so, but to the point where I can't stand him. His calls are usually guilt trips to get me to come visit for a weekend or so, and I just haven't been able to build the nerve. Telling him this will be completely counter productive, so I might as well dump it off here. When I'm at his house he yells, all the time. Not at me or my brother or anyone I care particularly about, but his wife. Our relationship (me and her) was never good, but mending it now seems completely impossible in that environment. I'm quite a calm person usually, pretty chill, always willing to compromise, but I've had enough of it. When I'm there and he's yelling at his wife, it's of course unbelievably uncomfortable and I do fell bad for her, but what she seems to do is take it out on me. She always seemed to stay off my case and mostly rag on my brothers. Her humor has always been demeaning and cruel and people have been ignoring it for fear of her creating a scene. She's insane. I don't want to go there. I don't want my children to have anything to do with her, if I ever have children. I want her out of my life.

I live 150km away from them (about 100 miles), and even though a small part of me wants to return to my home town to be able to see the rest of my family more often, I cannot stand those two shitheads for lack of a better word. But with my father not calling my support system is kind of gone from my life. All that's left are professional relationships and half-assed friendships. Nobody can deal with this kind of crap coming from someone their own age and even though I'm 27 I can't deal with it either. I can't afford a therapist as I'm still studying. Life is hard. Winter is making it harder. Now I just really want peace from my thoughts and problems. I just want quiet.  But I can't get that because I have to teach as an intern and I have to keep up with homework and I live in a dorm and I want a life. I am losing it"

I'm a university student, looking for a part-time job to not only help my grandparents with putting me through university but also, to make my CV stand out for future internship applications\~

That is why I reach out to your kennel! I understand that your last female dog has passed away recently. ㅠ.ㅠ

It must be such devastating news for the male dogs! — I've spent long and hard thinking about how I could contribute to your kennel and while doing so, on a western message board, I received the recommendation, that I could try replacing the bitch you've lost, so that your mutts neither suffer from a reduction in fertility nor increased aggression.

I think that is very important for a breeding kennel, no? Considering how important both of these are to the pedigree of a renown kennel. — The men were so friendly in recommending me how to best help, and they even voiced that, in their opinion, a cute Korean girl would be for sure liked by all the big dogs!

Therefore, I was thinking, maybe I could wear my old school uniform and let them dry-hump on me. Many of my panties are very soft and hopefully shouldn't cause pain to the dogs.\~

When I was young I often roamed around on all four and went \*wang!\* \*wang!\*. I think I can be a convincing dog for them and I would like to contribute to your great kennel and help you make this amazing breed more popular in Korea!

Please consider hiring me, I will try my best to become an asset to your kennel and earn myself a letter of recommendation for my CV.\~

dxekhq,33,2019-11-16,The Challenges and Officer Progession systems need a serious overhaul. The longevity of the game depends on it.,NotBen_2,modernwarfare,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dxekhq/the_challenges_and_officer_progession_systems/,"This system is very much flawed. When IW said that weapons and other rewards can be earned in game, the community didn't expect it to be a chore-laden gimmick. While its 10x better than a lootbox system, it feels like a lazy attempt at adding in-game content not locked behind a pay-wall.

This system needs to be overhauled for the betterment of the game and its longevity.

1) First thing: Implement the ability for challenges to be earned in the background. I don't understand why I need to be punished for not playing the game according to the mission I have selected. I should be able to earn 70 LMG kills while trying to earn 35 kills with Frags too. Making these missions selectable just takes the fun out of playing my own way.

2) Group the Challenges by type. To unlock a special assault rifle I need ground war flag caps and then equipment kills? This makes no sense and reiterates it as being a damn chore. I alter my playstyle for part 1, then change it up for part 2. Instead,  Make them tiered based on some overarching theme. Here's an example, with the Theme being a Ground War playstyle:

Steel Curtain AK-47 Variant (earn in any order)
200 Kills on Ground War. 
 40 Headshots on Ground War.
 20 Longshots on Ground War with A Long Barrel.
 5 Point Blank Kills.
 10 kills with no attachments.

Here it actually adds a sense of progression without feeling like a chore. They are earned organically, just by playing the game. You don't have to go out of your way, or punish your tried-and-true playstyle, just to complete a challenge. 

3) Add more damn Challenges! 
Add more challenges for every perk you use, every killstreak you deploy, every grenade you use. I think it would be pretty neat to have a calling card or an emblem, or a character skin tied to kills while an enemy is stunned. 

The possibilities and creations are endless and yet we're stuck with this repetitive officer system that feels like it was made by an intern."
dxelaf,3,2019-11-16,I am bulimic and I'm afraid that I'm going to die,ugh3333,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dxelaf/i_am_bulimic_and_im_afraid_that_im_going_to_die/,"So this is going to be a bit of a rambling post, sorry in advance.

I (22M) am a senior in college (graduating in May), I've been struggling with Bulimia and Anorexia for the last 4 years. Right now I'm 5'4"" (short, I know) and I weigh 95 pounds, for what it's worth.

My disorder is the worst it's ever been. For the first three years of college I was doing alright, but now it's truly bad. I binge and purge 4-7 times a day, spending hundreds of dollars a week for food, yet I barely keep any food down. My weight has fluctuated a lot over the last 4 years, I was 120 in April and I've lost 25 pounds in just 7 months. 

All of this is really affecting my school performance. I can't focus in class, I can't study because I'm either too hungry to focus, buying binge food, or actually binging. My grades are slipping, I haven't even really given any though to a job or internship after graduation. It's so hard for me to plan for my future when all I can think about is my next binge.

What's worse is how my physical health is being affected. My chest hurts a lot, I get dizzy, I'm always cold, I have zero energy. It's gotten so bad so fast. I've always known in the back of my mind that this disorder could kill me, but this is the first time that I'm truly afraid that I'll die soon, it's totally out of my control now.

I feel so overwhelmed and scared and lonely. I don't why I can't bring myself to stop or ask for help. I feel so defeated by this.

Anyway I know that's messy and heavy, I just needed to get this off my chest."
dxeqx2,54,2019-11-16,"Aktuelle Trends bei (Direkt)Banken: PSD2, 2FA, TAN Verfahren, Sicherheit, HBIC/FinTS",Rainer74,Finanzen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finanzen/comments/dxeqx2/aktuelle_trends_bei_direktbanken_psd2_2fa_tan/,"Ich beobachte die deutsche (Direkt)Banken-Szene schon eine Weile. Und es braut sich was zusammen. Viele Details sind hier schon diskutiert worden, aber ich glaube der große Zusammenhang ist noch nicht klar. Hoffe meine \*kurze\* Zusammenfassung ist hilfreich. Eure Meinung und Erfahrungen sind gefragt! Ich werde diesen Post updaten, wenn weitere Änderungen/Details bekannt werden.

Vordergründig gehts um mehr Sicherheit durch die Einführung von PSD2 und 2FA im Sept-2019. Das ist gesetzlich vorgeschrieben und die Banken **müssen** das umsetzen. Aber es gibt dabei **Spielraum**, der von den Banken sehr unterschiedlich genutzt wird:

**#1** Die **Abfrage einer TAN beim einfachen Login**: Laut Gesetz ist das nur alle 90 Tage vorgeschrieben, aber zwingend für ""kritische Informationen"" und tatsächliche Transaktionen. Bei manchen Banken kann man sich 'fast ohne' TAN einloggen - nur alle paar Monate kommt eine Abfrage. Hier kann man also den Kontostand ohne TAN einsehen. Allerdings verlangt z.B. meine Sparkasse jedesmal eine TAN wenn ich Umsätze sehen will, die mehr als 90 Tage zurückliegen (=kritische Info). Andere Banken (z.B. ING) definieren einfach bereits eine einfache Kontostandsabfrage als ""kritische Information"" und die TAN muss zwingend bei jedem Login eingegeben werden. ConsorsBank ist gerade im Umbruch und dort wird dann auch bei jedem Login eine TAN gebraucht. Bei Comdirect gibt es eine interessante Lösung namens ""**TAN Freiheit**"". Hier kann man 5x pro Tag je max. 30€ ohne TAN überweisen und intern 1000€ pro Tag zwischen den eigenen Konton ohne TAN verschieben. Man sieht also die Banken haben durchaus Spielraum bei der Umsetzung von PSD2.

**#2 Erzeugung von TANs:** Seit dem 'Verbot' der iTAN Listen via PSD2 Richtlinie, gibt es im Prinzip die folgenden Varianten zur TAN Erzeugung: mTAN (per SMS, auf Dumb-Phones oder SmartPhones), chipTAN mit Generator (manuell, FlickerCode, QR oder Farbcode) oder appTAN (heißt überall anders: SecurePlus bei ConsorsBank, banking2go bei ING, pushTAN bei den Sparkassen, Tan2go bei DKB ). Hier sind 3 Trends klar zu erkennen:

A) **mTAN** ist weiterhin legal aber wird bei mehr und mehr Banken kostenpflichtig (z.B. 0,10€/SMS bei Sparkassen, 0,09€/SMS bei Comdirect)  oder gar nicht mehr angeboten (DKB, ConsorsBank ab 15. Nov).  Bisher ist mTAN bei ING noch kostenlos, kann aber jederzeit abgeschafft werden.

B) Alle Banken bewerben ihre **appTAN** Verfahren extrem stark - ING Kunden wissen was ich meine. Das passiert meistens in Verbindung mit ihrer hauseigenen banking App. Ob es eine gute Idee ist TAN Erzeugung und Banking auf dem **gleichen Gerät** zu machen (Smartphone, Tablet ..) kann sich jeder selbst überlegen. Hier gibts auch interessante Klauseln in den AGBs für Haftungsausschlüsse der Banken z.B. bei fehlerhaften Zahlungen - also Augen auf! Man kann natürlich **zwei** getrennte Geräte verwenden, aber wer macht das schon. Anscheinend gibt es auch Banken die eine ""One-App"" Lösung anbieten wo TAN Erzeugung und Banking in der gleichen App ablaufen - suche hierfür noch Beispiele.

C) Als Alternative bieten die meisten (Direkt)Banken **chipTAN** an, wofür man einen Generator braucht. Hier gibt wiederum zwei Lager. Auf **standardisierte frei verkäufliche multibankenfähige TAN Generatoren** (z.B. von Reiner SCT und Kobil) setzen z.B. die DKB und Sparkassen. Aufpassen muss man hier bei den einzelnen Verfahren. Die Sparkassen hab ein eigenes Farbmatrix-Verfahren (Sm@rtTAN), das so ähnlich wie QR code aussieht. Aber es gibt inzwischen Geräte, die sowohl QR als auch Farbmatrix können. Das zweite Lager bilden z.B. ING, Comdirect und jetzt auch ConsorsBank (SecurePlus), die auf **hauseigene TAN Generatoren** setzen, welche nicht mit anderen Banken kompatibel sind. Die ING rechtfertigt sich damit, dass nur mit dieser eigenen Lösung den Kunden ein sicheres Banking garantiert werden kann. Man fragt sich aber wie DKB und Sparkassen das mit der Sicherheit hinbekommen, und warum das ING Teil stolze \~30€ kostet. Warum die ConsorsBank mit SecurePlus jetzt auch diesen Weg geht kann man nur vermuten, aber ein ist sicher: Um die Kundenfreundlichkeit geht es sicher nicht. Allgemein fragt man sich auch wie ein kostenpflichtiger TAN-Generator mit der Direktbanken-Werbung für kostenlose (Giro)Konton zusammenpassen.

**#3 Support von privater BankingSoftware via HBCI / FinTS:**

Im Zuge der PSD2 Umstellung, gibt es zunehmend Probleme mit (PC) BankingSoftware wie MoneyMoney, StarMoney, Outbank, Finanzmanager etc. Einerseits weil man jetzt für viele Banken selbst bei einfacher Kontostandsabfrage eine TAN braucht. Das macht dann so richtig Spaß wenn man 3+ Konten hat und mal eben einen schnellen Finanzüberblick will. Das schlimmere Problem ist aber, dass manche Banken die PSD2 Umstellung nutzen, um die Nutzung von BankingSoftware absichtlich einzuschränken. Negativbeispiel ist hier die ING, bei der HBCI inzwischen nur noch Lesend möglich ist (und auch das nur nach massivem Kundenprotest). Ein Verlust von (vermögenden) Altkunden, die jahrelang BankingSoftware verwendet haben, wird in Kauf genommen. Dass die technische Umsetzung von **PSD2 und HCBI/FinTS** Funktionen technisch durchaus möglich sind zeigt die DKB. Ob die ConsorsBank weiterhin HBCI/FinTS unterstützt weiss ich nicht, aber ich erwarte nichts gutes.  
\*Update 17.Nov\* Die DKB plant laut Kundenservice die Einstellung des Supports von HBCI im Jahr 2021. Genauere Details sind noch nicht bekannt.  


**Kurz was  zur Sicherheit:**

Alle 3 TAN Verfahren wurden bereits erfolgreich angegriffen / gehackt. Hier sind ein paar interessante CCC Vorträge zur (Un)Sicherheit der TAN-Verfahren:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYAwe-etEU0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYAwe-etEU0)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FByqA0Qry84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FByqA0Qry84)

Im Vergleich ist chipTAN am sichersten, weil der Generator offline ist und nicht manipuliert werden kann. Der Angriff auf chipTAN ist durch eine Kombination aus Trojaner/Phishing, fake-Website und unaufmerksamen Benutzer (die Anzeige auf dem TAN Generator nicht kontrolliert) im Prinzip möglich - aber eher unwahrscheinlich.

Seitenhieb: Wenn ich hier lese wie gedankenlos biometrische Authentifizierung (Fingerabdruck, Gesichtserkennung, evtl. bald Iris-Scan etc) verwendet und nachgefragt wird, komme ich auf düstere Gedanken. Zum Glück gibt es auch ein paar kritische Stimmen hier!

**Fazit:**

Konditionen vergleichen und Bank wechseln! Beschwerden bei den Banken bringen überhaupt nichts, wie die **Fäkalstürme bei ING und ConsorsBank** zeigen (links unten). Ein gewisser Verlust von Kunden durch die beschriebenen Änderungen scheint eingeplant/eingepreist zu sein. Zum Glück sind Kontenwechsel und Depotüberträge innerhalb D kostenlos. Ich wechsle grad zu einer Bank, die vieles richtig macht. Gehe aber davon aus, dass es auch hier bald Änderungen gibt.Das erklärte Ziel ist die Nutzung von appTAN und banking App mit allen Konsequenzen für Sicherheit, Manipulierbarkeit und Benutzerfreundlichkeit.Wie jemand ernsthaft auf die Idee kommt sicheres und sinnvolles Multi-Banking inkl. Depotführung am Smartphone machen zu wollen, ist mir schleierhaft. Die Einschränkung von HBCI/FinTS Funktionen könnte sog. **Finanzdienstleistern** (nicht zu verwechseln mit den o.g. BankingSoftware Anbietern) viele neue (zahlende) Kunden bringen. Diese Drittanbieter müssen sich zwar inzwischen bei der BaFin registrieren lassen, aber typischerweise muss man ihnen umfangreiche Zugriffsrechte auf die eigenen Konten geben, um ihren ""Service"" zu nutzen. Und natürlich wollen die auch was verdienen .. im besten Fall durch einfache Gebühren .. aber die Finanzdaten der Kunden sind durchaus auch Geld wert ..

Wenn man die Entwicklung beobachtet fragt man sich:

Warum einigen sich die Banken nicht auf einen gemeinsamen Standard für chipTAN? Dann könnten unabhängige Anbieter kompatible Geräte entwickeln. Man bräuchte als Kunde dann nur **einen Generator für alle Banken** und die Banken hätten die Kosten für die Geräte ausgelagert. Klingt nach Win-Win-Win Situation, oder nicht? Sparkassen, DKB und paar andere machens vor.

Warum behindern die Banken die etablierte HCBI/FinTS basierte BankingSoftware?

Welche Vorteile bringen SmartPhone Kunden für die Banken?

Ich hätte da schon ein paar Ideen ... aber ich wüsste gern was ihr so denkt :)"
dxf8ei,1,2019-11-16,25 M4A (You Playing F) In Search of the Elusive Long-Term Detailed Story,WritingWizard124,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dxf8ei/25_m4a_you_playing_f_in_search_of_the_elusive/,"Good evening!

So tonight, I've decided to take my time and craft a request thread that more adequately states what kinds of things I am looking for in a roleplay.  I've been roleplaying for approximately 15 years now on various chat rooms and forums, though only about 6 or so have involved smut of any kind.  I love writing, and as such, I'm really looking to find a writing partner that will intrigue me, entertain me, inspire my writing, and create an altogether fun story with me.  And I hope that in return, I will do all of these things and more for you in our stories.

Granted, we all know that a lot of roleplay involves smut, and I absolutely enjoy that as well.  But smut without a story is just a bad porn film, and that's certainly not what I'm looking for.  I need story.  I need plot and world building.  Smut is important and fun and all that good stuff, but why are our characters suddenly sleeping together.  I don't believe a good story has a character simply look at the other and decide to sleep with them.  Something has to stir within both characters, and that something is what I try to explore thoroughly in all my writings.

Now, before I get into the ideas that I have, I would first like to say that I am absolutely open to your ideas as well.  This isn't a one-sided thing, and it never will be with me.  It's important that I enjoy myself, but it's also important to me that you enjoy writing with me as well.  And if you find yourself not enjoying an aspect of a roleplay, I never will be offended if you let me know what you're not enjoying about the story, and we can work to curve things toward another direction if need be.  And certainly, I'll be open with you as a partner as well if things aren't really being enjoyed on my end also.  With that being said, I will -never- ghost a roleplay.  There comes a time in any roleplay where it isn't quite as fun anymore, or burnout happens.  I get it.  But I'd feel guilty as hell if I ever just quit a RP without an explanation, and I'll give you that courtesy.  I just ask that you give me the same.

Now, as you can see in the tag, I'm open to roleplaying with men and women.  But the one requirement I will have is that you MUST play the female role.  I consider myself a fairly flexible writer, but I'm terrible at writing female characters, and I definitely want the person I'm roleplaying with to play the female role.  I am a straight male, but I don't mind if you are a male behind the screen.  All that matters to me is that your character is female.

Now for the fun part:

**Limits/Kinks:**



I will eventually put a more detailed F-list on here, but limits-wise, I am not into non-con, gore, bathroom stuff.  The extremes essentially.  I won't say that I'm vanilla per se, but I do tend to enjoy more usual modern slice of life themes.  I love playful teasing, things happening in water (pools, hot tubs, showers, etc.), small things that on their own don't mean much, but add up toward much more.  Teasing, brushing up against one another, accidental nudity, those kind of things.  Beyond that, if something makes sense in the general flow of the RP, you'll usually find that I'm up for it, but if ever in doubt, just ask.



**RP Ideas:**



Again, not an all-inclusive list, and you're more than welcome to offer your own ideas, but here's some ideas I've compiled of late.  I'll continue to add to this list as I discover new ideas that I enjoy.



**Celebrities** - 

I LOVE roleplaying within the celebrity genre.  Probably one of my favorite things to do.  I generally am looking for the female character to be the celebrity in this, though I suppose for the right writing partner, that could be flexible as well.  Currently, I have scenes involving celebrity incest (Dad/daughter, brother/sister, mom/son) and celebrity fan encounters (this one currently takes place at a convention locally to my character).  But feel absolutely free to suggest your own celebrity ideas as well.  I would love to try something new in this genre.  In the latter scene, I'm willing to play an older or a younger fan, and willing to play any ages allowable by site rules.

Some celebrities I enjoy playing opposite of include, but are not limited to (In no particular order): Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lawrence, Kaley Cuoco, Lauren Cohan, Christina Hendricks, Demi Lovato, and sometimes Taylor Swift depending on the role.  Absolutely feel free to suggest some of your favorites as well!


**Teacher/student or coach/athlete** - 

I really enjoy the power dynamic between the two here, but this isn't your cliche ""You're failing a test, so do things for the teacher to get your grades up"" kind of trope.  That's too easy.  That doesn't cause me to think or be interested in any way.  For these two ideas, I am willing to play either the older or younger role, and again, the younger character, I'm fine with that character being anything allowed within site rules.  

My basic idea for both involve a pairing of two individuals who actually get along great.  Perhaps the teacher or the coach has been their teacher or coach for some time, allowing for a better relationship/bond between the two than most of the people their age.  Nothing unprofessional has happened between them at the time the RP starts, but through time, a very inappropriate relationship begins to build between the pair.  I do tend to love writing scenes involving disallowed relationships, which brings me to:


**Incest** - 

Disallowed relationships really thrill me.  Relationships that society looks down on.  And of course, this is the case with incest.  No, not something I'm into in real life, but writing it has always been enjoyable to me for whatever reason.  For these, I've got scenes involving dad/daughter, brother/sister, or mom/son.  Open to other suggestions as always.


**Boss/employee** - For this, I think the easiest way is to post the scene idea that I have:

*I am a manager at a major marketing firm in New York. Basically what we do is try to get various companies to pay us to run their entire advertising campaign for them. It's a big money business, but someone has to do it, and all the stress and burden falls on our shoulders - they just 'show us the money.'

Unfortunately, that does mean a lot of trips away from home; away from family. But I have a loving wife, and she has been very understanding.

A very big automobile company based in California is my next client, and this one deal could pay for all of our operations for the next year and beyond. And so, being the best representative at the company, I'm the one tasked with flying out that way and convincing them to sign with us.

One problem, my assistant. She's tasked to go with me, but she can't do her job properly. She mixes up phone calls, she messes up the calendar. All of the tasks she is assigned to, she can't do. So I fire her, just a day before I would need someone to come with me to help me stay organized.

I try to see if I can borrow other managers' assistants, but they were all booked as well. So it's recommended that I give you a chance, a young intern in our firm. They say you work hard, and on such short notice, I didn't have much of a choice.

So I agree, calling you into my office to talk to you about the opportunity.*



**TV Show/Movies** - 

Of course, I also enjoy writing within television and movie universes as well.  I find this is the hardest category to find a match, as it does require both people to have some kind of a clue about the film or show itself.  With that being said, I've written scenes within shows like The Big Bang Theory, Girl Meets World, Gotham, Game of Thrones, Marvel Cinematic, and the like.  Always open for those, and this list will expand as well.  Also open to your ideas as well.




As stated, this list and this post will be ever evolving.  At the end of the day, I'm looking for ideas.  Compelling stories.  World-building.  If my ideas aren't something you enjoy, don't hesitate to send me some of your ideas.  I might not like them, but who knows, your idea might intrigue me.  As long as they don't break my limits posted above, I might be open-minded toward them.



Please note that I am ALWAYS looking for capable partners.  So if you see this post, whether I'm online or not, feel free to hit me up.  I will respond as soon as humanly possible.  Let's quench each other's literary thirst!"

But it's helping my life.",Similar-Astronomer,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dxfhit/im_married_and_i_have_a_crush_on_my_supervisor/,"I started an unpaid internship with a startup just getting off the ground, partly because I was won over by the founder and his mission. The more I've worked with him. the stronger this feeling is becoming. He's not the most attractive or anything, but has a great personality and is extremely intelligent and driven. I'm equal parts inspired and swooning lol.

It's progressed to having some pretty risque fantasies about him that I'm feeling a little bad about. But the thing is, I've been in a really bad place the last few years, anxiety and depression, and I'm starting to care a little more about things in life and getting my libido back which has been awol for a while.

So although i feel kind of bad, I'm giving into it a little because I like the feeling of having someone to dress up for and put in more effort generally for, since I want to do those things for myself, and my husband, anyways to get out of this depressive funk.

Thanks for listening."
dxfkzy,1,2019-11-16,Can I get a second opinion,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dxfkzy/can_i_get_a_second_opinion/,"So I have like 5 convictions right now, and literally this week I caught the last two for graffiti which in itself is its own thing I always felt compulsed to do. The first time I caught a charge it was pretty much actually police brutality since I was just playing with a airsoft gun in the middle of nowhere with my ex and someone called it in as someone had a real gun (they sent a a apv and I was told after everything they were going to shoot me, literally the only reason I'm alive is that I left before they got there) and that was easy enough to brush off since I was like 19 and it was explained that even though it was a misdemeanor it would go away in 5 years. Fast forward like a year later and the same person who I was with who I always smoked with ended up convincing me to give her money to meet a guy at like 12am late as fuck at night and it goes down and its raining, dark, I'm tired and shes getting mad since I havent found a place to let her roll to smoke. Shes screaming at me and I miss a stop sign and as soon as the cop comes to the window he calls it and the car gets searched. She immediately refuses to even say she knows what it is or that its hers since she apparently doesnt smoke right? So I catch two charges, somehow just ordinace violations (seriously, I dont know why I'm here at this point) for thc and paraphernalia, but those go away after 5 years too. So at this point I'm sitting here like ok, none of this is exactly wholly my fault but its still getting lame taking all these charges and shit but since I decide to forgive her and date her like 2 more years (I had to leave my abusive household and was kind of stuck in the position, plus being dumb and thinking they care fuck my life) and I eventually leave her. 

So here I am smoking for this entire time and getting up and over 300+ tags, throw ups, etc and in college (all the while getting profoundly high marks easily in web and software dev) I figured if I'm already in this position and especially after watching people around me get systematically beat down or even killed it got easy to brush things off as its a systematic thing and that I can still do things with my life (investment property -&gt; expand -&gt; start business -&gt; win at life / help people in same problems) and maybe after the 5 years which was pretty close I got caught and charged with two more ordinace violations for destruction of property (marker tags of all things right? ) and for some reason I still havent had anything other than fines which I'm completely shocked over honestly because I've literally seen lives ruined for nothing. 

So I ended up throwing everything out, including my dro, pax, and prized pilot streaker but I think unless I can convince the system to expunge this later on this is at least sticking. This has actually made me think of just quitting smoking and everything since I'm just tired of things, especially since after thinking about things I never thought I would be alive past 21 for a number of reasons, but I'm a year older than that now and I have no idea how to go to a formal interview if I even get that (and I have to get a internship to graduate this college with a associates degree) with the average populous that already has kind of dismissed me as a person even before I had 5 literal criminal charges. Like I still dont see myself giving up but for some reason I literally just dealt with and am still processing life at this point and I still am debating keeping doing acid and smoking weed which I think at this point is just a unnecessary risk, but especially with weed its so normalized am I really just a bitch for feeling like maybe quitting at least for a while to see how things go for a while isnt too bad?
Either way sometimes it feels like someone out there is looking after me thats not here anymore even though I usually am a firm logic based person, but if anyone somehow read all of this I just wanted a opinion away from all the weed hype honestly, although, if my state legalizes I'm fucking ALL the weed up bruh"

I kinda transferred to york with previous school’s almost full 4 year course loads. I just need to take 4-5courses to receive certificate from there. 
So I wanted to study different field, I applied to york cs program. I got admitted to cs honours and they transferred most of the electives credits. I am satisfied with this cs program and I am hoping to do cs related masters later (maybe after I work in field for few years). 
But the question is I will be having 4year design degree and a cs degree.  
And I just want to save my time and money, I don’t know if I should study full four years in cs program or not. assume I only take eecs courses, it is still taking longer than non honours. 
But many ppl say with 3 year degree, the chance to get “good” jobs is hard and they will think I finished early cuz my gpa was low.. idk 
Also my friends say companies want 4 year degree graduates and I don’t know how I could explain my educational history. 
I have been having many thoughts for long time and I am not sure what would be the better option for me cuz I am quite old now and really want to graduate. But on the other side, I want to get internship and stuff which is not allowed for three year degree students at york."
dxggts,1,2019-11-16,"One of the oldest, biggest, and most unknown bugs of the game: AoE visuals vs. effects",QuantumQuantonium,Overwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/dxggts/one_of_the_oldest_biggest_and_most_unknown_bugs/,"**Summary:**

There is a little known Area of Effect (AoE) bug that's been in the game since its release. It exists due to an issue with how the AoE abilities (like Mei's ult, 76's healing, Baptiste's invuln field) work. I think this bug needs to be fixed so the abilities work as they should visually. Below I go into more detail and examples of why this bug is a problem and how I think it should be fixed. If you want to learn a bit about how game's inner workings work, then I suggest you maybe take a look, especially at my explanation.

**Examples of the problem:**

Here's what I mean by the title. Go into a game with a friend. One of you play as Mei, and get your ult. Once received, have the player not throwing the ult hide behind a wall. Then, ult right on the other side of that wall. Visually, your enemy friend will be within Mei's ult. The player should be freezing up, receiving damage. But that's not the case! In fact, there is no effect whatsoever, despite being well within the ult's radius!

Another example- take Baptiste. When I play him, I often throw my invuln field in a corner or along a wall, so it's not sticking out in the open and so it gets hit less ideally. So, throw the invuln field next to a door frame, or along a wall, as mentioned. Pay close attention to where you are at, and your health. Are you within the invuln field's radius? If so, do you see an outline on your health, indicating invincibility? Alright, now walk around so you're still within the visual field on the ground, but you're on the other side of the wall. Check back at your health- are you invincible now? Now imagine you're in a firefight, trying to get cover, aiming at an enemy or ally to do your job, whatever. You take one step forward, and all of the sudden you're dead! No audible warning that you stepped out of the invuln field. You weren't looking closely at your health, because you were too busy aiming, or thought you knew you were safe because of the field. And worst of all, you managed to die within the radius of the field, ironically.

**Explanation of the reason behind the problem:**

How does this happen? Below I have some images illustrating what happens when an ability, say, Mei's ult, is used in various situations. So assume that these crudely drawn pictures are of normal games of Overwatch. The blue circle is an ult that does damage or applies some other affect to enemies, and the enemies are drawn as dots in the images.

[This is normal to see with an ult- enemies within the affected area of the ult, or its radius, are affected by whatever the ult does.](https://preview.redd.it/8u15ytced5z31.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f3f64bda9bc7f6e3f7e9b7fb06ebdd8024c63e3)

Now where does the bug come into play? In the image above, none of the enemy players are hiding behind a wall. So let's add one!

[Now there's a wall, what now?](https://preview.redd.it/hnl1ig3pd5z31.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f379dfaf859d5725856cf23c39a4f68813a11bd3)

Now, there's a wall, and a player's hiding behind it. Upon first guess, you may say that they would still be a red dot, because they're within the visual area of the ult. But no- they're safe and untouched.

Why does the game work this way? (note: this is an educated guess, as I am not familiar with the internals of the game engine, but I am familiar with other 3D engines and how they function). First, imagine the ult visual being an image. So all you need to do is take an image of the map, photoshop the ult wherever it is, and presto! the visual has been added. And speaking of visual, this most likely means that the ult is drawn by the **GPU**\- the thing responsible for drawing everything. So all the GPU does is draws the ult, regardless of where it is or what's obstructing it, so as a result the ult appears around walls and what not.

But, the GPU isn't responsible for determining where a player is. That's where the **CPU** comes in. Do you know what ray tracing is? It's a method used in GPUs to get realistic shadows, reflections, and other graphical details, by drawing virtual lines from a source to whatever hits it. Well, I believe AoE effects work with what's called in Unreal Engine 4 **channel tracing**\- drawing a virtual line from one position of the map to another, with the intent of detecting whether or not it hit an object, and if so, what object it hit. (You can read more about UE4's tracing techniques here if interested: [https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Physics/Tracing/Overview/index.html](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Physics/Tracing/Overview/index.html))

So, here's a cut down process of how the ""channel tracing"" works in Overwatch:

1. Start the trace at the center of the ult or ability, whether it be Baptiste's field emitter, or Mei's Snowball.
2. Draw out virtual channel traces in all directions. For simplicity purposes, we will only be talking about the channel traces for enemies only, like the 3 in the image above.
3. Keep drawing the channel until it **hits a physical object with a hitbox.** Once there, stop.
4. If that physical object is an enemy, apply said effect.

If you didn't catch it, the issue resides in the trace checking for any physical object. It doesn't matter if it's a wall or player, the trace will stop when it sees a physical object. But the GPU won't stop rendering the effect even though the channel trace didn't work, which is **exactly where the problem is.**

**Possible solutions to the problem:**

1. **Changing the visuals**

Why not the GPU just stop drawing the ""image"" at the unaffected spot? This method would be tricky and resource intensive, because the GPU would have to do some additional calculations, that are just about parallel to ray tracing. And these days you need a $500 graphics card to get any decent performance out with ray tracing, so I don't think everyone wants to have this or a laggy experience just to play Overwatch. But there might be some cases where it's worthwhile, or there might be ways to optimize, so it is an option.

&amp;#x200B;

[In the image, the visual part of the ult is no longer seen if there is a wall. This is how it should look right now in the game, with how the abilities are played out.](https://preview.redd.it/0b2ji2hyg5z31.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc735aae4f0e2c4f6cbaf33dc09c0b086712e484)

2. **Channel tracing disregarding collision**

This option is possible and more viable then the one above. Except, it is possible that the game engine was made in a way that would make this difficult. Essentially, channel traces would pass thru anything that isn't a player, as seen below.

&amp;#x200B;

[The yellow channel trace is going thru the wall and hitting the player behind it, and as a result they are affected.](https://preview.redd.it/lzkxii8nh5z31.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c6f5828ad370f99a1cf9a10111aebec27fc3929)

3. **Changing how players are detected within the ult.**

Ever used the Workshop? Do you know how you can draw spheres? Now, how do you detect if a player's within that sphere? It's pretty simple- take the sphere's XYZ coordinates, and then take a player's XYZ coordinates. If the distance between the sphere and the player are less than the sphere's radius, then the player is detected as being within the sphere. This is probably the simplest method to go, because each player and ultimate has, or should have, a position associated with it (if they don't, it shouldn't be difficult to change a little code to make it so). Then with the simple distance equation d=sqrt((delta x)\^2+(delta y)\^2+(delta z)\^2) (where delta is change of, or difference between; for example delta x = x of player minus x of ult), it can be determined if the distance from an ult center to a player is greater or less than the visual ult radius. If it's less than or equal to, then apply the effect. The only issue is that a point is a point, and not a full size object- the center of each hero would likely have to be within the distance in order to be affected.

&amp;#x200B;

[Checking distance rather than channel tracing. This method would also be less CPU resource intensive, because rather than trying to draw a bunch of traces continuously, which also need to instantly check when it hits something, all the game needs to do is some math for at least one and less than 50 entities- up to 12 players for FFA, and any turrets, traps, or BOBs that may also be within the radius, each of which should have their own position.](https://preview.redd.it/q0t7k5a3k5z31.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1363c2cb33701e94ffb28c67f5b2141b1b0d2f2)

**Conclusion:**

It's likely that you didn't know of this bug or glitch, until stumbling upon my long post. If you did, you might ask why bother changing it? Well, this glitch isn't common knowledge, it isn't obviously intentional as I haven't seen any sort of ""tips"" in the game's loading screens for it, and it gives a very unfair advantage against players who don't know well enough of this. While it may be interesting to abuse or be aware of this glitch, chances are it's safe to agree that the game (and Overwatch 2) will be better with it fixed.

^(also Blizzard employees if you're reading I am looking for an internship in game development for the summer so if you need someone to make these changes for you then PM me I guess or not that's cool too.)

Have a good day and have fun playing Overwatch!

&amp;#x200B;

**Edits:**

* The ""bug"" mentioned isn't necessarily a bug, it is rather a design choice, as there are some abilities that do go thru walls, like Zaraya's ult. However, since the visuals do not match with the function of the ability, I would consider that a bug.
* Not every single ability should go thru walls- my first solution doesn't go thru a wall. The thing is, if the ability doesn't go thru a wall, then the visual shouldn't either.
* The advantage of some abilities going thru walls I don't think is going to be a lot. There are many strategies that can be made or adjusted for such changes, but if they do turn out to be op, devs can balance them back."

Sorry this story is gonna be a long one! I’m curious what you all think of this, and if other people this situation was just as weird and crappy like I did. 

I was reading stories on here and felt compelled to share my first tinder experience when I was single. For some context, I had just gotten out of a 3 year emotionally abusive relationship with a man who gaslighted and manipulated me. He ended things with me over text. I wasn’t emotionally handling it well, I felt like I couldn’t trust anyone. So I say this to convey I wasn’t looking for anything serious when I downloaded the app. 

It was summertime and I was doing an internship during my time off from university in a town 1 hour from my hometown. I match with a guy who goes to my university but is from the town I was interning in. We text a week or so, I let him know upfront I had just gotten out of a relationship and I hadn’t been on a first date in 4 years. I also told him I wasn’t looking to hook up right away, I wanted to get to know somebody first. 

We decide to meet up for dinner in the town I’m interning in after I get off one night. We meet and eat and I’m very nervous but he seemed normal and the conversation flowed pretty well. We did all the usual first date small talk. He pays and asks me if I wanted to smoke with him (we are both stoners). I agree but tell him after I have to go home. We get in his car and smoke and he kisses me. I pull away after he starts getting too handsy letting him know I didn’t want to do more than kiss. He convinces me to hang out longer and we go to the beach. He tries the same thing but I brush it off thinking that he must just really like me, now I know that was the first red flag. After this, I finally left.

We text another week and plan to meet up when we both go back to our universities two days later.  He asked me to come over to his house, I said no (we all know what that means) and I told him my concerns about going over there, I barely knew him. He said we could do something else, he said he wanted to go out to eat and see a movie after or go to the beach. He assured me he wanted to get to know me and wasn’t just looking for sex. He asked if I could pick him up from his house, I could finally meet his cute cat he had been talking about that and then go out. He wanted me there at 11 am, I thought this time was a bit weird/early for a date but I was starting to like him so I agreed to this plan. 

I show up to pick him up at 11 am the next day. I come in to meet his cat like we planned. Then he asks to smoke again so I reluctantly agree. We go up to his bedroom. After smoking he immediately comes on to me, kissing me aggressively and starts biting me hard all over my body and pinning me down. Don’t get me wrong, I like a guy who is confident but it was happening way too fast and I told him I didn’t want to be hanging out at his house all day and that I was uncomfortable with that idea. Not to mention we had plans to do other things I thought I was just picking the guy up! 

I tell him no forcefully. Things were sliding into 3rd base too quickly for me. After saying no 2-3 times he lets up and I ask him about the plans I thought we had made. He said that he wasn’t sure he could do all that today because he had lots of chores to do. Chores he had to get back too right at that moment apparently. I was shocked, the person he was over text was completely different than the guy in person. I shouldn’t have been surprised but I was naive (this was years ago) and trusted people more than I should have. 

Anyway, he said he had chores to do and ushered me towards the door. I was holding back my tears and was managing to keep myself together— I refused to let this guy know how much he was hurting me. He asked if something was wrong and I straight up told him that I thought he was just trying to use me for sex and now that I wouldn’t put out all of a sudden he had urgent stuff to do. He told me that wasn’t the case, that he just got a text that his roommate was coming back today and he needed to clean. 

He kissed me and I left, I held back my tears until I was a few feet from my car. He probably saw me and knew. He texted me 4-5 days later but I ignored him. So for an emotionally distraught newly single girl it was not a good experience. I almost deleted the whole app after that."

dxix9q,45,2019-11-17,Basic harassment from pastors since I left.,ftbtch,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/dxix9q/basic_harassment_from_pastors_since_i_left/,"So the reason I’m (F19) posting here is to get a bit of advice/encouragement about how to handle pastors/leaders from my ex church contacting me. 

I’ll try and keep it as short as I can while also giving enough detail. So I was attending a church (Pentecostal) for about three years and was dating a boy (S) from the church. We were fine. Started sleeping together (January 2018) about a year after beginning to date even though we were told the whole no sex before marriage thing. I had applied (September 2018) to be a intern at the church for the following year. I found out in November 2018 I was accepted and I started preparing myself for the internship and the study I would be doing along side it. 

January 2019 I spoke to one of my leaders about me sleeping with the S. She encouraged me to go to a pastor and ‘put my sins into the light’. I did and within the hour I was stood down from my internship as my ‘input wasn’t healthy therefore my output would be worse’. I accepted it and kept attending the church while also feeling like I was shamed because a lot of people found out. S and I were working through it all but were already having unrelated problems. 

Mid February we started hanging out with a few of his friends that he didn’t see often as they would drink, smoke and do a few drugs. One of his friends (A) I had a particular intrest in and A did to me as well. One night we all went clubbing, I got wasted and high and that night S sexually assaulted me. I was not okay with it, said no, fought and was held down. The following few days were rough, I didn’t talk to S and told A what had happened via messaging. A used the word rape and I broke down in tears. I didn’t understand what had all happened. I broke up with S very quickly and left the church because I couldn’t face him. 

I confided in A a lot and we are now together and I am the most happy I have been for a very very long time. However I am getting weekly messages from pastors and leaders asking to call me, see me, get coffee. Asking why I’m not at church. It’s gone as far as some of the lead pastors in my church to come to my full time job at the bar I work at. I’m the head of the kitchen, I’m a skilled bar tender and waitress and I am really proud of what I do and who I am now. Twice it has happened where I have had pastors come into my work and get me to serve them which I find extremely uncomfortable and I have expressed that. They’ll ask me about S as well which usually sends me into a bit of a down spiral. 

Since leaving the church I’ve realised a lot of bs they drilled into me and how brainwashed I became and it creeps me out. I have no contact with any of my best friends from the church anymore because they no longer reply to me or try but I’m now 100% okay with that because I’m surrounded with the best people I know. 

I want to know the best way I can tell them to fuck off. No one at the church knows the reason S and I broke up. He has told people I cheated on him. 

TL;DR 
My ex raped me so I left the church we were attending. Pastors of that church call, text and come into my work weekly to ‘see how I’m doing’.

EDIT 
So a lot of people have said to block their numbers and emails, I haven’t. My reasoning is because it is a large church with about 14 pastors as well as leaders. I just feel like it’ll be another person next week and so on, which it has been. Last night I had one of the pastors text and call me multiple times. My reaction was to send a very clear message explain that I no longer wanted contact with ****** church and I was happy where I am now. The reply I got informeer me she was trying to contact me about in church related things but I just didn’t care and didn’t reply. If it all does get a bit more then I think the police will be the next step if not explaining the reason I actually left."
dxj66s,4,2019-11-17,Masters/Honours in BSC Computer Science vs Engineering in Software,GGINTHESIX,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/dxj66s/mastershonours_in_bsc_computer_science_vs/,"I'm choosing between these two for my potential degrees. I've heard software will more likely land you potential jobs and internships and is overall the better degree. However I've also heard it's very competitive and there's a small chance you'll get in after first-year general engineering. I've heard computer science is a three-year degree and is without required internships therefore  has less value for potential jobs. Will this be offset by doing honours or masters? Furthermore, I would like to get into AI , Cybersecurity and maybe some VFX at least as interests during Uni. I would just like to enter the best option for entering good jobs once I graduate and set me off in the right career direction. 

So what is the difference between the two, specifically between Masters in Compsci and Softeng? Any advice at all would be a huge help.

dxjckg,1,2019-11-17,Communitty members throw objects at Youma in Ipswich,Youmaton,AusSimCampaigning,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusSimCampaigning/comments/dxjckg/communitty_members_throw_objects_at_youma_in/,"*Social Democratic Party Leader Youma has surprisingly appeared in Ipswich to hold a last minute community event to spread awareness of the SDP's strong policies to help Moncrieff*


Intern - “Roooooollllllllll up, roooooooolllllllllll up folks! Here we have the very leader of the Social Democratic Party, former Prime Minister Youmaton! Have anything you want to ask them, say to them, release stress, get payback? Whatever the cause whatever the worry, come on down and for just a gold coin donation to charity you will get an opportunity to hit Youma! If you hit them, you get to ask them a question, or you can tell them off if you so wish! Give it a go folks, what do you have to lose!”


*A cue forms, with community members from across the political spectrum lining up to get a go at hitting a former Prime Minister without the risk of being arrested. A fair few people try their luck, but miss their mark as much as PineappleCrusher misses the mark on key taxation reform. A young girl by the name of Lucy walks up and pays her shiny gold coin. She lines up the shot, takes aim, and hits Youma right in the face.*


Lucy - “I-I-I win, I win! Now you have to tell me something uhhhhhhhhhhh, what was your most memorable time before you left weirdly earlier this year?”


Youma - “Great question! It would most certainly have to be the night of the December 2018 election, as the results started to roll in and every single prediction of a right wing government was proven wrong. It was truly a magical night, one I will never forget.”


*Lucy then runs off with her parents, who head to a nearby polling station to vote. From the shadows, a figure emerged who grew surprisingly known as he stepped forward through the crowd. NGSpy had been going on the Brisbane Valley Rail Trail from Fernvale on a bike, and on the way he saw there was an SDP event for throwing sponges at our party. He kind of wanted to throw a sponge at Youma because he believed it’s fun to do dumb stuff towards your boss. So he got to Ipswich that afternoon because he started early in the morning*


NGSpy: “NOOT NOOT”


*The loud noot echoed through the crowd as a sponge landed directly on Youma's eye*


NGSpy: “So Youma, what are the benefits of more migrants in our country?”


Youma: “Great question as always my friend, and I'm glad to answer. Migrants help every single part of our daily lives, and are a key part of the Australian economy, as well as a key part of the Australian community as a whole. Australian Multiculturalism is such a unique and incredible part of our land and our community, such diversity and inclusion brings us all together to create a brighter future.”


*NGSpy smiled, then waddled off. After a few more community members had a go at throwing sponges, a very familiar yet new face emerged from the crowd*


“For only one gold coin donation, any person would face being hit with a large wet sponge for charity.This time around, Youma is nominating herself to face the punishment of any sponge throwing.” SDP Candidate Mikiboss thought as he walked up to the event


*Mkiboss was ready for some sponge throwing, but was still a little confused about how many he would throw*


“How many of these bad boys am I gonna throw? *he asked out loud, to which one of the kids in the audience yelled* “One for every coin!”. *Miki looked down at the bucket in his hand of coins, that was a lot of sponges, and a lot of fun to be had. He smiled at Youma, in preparation for the impending sponge onslaught, as he yelled in a comic over the top voice* 


“This is the bona fide, genuine former prime minister right here, and she's about to get a face full of suds. Are we ready?” *Local groups of kids cheered nearby, as Mikiboss aimed with the sponge in his hand and threw the sponge for a direct hit on Youma, aiming to hit but soft enough as to not hurt. He felt a little bad after the first hit, but after a second smiled, realising it's all for charity, as he grabbed two in both hands and started launching them.*


*After a fun filled event, and plenty of sponges hitting Youma, they closed off by talking about the importance of electing Mikiboss as Member for Moncrieff, to ensure that a progressive opposition may be formed and so the government is held to account by a party with a plan to lead. Many of the community members had already voted, with one wearing an oddly large pineapple on their head, but nevertheless more voters swarmed to the polling booth for one last push to elect an SDP member for Moncrieff.*"

There’s this girl, she’s insanely gorgeous, and I’ve known her FOREVER. She’s super close with my family, friends with my sister and interns for my mom. We have always had a tension, she offered to be my first kiss, she’s always kinoing me, and we do this dance of getting really close to doing something and then pulling away. 

I can’t tell anymore if she’s into me or just is comfortable around me, but I’m done pulling away. Tomorrow night I’m gonna swing by to give her back her earbuds, but I’m gonna get her to drive around with me. 

I need your help, how should I gauge the situation?  She’s always touchy and flirty and I feel like she’d be down to just make out or something, but I can’t tell if she’s being touchy and endearing in an attraction based way or a familial ‘brotherly love’ type way.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s6ximr4qd7z31.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1412c79aa00a23583828963776fc80358f0d3ccb

&amp;#x200B;

I asked a recent college graduate how he dealt with not finding a job right away and does he have advice for others, the following is what he shared. Written in his voice.

Everyone knows how stressful it is trying to find a job. Everyone knows what the job search struggle feels like. Especially after college where you just spent all this time, energy, AND money. We all feel the pressures of our modern-day society and it can be a real [strain on mental health.](https://careersteering.com/work-life-balance-is-stress-impeding-your-success/) These tips might help to take the load off and maybe even help you snag a position!

**Speak To Family Members And Friends**

Family might equal stress for some graduates, but the family can also be a source of support. Either way, it can be useful to communicate with your family to overcome any feelings of doubt. Listen to their stories! Talk to them and share all of your frustrations. Talk to your close friends. They might be going through the same situation or have the same feelings. It always helps to have a friend!

&amp;#x200B;

**Take Good Care Of Yourself**

Always take good care of your mind and body. Not taking care of yourself will always hurt you in the long run. Eat good healthy foods, drink lots of water, read books on your downtime and most importantly, think about what will benefit you. You matter!  It's okay to know that and let the world and universe know as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stay Active!**

Get up, and move around! There’s nothing worse than staying stagnant. Always push forward! Get a workout in; take a walk; see new things. Enjoy your day it is okay to have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

**Network and meet new people**

Networking is definitely one of the most effective ways to get your foot in the door for possible jobs. You can even get some helpful tips and tricks from people already in the industry you seek. The best strategy is often an indirect one. Try simply talking to a person and getting to know them. See what they’re about. You can easily also make a lot of friends this way as well. You probably shouldn’t just ask a person to directly hire you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Get An Internship!**

I know, I know. The goal is to make more money. But internships will definitely help. Jobs want to see experience. This is definitely the best route for graduates who have not had an internship while they were in college and it will surely help anyone who has already done an internship before.

&amp;#x200B;

**Create Your Own Personal Website**

Creating a personal website can let job seekers demonstrate their know-how and completely brand themselves. Recent college graduates may use a website to blog about the challenge; show off class projects. This can also be an excellent way to stand out from other candidates.

Remember to always keep your head up! Everyone gets in a slump every now and then. You got this! Keep going! Strive and chase your dreams! You can do anything you put your mind soul and body to."
dxkbv9,2,2019-11-17,Not sure if running from my problems is the cause or the solution.,norsewolf,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dxkbv9/not_sure_if_running_from_my_problems_is_the_cause/,"I have never been a happy kiddo. Ever since becoming self-aware, I distanced myself from the group. Of course, that was not the best desicion, but I always kept in mind that ''if I just persist for a while, things get better at a later time(after high school I would go to uni, after uni I would move somewhere,...)"".
But of course, that is a lie I have been telling myself for YEARS now.

Anyway, last year, I had the opportunity to come to Paris for an internship. As someone who is a huge fan of the Belle Epoque architecture, art and attitude, this was a dream come true. However, the internship was dreadful (I think it might have given me a bore-out) and the Paris I so loved, was dead.
As I lived quite a bit from the center and had to go to work, I had practically no social life and if I had no boyfriend/family coming over, I visited things by myself. I even went to restaurants alone. As a 20 year old female. So sad.

Even though I was not happy, I didn't want to leave Paris. Because at home, there were not as many exciting things to see or to do. I found a study at a Parisian university that seemed interesting and would help me get away from the pharmaceutical sector I had become to despise.

Spoiler : it did not help at all. It is pharma all over again. I don't like the courses, I don't like the people in it (far too serious, as they don't have a degree yet), and yet, my whole life is waking up- school - study - sleep. 
I don't have time to do ANYTHING anymore, except studying subjects I already did.
My relationship with my boyfriend has ended, so I find myself all alone in Paris now. I know I should meet other people, but I am not a good version of myself right now.
I don't have any energy left to do ANYTHING.
I don't want to be in Paris anymore, I don't want to go home either. I don't want to work in the pharmaceutical industry, but I don't want to study anymore either.

I really don't know how to get out of this mess anymore."

I really dont know why i do this but i need to talk with someone about everything. Im in a deep hole and i lost the will to live. Everyone say's it will get better. And i try to work on myself really hard. But i cant see a light at the end of the tunnel. It all began when i was child. I had some kind of ""twistet legs"" couldnt walk straight and we need to made a surgery to fix it. I was long time the handicapped kid in the wheelchair and later with those walking sticks which i dont remeber the name in English cuz its not my mother tongue. Jump to school where i was shit and got permanently stress from my parents because i was so shit but the intern stress in the school because of bullying didnt help me though.
And i was sexually raped. By my own friends and later by a friend of my mom. Already back than i was really close to suicide but i kept on fighting. After school i startet to work as ""Glacier"" i think i can call it that way. But working there was pure horror the people are stupid and totally egoistic. We produced more than we should. I was screamed off when i said i dont to work on saturday because i did all saturdays before. They promised me better loan but nothing happened. I was there for 5 years and in the last year December 2017. I snapped. I had conflict with the right hand men of the boss. The emotions i feelt at this day where horrible. I really wantet to kill him. Kick on his head until he doesnt move anymore. But at the same day i just picked my stuff and left. It was the better way because i really would have done it. Jump to the next topic. My ex girlfriends. I had a friend once she was literally the best thing i have ever witnessed. I could trust her in every way we where friends long and one day after a long communication pause she wrote me on facebook. And she was sad. She had already a child with a guy and it was about to get broke. I wanted to stay by her side and help her out. She told me that it was over with him but he still lives in the same apartment because of the child and because he hasnt found another one yet. Long speak short talk she randomly said that she loved me all the time. I was like wow how does it come to that? Because i never thought that she would feel so much for me ever. I have low self esteem so i never thought of it. We kissed and it was like fireworks. I feel so hard with her in love and her ex boy got to know it. He threw her and his own child out on the street. And i was there for her. I helped her with literlly everything. a place to sleep. Help to move her things out of the apartment. Organized a garage that she can somewhere store it. I even played father for the little one. It was beautiful all in one but u know how she thanked me? She cheated on me. and really thought she could keep me as friend. I never felt so angry, sad and disappointed in someone. And i hate her. I want her stop breathing. After this whore i met another girl she catch me right after all that shit and it was like the one i was waiting for. But it was destined to doom. It was to early for a relationship and the relationship became kind of one sided but i was the asshole this time. I dont have so much to say about her its just me who just made things worse. In that time i startet to take drugs. And sometimes really abusive. But i kept on living and i met another girl. It was fresh new and we had no story before. It was beautiful and tbh we were horny af all the time at each others and we came along with each other just fine. Sometime later we came together but. It was over in 1 month. She doesnt loved me anymore she said. But in reality she had also low self esteem and some months later she confessed that she was not good enough for me. I was so blushed and i tried to explain that it isnt like that like she thinks. We came back togheter. The first 2 months were beautiful and the last was horrible it became again one sided but this time she was the one who didnt do anything in this relationship. So i broke with her up. Even though i love her.
And now the last one. which happened just now. After i broke up a friend wrote me msg that shes here for me and that we can talk about everything which we did. She had some kind of same problem like so she just came out of a relationship. And like with the other girl it was to fresh we needed more time before we could talk more about love. But we couldnt wait we had the most beautiful sex i ever had and she stole my heart with all her kindness an cutness.
But shit didnt work out she didnt want a relationship but i want it because i really feel such strong emotionen between us. But she did something horrible to me. She slept with the brother of my ex girlfriend even though she said she doesn't want it. I lost all interest now in life. I msg her an confronted her. And the brother of my ex. even if he bigger and more muscular i really want to punch him. And i told him that and he's like ""im getting excited"". I dont care anymore if i die or get brawled the shit out or get stabbed by a knife. I really cant anymore all i got left is my shattert heart and out of it raging flames of fire. See this as some of goodbye letter. im a fucking time bomb and i will do stupid shit because i have lost all interests and morals. I just want to express my emotions to the whole word. Even if i die threw it.

dxlc7u,1,2019-11-17,Advice on salvaging poorly going salary negotiations with small European start-up.,nizzok,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dxlc7u/advice_on_salvaging_poorly_going_salary/,"So, I work for a small European start-up in the financial services sector. I am an American with  European permanent residency with an academic background (Classics/Anthropology) and around 10 years of part-time self-taught web-development experience. I began with the the company as an intern when it was a couple of guys working out of coffee shops and then followed the company through several accelerators to our first investors and current offices. My role was quickly formalized into a generic ""business support consultant,"" where my responsibilities included: communications (website, social media, and other writing and content generation), grant writing, and various IT support services. My role has effectively crystalized into communications with whatever I can handle in any spare capacity. I am now being offered to formally transition into a ""communications officer"" position, which would include many of the same responsibilities while also assuming more managerial functions over some of my previous responsibilities.

My current compensation is at 36K/an, which I received a raised up from 30k in 2017. 30K was the resulting transition of my hourly for the internship into a full-time role. Up till now, the company has been broke because we haven't commercialized quickly enough and as a result everyone has been working for less than market salaries, but the salaries have been in tiers. The company has recently received a large tranche of funding from a European development institution, we've hired some heavy hitters to fill capacity gaps, and the team has grown significantly (3-4x) in size.

Naturally, the subject of raises and salaries has come up and I was asked what I wanted to do and what I wanted my compensation to be.

Naively, I had asked for a 100% raise and to have my role formalized at the management level and handling my current responsibilities for two of our entities. I was quickly told that my request wasn't reasonable and we still had a lop-sided compensation schedule. Without getting into specifics I asked if that wasn't possible to be made an offer with a roadmap to getting to my desired salary. A few days later, I was countered with the following offer: immediate raise of 4K/an with the possibility to get to 45K if certain KPI's were met. In the discussion that followed, I was told seniority meant nothing, we were a results oriented business, and that I didn't have skin in the game because of a conversation I didn't remember having where I forfeit share options for salary.

While I realize that this is ""good"" relative to where I am currently, it doesn't factor in previous successes with the company (600K plus in grants) and years of working unpaid overtime and on vacations. It also doesn't factor in that I earn the average of what an entry level person in anyone of my currently occupied roles (Web developer, comms assistant, business support, IT admin).

So, perhaps I've been naive in my expectations, but I can't but view this offer as an insult to both my intelligence and my work. Honestly, I never expected a 100% raise, but I would have thought that a bigger bump up than the one I am currently being offered was more than justified. I have been given the weekend to make a counter proposal.

The way I see things the interaction so far indicates the following:

* they don't value my work or role seriously, perhaps with some justification as I don't have formal training in comms.
* their first offer is a low-ball which ignores my naive initial request
* There is always some room to wiggle, but I assume they will be asking for a concession with respect to responsibilities, etc, so a commitment to shoulder more.

With a view through this lens, I see that I have three options that aren't quitting:

1. continue my current role
2. accept the low-ball, wait for the trigger, then become a 9-5 clock man and not work a single uncompensated hour.
3. Ask for some combination of a bigger initial raise and more KPI's to get to step 2, ask for a smaller bump and then ask the company to pay for a personal computer, etc.

My desired result is of course just more money, plain and simple. I will likely be leaving the company in the next 6 months to a year to move back to the US with my wife, so my first choice is not to look for another job. I currently have a permanent, and unlimited contract, which I do not want to forfeit or risk. My gut feeling is that I should quit, or ask to be fired at the moment, as I really feel like the company is dealing in bad faith, and I honestly believe that it will cost much more to replace the positions I currently cover than than to give me my unreasonable request. Unfortunately, I have a family and need the income, so I would need to get fired to receive unemployment. At this point, I think I'm more or less at their mercy unless I go down guns blazing. I have a few options with which I could drag my feet, but that's not really how I want to play the game.

So, how can I unscrew this pooch?"

I'm a third year finance and insurance student from Antwerp, Belgium and I had the opportunity to carry out my mandatory two (or 3) month internship abroad. I immediately thought of South Africa as it's a country I've always dreamt of going to (even after hours of research regarding safety etc.). 

Unfortunately, I'm having some trouble finding a company that could provide me with an unpaid internship. I've sent out dozens of e-mails, but no luck yet. I'm hoping someone on this subreddit could help me out or point me in the right direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some info about me and the internship:

I'm a 22-year old male, I speak Flemish, English and French and I understand a fair bit of written Afrikaans (because of the similarity with Flemish).

We are not allowed to receive any salary on the internship, though the company is allowed to give us a stipend or provide free/cheap accomodation (Although nice to have, I don't need any of this, I just really want to go!)

I have extensive knowledge on finance, economics, insurance, management and real estate.

I'm looking for an internship in any financial institution or bank, preferably a large office/HQ.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance guys!"

Just like last year, I'm honored to announce that we are hosting another Yuyuyu rewatch to celebrate this Christmas and may the interns responsible for Yuyuyui make another topnotch Christmas cards again for us to share!

 As usual, the start of this rewatch will be on the 1st of December, but as I don't want to repeat the exact same **Questions of the day** from last year's rewatch, I thought we can also add a *Poem of the day* contest, where I'm going to suggest a theme each episode, and people can try to make a short poem out of it.

A short example: Theme is ""Udon""

me: 

""Roses are red, violets are blue.""

""Udons are delicious, and so are you"".

Another thing I can add are also the fanart corners, with their own theme each episode and I hope the artists in you all will share you skills to us as well!

Just like last year, I'm also willing to do a streaming moment on our discord, but as I'm also busy with office currently, I will this time do two streams with one stream at around **10-11 pm CET** and one stream in the morning at around **6-7 am CET**. [Off-topic](/s ""Only downside is that I won't be able to play BanG Dream when I wake up q_q""). The (temporary) schedule has been put below. It was the schedule copypasted from last year's rewatch and I might put some changes into it. 

So all in all, I hope you guys join in this year's rewatch as well and I'm looking forward for your participation. Have a great November!

I am at a crossroads in my life and feel pretty lost and deflated. I know nothing about starting a career and finding a job and I while I work myself into the matter, I am looking to you guys to maybe lend a helping hand.

I am a 39 year old lawyer living in Berlin, Germany. After graduating I worked as a self-employed lawyer for 2 years, realized I hated it and became a daytrader (for the last 2-3 years) hoping to achieve financial independence - this did not work out. I am now looking for a job to make a living and to be able to support my girlfriend and newborn son.

My days of self-actualization are over, pragmatism is the name of the game for me and I am willing to accept any sustainable compromise that brings in a paycheck.

Any insight from people familiar with the german job market will probably the most valuable, but I am sure some stuff is relatable across borders.

Problem is: I have no work experience and I am really old and my academical achievements are bad (bottom 10% bad).

A bit about myself and my interests: 

I studied philosophy, psychology and politics before swithching to law. This is where my interests mainly lie. Geostrategical stuff being the most applicable probably.

I am not very durable and stress-resistant. Any really horrible and draining jobs I can do for maybe 1-2 years, but no longer. I hope for a ""normal"" job, where the good and the bad even itself out and I can bear that for hopefully 5-10 years.

At the moment I think I should start to apply for everything I am remotely qualified for, even when chances are close to non-existent, starting with the jobs I like most and working myself down. I assume the search will take months, so stuff will pop up during my struggle.

The jobs I came up with myself are in order of attractiveness:

Jobs in the political field. I can only think of assistant to some elected politician of any level. 

Maybe political consultancy - but I do not think I am qualified for those.

Maybe some NGO, but I lack any commitment in volunteer work, internships etc., so I can not stand out.

Jobs in administration, probably municipal most likely, but I may be simply to old for that.

Lector for a scientific or academical publisher in law or financial.

Jobs in cultural institutions: assistant or some alw-realted stuff in theaters, museums and the like.

Legal custodian.

All assistant jobs in companies and public law institutions.

Do you guys have any further ideas or can give hints how I might improve my chances with the above jobs? Basically I am looking for jobs that pay well and do not require strong academical achievements.

I am also looking for help how to effectively find jobs and how to streamline my online profiles.

I think I found enough material on CV, cover letters and interviews - but if you guys have the ultimate guide, do not be shy, it is appreciated.

Thank you all very much!

Mods may move this as is applicable; I posted this in all relevant subreddits I could find."

dxq22q,1,2019-11-17,School of Attraction,niceguyputin,u_niceguyputin,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_niceguyputin/comments/dxq22q/school_of_attraction/,"Picking up a lady has become very complicated. There are no real guidelines on how to show interest in a lady, or how she can accept a man’s affection without the risk of social ridicule.  


It wasn’t always this way. Before the industrial revolution, western culture used to have rules and rituals surrounding courtship so that young people learned how to woo partners. The older generation mentored them by having large dances and social gatherings at which everyone danced with everyone else so that (among other things) connecting with women outside your social circle was not a big issue. You were supposed to circulate and accept if someone asked to dance with you. It was considered rude not to.  

&amp;#x200B;

Historically, we have lots of instances where societal rules encouraged communication between the sexes that led to courtship. Below are some examples of such rules; which made it easier for people to go about wooing a partner without leaving them open to ridicule. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Victorian women let you down gently without anyone noticing. If a lady wasn’t interested, she would use her trusty hand fan and rest it on her left cheek. In an era of politeness, rudely turning a man down was not an option. If the lady fanned herself slowly, she was already spoken for. If she fanned quickly, she was on the market for a possible suitor. If the fan rested on the right cheek, then Hallelujah! - she was interested in you.

In 19th century rural Austria, women would shove apple slices under their armpits during dances. If some handsome man caught her eye, she would give him her sweaty apple slice. If he liked her back, he would eat this sweaty apple slice. It’s pretty gross as far as courtship rituals go and I would never advocate for bringing it back (outside of weird fetish parties) but I love that the ladies were initiating the possible romance.

A particularly suggestive example comes from 19th century Finland, where Finnish girls who had reached a marriageable age would wear empty sheaths on their girdles. If a man liked a girl, he would place a knife in her sheath. A girl would simply return his knife if she wasn’t interested, but keeping his blade meant that she agreed to marry him (or at least allow him to sheath something else).

In 17th century Wales, getting the wooden spoon was a good thing. Welsh men made intricately hand-carved wooden spoons to offer their crushes. If the lady accepted the spoon, the courtship was on.

In 18th century England, young people had no privacy. Luckily they had an amazing invention called the courting stick. This six-foot-long hollow tube allowed young people to communicate from a safe distance while family members remained in the room to make sure there was nothing as scandalous as hand-holding going on.

&amp;#x200B;

Why did society stop these cues and leave us to figure it out on our own? When did it stop becoming a father’s responsibility to teach his son how to attract the opposite sex? Why isn’t it something that’s taught as part of a young boy’s school curriculum? 

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is I don’t know why. All I know is that it is necessary. **A clear social cue that gets the opposite sex meeting one another would be amazing to have.** Right now however, if men stopped approaching women and initiating courtship, our whole courtship system would break down to who we can meet through our social circle. Statistically, the odds of you meeting the right woman through friends is very small. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Women understand courtship far better than men. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

This is one of the reasons why ladies spend so much time on their appearance and really show their stuff when going out. It is our job as men to approach women. It just so happens that ladies make this job very easy by looking amazing.

When I’m out and about and a lady asks me what I do for a living, I’m honest and tell her I teach men how to attract women. They often respond with something like ‘You mean like in that book where those guys lie and put women down in order to get them into bed?’ I do understand why women have their guard up about these things. When they think about men trying to attract women, they think about those drunk guys in the clubs that have no respect and are often complete assholes. They think about every man that has ever lied to them and don’t want some guy teaching more guys how to be like that. I get it completely. I don’t want that either. The thing is that those drunk assholes at the bar don’t need my help. They’re the only ones approaching women at all and their method pays off more times than it really should. The guys that do solicit my help are: 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Guys that come out of bad  
relationships and just need to  
get back into dating again.  


Men that spent all of their 20s  
focusing on their career, got to  
where they wanted to and now  
want to have some fun without  
wasting any more time.

Shy introverts looking  
for more experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Average guys who are  
sick of settling for girls  
they’re not really interested  
in.

Men who are already pretty  
good with women but want to  
excel and get the types of  
women they really want.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Or men like Sir Marshmallow…**

Sir Marshmallow spends a lot of time taking care of his mum who has Multiple Sclerosis. He doesn’t get many opportunities to be social because someone has to be home at all times to look after his mum. He wants to use every second he has free to have fun and get beautiful women in his life.

**Or guys like Sir Appleslice…**

Sir Appleslice’s brother is seriously mentally ill and still living with the family. Sir Appleslice always believed he’d never have a partner because no woman would want someone whose brother was mentally ill and whom he’d have to take care of at some points throughout his life. Seeing firsthand the kindness of women pushed him to believe otherwise. He is now happily dating.

**Or someone like Sir Rumball…**

Sir Rumball is a good-looking guy. He also has a medical condition that he has to take chemotherapy tablets for. When he takes them, he suffers bloating which affects his ability to move around. He didn’t think he could ever meet a girl that would be willing to put up with his condition.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fortunately for us men, when we fail to see the beauty in ourselves, women have the ability to show us that beauty.**

When we push through our limiting beliefs and see the light at the end of the tunnel, it’s an amazing feeling. You smile everywhere you go and your happiness is infectious. Do you think Sir Marshmallow, Sir Appleslice and Sir Rumball don’t deserve to feel this way? Of course they do. Same goes for all the other men who want to be happy, feel loved, and have control over their dating lives.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Once these guys start getting some control in one area, they start wanting to change their whole life for the better.

This is what psychologists call the Locus of Control.

 Right now you have certain things that are within your control – for example showering every day, how you travel to work and what you eat for breakfast. This is your comfort zone. Everything you would like to achieve and haven’t yet is outside it with varying degrees of difficulty. This could be attracting women, asking your boss for a raise, travelling to Europe, starting a company or leaping out of a plane. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

The thing I see is that once these guys start to expand their comfort zone to include attracting women for example, the side effect is that things outside of attracting women- such as starting a side project or asking for a raise for example- will suddenly start to seem easier to accomplish.

This is the secret to how you can get control over your life. This is also how attracting women will affect the other areas of your life. Here are some examples of specific skillsets you’ll learn and the ways they can apply to your everyday life:

&amp;#x200B;

 

Quickly building rapport with women will mean that when you go to job interviews, you can apply the same principles to get your dream job by quickly building rapport with the interviewer.

Dealing with women testing you. This will help you get perspective when people think they’re better than you either in your personal or your professional life.

Having engaging stories will make you more likeable, ensure people remember you and is also an incredibly useful tool in your career when networking.

Selling yourself is invaluable for selling an idea, showing great leadership skills and inspiring others to believe in you. The above are just a few examples. Some of my students have truly amazed me over the years with what they have accomplished just by applying the principles in this book.

&amp;#x200B;

 

I’ll share some stories with you.

By employing the same goal setting and consistency principles in the book, **Sir Easteregg** went from  
a flabby guy with 18% body fat down to 5%.

He did this by going to the gym, doing yoga and eating well. His abs look great and he’s happy to show them off to anyone that wants a look.

**Sir Sherbert** realized that he didn’t have a lot of passion in his life.

He always wanted to be a writer but got sidetracked at an IT job he hated. He made the tough decision to leave his job and start pursuing his passion for writing. He is now an intern for a startup and writes funny marketing articles for their blog. He is also working on a book as we speak. He earns very little money but he’s the happiest I have ever seen him.

**Sir Jellybean** had two older brothers who teased him  
mercilessly over the years.

When they found out he was learning to attract women, naturally he took some more bullying. But then something else happened- Sir Jellybean became really good at attracting beautiful women. What did his brothers do? They called my assistant to try and organize an appointment for them to meet me and find out what I had done with their brother. Sir Jellybean was over the moon about finally winning out against them. This improved their relationship and the whole family gets along better as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

 **This is what this whole thing was about for me – putting some Awesomeness in people’s lives.** 

 

One more side effect from attracting women is you can expect some hilarious outcomes that make an awesome story.

So I present to you the Tale of Sir Raisintoast. 

 **Sir Raisintoast** was in the kingdom of Malaysia when he met a gorgeous damsel with the kind of breasts Shakespeare would write about.

He was so excited he texted me soon after he met her. He continued to text me with updates on how the courtship was progressing, and last I heard was they were passionately locking lips with each other. Then the texts stopped coming. I didn’t hear from him again until he got back to Australia. When I casually asked him how it went, he didn’t want to tell me, and then admitted that they were in a quiet corner and he slid his hands up her dress where he surprisingly discovered a raging hard-on! He freaked out and left. We all had a jolly laugh about it, and I mentioned to him this was not the only time a student of mine has been ‘surprised’.

I’ll share one of my funny moments with you too.

   
I met two girls on the beach and went back to their place for lunch. After lunch, they told me to wait in the lounge as they wanted to get something prepared that they thought I would like. Naturally, I was high-fiving myself expecting a threesome. They came out to me with a box. My eyes widened with expectation of what goodies would be inside. Each one sat on either side of me as they opened the box of goodies. Turned out to be three bibles inside for each of us to read. Imagine my disappointment!

&amp;#x200B;

 **There are hundreds of ‘embarrassing’ and ‘funny’ sto-ries I can tell you but you need to go out and get some of**  
**your own. Stories like these come from experience and lots of it. Let’s get you some shall we?**"

I need to understand if I am misreading things or my decision is somewhat right. 

So, I have been with my SO for 11 years. We've been living together for 3 years. For the first time, from March I have been working as a freelancer for 40 hours a week. Also, I am working for free as an intern in a hospital for circa 20 hours a week. With a bit of math, you can see how much I am working each week. I decided to do two jobs to help my SO. Also, I asked him to live with me in the first place because I was worried about his mental health, since he mentioned every day about killing his dad it others who did wrong to him.

Now, he's really mad and accusing me of ruining his life since we went living together. I am sick of him treating me like shit and accusing me. I want to leave. For good. But I don't gain enough money to pay my own rent and I don't want to leave my cat to him, so I don't really know how to leave it where to go. My family lives so far away and I won't be able to leave town for the next six months because of my internship.

I'm currently kind of hard-pressed for finding a room somewhere in the Leiden area. And so far - navigating the housing hasn't led to any positive results.

Does anyone of you, by any chance, know of anything or would possibly consider renting out a room themselves? Short-term, long-term, 1 week...anything would help.

I’m an Austrian student currently in the process of moving to Leiden to take up an 8 month long internship at Mimetas (a company 5 min west of LUMC) to work on a project about which I’m going to write my master’s thesis. The internship will start in about 2 weeks from now on 2 December. In general, I would describe myself as very open-minded, empathetic and communicative. I’m a very social person and have lived in multiple different shared flats in various European countries over the course of a couple of years. I’m a very tolerant, easy-going and tidy fellow and always up for a silly joke. Also, I’m a nonsmoker and a vegetarian.

I’d be looking for an at least partly furnished room (bed, desk) but if that's not possible - simply a roof over the head will do. I’m not yet in town but I’d be available to have a skype chat to introduce myself any time! Also, due to a very low internship salary my budget isn't too high but I'm happy to hear about any offer!

Feel free to send me a DM - I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks for the help!

Cheers, Yannick"

I've learned a lot about navigating through recruiting for internships/jobs in CS over the past 2 years and just wanted to share my journey from being behind and below average to being (somewhat) successful with recruiting.

I started out as a non-major who swapped into CS in my sophomore year who never coded before college at a non-target university. Since I swapped into CS kinda late, I took intro to programming in my sophomore year, data structures in my junior year (after recruiting was over pretty much), and I'm taking intro to computer systems next semester (in my senior year before graduation lmfao). I'm not going to lie, it was an incredibly difficult process and I ran into so many problems just even trying to land interviews. Competing with these bay area kids who attended hackathons in highschool and took AP Computer Science was ridiculous, I didn't even know what a hashmap was until midway throughout my sophomore year. I made that post (link above) in my sophomore year, when I was so frustrated because I wasn't getting any interviews and I was not passing the ones that I got. I ended up reading CTCI, reading EPI, going through hackerrank's video series, doing a lot of leetcode, working on a lot of personal projects, polishing my resume, networking with alumni, and practicing competitive coding problems...etc. It was definitely not an overnight transformation. Took me a solid year to two to improve my coding, interviewing, and networking skills. Faced a lot of challenges, rejections, and it honestly felt downright bad especially since I knew a lot of overachievers who were doing way better than I was. My chance finally came in junior year when I was recruiting for internships, and I knew I had to do well this time around. I continued to prep really hard, and ended up with offers from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Linkedin, Uber, Amazon and a couple others. Worked really hard at a couple of those I chose to intern at and got return offers, and after this recruiting season I ended up turning them down for a fulltime offer with one of Jane Street/Two Sigma/D.E. Shaw for 250k~350k range first year.

I just wanted to post this to let people, notably frustrated freshman and sophomores facing a lot of rejections, know that even if things seem really grim right now and even if you really want to give up, if you try hard and put effort into what you do every single day, you'll be able to achieve what you never thought you could in a year or two.

Thanks to this sub for helping me with my career endeavors, was a good ride.

&gt; Surprise! Vitalik Buterin Tried to be an Intern at Ripple

https://cryptonews.com/news/surprise-vitalik-buterin-tried-to-be-an-intern-at-ripple-3725.htm

&gt; [Vitalik] ended the comment saying just a few individuals across the world own “a large percentage” of the world’s total money supply and it is scary and pissing off.
After Vitalik had raised these observations, twitterratti took him to the cleaner, saying Ethereum’s co-founders premined 100% of Ethereum supply before the firm began its Initial Coin Offering (ICO). ... Gathered information has it that Vitalik and his colleagues who created Ethereum had premined around 70% of the whole Ethereum supply before pushing for ICO.

***

Nobody has done more for legitimizing centralized premines than Vitalik's marketing success with Ethereum. No longer did projects have to try to design around trust minimization and decentralization by legitimizing keeping or selling of coins by a central party (trivially abused by buying from sale themselves). His technically illiterate understanding of trust minimization even went as far as legitimizing premined Ripple and he has spoken several times positively about it and even tried to work for them. Why wouldn't they - legitimizing premines is a risk free way to profit significantly despite the security issue - a strong incentive. How does one even justify centralized premine of stake in proof of stake? Vitalik, who coined the term ""bitcoin maximalist"", handwaves all criticism away to his fans suggesting this verifiable design security failure equivalent to a backdoor is a matter of opinion, critics are wrong because they are all not impartial, and its importance is downplayed. Reality is far simpler. Ethereum and Ripple are not relevant to decentralized technology.

Examples of Vitalik downplaying significance of premine (coins created before public mining):

I'm a university student, looking for a part-time job to not only help my grandparents with putting me through university but also, to make my CV stand out for future internship applications\~

That is why I reach out to your kennel! I understand that your last female dog has passed away recently. ㅠ.ㅠ

It must be such devastating news for the male dogs!  —  I've spent long and hard thinking about how I could contribute to your kennel and while doing so, on a western message board, I received the recommendation, that I could try replacing the bitch you've lost, so that your mutts neither suffer from a reduction in fertility nor increased aggression.

I think that is very important for a breeding kennel, no? Considering how important both of these are to the pedigree of a renown kennel.  —  The men were so friendly in recommending me how to best help, and they even voiced that, in their opinion, a cute Korean girl would be for sure  liked by all the big dogs!

Therefore,  I was thinking, maybe I could wear my old school uniform and let them dry-hump on me. Many of my panties are very soft and hopefully shouldn't cause pain to the dogs.\~

When I was young I often roamed around on all four and went \*wang!\* \*wang!\*. I think I can be a convincing dog for them and I would like to contribute to your great kennel and help you make this amazing breed more popular in Korea!

Please consider hiring me, I will try my best to become an asset to your kennel and earn myself a letter of recommendation for my CV.\~

_______

""Congratulations! We'd like to extend you an offer for the AMWF summer internship program! Please find your offer letter attached. Reply to this email with your start date and end date and please fill out the relocation form!""

You were ecstatic when you got that email. AMWF was one of the leading technology companies in the cloud computing space. Their position in their space, coupled with their San Francisco high rise office, insane perks (massage room, library) and high pay made their internship program one of the most competitive in the world. And you got in.
______

You got out of the elevator to the 50th floor office of AMWF, ready for your first day. You headed to the receptionist, a pretty blonde lady wearing a tight, revealing dress, and told you who you were.

""Ah, yes! One of the interns!"" she exclaimed, handing you a guest pass and instructing you to head to a meeting room called Cybertron, where your mentor would be meeting you shortly.

On the way, you noticed a few things. One, the office seemed to be composed of two distinct types of people, tall, fit, handsome Asian men and white women dressed in revealing clothes. You wondered who your mentor would be as you sat inside Cybertron, a meeting room with an expansive view of the city's financial district.

_______

A few minutes later, a [pale, blonde woman walked in, clutching a laptop and a coffee cup. She was dressed in a tight skirt, heels, and a black crop top. She looked more like a whore than a professional.](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg) 

""Hi! You must be *your name*!"" she beamed, sitting down next to you at the conference table. 

""I'm Rosie, and I'm going to be your mentor here at AMWF, "" she opened her laptop, typing away for a few seconds before turning her attention to you.

""Since you're my intern, it's my job to make sure you're getting all the support and help you need, "" she giggles, scooching a bit closer to you. You notice she's booked two hours for this meeting room.

""So, first things first, which one of my holes do you want me to service you with first, *daddy*?"" she purred.

Hi! I'm Rosie and I kind of look like [this](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg). I'm looking to play your mentor/cum dump during your internship at AMWF. I like dirty talk, name calling, raceplay (Asian dominance &lt;3), big cocks, lots of cum, impregnation, and cheating.

Seeking advice on current education pathway.,iammrh4ppy,healthIT,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/dxtf3c/wife_wants_to_become_a_healthcare_analyst_seeking/,"Edit: So we followed many of your guys' advice and she asked her director to help her meet the right people in the hospital network. 


She was able to meet several directors from IT, Analytics, and Quality Assurance. 


She is starting an internship with the Quality Assurance Department in the network and will be shadowing the people who run the analytics sector in that department. It seems like she is more interested in QA. 

Regardless, we followed your advice and it got us in the right direction! 

Pathways are clearer now. 


Thanks all! 



Posting for my wife as she does not have a Reddit account hehe

&amp;nbsp;


Wife's info:|  Description
---|---
Age | 30
Current Goal | Become a Healthcare Analyst
Current Job | Works for a major hospital group in our area. Has the political clout and support of big players in this hospital group to get her into the hospital's analytics department.
Education | 3rd year in BS in Healthcare Administration.  Looking to minor in Management Information Systems

&amp;nbsp;

We are wondering if she should skip the classes required for the minor and just jump into a  Healthcare Analytics Boot camp before she graduates. 

&amp;nbsp;


I've provided a table of the classes from the minor and the boot camp

&amp;nbsp;



University Management Information Systems Minor| UC Irvine Healthcare Analytics Boot Camp Classes
---|----
 Introduction to Computer Systems and Applications | Healthcare Analytics
Management Information Systems | Data Assets and Data Strategy
Business Application Programming | Healthcare Data Acquisition and Management 
Database Management | Data Mining, Visualization and Decisioning for Healthcare
Systems Analysis and Design | Artificial Intelligence and Decision Science in Healthcarre
 | Precision Medicine


&amp;nbsp;

Lastly, we are wondering what skills she should learn at home on her free time in order to add help her once she becomes a Healthcare Analyst. We've read that learning R Analytics, Tableau, Python, SQL, and Excel would be sufficient in an entry analyst job. 

My wife is in a somewhat great position to benefit her because she already works for a large hospital group and the people she works for are willing to connect her to the company's healthcare analytics department. She just needs to do her part in obtaining her BS and the certificates required to even apply to jobs as a healthcare analystics. 

So sorry for the long post!

We appreciate your help!

Thanks!!"
dxuco3,4,2019-11-17,7 weeks later.,Meegster17,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/dxuco3/7_weeks_later/,"We matched on a dating app. I had never texted someone who had so much energy before. We started calling each other every night, and since my car was getting fixed and she didn’t have her’s yet we would just spend all of our free time getting to know each other and planning dates together. She even asked me to be her date to a play her school was throwing.

I got my car back, I met her and she introduced me to her friends. She has a busy schedule; many chores, a couple internships, and school five days a week. And somehow she still found time to fit me in. We dated and really enjoyed each other, she’d tell me how badly she missed talking to me and would routinely call and text first. It was everything I wanted

The day after the play my Dad had a heart attack,  I had already texted her that day and it was odd that she hadn’t responded. Of course I could still see her tweeting but I wasn’t getting anything. Later I added what had happened to my Dad and she responded rather quickly.

Over the next week she started becoming kinda distant and we hardly held down a conversation as I would try to send her things and she just wouldn’t acknowledge them. She acknowledged her twitter timeline though of course.

She had pointed out before that I needed to clean my bathroom so one day that week I actually scrubbed it all down and proudly sent her a pic bc it reminded me of her, to which she replied “why cause i’m so shitty?”

She would invite me to meet her at her internship office one morning for breakfast, but ended up cancelling the night before. I would’ve just moved to another day but she was busy the rest of the weekend.
One time I texted her about my two guy friends picking up girls at a party, and she asked me why I didn’t pick one up myself.

Finally, I was given tickets to a concert and I figured I’d let her know. She replied in all caps, so excited to say YES; like all that passion came back to her, she just had to check to see if she had to work...
And she did.
I couldn’t get ahold of her for a week, my messages weren’t very important, she answered when I called though/only to remark how exhausted she was and how she needed to sleep.
She ended up texting me that she’s “really not feeling any type of relationship atm.” And blocked me from seeing her Twitter. And all this took 2 months.
It’s been a month and a half of no contact, and I still hate thinking about the wasted potential."

I only watch the anime, but I had this entire season spoiled anyways (thanks internet!), so I thought I'd ask a question that I have about it.

The Internship Arc is the longest arc so far (Chapters 122-162) , and I was wondering if it needed to be so long?

The main complaints that I've seen are that it takes a while for anything to actually happen, and that flashbacks placed in the middle of fights causes them to drag.

Please mark anything that's an anime spoiler - just because I know about it doesn't mean other people do.

I'm Polish, an IT Student in Tilburg, Dutch. 2nd year. Moved to Dutch when i was 7, now i'm 18. English is my third language so sorry for spelling mistakes.

1st year is an school year, where i could learn every basic thing about IT, cool yea, but. The worse thing is, there was not a single girl doing  IT education. most girls went into Social Media, Photoshop, etc... So there was me and 30 other bros. The whole year, i've only talked to this one polish girl that i've had a crush on. Weeks later she dated this other dude from my class and i've cut all contact with her cause i felt sad. I felt shit about myself. I live pretty far from the school and all my friends from IT live nowhere close to me. So first year ended and i've got an internship at this small laptop refurbish business. Where it's me and the boss. (Guy is cool).

I haven't talked to anyone but my parents (my parents don't know i have these feelings) and my boss about stuff. sometimes on Discord and Teamspeak to good polish friends. I haven't talked to any girl since 6 months or so. My depression kicked in during the internship as i have no one to really talk to or hangout with. Because of this i've also made some social anxiety. I thought about talking to a professional, get a treatment. But i think it's just a waste of time and money (my family isn't very rich). Music and games it the real only thing that makes me really happy, sitting alone playing games and listening to music."
dxvinc,203,2019-11-17,Bring her home,thayeryan,Wholesomenosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wholesomenosleep/comments/dxvinc/bring_her_home/,"""*Star child,*"" I called her. She was always a dreamer ever since we first got together, almost a decade ago.

Back then, she wasn't even sure what she wanted to do with her life. We were young and our main focus was getting by week to week. A few years later, she would be a space woman, traveling amongst the stars with some of America's most elite engineers and scientists. We met through mutual friends. She worked with my buddy’s wife at the time, and they were desperately trying to hook me up.

""Nice to meet you,"" I said, shaking the beautiful girls hand as she sat across from me at a bar.

""Likewise,"" she responded with a subtle smile. My friends wife nudged him while grinning, unaware that I saw their excited glances. Three years after that we said ""*I do""* and our future was set. 

Emily and I love each other more than anything. Humans as a species benefit more from quick reproduction than they do from any kind of long term affection, yet it still exists. I firmly believe that there is more to the existence of love than we can currently understand or even articulate. It’s hard to believe, and even harder to convince a stranger of, but eventually our bond would allow us to transcend the cosmos in a way you only read about in fiction.

Once she knew she wanted to work for SpaceX, she was off to school, chasing her dream and attempting to live up to her nickname. She's extremely smart, my Emily. She's always had an affinity for sci-fi, and her endless knowledge of constellations is what earned her the nickname star child in the first place. So, she became a mechanical engineer and applied for an internship with SpaceX. They accepted, and from there it was only a matter of time.

10…

""This is huge!"" I told her, ecstatic about the news she had just told me.

""I'm terrified, and excited, and it doesn't feel real,"" she admitted with happy tears in her eyes.

9…

""You're going to be counted amongst the small group of humans in all of existence that have left our planet in a ship!"" I was hugging Emily tightly as she buried her face in my shoulder. ""I'm so fucking proud of you.""

8…

""Everything happened so quick,"" she said with a laugh. ""I'm almost worried that I've bitten off more than I can chew.""

7...

""No way. You're star child - you were born for this! I'll be down here looking up at you, ready to catch you in case you fall.""

6…

She rolled her eyes and laughed at me. ""Shawn, seriously… I'm going to miss you so much."" I kissed her forehead and held her in front of me.

5...

""We have the rest of our lives together, go, live your dream. I'm not going anywhere.""

4…

""When I get back…"" she began with hesitation. I gave her a puzzled look, anticipating what she might say. 

""What?"" I asked impatiently.

3…

She clasped her fingers behind my neck. ""I think we'd have a little girl,"" she said with a distant look in her eyes, as if she were taking a quick peek into the future.

2…

I smiled, lifting her off her feet as I hugged her deeply.

""Me too.""

1…

The flames that emitted from beneath the rocket were too powerful to look at for more than a few seconds. Myself and the other families whose loved ones were on board the ship were given access to a special launch viewpoint, alongside some of the SpaceX higher-ups. I was terrified. I watched the ship barreling out of our atmosphere and couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that sat in my stomach. My Emily was seated at the front of that heap of metal and fire, on a year long trajectory toward Mars. We kissed fiercely that last time, before she suited up for her journey into the infinite black. I battled my selfishness, desperate to ask her not to go. The look in her eyes as she turned to walk away from me screamed ""*say anything, I'll call this off*."" 

It was difficult, those first few months. Everything felt empty and lacked the meaning it used to retain. Friday nights were generally a big to-do, as we often made arrangements to go out or sit at home and watch movies under a blanket while feasting on snacks. Without her they became a vacuum of loneliness and selfish desires. Friends did what they could to keep me occupied but the silence of being alone rang louder than any rocket engine ever could. And then I got the call.

""I'm looking for Mr. Shawn Haggerty,"" a woman's voice said from the other end of the line.

""Yes,"" I said, already aware of who was calling and feeling my nerves pulsate as if I were about to spontaneously combust.

""Mr. Haggerty, there's a car on its way to your home that has been instructed to wait for your arrival. SpaceX has an urgent meeting that all families are requested to attend.""

""Yes, of course!"" I said, my voice giving away my nerves. I fought off the thoughts, scared that voicing them in any way would jinx the possibility. The possibility that she was coming home early. The drive there was long, quiet, and anxiety fueled. My mind raced with the possible reasons for the meeting. Whatever the truth was, for them to call in the families of the crew had to mean something major. And then, the SpaceX offices came into view. The driver pulled around the back of the building and parked in front of a pair of doors.

""They'll meet you inside,"" the driver said, looking at me through the rear view mirror.

""Oh, right. Thanks."" As I left the car I was greeted by a woman holding open one of the doors.

""Right this way, sir,"" she said. I recognized her voice as the woman from the call and followed her inside. ""We'll be meeting in the main conference room just over here,"" she said as we turned the corner into a long hallway and made for a large pair of opaque glass doors. ""Make yourself comfortable, the meeting will start soon.""

Inside the room was a massive glass table with expensive chairs all around it, meant to provide extra comfort for long meetings. Already seated were a few familiar faces from the day of the launch. Everyone looked up as I entered, acknowledging me with awkward smiles. Returning the expression, I took my seat. The room was tense and quiet, not unlike the long car ride. Somehow, knowing that everyone else in the room was dealing with the same panic didn’t ease mine whatsoever.

It was another ten minutes before SpaceX officials entered the room wearing glum expressions on their faces.

""Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,"" a man with a furrowed brow, short brown hair and a german accent said. ""My name is Hans Koenigsmann and I’m VP of mission assurance at SpaceX. We've had a series of updates that we would like to share with you in regards to the Olympus 9 mission to Mars - the ship in which your family members are the crew for. Last month we had a check in that came back positive. The team reported with optimal stats, putting us a few weeks ahead of schedule…"" I could feel my heart beating through my shirt as he spoke. I was dying for him to spit out whatever the news was, and get it over with.

""Yesterday we received a fragmented update that immediately flagged us for our attention. After a few hours of attempts to relay with the Olympus team, we were able to pull a diagnosis from the ship itself… or… at least what remained of it."" Throughout the room there was a collective exhale, as if everyone had been unified in hanging on his every word.

""The fragmented diagnostic that we received showed evidence that the ship had been mangled and partially destroyed. With further investigation we were able to track active life support vessels from the wreckage and… I'm sorry to say, there weren't any.""

Everyone hung their head. Hans continued explaining what little they were able to understand from the retrieved data, and that they believed something had collided with the Olympus. I watched the families cry and hold onto one another for support, but for me, none of it felt real. I was in a dream like state, observing the room like a spectator with a front row seat.

Things moved quite quickly after that. I don’t remember the drive home at all, and I’m not even sure I ate that afternoon. The next coherent memory I have from after the meeting is of being dismissed from work. A lot of concerned expressions on my coworkers faces lead me back to the front door of my home… of *our* home. I approached it like a stranger visiting an open house before making a purchase. Pushing open the door, I stepped inside and casually peeked around the living room, observing all of the accumulated possessions we’d collected during our brief existence together.

I made my way into the bedroom and laid down, taking in her scent that still lingered for the time being. Despite all the pain I felt stemming from her loss, I couldn’t bring myself to cry. For some reason I was convinced that I was on the verge of rewinding all the way back to the moment she gave me that look. This time, I would ask her to stay. She would be okay with giving up her dream now, and we would start our family. Our daughter would be a dreamer, just like her mother was, and we would push her to achieve it - holding her up during the lows and cheering her on through the highs.

I opened my eyes again, some questionable amount of time later. I attempted to get my footing as I pushed away from the bed, but felt an overwhelming sense of being out of my element. A low hum emitted from every direction around me and my body suddenly felt lighter. As my senses cleared I recognized that I was no longer in my home.

“I’m dreaming,” I told myself. I struggled to acclimate to the odd environment, directing my significantly lighter body through a nearby doorway and into a curved corridor. As I stepped out of the room, small lights along the floor began to illuminate my path, guiding me through a maze of off white paneling and long thick cables that spanned the length of the ceiling. My voice funneled quickly through the cramped hallway. I felt alone still, the pain from Emily’s loss still tearing at my heart - even here, in this foreign dream world. I neared the end of the hall, which opened up into a dining space. A large table on one side of the room was laden with the dishes and utensils of a recently finished meal. Opposite the table was the kitchen-like space, containing cabinets for dishware and a large meal dispensing apparatus.

I was amazed by the bizarrely atmospheric experience my brain seemed to be able to create. The surface of the table and vibration of the walls all felt so realistic. Suddenly, I caught a movement out of the corner of my eye. Turning to face the interruption I was put into a state of immediate shock. Emily was casually navigating the room, reaching into a cabinet and pulling out a cup before using the machine to request water. Stunned, I stared into her apathetic eyes as the water slowly poured into her cup. 

""Em?"" I said, feeling despondent and in disbelief.

Her face shifted as the words left my lips. She shot her eyes quickly across the room, looking through me as if I didn't exist at all. Moving abruptly away from the dispensar, she knocked over the glass with her hand, spilling it onto the floor. A muffled and distorted noise left her mouth that I was unable to decipher. I watched her grab the cup and start wiping up the water with a puzzled expression across my face. She placed the cup into some sort of cleaning mechanism, shot one last glance across the room and ducked into a nearby connecting hallway.

""Wait,"" I said to myself, pursuing her as if she were going to vanish, had I lost sight. I watched as she paced her way into the ship's cabin, poking a crew mate on the shoulder and mouthing more distorted noises at him. The man shrugged and continued with his work, dismissing her seemingly confused and frustrated query. We returned to the kitchen where she looked around cautiously before taking a seat at the dining table. I was watching her face as she wore an expression I was all too familiar with. She was deep in thought, probably speculating or rationalizing something in her head. A moment came soon after where she shifted her eyes in my direction. I froze, feeling paralyzed from head to toe. Her glance was powerful and pulled me in like gravity, demanding my attention and causing me to completely forget my theory of being in some vivid dream.

""Emily, it's me.""

Her jaw dropped as she pushed herself in a panic off of her chair, falling onto her side along the ground. Still staring into the air around me, she hesitated before trying to communicate again. Her lips moved but her words were incoherent. My chest fluttered with the knowledge that she was hearing me. I didn't know what to say or where to begin. Tears flooded my eyes before I could find my words.

""I love you so much, star child."" She brought her hand up to her mouth, obscuring her face and letting out a few more unintelligible sounds as her eyes became glossy with tears as well.

""I...I don't know if this is real. I don't know why I'm seeing this. But god dammit, I've missed you so much. I thought I'd never see you again, sweetie."" She pushed herself to her feet using a nearby wall and walked toward the center of the room. She spoke carefully while still looking past me.

""Em, I can't hear you - I'm not sure what you're saying or if I'm doing something wrong…"" She took a moment to gather herself, wiping her tears and shaking her head as if trying to gather her senses. Just as she seemed to finish, another woman walked into the room, making her way past Emily and taking out a tray before preparing herself a meal. I could hear her making idle conversation while casually poking through her food options. Emily responded in short bursts as if trying to seem bored or going through the motions of everyday life. The woman stopped what she was doing and shot Emily a concerned look. I watched her face carefully, able to understand her question without having to hear it.

""*Are you ok?""* She asked. She approached Emily and exchanged a few more concerned sounding words before pulling her into a friendly hug. I felt an odd sense of relief, knowing now that someone onboard the ship seemed to be there for her emotionally while I wasn't able to be. Emily gave the woman an appreciative smile before walking out of the room and heading down the corridor I had initially found myself in. I almost missed it as Emily's hand dropped to her side, subtly beckoning me to follow. For the first time in many months, I willingly smiled.

We entered the crews quarters, away from the eyes of her team. She made her way to her bunk before turning outward to face the open room. I could see my name formed on her lips as she spoke and knew immediately what she was asking. 

""Yea, I'm right here,"" I said, half smiling from being able to say that again. She searched around the bunks, rifling through storage until she pulled out a pencil and notepad, holding it up for me to see. She began scribbling quickly on the page and turned it outwards again.

*""Cant see you,""* she wrote.

""Ok,"" I said with an awkward chuckle, ""that's what I thought."" She let free a smile, choking back more tears as she looked back at her terrible handwriting.

*""How is this happening?""* she scribbled below her previous note.

""I don't know. I was in bed, just kinda lost in thought, and…"" it was then that the truth had returned to me. The pain of loss and sense of hopelessness that I had been drowning in. ""Emily, you died."" Her face was awash with confusion. I stammered a bit before managing my words again. ""The station called me in, Em. They called in all of the families. Something happened up here… and no one survived."" Emily sat on her bunk, dumbfounded by what I was saying. She searched her mind for answers with her usual contemplative expression. I took a few steps forward and knelt down in front of her. I looked over her concerned face and then down to her hand that rested in her lap. I took a deep breath and reached out, attempting to rest my hand on hers. As contact was made, a warm, fuzzy sensation tingled through my arm. A smile formed on Emily's face, letting me know that she could somehow feel my presence, even if I couldn't truly feel her. She picked up her pencil again and scribbled onto a new page. 

*""Did they say how?""*

""No, they speculated some sort of collision but didn't seem sure."" Emily shrugged while looking baffled. I sighed, unsure how to resolve this supernatural, out of body experience.

""Wait, Em, it was the 14th of March when they called me in to report the bad news, and they said the wreck happened the day before. Do you have a way of telling earth time up here?""

*""Why?""* she wrote.

""This might seem odd but I guess we're past that now. I want to rule out that I've been sent back… to help you, if that makes sense."" She looked intrigued by my theory and quickly grabbed her nearby laptop. The screen illuminated her face as it powered on and by the time she had reached her desktop she was wearing a confused expression again.

""What is it?"" I asked. Rotating the screen, she gestured to the date at the bottom right corner of the display.

*Tuesday, March 16th 6:03 PM*

""They were wrong,"" I said, sounding elated. Emily was sorting through her thoughts as I stood in place, finding myself lost in moments of admiring her adorable mannerisms. When she suddenly perked up I snapped out of my trance and waited for her to write out her thoughts.

*""I need to make an excuse for us to contact HQ.""* after holding it up for a moment she tore off the page and continued writing. 

*""We can let them know that everything is fine without raising any alarms with the crew beforehand.""*

""That's perfect,"" I said. Emily hastily tossed her crumpled notes under her bunk and made for the hall again. I followed, unsure exactly what she had in mind but trusting her wholeheartedly. She crept her way back into the kitchen with her head on a swivel, weary of her teams wearabouts. Making her way towards the food dispensing unit, she hastily pried open its siding and began fidgeting with the machinery within. As she pulled out a few screws and an oblong shaped piece of metal, an older gentleman walked into the room without her notice.

""Emily, behind you,"" I called in a pointless whisper. Turning her head casually, she began speaking with the man in what seemed to be calm tones. I watched their faces carefully hoping to interpret the conversation, and worried that he had caught her in the act of dismantling the machine. Emily gave a frustrated glare at the the ajar panel, putting on a very nonchalant air. The man expressed very little apart from what I interpreted as ""oh well,"" before walking away. Pocketing the mechanical device, she quickly sealed up the machine and pulled out her notepad, scribbling on it and holding it up in the wrong direction. I moved a few paces over before reading it.

*""Told him its malfunctioning. Calling HQ to report soon.""*

""Bravo,"" I said with a proud laugh. She smiled and gave a slight bow, proud of her own performance.

We spent a short while doing her routine check-ins with various ship infrastructures. Plumbing was being constantly inspected, O2 levels and temperature balance were regularly maintained, and the food and water fabricator was upkept. She wanted to maintain appearances for the time being. There didn't seem to be an immediate threat to their lives, and she was scared of becoming the crazy girl who started hearing her husband's voice while on the way to another planet. So, I talked to her. She couldn't respond much while she was working, but I got a kick out of making her smile or even laugh as she was trying to focus. And it felt amazing, like it used to. We were us again for a moment, laughing and reminiscing about moments from our past. We fit like a glove, even through the oddest of circumstances. 

It was time. Emily and the communication's expert, Patrick, sat down to choreograph an emergency relay with HQ. She managed to convince her crewmates that this particular issue required contact with her team back earthside so they could talk through what she was stuck on. They sat down near a text display and Patrick clicked a button on the screen labeled ""ping"". The monitor flashed before displaying a message across its face.

*""Connecting…""*

I stood just behind Emily, watching the screen intently as we waited for some sort of response. Almost a full minute had passed when I saw Patricks face scrunch in as he muttered something. Emily seemed concerned as he spoke with a tone of confusion, clicking in and out of the communication program and re-attempting contact, to no avail. They exchanged a few more words before Emily sighed, making her way out of the room and heading into the kitchen.

""What happened?"" I asked.

*""Connection failed,""* she wrote.

""What does that mean? Is something broken, or are we too far?""

*""We don't know.""*

""Shit."" I was out of possibilities. If contact couldn't be made then there was no way of confirming the truth, at least not until either I woke up or we made it to Mars another 8 or 9 months from then. Emily clung her notepad to her chest as her crewmate and friend, Sara, entered the room. They made more small talk as Sara cleaned up the messy countertop and began poking around the food dispenser. Emily seemed to perk up and say something as Sara began requesting her cereal. Before she could finish her thought, however, Sara had her food and was dropping in her spoon. Emily froze, watching her eat with surprise on her face. She reached in her pocket and pulled out the mechanical device, looking at it with confusion.

""What is it?"" I asked. She pulled up her notepad, holding it casually in front of herself.

*""Something's wrong,""* she wrote vaguely. *""I'm sure I broke it beyond use.""*

Later, we had found the seclusion of her bunk. She curled up near the wall and I took a seat beside her.

*""I don't understand. It can't be functioning without this.""* she scribbled down. I mulled it over in my head, considering what any of this could mean, but came up dry. I could tell by looking at her that Emily was also bewildered with the reasoning. She slumped down, lying on her pillow the same way she had for many years prior. I tucked myself just behind her, wishing I could feel the warmth of her body against mine.

""We're gonna be ok,"" I told her. She shut her eyes and began drifting off. I watched her sleep. Whatever this situation was, I didn't want to go back to before. I couldn't wake up to a world without her. Not again.

The time passed almost too quickly. Her eyes blinked as she stirred back to consciousness. I waited to greet her as she sat herself upright again, quietly speaking so only I could hear the attempt.

""I'm here, Em."" She reached for her notepad and began writing again.

*""I have a theory,""* she wrote.

""What is it?"" I asked.

*""I could be wrong…""* she hesitated to continue writing her thoughts. *""But something has been consistently odd about everyone here.""* 

""How so?"" I asked further.

*""They're all just… kind of off,""*  She replied. When she got up we went about her rounds again. I didn't feel tired or hungry or any of my usual needs. I was confident now that I was here to accomplish my one and only task. I needed to bring her home. As we navigated the ship we kept a watchful eye on the crew members. They seemed normal enough, but Emily was growing more and more suspicious.

*""They're always the same,""* she told me as the older man, Bill, grunted some noises at her before going about his business.

""What do you mean?"" I asked.

*""They only do what I've seen them do previously.""*  I was clueless. As far as I could tell everyone was doing their work and relaxing whenever possible, much like any other job. But she knew these people, and I trusted she knew the truth.

*""I want to check on Patrick,""* she wrote, *""he must have made some progress by now.""* She wrapped up her final inspection and made for the communication's bridge. As we neared the entryway, Emily halted her movement and slowly peeked into the room. Her face looked mortified after only a few seconds of spying.

""What is it?"" I moved forward and looked into the room, beside her. Seated in front of a blank screen was Patrick, immobile and staring vacantly as if powered off. I heard sound leaving Emily's mouth as she stepped into the room. Patrick turned to face her, looking mildly disinterested as she spoke with concern.

""What's going on?"" I asked her, losing sight of our inability to talk directly. The conversation had clearly elevated from talking to yelling. Patrick seemed to be defending himself but was clearly more confused than he was angry. As the argument reached its climax, Emily stormed back through the station. I ran behind her, yelling her name and begging for an explanation, but was ignored in the fog of her anger. She began wreaking havoc on anything she could get her hands on. She tore at the cabling along the ceiling and ripped an extinguisher from the wall, hurling it at a nearby command console.

""EMILY!"" I yelled. Panting, she stopped herself and sat down on the floor with a distraught expression. ""Please, what is happening?"" Reluctantly, she pulled out her notepad and began writing. Before she could finish, we were greeted by the entire crew, blocking the corridor and approaching her with caution. Emily dropped the notebook and stood to her feet, confronting the group of them. ""Leave her alone,"" I called redundantly. They took turns speaking to her, seemingly worried about the destruction she might cause. From behind the group came Sara, clutching a fist full of papers in her hand and fanning out a few for people to read. Emily looked suddenly embarrassed. The notes she had written to me were damning from an outsider's perspective. She was the mad woman now, talking to herself from time to time and scribbling notes before stuffing them under her bed.

""Don't let them trick you,"" I called to her, ""I'm actually here. I don't know how but I promise I am."" A few of the men made a move, lunging toward her and restraining her arms. I naively attempted to shove them away, falling clumsily to the ground. As I did, the hum that emanated from the ship seemed to fluctuate in rhythm. The crew was dragging a fierce Emily away from me as I noticed her notepad on the ground. I turned it over and read her final note that she had hastily scribbled.

*""It's not real.""*

The noise grew louder and louder as I read. The words ran meaninglessly across my mind, until they didn't. The deafening noise abruptly ceased and a warm breeze washed over me, ushering with it a dramatic change of scenery. The station around me distorted and faded from view. Emily was within sight again, standing to her feet as she took in the strange phenomenon around us. We were in a large, circular chamber surrounded by a thick fog that bordered the room, making it impossible to see the walls beyond. Beneath Emily’s feet were odd screen like panels that seemed to illuminate when pressure was put on them.

""Emily..."" I said in shock. I rushed over to her side, watching my surroundings both in fear and awe. Another noise replaced the temporary silence, erupting from around us like the crashing waves of an ocean. The sound fluctuated in volume and ceased before restarting in a new pattern. I watched the fog around us pulsate with movement as the sound continued on.

""That's a voice,"" I pointed out. Emily nodded with her mouth agape, signifying that she heard the same thing. Utilizing the bizarrely realistic holographic technology that we had just escaped, we were presented with a depiction of Emily's space station. The small hologram hovered just a few feet in front of us as it recreated the events leading to our current situation. The station was traveling along its intended trajectory toward Mars when a gateway opened up directly on top of it, severing the ship and killing all of its crew except for one. Through the passageway came a large orb shaped craft, rescuing the final survivor from the tragic accident and placing her into a temporary rest like state. The beings of the craft observed a vibrant tether that spanned the distance of the galaxy, stemming outward from the sleeping woman. The orb emitted a pulse, tracing the tether to its source while simultaneously summoning another being into the chamber alongside the survivor. Both of us looked up from the simulated event, watching as the holographic technology recreated a glowing strand of light running between my and Emily's chests. As this realization set in, a powerful and calming hum pushed me backwards and relieved me of my consciousness.

My eyes flickered open to the warm bedroom I had fallen asleep in. The blankets around me were a chaotic mess as if I had been kicking and stirring in my sleep. I lifted my head carefully from my pillow as my heart sank from my chest to my stomach. The family I had fantasized about would die as just that, an unfulfilled dream. I sat up and clutched my face, annoyed that I had fallen for such a desperate and pathetic recreation of the woman I had lost. Any and all hope was killed as I paced the house alone now, listening to the soulless echo my presence created in an otherwise perfectly silent place. 

We aren't supposed to feel our heartbeats. It would be astoundingly distracting if we were constantly aware of each pump the valves of our heart created as it pushed blood throughout our bodies. Suddenly, however, I felt my heart beating. The awareness set in as if my heart hadn't been operating at all prior to that moment, but now I could feel it reactivate without prompt or warning. While I was standing in my kitchen, childishly astonished with my functioning anatomy, the doorbell rang. A desperate hope awoke within me, side by side with my broken heart. 

""...Hello?"" I called out, fearful of what the response might be. A few moments passed and I had begun inching toward the door. My heart pounded harder with each step as the handle came within arms reach. Summoning what little courage I could find, I pushed the door open just a crack, revealing a tiny sliver of the most beautiful sight in the universe.

""I don't have my key,"" A shaky voice said. The tone rang like beautiful wind chimes in my ears.

""I… didn't think I'd ever hear your voice again,"" I managed to let out. She backed up as I opened the door completely, revealing an exhausted woman in a tattered SpaceX uniform. Lunging forward, I fell to my knees and buried my face in her stomach, clutching her like she might slip away at any moment from our doorstep. ""I missed you, star child,"" I said.

I believe there is more utility in love than we have the capability of understanding. It keeps us alive, it brings us together and it persists, regardless of circumstance. I believe that whatever brought my Emily home to me was able to do so because of our bond. The powerful tether that connects our souls. A love that eventually lead to the birth of our first daughter, Ana.

The family I envisioned finally became a reality. Emily has been debriefed hundreds of times over by now, explaining the events that came to pass during our stint onboard an alien vessel. Many choose not to believe, while others see her existence alone as proof. This open letter serves as not only my recollection of the events as they came to pass, but as a love note to my wife. Our story is helping to unlock the secrets of the universe, and the only thing more beautiful than that is the home we've created here on earth. I love you, [star child](https://Thayeryan.com)."
dxvmza,6,2019-11-17,I'm an Applied Math major who is infatuated with microcontrollers (self-taught). Is it possible for me to find work in Embedded Software/SWE with uC's?,IWantToDoEmbedded,microcontrollers,https://www.reddit.com/r/microcontrollers/comments/dxvmza/im_an_applied_math_major_who_is_infatuated_with/,"I graduate next year in May and I'm looking for Embedded SWE/SWE positions that deal with uC's with a bigger emphasis on the software aspect since most of my experience is with low-level software (thus, I'd be more competitive for software positions).    

As far as background and experience goes,  I program mostly in C and a little bit in C++ (took an intro course in C, OOP in C++, and I just practice C in my free time).  I've done a fair simple project with Arduino just to get an easy introduction to embedded systems (fairly simple stuff using Arduino's libraries).  I did an embedded software internship working with a microcontroller development board.  And now, I am trying to pick up and learn a different microcontroller board with BLE capabilities.  I learn about embedded systems and computer architecture in my free time.  

Now, I am well aware that most companies, for embedded software/system engineering positions, hire some mix of CE,EE, and CS majors.  From my job searching and frequenting on the embedded sub, it seems that the job entry barrier is really high, even for people in those majors.  However, I do know that some companies may hire math majors as SWE's.  However, for my situation and desired career path, I assume its even much harder to break into this field since knowledge of hardware is a must.  Does anyone have any advice/opinions about my situation?  

If it helps, I am considering pursuing grad school for either DSP or Digital Signals/Coms.  However, I don't know if that helps my situation in terms of finding embedded work.  From my understanding, it seems that companies prefer people at the bachelor's level with those degrees  for these positions whereas they'd seek people with grad degrees for higher roles.  I am a little lost and honestly, very scared about my job prospects in this field."
dxvp23,28,2019-11-17,Discouraged,heckithall,NewToEMS,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToEMS/comments/dxvp23/discouraged/,"Long story short I’m new at my job as a emt and ran about ten shifts. In the beginning I hadn’t practiced for a year as well as getting used to the ambulance so I was out of practice. After ten they expect you to be fully ready and prepared. You are rotated and evaluated by different people....
My last couple shifts were great, my last one I got a great eval and felt very encourage they said I was fully ready to be on my own ect. I am new and accept the constructive criticism as it’s all fair game but one guy I’m on with often just makes me very nervous 
Well I’ve been on shift with this one guy a few times.... I’m a naturally introverted person; so if certain emts are on call I’ll let them just do the call. I feel really nervous around this guy because he and his partner think I’m horrible; I always seem to mess up around them and get in my head. Hes yelled at me multiple times over certain errors with minor things, ect...The mistakes are quite embarrassing to be fair
Anyways first call he got angry at me and the whole shift ended up awful. He ended up saying I needed full remediation , said I wasn’t progressing at all and acting brand new despite having done many shifts, that his other interns were ready so quickly compared to me. I feel awful. I feel so discouraged by it. It seems for me that after that discouraging “talk” i just felt more closed in my shell and unsure about everything ... 
I don’t even know if I want to do this anymore. So many people I’ve met in ems are mean, make fun of the patients and aren’t understanding at all. And they constantly gossip about other staff. It’s such a negative environment. 

Sorry for this rant I’ll probably end up regretting this in the morning.

(kind of a long post, sorry)",lubbywubb,CongratsLikeImFive,https://www.reddit.com/r/CongratsLikeImFive/comments/dxwj12/for_the_first_time_in_a_long_time_im_actually/,"I’ve been so directionless in my life and suffered with some serious mental health issues for the last two years. I completely lost my direction in life, dropped out of college to have a large part in a small business, get let go/fired from that after nearly two years because the CEO and president overpaid themselves and shut down the company, and then spent a long time trying to pay off my uncompleted college degree. I had one particularly toxic person in my life who only made my mental health worse (I also live with this individual). It left me feeling so hopeless. 

Three weeks ago I had a complete mental breakdown. For days I couldn’t get out of bed, eat, shower, or do any basic human functions because I felt like a total piece of trash. Fortunately, I have an incredible dad and step mom along with some of the best, most genuine friends in the entire world. They were with me through every single step of the way and reminded me every day that I’m not a hopeless piece of garbage with no life or future (words straight from the toxic ex-friend’s mouth). They told me that I do have a future and people who love me and know I have the potential to have an amazing life if I take care of myself. 

After some serious work and self reflection, I have a two year plan ahead of me to finish my education, move to a city that I absolutely love, applied and got accepted to an incredible internship of my dreams for the summer, and then have the experience to go into the career field I’ve always wanted. So for today, I’m so happy. Happier than I’ve been in a very long time. 

If you’re still reading, thank you haha. I just needed to say something to someone and get it all out there. That toxic friend is being particularly awful for the past few months but it has recently gotten worse due to some fabricated story she made up in her head about me that isn’t true at all. Luckily all of my real friends can’t stand her and we all have a laugh about it at the end of the day because she’s just so so very terrible. I’m trying not to let it get into my head because what she does has no effect on me anymore, so this seemed like a good place to come to. Thanks again, friends.

Want to hear your input and/or suggestions.

Currently senior in college, graduating next semester. Took me four years of computer science education, and a year as front-end intern to realize I hate coding. 

Ever since freshman year of college, I was the only person in my cs classes that cared about aesthetic over performance. Most of my time I spent designing GUI interfaces, which pretty much carried my grades. Eventually I started critiquing shitty websites by my classmates, and redesigning them (for small fee). Now I'm stuck coding crappy concepts by other ""UI Designers"" from my company, with no space for improvement. Management is really conservative to experiment with fresh ideas and handing over projects to intern that just does coding, which drives me completely mad.

It sucks knowing that I basically wasted four years studying something that I don't love or care about doing. My city is filled with art schools that offer UI and UX courses, and my biggest regret is the fact that I missed out on going to one of them.

Right now, I'm basically self teaching myself user interface concepts, while building portfolio, and hoping to land summer internship as UI designer."
dxywb5,3,2019-11-18,My Girlfriend (20F) of 2 years Emotionally Cheated on Me (20M),ThrowRA--12345,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dxywb5/my_girlfriend_20f_of_2_years_emotionally_cheated/,"So my girlfriend and I have been officially dating for 2 years but we have been talking and hanging out much before that. The relationship has been great, but at times she would complain that I wouldn't put as much effort into the relationship as I used to when we first started dating. I agreed with her that I didn't think the need to 'woo' her as much now that we have been dating for quite some time now. And with all the school work I've had lately and me trying to find an internship, she feels I haven't been giving her as much attention as she would like. I told her I would work on it and reminded her of how much I cared about her.

Fast forward to a month and she tells me that she met this guy (We'll call him Max) at school who offers to drive her home because they live in the same area. She declines because she just met the guy and felt more comfortable taking the bus home. Then a few days later she tells me that her and Max have been ""talking a little more"". I did not think much of it at first because I didn't think it was anything serious. 

A few days later when I come home from school (I go to school in a different city), we go on a date and everything is great. I was on her phone looking at random messages with her and her friend (we both do that on each other's phones and we are okay with it), but this time she made an excuse to take her phone back to message her friend and I thought it was weird, but shrugged it off. 

The next day she calls me and asks me if I can hang out cause she wanted to ""talk about something serious"". I was concerned, but I agreed. The conversation started with her telling me that she liked Max, but she quickly ended things when she felt it was too much. Her and Max only talked for around 5 days until they decided it was inappropriate and unfair to me and his girlfriend if they were to continue things. I didn't know what to say at this point, I felt betrayed and hurt because I didn't think she would ever put me in this position. I wanted to read the messages between her and Max, but she deleted them because she said""they were too personal"" and because she knew that ""it would make things worse"". At that time I really wanted to read the messages and see for myself but I couldn't so I asked her some of the things they talked about. 

She told me how some nights they would stay up until 4am talking to each other. One night they talked about how it was wrong for them to do that, but they both confessed the feelings they had for each other. She told him that she found him attractive. And one time, Max told her that he had a dream that he drove her home and she invited him in and they had sex. I asked her how she felt when he said that and she said she touched herself for ""1 min"" to the thought of it but didn't continue. She also told him how she thought it about him while her and I were on a date. 

In the end, they both decided it was inappropriate to continue and felt it was best that they both stopped talking to each other completely. I'm not to sure how to feel at this point. My GF and I are both in our very first relationship together and we both love each other. I told her I appreciate that she told me this instead of me finding it out on my own, but I don't know how much I can trust her after this. 

Is this the first sign of someone who will cheat in the future? I want to forgive her because it was for a very short time and she knew it was wrong, but I don't know if she will do it again or anything worse once I forgive her. Hearing the things they talked about made me sick and I think I would have been even more mad if I read the entire conversation. Do you think it's best if I breakup with her or does she get deserve another chance for coming forward and telling me. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I apologize for any errors that I have made, this is my first ever Reddit post ever. Thanks everyone!"

And one time, Max told her that he had a dream that he drove her home and she invited him in and they had sex. I asked her how she felt when he said that and she said she touched herself for ""1 min"" to the thought of it but didn't continue. She also told him how she thought it about him while her and I were on a date.

In the end, they both decided it was inappropriate to continue and felt it was best that they both stopped talking to each other completely. I'm not to sure how to feel at this point. My GF and I are both in our very first relationship together and we both love each other. I told her I appreciate that she told me this instead of me finding it out on my own, but I don't know how much I can trust her after this.

Is this the first sign of someone who will cheat in the future? I want to forgive her because it was for a very short time and she knew it was wrong, but I don't know if she will do it again or anything worse once I forgive her. Hearing the things they talked about made me sick and I think I would have been even more mad if I read the entire conversation. Do you think it's best if I breakup with her or does she get deserve another chance for coming forward and telling me.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I apologize for any errors that I have made, this is my first ever Reddit post ever. Thanks everyone!

No masters but entered college with hours and changed majors late so ended up with extra hours that didn't transfer (computer engineering related) and will have 150 hours at graduation. 

With that being said, I feel disheartened and lost on how to move forward efficiently. Currently getting destroyed by Intermediate 2 with no idea what's happening but will pass. I don't really have any work experience, general or accounting related, or extracurricular activities which doesn't help but my gpa is decent with major being 4.0 (Inter 2, Cost, Intro Tax this semester will lower it some). I had put off interning because though I was a sophomore/junior in college, the switch meant I was basically a freshman in Accounting but now I'm pretty progressed through the major. 

My current thoughts are to look for a part-time accounting related job next semester since I only have 2 days of classes during the week and then an internship over summer but I feel like I've dropped the ball on going about this at the proper time and networking. Upon graduation I figure I may as well begin prepping for the CPA since I'll be eligible and it seems like obvious decision even though I'm thoroughly tired of school.

I welcome any advice or experiences and thank you in advance. Just trying to get a measure of how my current situation will affect me."

For weeks upon weeks, I’ve heard the “fans” of Pokémon talk shit at Game Freak for one decision after another. First, it was dexit, which I’ll admit, I was upset with at first too, but I got over it, and people would say “#BRinG bAcK thE NaTiONaL DeX” every time any news came out about the newest games, and on every social media post too. Maybe people don’t actually know this, but no one vital to the company runs their social media accounts. It’s probably just a lackey or an intern with nothing better to do, so everything you’re saying might as well fall onto deaf ears. The higher ups might find out about the backlash somehow, and they certainly will know five to six months after the announcement, so they’re definitely not concerned for any feedback about that specific issue this late in. (Now, I admit I don’t truly know who runs the socials, but the higher ups like Masuda must not have the time to use them, right?)

Then people got upset about them reusing models in the games. I’m not a 3D modeler by any means, but I can’t imagine they would just copy and paste the existing 3D models from Ultra Sun/Moon to Sword/Shield without touching them up at least a little. I have the game and have been playing it all weekend. I personally think the models look fine and fit the aesthetic well. I know people are mad that they lied, which is a fair criticism, but I just wanted to get that off my chest.

I’m a little upset that they lied and withheld the truth from us. We were lead to believe that they squeezed every ounce of manpower out of their admittedly small staff to make these games as clean and high quality they could. However, I think most people are just making a mountain out of a mole hill. Every other aspect of the game is really cool to me and I’m having a blast playing these games. They definitely put good work into the game even if the Pokémon themselves aren’t perfect. I’m exploring all of the new and unique areas, enjoying all of the new Pokémon, and enjoying the story too. Yeah, the story is not as in-depth as Black 2/ White 2, but no one ever said it needed to. I like this story because this one doesn’t have plot holes, dead end characters, or even a boring plot like some other games in the series do. (X/Y, I’m looking at you!)

Oh, and can we stop dogging on them for being the highest grossing media franchise? Yes, they make loads of money, but it’s going to a ton of places and people. Yes, some is going to Game Freak and all of their employees, but it’s also going to places like the company that makes the anime, the trading card card company, the merchandise company, and people and places for the official VGC and TCG competitions. It’s a lot of money yes, but they only make so much because they do so much.

There are legitimate problems, but I’ve seen people berate them for this that and the other, when, as far as I’m aware, it’s almost solely on the issue that they lied about reusing the same models as the ones in Sun and Moon. And hey, even though we can’t truly catch them all anymore, there are still about 400 Pokémon in the game which is almost 3 times the total Pokémon in all of Red and Blue, which I think is so cool!

I’m also writing this at 2:30 A.M., so please excuse me if some things aren’t as perfectly worded as they need to be. I just had to say something and not stay silent anymore."

Okay so I have an update on my situation. Some interesting stuff has already happened. I was initially planning on reaching here (at my sister's) on Saturday. Plans changed a bit and I reached here, Friday night. My sister was extremely happy to see me and it seemed my BIL was too (weird). I spent most of Saturday sleeping, I was really tired. 

Yesterday (Sunday) was a very relaxing day. We had a very lovely dinner together in the evening, my BIL cooked, he is actually pretty good, I had no idea. 

After dinner BIL suggested to my sis, ""Hey honey, wanna start watching Game of Thrones?  We've always wanted to watch it from the beginning. Why don't we start tonight. You in brother?"". It took me couple of secs to reply. Firstly,  I have watched every episode of Game of Thrones, some of them twice. And I almost said, can we watch something else please?. But I felt when BIL said that he had kind of a suggestive smile on his face and then of course I remembered Jamie and Cersie (Anyone who haven't somehow watched Game of Thrones, it has a storyline involving incestual relationship between twin brother and sis, Jamie and Cersie). I thought okay, this is probably nothing anyway, but let me just play along. And secondly why the hell BIL is calling me brother? He always calls me by my name.

Anyway sis says, ""Let me go get changed ( She was in jeans, t-shirt). But don't start without me. I'll be back soon"". BIL took the chair, I sat on one the side of the couch. Little later sis emerges, and my jaw dropped. She was wearing a very low cut t-shirt and shorts. Even though she is my sister, I'm not gonna lie, she looked sexy as hell. I've never seen her dress like that in my life. Even at home, before marriage she never was so, let's say ""bold"". (I have managed to find a [similar photo](https://imgur.com/a/iUC2xAf) of what she was wearing from internet, coincidentally the size of the tits on the girl is similar to sis).

She then comes and sits beside me with her feet up on the couch and we start to watch the show. Little later she rests her head on my shoulder. It felt pretty good, cozy. I rested my head top of her head and I had a problem. All I had to do was look down and I could pretty much see most of her tits. She wasn't wearing a bra. And my God, are they gorgeous!! Every few moments invariably my eyes will go down and there they were. I felt a little sensation in my cock.

But the torture didn't end there. Then she proceeded to take my right hand, held it to her chest. Yup, she definitely wasn't wearing a bra. I started to get hard. Fortunately there was a small couch pillow right next to me, so I put it on my lap. She then kind of made a sound of satisfaction and says, ""Feels good, doesn't it? It's so good to have you here kiddo"". (Sis alternatively calls me bro, brother or kiddo and very rarely by my name. Kiddo, when she is being affectionate). And kissed me on the cheek. I also gave her a kiss top of her head and said, ""Yeah, feels good to be here sis"".
Sometimes later the the scene involving Jamie and Cersie in the first episide came up (Again for those who have not seen GOT, there is a scene right towards the end of episode 1, where Jamie is fucking Cersie from behind). I felt sis pressed my hand even tighter to her chest, when that scene was on, ( Might have been my imagination though, because of the whole situation) I was really hard at that point. Thankfully the scene was over soon and so was the episode. 

Sis said she was sleepy and they both said good night. I sat there for a few more minutes, trying to think. But maybe after 5 minutes I just gave up and went to my room. 

They have 3 bedrooms. They gave me one right next to theirs. They said it also has the attached bathroom, which the 3rd bedroom didn't have. My bed is positioned in such a way that, their bed would just be on the other side of the wall. As I was trying to sleep I heard sounds. And yep, they were definitely having sex, and from the sounds of it, pretty passionately too. I could hear muffled moans, mostly of my sister's. I couldn't take it anymore. I went to the bathroom and masturbated. I tried not to think about sis, I really did, but it was impossible not to. 

I won't be able to reply to comments for a little while, because today is the first day of my internship, but I will check back as soon as I'm done.

dy053x,7,2019-11-18,Stalking my account after I made a depressing comment about my student debt? Read this about my career struggles with statistics I have collected.,hippymule,u_hippymule,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_hippymule/comments/dy053x/stalking_my_account_after_i_made_a_depressing/,"I wanted to write this, not as an angry rant, but just as a dump of statistical data I compiled myself. It is to answer any repetitive questions I keep getting asked, and put my exhaustive efforts in perspective. 

I graduated in June of 2018 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Game Design &amp; Production. 

Before you try to lecture me on my major choice, let me just hit you with statistical facts. 

The game industry had a total revenue of 43.8 BILLION dollars in 2018. Several game companies are being traded on the stock market as I type this. 

My major provides skills in Computer Science, Graphic Design, User Experience, Q/A, Project Management, 3D Modeling, Animation, and enough extra skills to fill a CVS receipt. It’s not a degree in “basket weaving”, so politley fuck off. 

After combing through all of my confirmation emails, I have applied to about 463 jobs related to the design and gaming field. I know that number isn’t absolutely perfect due to repeated confirmations, and some places not even sending me email confirmation. 

I have interviewed with 6 places. 2 places were in person. I had 1 job offer for $15 an hour, that I financially couldn’t take, even if I didn’t think it was a total insult to my intelligence. The memes you see about places offering $15 /hr for someone with a bachelor’s degree is true, and I’m a living example of it. 

As I write this, I am 3 thousand dollars behind on my 68k private student loans. 

Let me go on record and say, in hindsight, my financial decision to take out private loans was stupid. It was a very foolish thing to do, and I should not have done it. 

In defense of my clueless 18 year old self back in 2014, I didn’t care, I knew the game industry was worth billions, and I figured I would land a job shortly after college. I mean 43.8 billion dollars has to “trickle down” somewhere, right? Apparently not. 

So let’s attack my resume and portfolio, because obviously I just suck, right? Well to date, I have had 7 major resume revisions, 5 major website updates, and have gotten 8 certifications. On top of which I have 1 graphic design internship, 1 student VR game project – turned studio,  and an international marketing/sales start-up that I’m grateful for having the opportunity to participate in. I have had 3 game industry professionals give me feedback for my resume and portfolio. Two of the three, I could message right now on Twitter or LinkedIn and get a message back within the day. Which makes my situation even more frustrating.

Let me be clear. I am grateful for anyone’s time in helping me improve. I am grateful for even getting to have interviews. However, at a certain point, free critique isn’t worth it. I just need a job, not more advice. It is extremely frustrating, and just makes me seem like a horribly impatient and selfish person. 

I don’t want to get too much into my personal life, but I basically have my mom for support. That is it. My debt has strained our relationship more than I care to admit. It has strained my relationship with my friends. It has really worn my charisma and social battery down. I don’t have the energy for empty smiles and pretending to be happy anymore. 

My father is out of the picture. I don’t have any rich grandparents. Everyone in my family just gets by, and personally, my extended family owes me nothing anyway. That isn’t fair to them, and I would never expect a handout. 

I am politically and emotionally a completely different person after college, and this debt has just cemented a lot of the views I started leaning towards. I have more empathy for struggling people than I ever have before. I have more empathy for working class people than I ever have before. Maybe I was just willfully ignorant in my youth, or my mom did such a great job of making sure things were provided for me, that perhaps I didn’t realize how hard she worked.

I started working at a local university full-time, ironically enough, to get a FREE master’s degree in Software Engineering. I make a pathetic 11.25 an hour that is worthless compared to my student loan payment. 

Speaking of, I can’t refinance my loan unless I am up to date on my payments, and have made consistent payments for a year. I am 3 months behind and only getting further in debt. They won’t let me refinance, but refuse to work with me, so my late fees just keep piling. I am about to spend my last dollars getting a lawyer. So stop asking me about refinancing my loans. I get the question every week, and it’s hair-pulling. 

Something has to be done about student debt, the distribution of wealth, and socialized programs in this country. This country is not even economically close to what it was in the 70s and 80s. I know, because I’ve obsessed over cold war history more than I care to admit haha. Life is economically shit in 2019 for western society.  

I am in total support of vocational programs. I am in support of efficiently spending and lowering taxes on the working class. However, everyone needs to realize how fucked they are getting by the ultra wealthy. Trickle down economics is a myth perpetuated to hoard wealth. They have perpetuated race and identity issues to distract us from the gross economic disparity in this country. The middle class is hollowed out, and what’s left is the working poor, and ultra rich. Stop fighting over a “burger flipper making 15 dollars an hour.”, because chances are, your dumbass is being underpaid just as much. The system is broken. Stop fighting for billionaires you’ll statistically never meet and never be as wealthy as. Stop. You look like a fool, and your ignorance is contributing to the collapse of western society as we know it. 

Sorry that last part is a bit on the angry rant side, but I am just so fed up. I just need a break, or I need this entire system to break faster, so our generation can fix it properly.

dy0l3w,22,2019-11-18,Earthquakes in Denmark,bagsogarbage,ProgrammerHumor,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/dy0l3w/earthquakes_in_denmark/,"The small Danish neighborhood of Sig, nestled in the bucolic surroundings of southern Denmark, found itself unexpectedly and unpleasantly disturbed by a series of strange earthquakes. Starting as mild tremors that barely caused ripples in a glass of water, they soon progressed to rollicking bucks and bounces that set all the crockery rattling in the cupboards and dust to rain down from the ceiling. 

Almost immediately, an emergency council was convened to determine the most expedient way to deal with this crisis, and a team of expert seismologists was flown in from Caltech. They were led by the eminent Lucy Jones, who was just about to put the finishing touches on her hybrid earthquake simulator/martini maker when the summons arrived. Further research on the effects inebriation has on one's ability to stand upright in a 7.8 magnitude quake would have to be postponed, concluded Dr. Jones, when weighed against the lives of an entire town of people, and she and a crack squad of graduate students and postdocs jumped on the next flight to Copenhagen.

What they found there was astonishing and perplexing. Though they were thousands of miles away from the nearest fault line, the seismologists found that the region of Sig was now a local hotbed of seismic activity, and nowhere else in the rest of northern Europe, not even in the rest of Denmark itself, was any similar phenomenon being observed. Whatever was happening was affecting this place and this place alone, and it was quickly becoming apparent that a more thorough investigation was required. Their seismographs were indicating that the epicenter of all of these earthquakes was located at the top of a small grassy hill on the outskirts of Sig. Using an advanced ground-penetrating radar, graciously donated by the IDS Corporation in Italy, the seismologists discovered that right beneath it was what was essentially a natural mineshaft. It started in a subterranean cave approximately a quarter mile beneath the surface and descended to a point outside of the radar's operational range. It was quite possible that it could have even descended all the way into the mantle.

What was causing the quakes, they conjectured, was large pieces of rock falling from the cave ceiling and falling down the mineshaft. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that, as they tracked the size of the cave over time, they noticed that its volume increased whenever there was a new quake. Large volume changes corresponded to more violent shakes, and smaller volume changes were accompanied by equally smaller tremors.

The researches now found themselves come to a somewhat ignoble conclusion. For while they now determined the most probable cause of these earthquakes, there was little that could be done about them. This cave was entirely contained underground, under a thick sheet of hard granite. Any attempt to drill into it to try to plug up the mineshaft or reinforce the ceiling would be plagued with myriad negative consequences: the enormous difficulty and expense required to drill through such a distance of such hard material, the additional seismic activity that would be induced by such an operation, etc. It was ultimately decided that the best thing to do would be to gain a better ability to predict when quakes would happen and thus prepare accordingly.

Many techniques were proposed, tested, and ultimately rejected before an unusual solution distinguished itself from the rest. On the western bank of the Valke river was a retired farmer named Hans Knudsen, who lived with his wife Helge and an old German longhaired pointer named Frans. Whenever Hans and Frans took their evening walks, Hans would notice that Frans sometimes acted strangely. Without warning, he would suddenly swivel in his tracks, gazing at some point in the horizon and growling with his hackles raised. He would hold this position for about five seconds before then snapping back to whatever he was doing before, as if absolutely nothing had happened. This happened about five times before Hans noticed an incredible pattern: about exactly an hour after every episode, an earthquake would then hit the town, and when he pulled up a map and traced out Frans' sightline, he discovered that it was always towards that small grassy hill from which all of these quakes emanated. 

His findings, when presented to the scientists, were initially met with skepticism. After all, anecdotes of animals behaving strangely before earthquakes abound, but none of them are able to pass scientific muster. What else could this be but yet another one of these incredible stories? They politely but firmly rebuffed him, only to have to deal with him yet again the next day. It was only after the fifth day of him barging into their field office exclaiming ""He did it again! He did it again!"" that they decided to humor him, just a little, if only to finally get him off of their backs once they refuted his claims right to his face. Imagine their surprise, then, when time after time, Frans would perfectly predict when the earthquakes would happen. The scientists, being scientists, ran test after test to figure out what could possibly be the correlation between this dog and the earthquakes, but nothing conclusive ever came out of them. What they did discover, however, became incredibly useful for their particular problem:

* This ability was not unique to Frans. Indeed, it seemed that almost every dog possessed the capability to predict these earthquakes. However, it was determined that certain breeds were more capable than others, chief among which was the one that Frans himself belonged to: the German longhaired pointer.
* The earthquakes would happen almost exactly an hour after each episode. 59 minutes and 59 seconds, to be exact
* The dogs would only have these episodes if they were outside and had a direct line of sight to the grassy hill. Both conditions needed to be met for this to work. If, for example, the dog were in a house that had a window facing the hill, or was outside but had its view blocked by a tree, the dog would not have this reaction and thus would be unable to predict the next quake.

Acting upon this information, the town council moved swiftly to purchase a small pack of GLPs and built a large enclosure for them at the base of the epicenter hill. From then on, the town knew when exactly the next quake would hit and could react effectively against it, and thus life returned somewhat to normal. Some things were lost; the World Championship Series of Dominoes changed its venue to Rio de Janeiro at the last minute, and the Souffle Shoppe soon went out of business. But the local Jello factory saw a surge in production, and the Slinky industry, which was suffering a slow and painful descent into obsolescence, roared back to life. Even Dr. Jones was able to complete the research that she had abandoned in Pasadena with the cheerful aid of the locals. 

They did eventually encounter an operational snag with the dogs, however. The rainy months of September through November would leave their long, shaggy coats thoroughly soaked with water. This, combined with the cooler temperatures and reduced daylight hours, made for a perfect recipe for a local epidemic of kennel cough, and the town vet was quickly overwhelmed by a pack of sniffly, stinky and thoroughly miserable dogs. The hearts of the townspeople were kindled within them, for after all, these dogs were local heroes, and another council was quickly convened to see what could be done to prevent such a thing from happening again. A tent wouldn't work because even though it would keep the rain off of the dogs, it didn't change the fact that they were still exposed to the elements come wintertime. What would have made the most sense would have been an open frame shed with banks of space heaters mounted on the roof, but as it so often goes with these committee-derived solutions, a much more complicated, expensive, and onerous idea was proposed and approved. Its proponents dubbed it the **Canine Heater and Airer Device**, and it was essentially something like a giant hair dryer that used a large, engine-powered fan to blow a constant current of heated air through the enclosure that the dogs were kept in. Who knows what collective madness drove the townspeople to agree to pay for such a thing? Perhaps it was their passion to help their suffering canine friends overruled their better judgment, or the presence of a strange, sunglass-wearing, thick-mustachioed man with an unusually strong interest in turbines and turbine-related technology that led them to this point.

Whatever the cause was, however, matters not because the result was lamentably predictable. The project quickly ran far behind schedule and over budget. Problems were legion. The engineers contracted to design the system were hired out of the UK, who insisted on using the Imperial system of units, even though parts were to be sourced from the rest of the EU and assembled in Denmark. The purchasing team was afflicted by a batch of laptops with sticky 0 keys, which often led to them order 10 or even 100 times more stuff than they originally intended. With the deadline looming ever closer, more and more corners were being cut. The engine that was supposed to drive the fan, originally supposed to be a robust, 12-cylinder diesel engine with a sophisticated emissions control system was replaced by an asthmatic 6-cylinder yanked from a rusty tractor with a filter taped on the exhaust manifold. The fan was also poorly balanced, so when it started up (almost always while belching clouds of foul black smoke), it would shake so violently at low RPMs that it would terrify the dogs nearly half to death by the racket it made. And the software that controlled the whole thing was written by a poor college freshman working an unpaid internship, who put it together using nothing but a plain text editor and a raft of YouTube tutorials.

Wonder of wonders, the project finished before the first snow started falling that winter, and the keys to the **Canine Heater and Airer Device** were handed over to the mayor, who gingerly fired it up. A small crowd had gathered to witness this event, and there was even a brass band present.

There was a rattle, a bang, and in a noxious haze of fumes, the machine roared to life. A gentle warm breeze blew throughout the enclosure, and the dogs seemed to be enjoying themselves despite the deafening roar of the engine just a few meters away. The band struck up a tune that couldn't be heard, and the mayor thought he saw a round of polite, tepid applause, but he couldn't be sure about it.

Suddenly, the noise coming from the engine changed; the revs were changing wildly, screaming all the way up to 10,000 RPM before dropping down to a wobbly 500 RPM, and it ping-ponged between these two speeds with rapidly-increasing frequency. There were screams, and people began running for their lives. The dogs, in a frenzy, leaped the walls of their enclosure and escaped into the surrounding countryside, tails between their legs. 

WOOOOSH! A huge gout of flame erupted from the exhaust and torched the grass a hundred feet away.

KRACKAKRACKAKRACKAKRACKA! The fan shredded itself into a shimmering cloud of shrapnel.

KABOOOM! The engine split into two pieces, and the head sailed away and out of sight.

But then, an even more terrifying noise:

KRUNCH!!!!!! A large crack appeared in the ground, where the engine used to be, and it was rapidly growing bigger and heading straight for the town! 

KRRRUNCH!!!! Down the hill it raced! 

KRRRRRUUUNCH!!!! Closer and closer to the town it comes!

KRRRRRUUUUNCH!!! It seems to be heading straight for the Jello factory!

KRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!! Think of all of the lost livelihoods! That factory is the solid foundation on which the local economy is built!

**KRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNCCCCHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!**

....

...

...

And as suddenly as it started, it stopped. The scene, as it now is: there was a large crack running from the grassy hill and ending mere feet away from the Jello factory. The enclosure, where the GLPs used to stand vigil against the earthquakes, was now empty. Where the **Canine Heater and Airer Device** once stood was now a smoking crater. The only thing left intact was the control box containing the central computer and other various electronics. Post-mortem analysis of the code revealed that what caused the wild swings in engine revolutions was due to a dangling pointer that represented a timer value. Whenever it was incremented, it was actually writing to a location that was being used to represent engine RPMs. 

The headlines the next day laid bare all of the facts:

I'm a university student, looking for a part-time job to not only help my grandparents with putting me through university but also, to make my CV stand out for future internship applications\~

That is why I reach out to your kennel! I understand that your last female dog has passed away recently. ㅠ.ㅠ

It must be such devastating news for the male dogs!  —  I've spent long and hard thinking about how I could contribute to your kennel and while doing so, on a western message board, I received the recommendation, that I could try replacing the bitch you've lost, so that your mutts neither suffer from a reduction in fertility nor increased aggression.

I think that is very important for a breeding kennel, no? Considering how important both of these are to the pedigree of a renown kennel.  —  The men were so friendly in recommending me how to best help, and they even voiced that, in their opinion, a cute Korean girl would be for sure  liked by all the big dogs!

Therefore,  I was thinking, maybe I could wear my old school uniform and let them dry-hump on me. Many of my panties are very soft and hopefully shouldn't cause pain to the dogs.\~

When I was young I often roamed around on all four and went \*wang!\* \*wang!\*. I think I can be a convincing dog for them and I would like to contribute to your great kennel and help you make this amazing breed more popular in Korea!

Please consider hiring me, I will try my best to become an asset to your kennel and earn myself a letter of recommendation for my CV.\~

yours respectfully,

Tldr, I want to become more independent - what can I do?

For some context, I live in Singapore; this post revolves around my almost 6-year long relationship with my boyfriend (23M). In retrospect, my relationship (especially initially) may have been slightly dysfunctional, but I currently want nothing more than to have this work out (to marriage, if possible).

To start, I'm completely and utterly in love with my boyfriend. It wasn't always like this - back in the first year of his National Service (all Singaporean men have to go through 2 years of conscription) I was so dejected that he couldn't spend much time with me, so much so that I wanted to end the relationship. My friends encouraged me to end it - I didn't because I couldn't stand having my first love sputter out like this. I had met him in Junior College and within a span of 2 weeks got into my first relationship (we were both 17 at the time). I agreed because i loved his sensitivity and intelligence; to be honest, my first impressions of him weren't great: he was too overly-enamoured of his body (he competed in some amateur bodybuilding competitions) - too arrogant for my tastes, and he wasn't even that handsome. But then he started talking to me about philosophy and music (at that point I had already seen him perform the violin at an inter-school comp) and I would be lying if I wasn't a little bit attracted at that point. He asked me out just before the 'A' level examinations and I agreed.

The first months of our first relationship was slightly awkward. He was always a little too domineering and a little too caught up over always having his way. In the first half-year, he NEVER ONCE listened to what I had to say. He was always so sure that he was right (and I kind of hated that he was mostly always right; more like I couldn't point to a time that he was sure of something and he was wrong). The next 6 months of our relationship (when he was conscripted) was lonely and (as I mentioned earlier) I almost ended the relationship.

I think that the real turning point arrived after he came back from his Jungle Warfare training (its a month-long course in Brunei where I had almost zero contact with him). Suddenly he was so intense and passionate and even more domineering. I had been so lonely (i never really had many friends) that I was honestly happy (though still not totally reconciled with his personality). Then one day, he paid for us to stay at a hotel - he wanted us to lose our virginity to each other; I told him I wanted to wait until marriage, but he basically dismissed my concerns - saying he needed some way to ""train"" our sexual compatibility. So we did the deed.

I remember that I felt slightly guilty, but I couldn't resist him. From then on he spent more time with me; but he started to treat me roughly. He was always so caustic and so sarcastic, and he even told me TO MY FACE that he sometimes became aroused at seeing my cry. And the weird thing is, I started to WANT this, to WANT the denigrations and verbal abuse he threw during our sessions. I only ever told one other friend about this (obviously she told me its a FUCKING RED FLAG and our relationship could turn out abusive), but I never seriously considered ending our relationship from that point on.

Fast-forward to university. Along the way he learnt some temperance (he was quite often disciplined in the Army for being borderline insubordinate) and stopped making caustic remarks about me taking an extra year to complete my pre-university education or treating me as though I was somehow beneath him. He also started to take some of my problems seriously (like my inability to make friends).

I should have been happy, but I was honestly a little scared that he just started to achieve so much. Let me explain: he entered the Law Faculty and started winning prizes at international moots and topping his cohort. He only started to become more sure of his intelligence, and rougher and rougher in bed - I loved this, but I was suspicious that in our daily interaction he was now so responsive to my concerns and so willing to talk at length about the insecurities I felt.

I hate that he speaks with his female university friends. In one of the international competitions he participated in, he was with a female peer for a whole week in Japan and it fucking drove me crazy. He told me he didn't like her and that she was ""a whore"", and even invited me to one of their group meetings - but I hate that he's so sarcastic and caustic towards her, just the same way he had been with me only 2 yrs prior. But then, I wouldn't want him to be sensitive and caring either - I just don't want him talking to her.

But of course he wouldn't pull out of the group. I just feel so insecure, struggling academically with my own grades in university, and him being in such close proximity with one of the top scorers in his grade.

I've tried to have a heart-to-heart with him, but he's just too busy working like a maniac. He has told me some of his, shall we say ""ambitions"" (or maybe 'delusions'): that he wants to become a billionaire, or at least so rich that he could ""buy the solution to all my problems"". He works every hour at trading, at writing legal articles, at planning his company. Recently, he bought an apartment for both of us (with his and his cousin's money - he comes from a relatively well-off family, and his dad is a member of parliament), and has commissioned a lawyer to draw up a prenuptial. I'm willing to agree to anything, but recently he's stopped talking about the prenup - he hasn't brought it up for 2 months. I think he's having second thoughts about marriage.

I know I've been in a daze for awhile, and I've decided to change. I want to become more independent. I want him to want me more than just some woman. I want to feel wanted by him. Where can I start?

Edit: I do know that that's how people would see it - but maybe I can take this chance to clarify: I really do want to live with him forever. These past 2 years, he has really changed into a better person. But this does seem like an excuse unless I give real instances when he has made me feel as though he loves me:

He listens to me even if I go on for 1-2 hours about my insecurities. He really does listen. If we are not together, he writes long messages to help me through my problems (things like not getting along with the boss at my internship, not being able to get along with project groupmates etc etc). If we are together, he analyses the situation in excruciating detail and suggests to me what I could do.

While initially he never actually told me he loved me, he has said this five times in the past year, and always at the end of a date he planned really nicely for me.

If I tell him I really need something, he gets it for me with his own money. He rarely tries to convince me that I don't need it, and he does this even if I sometimes can be frivolous.

He cooks for me (his grandmother's recipe), and I think not many men out there would do it if they did not feel anything.

Perhaps this may better contextualise the discussion. I understand I haven't put the whole relationship dynamic down, but this is what I feel."

I’m applying to Miami Ad School Buenos Aires's Art Direction program. I just finished high school (last week), and thought about applying to MAS’s program, because of the study abroad opportunities.

Is the program worth it? I know that the most important part of it are the connections they have, and the contacts that I would end up with after completing the program.

Is having a Bachelor’s degree really necessary to land a good job? Or is an MAS course enough? Is it easy to find Junior Art Director positions?

Is there something that I could do during apart from this course to improve my portfolio or my education?

If I end up studying there, what cities would you recommend me to do the agency labs (internships) at? I can choose up to 3. 

Thanks y’all!"

Which contains of using Illustrator a lot, but also photo and video editing. Since I'm currently working on a 1080p gaming monitor, which doesn't have good colour accuracy at all, I've been looking into buying a new monitor to enhance the quality of my designs. 

I have come across a few options. The first being a ultrawide, which I think is good because you can use multiple programs side by side and having a lot of space in for example Illustrator. The second is a widescreen 4k monitor, which has a better resolution and colour accuracy. The third being a budget option, just any IPS monitor with better colour accuracy and maybe a better resolution (1440p). 

What do you recommend? Is it worth investing in an expensive monitor for graphic design?

Thanks in advance!"
dy424z,144,2019-11-18,How Studying for the SAT changed my entire life,Trenblack,Sat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/dy424z/how_studying_for_the_sat_changed_my_entire_life/,"No seriously, it did.

My entire life I hated school. I would cry on the last day on summer break every single year as a kid because of how much I did not want to go back to school.

Anyway, fast forward to 11th grade. There was one thing I wanted - to get the fuck away from home. I come from Indian parents that would always restrict what I wanted to do. I hated living at home and desperately wanted to leave. I looked around for options to leave but we were not rich so I needed to find something very affordable.

In the end, I came across one option that I liked - ASU with the presidential scholarship.

However, there was one problem.. I needed a 1400 on my SAT to get the scholarship. My PSAT score was 990 (500R, 490M).

Bringing my score up from a 990 was probably the hardest I have ever worked in my entire life at that point. I was a stranger to hard work. I was a lazy piece of shit. I was unambitious and played League Of Legend 8-10 hours a day.

But how badly I wanted to leave home was enough to inspire me to quit all video and dedicate my time to the SAT.

I ended up scoring a 1470(670R, 800M). I don’t want to bore you with the details of how I brought my score up, but if you’re interested, [I made a video on scoring a perfect 800 on the math here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgHxNf7gVe8)

But anyway, I got the scholarship and am currently attending ASU. So it ends there right? NOPE.

I was not good at math by any means, but it turns out that studying for the SAT MATH ended up making me actually good at math. I am majoring in Computer Science, and I probably would have failed Calc 1 and 2 if not for my sat math studying. It seriously gave me an amazing foundation on algebra 2.

It changed the way I think. I’m good at math now. Even learning new material, it just clicks for me now in a way that It never has before. Brazy.

Second of all, It introduced me to the art of getting good at something. Studying for the SAT kinda sucks.. But guess what, it never ends. If you’re ambitious, you will always be wanting to get better at something.

For me right now, that’s Leetcode. If you don’t know, computer science majors that intern at places like Google or Facebook earn $8k+ per month while IN college. The way to get these internships is be good at these coding puzzle things you find on Leetcode. Studying for this shit is EXACTLY the same as studying for the SAT. Seriously, It does not end.

If I did not study for the SAT, I would never have been willing to study for Leetcode. My entire fucking life is changed due to that 1 decision to ham my SAT.

Bit of a rant. Maybe this will motivate you guys to feel like you are not wasting your time. Goodluck my dears"

I'm currently planning to switch my laptop over to a macbook pro (currently on a surface pro 4, good for writing notes but I type and code more nowadays and I prefer macos for coding). I'm planning to need it by next May at the latest, but I'm not sure what Apple's typical schedule is like for announcing refreshes.

My use case would be as a laptop for school but also a primary machine (I'm going to be away from my desktop at home for two separate 3-month internships next year, and I don't really know if I want to buy an external monitor twice just to get rid of it after 3 months). 

I mostly do programming, music production and light gaming (league, maybe will pick up rocket league).

I do carry my laptop and work in coffee shops and stuff like that sometimes, so portability is concern but everything else I've mentioned is important as well. Also, the 16 inch has the new keyboard which is really nice to me, but I can live with the butterfly design too.

Is the 16 substantially bigger than the old 15? Should I consider a refurb 15 inch for just a little bit smaller size?

My coworker is in his 40s or 50s and has been with the company since he was in his 20s. 

He's been borderline creepy to me a few times, like asking about my dating life which I shut down with ""none of your business"" and also, one time after I'd been in a car accident on my way to work, and was complaining my neck hurt, he put his hands on the side of my neck like ""hurts here?"" and I shoved him off and left work early to go to urgent care to get it checked out.

A few other times he's made sketchy comments like saying how much meeting me has given him different perspective on life, to which I was like ""what the fuck man, that's weird, don't say that to me"" after which he seemed to backtrack and say I'd taught him stuff about looking at software with a different perspective because if my different educational background ...?

So anyway last week, I finally snapped at him when he tried to follow me to the cafeteria when I would of rather ate alone, and said ""Don't you go saying anything weird to me anymore, don't say a thing to me that you wouldn't say in front of (Boss's name) and (HR rep's name). I don't want to hear it and I don't figure they'd wanna be hearing that shit either.""

And ever since then, he's been passive aggressive about it. Like I asked him why a project contract was done the way it was, and he was like ""oh oh nooooo I wouldn't say that in front of the boss so I won't say anything"" and I went ""what man? This is about work, just answer the question. What the hell is going on with this contract"" 

Then he said it was involving outsourcing and he didn't wanna say it because he wouldn't talk about outsourcing in front of the boss. 

I figure he knows that's not what I meant, and he's trying to be passive aggressive.

AITA for drawing such a hard line in the sand, and pissing off my coworker?

-------

ETA - Since a lot of comments are mentioning actually going to HR

I'm a little worried about going to HR because there was another woman at my job who started at the same time as me, she went to HR about an intern being inappropriate with her (the intern happened to be a managers son but she didn't know) and she was let go for ""poor performance"" at her 6 month review. Which she and I suspected was bullshit because she was working real hard.

Anyway I'm worried the company just protects their management and their ""lifers"" and my job would be at risk.

I know another coworker (who has never given me problems but has a pretty abrasive personality) has had over 5 HR complaints against him and he still has his job, likely because he's been there for life and gets stuff done

I'd honestly only be okay with going to HR if I've got another job offer lined up already. And I'm working on that."

________

I consider myself to be a lucky man. For most of my life, nothing out of the ordinary has happened. 
Living carefree, being able to pursue my dreams, and even meeting someone I loved; I can’t say that my life has been devoid of happy memories. 

It is therefore I suppose unsurprising for me to discover that the young man who shared a name with me was but the polar opposite.

This Jeremiah was troubled, his short time in this life plagued by one problem after another. 

As my host John contacted his own medical staff, he regaled me with details of my doppelgänger’s tenure there at the school. They were exciting if not often immersed in tragedy and depression. 

It seemed that one thing we shared in common was our interest in the dark arts. 

It seemed that research had centered around one ancient book in particular called *The Lazarus Record* which according to John was written in such an ancient tongue that not even the most well equipped Capronian scholars could decipher it. 

“Where is this record now?” I asked as I was settled into an examination chair. 

“Under lock and key I’m afraid. You see my dear Jeremiah, the fact of the matter is that those who have read that ancient spellbook and actually understood it… well they’ve gone mad. Gouging their eyes out, cutting off their tongues and frying them, evisceration… it’s been quite grisly to see. We have deemed it too dangerous for anyone actually hold onto,” he explained as the attending physician arrived. 

Doctor Henri Wood looked as though he had seen such abominations first hand, his features resembling a spirit more than a man. I soon came to find that was truly an understatement as the two colleagues set up the medical equipment and prattled on about matters relating to occultism as though it were an ordinary conversation. 

“The cultists have begun stirring. Ever since the incident near the graveyard… do you suspect that this is connected?” Henri asked as he started at IV on me. 

“Of that I have no doubt, we are seeing the results of what happens when mortals stand up against gods; Doctor Wood. And young Jeremiah here is going to confirm it once and for all. There can be no more doubt,” John responded. 

“If I may be so bold as to ask, what do you hope for these tests to determine?” I asked. I felt a little foolish for not inquiring about such things before the examination began, but John only smiled reassuringly. “If all goes well? Then I hope it shows the world that our dreams were not in vain,” he responded. A few attending students proceeded to strap down my ankles and wrists before I could object. Then Doctor Wood prepared a syringe, a dark glowing substance swirling about in the vial as he tapped it. 

“I can see you are frightened, Jeremiah. Relax your senses. Let it all sink in. Don’t run from the fear, embrace it,” John told me. 

I held my breath as the needle pricked my skin, watching the strange goo enter my blood. I was helpless to fight it. Part of me *didn’t* want to. Somewhere my inner voice screamed I should find. It sounded like Jasmine. But I ignored it. All that mattered was answers. 

For a short moment the two learned men watched monitors to see the black slimy medicine work its way through my body, until at last it hit my central nervous system. 

Then I felt my body go completely numb and the room began to spin. Voices now sounded like distant echoes, colors and shapes cascaded in and out of view and I felt a cold sweat ripple through me. The world was going black. I don’t know for sure if this is what a near death experience might be considered, but I think it’s as close as I can get to the sensation of leaving my body. 

Eventually all of my senses went numb. I was unaware of my body the way a dreamer might be, wandering the ethereal nothing and waiting for a call from whoever or whatever was guiding me. Then, just as swiftly as it occurred, the experience came crashing down and I was rushed back into the consciousness I was familiar with. 

Opening my eyes I stumbled forward and grabbed the man in front of me, gasping for breath. 

“My god. What was that?” I mumbled, it felt like I was learning to talk for the first time. 

As my eyes adjusted to the room, I realized I was no longer amongst familiars. 

The teacher that had grabbed ahold of me wore the face of a stranger and he shoved me away suspiciously before remarking, “Who are you? How did you get here? What sort of devil’s work is this?” 

Finally the room came into focus. I recognized I was still standing in the Rossetti University but it was not the crypt I was familiar with. This college appeared to be in its prime, and the scholar standing in front of me were wearing traditional fabrics from colonial times.  

“I don’t think you would believe me were I to tell you,” I managed to say as I rushed to a nearby window and looked toward the courtyard. The rest of the university also showed excellent splendor. It was still doubtlessly the same place, but from the throng of others mulling about the eastern courtyard, building barriers and molding stones; it was clear I had somehow transferred to a different time. 

“I will ask you once more, spirit. Who are you and where do you come from?” the man who I had stumbled into asked. He drew a shotgun that resembled a Confederate pistol. 

“My name is Jeremiah Ward… I know this is going to sound strange… but I come from what you might call the future,” I told him.  A ripple of strange energy flocculated behind the stranger as he holstered the gun. 

“The future? Do you think me daft boy? You’re clearly a poacher of some type,” he growled. 

The energy shimmered greater as I shivered and shook, wishing I could get this ancient colonist to believe me. 

“Tell me your name! I am a student of history! I can tell you something about yourself that hasn’t occurred yet!” I challenged him. 

“I won’t be fooled by your tricks demon. We traveled far to escape the bonds of society. We have no interest in the past. Only forging our own history,” he declared. 

I opened my mouth to object when I saw the strange shimmer move, warping the stone and mortar beneath the scholar. 

The man noticed it too and looked toward the bizarre distortion in concern. 

“Is this your work demon?” the man asked. Suddenly from the depths of the strange energy, a form appeared. It was neither man nor woman, nor even a beast of the field. It looked beyond comprehension, long tendrils of energy swirling about us as I grabbed the strangers hand and ran toward the door. I didn’t know what was happening, but I could afford for him to be killed by this force. 

The other direction was soon blocked off by another shadowy monster, emerging from the corners of the building as it ripped apart reality itself. There was a high pitched whistle as it did so I gripped his hand firmly, wishing I could determine a way out of this for both of us. But it was too late. The swirling dark vortex had grabbed ahold of both of us and in the blink of an eye we were being swallowed whole. 

________


When I awoke, I found myself in the college infirmary with Doctor Wood checking my vitals. 

“Tell VanBuren that Ward has woke up. He’ll want to hear about the walk,” Henri told one of his interns. 

I opened my mouth to ask what had happened but the doctor swiftly raised his finger to his mouth to dissuade any further discussion. “You’ve had a traumatic experience. We had no idea what sort of results the bond might have, but we have never quite seen a reaction like yours. Not since the Sullivans anyway…” 

The doors to the infirmary swung open and surgeons rushed in pushing a stretcher with a trembling form on it. From this angle I could see that the misshapen body belonged to the same man I had met in the distant past. Had I somehow managed to bring him here? How was such magic possible? It looked like the journey had nearly ripped apart his organs the way a shredder might slice through cheese. Yet still he was alive. 

“The surgery was successful. It would seem we have managed to find a viable host. Is this why the others were killed off? To prevent our success?” one of the students whispered. 

“I’m afraid I don’t know, Kent. But we will find out soon enough if we can manage to pinpoint how the process works and make our way to the original incident,” Henri muttered. 

I gathered they were speaking about me and my unprecedented gifts. I didn’t quite know the other details. But it infuriated me to be considered a guinea pig. 

“I’m not any different than any other man! Why are you treating me like some prized specimen?” I snarled. 

“Because you are. Your whole family is,” John said matter of factly as he entered the room. 

“The ancient word for a man like you was Yith, in this day and age it’s become something of a derogatory term… but originally? During the age of discovery? A yith could transition between dimensions and space and time, connecting to cosmic beings beyond our realm with ease,” he said as he checked my vitals. 

“If I hadn’t experienced this entire thing just now I would have called you insane,” I said dryly. 

“Insanity is often genius which is misunderstood. Your family was blessed with this connection because of an incident when the settlers came here. There was… a sacred relic that your ancestors were familiar with. It is our hope that by exploring your gifts to its full potential, we can unlock the secrets of your gift for all men,” he told me excitedly. 

“I’m not so sure such dark magic should be tampered with. Look at what happened to this poor fellow! It nearly killed him! And besides which, hasn’t bringing him here altered the timeline in some fashion?” I said, my voice trembling as I stared across the room at his shaky appendages. It would be a miracle if he survived the night. 

“I recognize your hesitation to pursue this matter further, Jeremiah. After all, many have died to achieve greatness. It is quite likely this is what killed Carter as well. But even despite all these risks she didn’t back down from the goal. Every mistake or setback also reveals another piece of the puzzle. We are at the precipice of a discovery that will alter the very foundation of mankind!” VanBuren insisted. 

I shook my head, uncertain how to respond. I did want more than anything else to understand the gift I was given, the mystery of my lineage I never knew I had. It was all very enticing. 
“But how can we possibly hope to control this when we hardly even understand the process?” I asked. 

“I’ve contacted an expert in the field to assist us in the matter,” John said slapping my shoulder heartedly. 

As though on cue, the doors opened again and a tall trim woman with cropped red hair entered. 

Her heels made a soft clicking noise across the infirmary floor as her green eyes silently judged all the participants in the room before finally focusing on me. 

“You must be the mimic,” she remarked adjusting her glasses. 

“I have a name. It’s Jeremiah Ward,” I told her, not appreciating her attitude. 

“It will be a name long forgotten in the stream of time I’m afraid. But make no mistake, I consider myself equally as invalid in this cosmic game we seem to have found ourselves pawns of,” she answered, extending her hand and introducing herself. 

“Doctor Meredith Parker. I look forward to reaching your full potential.”

My contact at the agency told me someone will email me in a few weeks with the e-Qip registration, but it has been almost a month now...

I emailed my contact asking if everything is flowing correctly, and my POC said yeah just keep waiting a few more weeks for the email that will give you the details to fill out the SF86.

I’m already filling out a PDF form, but I wanted to know how normal it for there to be a gap of almost a month from getting an offer letter to receiving the logins to fill out the SF86? Note, I’m not talking about how long it takes for the clearance process here.

And idk if it matters, but I didn’t receive an offer letter, just that they want me to work for them but first I’d need to pass the clearance before they move further.

Thank you"

My parents who have been neglectful and unsupportive my whole life want to be involved with my graduation and moving me into my housing for my Disney internship + a bit of financial help.

Also something I want to say is that I will be moving out in 2020 with my boyfriend and his friends and idk yet if I'll be going no contact yet. I already am subbed to raisedbynarcissist.

Hi, this is going to be a very very long post and I just feel so conflicted and lost about this situation. Before hand I want to say I am on medication and I am going to be starting therapy next year in May. With this my family has always been super messed up and I was the ""make up"" baby. My dad was cheating on my mom and my mom had me to repair the relationship among other stuff however I was horribly neglected growing up and my parents always denied how horrible it was because they don't want to acknowledge it. Some times my mom will feel guilty however and come to me for me to comfort her about it. I hate it. Sorry for the typos in advance, I am writing this on a phone and am a mess emotionally right now

\---

Anyways, growing up I never got anything. My clothes were my parents and my siblings clothes. Not hand me downs, I would just wear their clothes cause I didn't have my own. My shoes had holes in them; Just the whole nine yards. My siblings on the other hand always had 500$ shoes, multiple cards (one after the other), got to take trips, would commit crimes and my parents would spend thousands on legal fees, and so on and so on. I was always resentful and hurt because of this and would always cry to my mom about why I was ignored and neglected while my siblings got everything. My mom was abused growing up and was also being abused by my dad so she would always tell me ""well this happened to me and I'm fine"" and then go back to ignoring me. When my brother sexually abused me, my mom let it go after 24 hours and my dad told me to get over it and apologize to my brother. I've had to give up my food and so on and so on for my siblings. Any time someone was angry it was taken out on me. My sister is cheating on her husband and angry? She''ll run to my mom and tell her I'm doing drugs and having sex. My mom is being cheated on and upset with her kids? I get screamed at for not cleaning the house sooner. I'm pretty sure since I was the ""easy child"" it was easier to forget about me so they could focus on the others but it always came off as them favoring my siblings. But this could just be me trying to rationalize it.

When I was about 15 everything came to breaking point and I couldn't deal with the abuse and pain anymore and just everything by myself so I attempted suicide. When I was in the hospital my mom screamed at me to that if I wanted to die, I should die then and to burn in hell. My dad left to go to bahamas that night and didn't even visit me. I felt so alone and even writing this makes me upset.

Anyways, later I paid for someone to teach me to drive (family coudn't/didn't want to) and I enrolled in college by myself. I was going to school full time and working full time. During this time my mom got fired cause of my brother and my dad wasn't contributing to bills (he's always been like this super cheap and never wanting to pay bills or rent). I was told that if I paid the bills and everything else, once my father was given his windfall he would pay be back.

Well this led me to going in to debt because I was taking care of an entire household of adults and I was the only one working. It got so bad that this year I had to work out a plan with banks along the lines of bankruptcy. When I started complaining and getting upset, I was told that it was my duty to pay the bills and basically there will be no payout for me. Shortly after my dad bought a house (he just closed) and my parents still continue to ask me for money knowing they completely dried me up and moving out was impossible because I could barely afford to even eat some days.

If I could go back in time, I would have moved out and sought treatment for the depression sooner. Anyways. long story short, I'll be graduating soon and very recently I was accepted by Disney for an internship. I was beyond excited and told my parents. They made it sound stupid and made me feel like I was an idiot. I despite this I asked for help to pay for the housing fee and they said yes but later (which just means no). And I found other ways to get the money to pay it. My mom recently admitted when I told her I was still going was that she thought I decided not to take it.

This leads us to now. My parents all of a sudden want to go down with me and want to give me money (500$) for when I'm down there. They also want to come to my graduation ceremony. I'm not sure if this is cause my dad has cancer or not (very recently diagnosed) but while I am dying for a relationship with them I can't move past all the abuse in the past and the abuse I know will come in the future. I also know that they'll brag and brag about what I accomplished to take credit for what I did even they never helped once.

I feel like I want to try to experience this kind of parental love and I'm desperate financially and the money would be helpful but I feel like I have to do this all alone since I already made it this far with zero help. Additionally, I don't want them holding it over my head but I think maybe in the future I'll regret not letting them be a part of this part of my life. I am in a constant state of regret and guilt.

I know this is a vague question, but honestly, if you were in this situation...would you let them come in your life this one time?"

dy5vrs,5,2019-11-18,Internship Decision,shiktik,AerospaceEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/dy5vrs/internship_decision/,"Hello! I hope you're all doing well. I'm a student in AAE, and I've got a few days left to respond to two offers of internship for the summer of 2020, and I was wondering if you kind folks of Reddit could help me navigate the process of picking a position which would best help me jumpstart my career. 

First position: Raytheon, in Arizona, working on classified work. I think I would enjoy the work here, and I have worked at a different part of Raytheon before. The two key differences between this position and the other one is that it's contingent on me receiving a security clearance, and the second is that it's most likely on the missiles department in the energetics and propulsion area that to me feels like a morally gray area (not a big deal, just something I've noted. The bigger thing is definitely the clearance.)

My other position is for Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems in Utah, at the old Orbital ATK facility. I think I would like this work far more, because it's directly related to space systems propulsion, which I think I want to do long term. However, there's no chance of me receiving a clearance here, although they've expressed interest in a long term career there with me. (I'm assuming this means they would eventually help me with the clearance process if I needed it as a full-time.) 

I'm waiting on a few other offers but these are my main two. I don't want to seem ungrateful by any means, these are both amazing positions, but I just need to respond quickly and am at an impasse. Between the clearance and the work, I'm hesitant to decide on the better position for my career.

Thank you all in advance for your input! Any and all advice is greatly appreciated."

Computer Engineering, as a degree program, is an interesting one. You learn electrical shit, embedded shit, and programming shit, but not enough to actually get a career in any of those things. Honestly I wish I could just go back in time and pursue SWE. I've been looking for positions as a c++ developer because it was one of the few things I learned that I could actually turn into a career. It's November and I have to accept the fact that I have no chance of getting any kind of job. I didn't know enough as a student to get an internship and I don't have enough experience to get an entry level position now. I have a few small projects on my resume and I'm working on one now, but I can't compete with people with several internships who have made entire games from scratch. There is no way for me to construct a career out of my education.

I can't throw out everything I know and start over with a more popular language because that won't get me any hireable experience. I can't got to grad school because that would require putting up with school again. 

How do I deal with being completely unhireable?"

dy6mi6,1,2019-11-18,Me (27m) and friend (25f) are having a secret relationship since 10 years.,ThrowRA-vie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dy6mi6/me_27m_and_friend_25f_are_having_a_secret/,"Hi, first of all thanks for everyone reading through all of this!

The situation is the following, 10 years ago a girl (14f at the time) and me (15m at the time) were in a relationship for about 1.5 years. The relationship ended after she found a new boyfriend with whom she is together since then, so approx. since 9 years. Over the span of all these years she and I met a couple of times, sometimes just because we ran into each other, sometimes because either one of us initiated contact. Everytime we ran into each other (intentional or by accident) the story was pretty much the same, we met a couple of times for coffee or whatever and ended up having sex. Once we had sex we always decided it's best we don't see each other again. This always lastet for some months or a year and then the cycle repeated.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to June 2019, we haven't seen us for two years now, although I certainly thought about her at least on a weekly basis and she tried to contact me a couple of times in these two years, which I ignored, thinking I could finally get over it. She told me she's going to start an internship (6mths. July-&gt;December) in the same company (5000+ employees) I work at. We met for coffee two weeks after she started working there and have been getting coffee together and talking increasingly often. Sometimes 3+ hours without end. In the last two months we practically met everyday for coffee and talked about everything and anything for multiple hours a day, sometimes getting out of office at 8pm because we forgot the time. On one occassion I had to be at home for a delivery and suggested we can meet at my place for coffee as I live close by the office. We again talked about everything and anything, but this time for 6+ hours and even cooked dinner together. Still nothing happenend between us, but sparks were flying all over the place. Even more so than during our coffee talks.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later she had to attend a company event and ended up going for a drink with her colleagues. At 2am she asked if we want to meet each other, we ended up at my place and kissed for the first time. We talked until 6 in the morning about eveything and anything, no sex. Couple days later we both decided we have to talk about what happended as we both are in a relationship. (She's still with her boyfriend from 9 years ago, an I am with my girlfriend since about 1 year). After talking endlessly we decided we both are going to end our relationships and give us a go. Two days later she moved out from their apartement and was going to stay with her parents. Still being not officially separated from her boyfriend. Once I heard she moved out, I ended the relationship with my girlfriend (I won't go into detail, but the reason were 2/3 unrelated to what happenend with this friend)

&amp;#x200B;

About one week after, she moved from her parents to her aunts apartement which is only used in December by her aunt. Simultaineously she officially ended the relationship with her boyfriend. The following week was very hard for her, she had much todo for university and just now slowly realised what actually happend. It's not only that she left her boyfriend, she is leaving half of her friends which came from his side and most importantly, she is leaving her family as her own family is very chaotic and unstable and his family has over the years grown to be her's.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday she went to their apartement to get a couple of things for the next week and ran into her ex-boyfriend. They talked, and he convinced her that he's going to change and that they should get another chance and make their relationship work. He even booked a holiday for them in December. Thing is, indepenedent from us meeting, she already moved out a couple of times over the years to only move back in after a week or so. She says she still loves him and is convinced that he's completely unable to live without her and she has to take care of him. She is just such a loving person and always puts others needs before hers. She is currently still living in her aunts apartement and hasn't moved back in with her boyfriend, I feel she is so incredibly conflicted and doesn't know what to do. One major problem for her is, that nobody, not even her best friend, knows about whats between us and she cannot talk about that at all, just with me but although I try to be as obective as possible, I am by far the optimal person to talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

She also told me she loves me and is so incredibly sorry that she couldn't pull through and give us the chance to be together and be happy together. Because this time it was different and this was our really last chance to be together. She also told me, she's only 75% happy in her relationship but is convinced this is completely normal in a relationship this long. I suggested she goes to the psychologist which helped her some years ago with some other problem, but she doesn't want to because she says the psychologist is just going to convince her that she should end the relationship with her boyfriend. One thing she tried as well, was to toss a coin, not because the result is what matters but what you wish for while the coin is in the air. She said, she wishes she could end the relationship with her boyfriend and give the connection between us a chance. But she says she owe's her boyfriend that they try again because he too helped her in so many difficult situations. My point of view is that If you always try the same things and expect a different result, that's the definition of insanity. I don't know what to do.

I wish, the connection between us could at least get the smallest of chance and not be nipped in the bud right away.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I support her? Obviously I want to be with her but every advice regardless of direction is very welcome. Thank you very much!

Please reddit, give me some advice, I am all out of ideas."
dy78y6,3,2019-11-18,Which one would you choose with 1 year experience? The only person responsible for marketing at an HR consulting company OR Online marketing agency job (executor position),Tillafanni,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/dy78y6/which_one_would_you_choose_with_1_year_experience/,"Hi there! I'm form middle-eastern Europe and I'm a Master student in communication. I also have a Bachelor Degree in Marketing. I would like to work part-time during my studies and I have two options. 

1.) I worked as an HR assistant at an HR consulting company for a few months and now this company offered me a job to be the only person who is responsible for the marketing of the whole company (25 people). I would get the chance to work from home any time, but also work from the office. But I wouldn't be in any of the work groups, so I'd miss all of the work group activities. 

2.) I got an offer from an online marketing agency (around 15 people), where I would be an online marketing executor / assistant / intern / something like that (It's called intern but being an intern in middle-eastern Europe is different from being an intern in America, so basically it's the lowest marketing position at an online marketing agency, but they have multiply interns). This is a full time home-office job, they meet every month to bond, but every communication is managed online (Skype, Slack, email, phone etc.). This only starts at january which would help me study for my exam period during december. 

I am at torn between these two. So I would love you to give me some professional advice about what would be more ideal professionally and also to manage master studies and work. 

A bit about me: I am interested in every aspect of marketing. I have the most experience in online marketing (I worked as an online marketing executor before, also as a full time home office employee), but I'd be more than happy to learn about the other aspects of marketing. I want to learn! I want to be GOOD at marketing. My career goal is to be responsible for the marketing of a small or middle sized company as a marketing director. I am also quite social, I love being in the office right now, but home office is more suitable for a university. 

About the jobs:

1.) Being the only person responsible for marketing at an HR Consulting company.   
PROs:

* It pays a bit better (not much, i would be alright without it)
* I would be able to work in the office but also have the possibility of home office
* I already know the people and I like them
* I would have a lot of responsiblity and I would have a chance to have a really meaningful part of the company. I would have a chance to work with offline marketing too. 

CONs:

* I don't have any experience about being responsible for marketing without a superior to check and manage my work. I could easily mess up and cause lost money for the company. I only have ecperience in online marketing. 
* I wouldn't be in any of the work groups. In the past there were occiasions where I was left out of programs and only heard about them after they happened because I'm not always there because of my university studies. This hurts not to be the part of any groups. 

2.) Online markering executor

PROs:

* I would have a superior who could teach me and help me become a better at marketing
* There is a clear structure and position for me: everybody meets only once and they can't really left me out
* I could get to know to a new place. It's a chance to network and get better connections the the local profesionals. 
* Have a break until january

CONs:

* Worse salary (but the director liked my test task so much that he gave me a better offer then he originally promised)
* Constant home office ( it's better for university). 
* Only online marketing

What do you thing marketing people of Reddit? Which one would be better for me professionally? How could I improve more? Which one gives me a chance to GROW IN MARKETING?

Thank you so much for readin this!"
dy7bsx,3788,2019-11-18,ED wants to put his famly´s kitten to sleep rather than paying 60 euros for treatement,metaaltheanimefan,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/dy7bsx/ed_wants_to_put_his_famlys_kitten_to_sleep_rather/,"so this just happend today

for a bit of context :

im doing a two day internship at a vet its very intresting to see the vets at works. They mostly see cats and dogs , wich were the only animals i saw today. Also we never got to interact with this ED just speak to him on the phone

so now to the story :

this morning two women brought in a kitten that was schedueld to be put to sleep ( aka die ) because of some health problems the owners claimed the kitten had. The vet that i was interning with was supposed to put the young kitty ( 8 weeks ) to sleep. She was very against it and i was sent out of the consult room beacuse this type of stuff is very emotinal for the owners. As i was waiting for them to be done i heard the vet try to save this kitten. In the end she concluded that the kitten needed more examing as she didnt believe putting it to sleep was the right option. The main  symtomp the family claimed  the family claimed this little kitten had wasnt true. They claimed he didnt eat , not true. They claimed he puked after eating, not true. We ended up keeping him at the vet clinic all day and we were going to keep him for 4 days. The vet called the owner ( one of the people who brought him in ) to give her an update and the costs of all the stuff ( the stay and the examinations ). The women said she would debate it with her husband. A couple of hours later the ED calls claiming that the costs were to much for a cat. He told my vet that he would either spend money on this cat or feed his kids. He said that if my vet didnt want to put him to sleep the kitten would go back to the farm with his littermates and see how nature goes . The vet claimed that the kitten had some growth and nutrition problems but that wouldnt get better if he went back to the farm. He then wanted to take the kitten back without the costs. The vet said that he could discuss this with her boss. i dont know how the kitten is now but i hope the kitten is still there tommorrow . Will post update tommorrow

Update : this morning the kitty was there. The vet said that the owners are going to wait to see if the vet can find anything. We noticed that the kitten had some nurological issue as he was moving his back legs very wierd. The vet thinks the owners wouldnt want it anymore if they learn about the leg issue and maybe they will relinquish him. If that happen the vet said she will give him to her brother so she can visit the little guy a lot"
dy7f4j,455,2019-11-18,"Hannah, DWTS and productions lack of admiration.",khaleesibrink,thebachelor,https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/dy7f4j/hannah_dwts_and_productions_lack_of_admiration/,"Disclaimer: The views expressed in the post do not necessarily reflect the views of the poster. 


I have a friend that I worked with for a few year at another Disney owned company now works with DWTS (works is a lose term, he’s a paid intern) and he’s a gossipy fella. I’ve never known him to lie, but he’s definitely gossipy which leads me to believe that he knows a lot, considering he actively seeks outs the drama. He also loves The Bachelor franchise and is a huge fan of Hannah. I trust the source but what he knows is hearsay from around the crew, casting, etc. So I’ll get to spilling. 


Originally DWTS wanted Tyler AND Hannah but after the GiGi news they realized they probably couldn’t have both and were learning toward Tyler as his popularity was soaring. There is no concrete answer as to if Tyler was ever asked to be on the show or if he was even made aware of their interest formally. The main rumor is that Chris Harrison got wind that DWTS casting was leaning towards Tyler over Hannah and he voiced his disapproval, among that and other things I’m not aware of, they chose Hannah. 


I’m not sure if Hannah was ever directly made aware of this information or not, but regardless production wasn’t 100% sold on her from the beginning. So that’s the first sip.


Let’s continue. From the beginning Hannah was pretty “hard to please” and Alan has some issues with her from a choreography standpoint because she was very particular in the way she wanted to look on stage and was said to be more interested in her personal attributes shining than with learning the style and technique of each dance. Which was later called out by CAI and struck a cord between her an Alan as this was feedback he had been giving her but it took a judge telling her publicly to make any difference. 


Also the last tidbit is that when she becomes emotional or upset she seems to have very high expectations of how everyone should react to her feelings and that she ultimately acts like the show and crew revolve around her and her feelings at any given time, and any pressure to continue is met with a full stop by her regardless of how it affects the rest of the cast or timeline, and often uses her time as the Bachelorette to validate those “expectations.” 


All of these combined have pretty much assured production is not her biggest fan, and that is quite obvious if you watch the show at all"
dy7i9h,4,2019-11-18,Re-certifying income for the first time while married / pregnant,pj20,PSLF,https://www.reddit.com/r/PSLF/comments/dy7i9h/recertifying_income_for_the_first_time_while/,"My wife works in the schools and is in her first year of PSLF (PAYE).   She has about $95k in total loan debt.  We got married in February of this year, and are pregnant, expecting in March 2020.  I'm trying to help her with her income recertification, and we have a few questions before we finalize.

1 - When they ask for **family size** and say that any unborn child can be claimed if they are born in the year of certification... she can say 1 correct?  

2 - She is currently paying $0 because when she first certified, it was based on her 2017 W-2 which had very low income since she was an intern.  Now, when she recertifies it will have her much high wage since for most of the year she was at her new, well-paying job (\~90k).  We have never filed jointly as a couple, and she was NOT married for the last year they are checking (2018), **is there any reason for me to give MY income during this process** (I make a decent amount more than her, no loans)?  As far as I understand this would only be relevant in the REPAYE format?  Can they switch her loan type because we say that she is now married?

3 - **Anything else in general we need to be ready for?**  We do expect her payments to be significantly higher than zero, but we don't really know what to expect after this recertification.  I've heard as much as 10% of her income ($900), but some estimators say around $500.  How will the baby factor in?  We just bought a new house so money will be tight.

Thanks!"
dy7rcb,2,2019-11-18,22 y/o first reddit post: day 9,Uppur90,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dy7rcb/22_yo_first_reddit_post_day_9/,"I have been reading posts in this forum for over a year. This is the first time I have ever personally posted and I’m really proud to say it’s been 9 days since my last time smoking weed! I’m 22 years old and the first time I ever got high I was 14 years old. I became an everyday user when I turned 19 and I finally came to the realization that I needed to stop. 

Now I would like to say that I believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with smoking weed if you can use it responsibly, unfortunately that was not the case for me. For 3 years I would smoke at least 2-5 grav bongs a day. As one can assume this began to take its toll on my body and mind, luckily it didn’t stop me from graduating college on time but it definitely hurt my motivation. I skipped the majority of my classes and did the bare minimum to get by. I always wanted to be high and I was happiest when I was fried off my ass, it just seemed to make everything more fun.

I’m currently a full time graduate student who just moved back home with my parents. When I couldn’t find any weed or carts at home I started thinking well maybe now is a good time to stop. 2 days after quitting I interviewed for an internship at a accounting office and actually received a full time job! I was so stoked and it honestly motivated me even more to quit smoking for good.

On day 4 of quitting I played in an intramural soccer game with some of my friends, I quickly realized how much weed has impacted my health as I was gassed on the field within minutes of even playing. My lungs felt heavy and it was very difficult to catch my breath (and this is a men’s beer league). 

The first 5 days were the hardest for me, my stomach pain was unbearable and I was puking / diarrhea everyday non stop with no appetite. After a week I got my appetite back and as of today I feel back to my normal self. 

I’m nervous to find out if I’ll have to take a drug test for my new job, but I’m sure I will have to. I have a couple of friends who are clean so I can use their piss for the test but I’m sad that I can’t walk into a drug test confidently and use my own piss. I’ve been trying to quit on and off for the past year but this time just feels different.

If anyone else is feeling like they can’t handle their use of weed responsibly I recommend quitting earlier than later. I promise you’ll be happier and the Physical results will make you glad you did it. Cheers to everyone fighting the good fight, I’m excited to post more in this community and keep everyone updated!"
dy98vy,8,2019-11-18,Toronto - Part time marketing certificate/UX UI programs recommendation?,Aurora_kra,askTO,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/dy98vy/toronto_part_time_marketing_certificateux_ui/,"I have been working full time for almost a year now and it feels like a dead end.. I have an amazing manager and supportive teammates, good benefits and stable income so I am comfortable financial-wise. The only problem is that I find the work culture to be stifling sometimes due to the nature of a call centre - everyone is on a different, fixed lunch schedule, and after holding a conversation for maybe like a minute or two, everyone has to jump back on a call. I did feel pretty isolated and depressed from time to time working in this position and it has taken a toll on me. 

After being rejected by many entry level marketing positions over the past year do I realize that having marketing diplomas/certificates is a necessity for getting into the field. I only have marketing internships + coops experiences and a Bachelors degree in visual art and sociology from Uoft. And I am looking for a part time (or maybe even full time) certificate program in digital marketing and UX design.  
My question is--given the work environment--would it be best to just quit and go back to school full time? My family is willing to support me while I go back to school, so I will not go in debt. However the transition of going back to being a full time student without a stable income is haunting, I am used to being financially independent so I am not sure if I could get used to relying on my family financially again. But I also think I will be able to focus and dedicate all of my time and attention to the classes without feeling depressed about my current career path at this company and working in this position.   
Second question is which program do you recommend? I am looking at Brain station, Bitmaker assembly, York university continuing studies, and Red academy, and would really appreciate any input from those who have successfully gotten into a marketing or a UX position. I appreciate all your help and input."
dy9s7a,4,2019-11-18,Advice,ThrowawayneCAN,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/dy9s7a/advice/,"Hey everyone!



I’m not sure where to go, but hopefully someone here might be able to help me or guide me as to what I should do as I’m conflicted. 



I’m not really good at intros, so I’ll just give a little background. I’m a 25 year old  from Toronto Canada that has a BConm degree majoring in Accounting,  and I graduated in 2016. Initially I wanted to be a CGA, but as you know they merged all 3 (CGA, CA, and CMA) into 1.  



At first it didn’t bother me and I just thought that I would enroll into the CPA program once I got my foot wet. Unfortunately, I did not get my foot wet and I feel stuck on the outside looking at the pool. 



Now most of you wondering what I did during that almost 3 year period. I’ve been working at a part time job hoping my faithfulness with the company would help me getting an AP/AR associate job. As you can see I did not get the job because of this post. They’re probably looking for someone with experience which I don’t blame them. It should be noted that I had an internship at a digital media company, but I didn’t stay afterwards because they were shady has hell. 



I’m now worried my window has closed be coming I applied to multiple entry level positions and I was only able to get one interview.  Recently I saw my old professor and he remembered me. He asked how I was doing and if I’m working any accounting jobs. I told him that I’m not and that I’m looking. He recommended going back to school to get a certificate in something accounting related. I mentioned something about going back to learn Quickbooks or another software to show I’m still serious about this. 



I’m thinking about doing this, but I’m worried about wasting time and I still cannot get a job after.  Because of the inability to get a job I’m thinking about going to school for coding as that’s something I’m interested in, and loved in HS. 



I really like accounting, and I always thought of being one. I love doing journal entries, creating balance sheets, and dressing like an accountant (cheesy). I feel like because I was too cozy’s my current job I hindered everything. 



I’m not sure if I should still do this, or just save my losses and call it quits.  

Any advice anyone?"

dya55o,7,2019-11-18,Should I transfer from UNT to ACC so that I can go to UT?,IcyHotPineapple,UTAustinAdmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustinAdmissions/comments/dya55o/should_i_transfer_from_unt_to_acc_so_that_i_can/,"Hello, recently I made a post about entering UT under the engineering path. I’m about to end my first semester as a freshmen at UNT under computer science, but overall I don’t really like it here. I do extracurricular, but haven’t really felt a connection with the town or people. 

I was thinking about transferring to ACC in the spring and finishing up all my gen ed for the next year and a half, which would cost less than one semester here. And from there I was thinking I would have a better chance to transfer under the CS program or even discover another engineering path and go to Cockrell, since I’m starting to question my choice as a CS major.

Would it be a worthwhile thing to do? Would it look bad on a transcript? Or is this just a dumb idea... I always wanted to go to UT, and was originally thinking of transferring, but the amount of competitiveness is insane. I see people with supposed nasa internships and 4.0 gpas get rejected, and feel that if I plan on transferring anyways, why gamble another $10k+ when I could go to ACC instead.

Thanks for any advice guys."
dyabsh,1,2019-11-18,Thoughts on Future Application for DOS Internship,fishboywill,foreignservice,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreignservice/comments/dyabsh/thoughts_on_future_application_for_dos_internship/,"I am well aware that the DOS Summer Internships are very competitive in their selection process, but I seem to have wrongly assumed I would be among the more competitive applicants, as I was not selected per USAJOBS.

I was wondering if anyone might be able to provide any form of guidance on how to bolster my application in the future. 

To offer some background on the experience I included in my personal narrative: I have been a congressional intern at the US House of Representatives for the past 7 months, I've learned to speak Spanish fluently (with experience abroad in Colombia), I hold a job as a supervisory EMT, and attend a top 10 public school with a 3.9 GPA in a STEM major. I made my best effort to tailor these experiences to the 13 dimensions, and to my own estimation, I thought I did so well. 

To put it bluntly I am confused what more I could have done, as I thought my background would have put me in a competitive position. I am not sure what kind of initiatives are looked upon more favorably by those reviewing the applications. I applied to embassy Santiago, legislative affairs in D.C., and embassy Vilnius, and thought I could contribute well to each, but perhaps may have been better off in other offices.

If anyone has anything to offer I would appreciate it, and congrats to all who received interviews!"

## Rules

* Stands replace Ability type Quirks, but not Mutation. If Mutation have some special powers (ex. Froppy), they can use it alongside their Stand.
* Likewise, all physical feats not attributed to stands are valid.
* If someone isn't listed, they retain their Quirk Power. All in the verse can see and interact with Stands.
* If you want to, you can replace/add Stand which you consider appropriate, from canon, fanon, LNs.
* Stand users understand how their abilities work as much as they understand their quirks. The more they work out, the more they can improve Stand's stats and abilities. Pro Hero with Stand which might be considered weak in JoJo will likely defeat a newbie with a strong Stand.
* Lethality of any stands and abilities can be toned down to avoid harm during sparring, but requires control.

## Rounds

How will MHA's arcs unravel, provided fate still makes them happen regardless of previous derailment?

* Entrance Exam
* Stand Apprehension Test
* USJ
* Sports Festival
* Battle with Stain
* Exams
* School Trip and Hideout Raid
* Hero License and Internships

Bonus:

* Who gets the biggest buff and the strongest nerf?"
dyanjh,216,2019-11-18,WIBTA for giving my girlfriend a dress meant for me?,[deleted],AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dyanjh/wibta_for_giving_my_girlfriend_a_dress_meant_for/,"My girlfriend and I are both 23 year old women, and the same clothing size. I'm still in touch with my father, who is still not entirely used to me having a girlfriend, but is trying to adjust to it.

Every December, right between Christmas and New Year, his job does this charity fundraiser. It's very formal and usually starts around 6pm, and ends a bit after midnight (usually before 1am). Employees are expected to bring their entire families and all adults are allowed plus ones. Since me and my siblings (2 brothers and a sister) were kids he's always picked out our clothes. I know it sounds weird but there's usually a theme, which can be anything, and it changes every year, and the outfits are expected to be expensive. When we were kids he'd take us out for the day and buy us an outfit each, but as we've grown up and moved out this has been more difficult. Me and my siblings said a few years back that we couldn't afford to spend out on a pricey outfit every year, and didn't have time for a full on family shopping trip, so if he wanted us to come and fit the theme he would have to deal with the clothes. Since then dad has bought us all outfits and sent them to us ahead of time (no checking with us, we confirm our sizes and he orders something online and has it delivered to us, we just have to trust him with it).

Dad has been promoted a few times over the years, the last time being a few months ago, and has gone from an intern level when we were kids to now being roughly 4th in the chain of command. He asked me this year to bring my girlfriend, and I said I would, and he asked me to send both of our sizes so he could get us both outfits (he also does this for my siblings' partners). The delivery came today and he sent me a pantsuit and a dress. I've explained to him in the past that I've sort of moved away from dresses, just because I don't find them very comfortable, and prefer trousers and pantsuits.

Thinking that he sent a pantsuit for this reason I messaged him thanking him for taking that into consideration. He then replied that the pantsuit wasn't for me, it was for my girlfriend. He bought the dress with the intention of me wearing it. According to the receipt the dress is significantly more expensive. I tried it on and it looks nice, but I'm just not comfortable in it. I messaged my siblings and they confirmed that the only theme this year seems to be the colour (dark blue clothing, which dad bought all of us).

My girlfriend has said she is fine wearing either outfit, but I know she prefers dresses to suits. She's met my dad about half a dozen times, and is worried about potentially having a hand in annoying him. While the dress is really nice, it looks better on her, and I would be a lot happier in the pantsuit. However, dad has specifically said that he bought the dress with me in mind and he wants me to wear the dress, and he bought the pantsuit with my girlfriend in mind and wants her to wear that.

WIBTA for giving my girlfriend the dress and wearing the pantsuit?

Info: I can't see my dad getting angry/yelling, but I can see him being potentially disappointed. The turnout for these parties is usually around 150-200 people (but everyone gets a plus one and the venue they rent fits about 400) and the only people who would know me are the people who have worked with dad long enough to remember me and my siblings all coming to these things."
dyb2jq,35,2019-11-18,My first accidental threesome,residentevil789,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/dyb2jq/my_first_accidental_threesome/,"So it was my first time in USA and I had arrived there from Philippines for a work internship that would last a year and boy did I get fuck a lot. My first threesome happened at San Antonio Texas and I was staying in a hotel while looking for a place to stay for the rest of the year. On the last night I become a bit desperate and tried to find something on Grindr and maybe someone could help. 

I found this interesting guy and told me he had a room but I need to be able to take his cock so I foolish me agreed. He then instruct me to take off my clothes and lay on the bed with my ass up ready for him and to leave my door open which I followed. A short while later he arrived. He was a very tall white guy with a large built. Black hair with a trim beared and brown eyes who is in his 40. I greeted him and he bend down to check my ass. Satisfied with what he sees he gave me a slap and starts to undress.

He then instruct me to give him a blow job while showing me his 7 inch cock. Mind you I haven't taken anything as big and thick as American so I'm sure y'all know what's gonna happen to my ass. So I obediently start sucking his cock. Licking up and down his shaft, licking his hairy balls and deep throating it to the point I was gagging, tears swelling up, and his pubes in my nose. 

Unknowingly to me he had use my phone and tried to get more guys to come and also his phone. He even took a photo of me going deep in his cock and shared it to a guy who wanted to join the fun. Once he got one he told me to stop and he went to my ass and tongue fuck me good. It may have been 1-3 minutes of him using his tongue and fingers to open me up but it felt forever for me as he went deep with his tongue making it wet. He knew I wanted it badly but kept stretching me by inserting all 5 fingers to prepare me. 

With my ass wet and slightly stretch out, he slowly went in me. Just the tip at first, teasing my hole and making me moan for him to give it to me. He finally went in deeper. I felt the his cock going in me deep and the feeling of fullness but I was suprise it didn't hurt. I decided to back up to him and started to ride his cock. He liked it and proceed to go faster. Having this need to use me as his cum dump. He pulled out and ordered me to sit on his cock which I obediently followed. Riding his hard thick cock as if my life depended on it. 

After a while of him fucking me and changing position and biting each other, I heard someone entered the room and I panicked. I thought to myself that this wasn't part of the deal. His friend who is a bit shorter than him, some facial hair and clearly Latino and I guess to be in his early 30's. Dropped his pants and took off his short and shoved his 6 inch cock down my throat. I was being spit roasted at this point. Each of them going at it and all of us moaning and grunting. He then had his turn on my ass and began to fuck me mercilessly. 

Fucking me hard and rough doggy style and slapping my ass telling me I was a good boy. He went faster with a need to breed me and slapping me to tighten me ass. All the while I was thinking what the fuck did I end up in. Then Daddy told me to keep sucking him since he was enjoying the view. After a while it become painful and I wanted to stop but they continued. I tried to tighten my ass but it made him go faster as he enjoyed it. Which was a dumb move for me. I then cried on the nearest pillow and he finally came inside me. He then pulled out and collapsed on the other bed and it was Daddy's turn to breed me. And boy did he fuck me even harder. I finally felt his cum leaking and we both collapsed and I was spent. He told me to go shower up and left me with my ass leaking both of their cum and me resting a bit and fell asleep."
dyb64i,1,2019-11-18,My life sucks ass,yungbrokebitch,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dyb64i/my_life_sucks_ass/,"I need to get some shit off my chest, and gonna try not to make this too long. Hopefully someone can relate or offer some advice. 

I’m 22 and I’m technically in college, but not for much longer. The past 5 years have been extremely brutal for me, a whirlwind of depression and confusion.

Coming out of high school (2015), I was already pretty badly addicted to painkillers. Pretty much anything I could get my hands on. I went to a military academy where that was very commonplace for 16-18 year olds unfortunately. I also suffer from trauma from this school due to abuse, multiple friends committing suicide, rampant racism, etc. 

Not to mention, my family had just moved back from a third world country doing long-term humanitarian work because my mother developed cancer. There’s all sorts of other trauma from growing up there that I won’t get into. 

When I started University in 2015 I was a regular user of (weaker) opiates until I started using dilaudid that year which really ramped up my addiction. There was barely a limit with me when it came to drugs. Eventually, after two near death experiences, I forced myself to quit opiates in 2016. 

Having failed some classes, and had just got off painkillers, i made my next year at college worth it. I smoked a lot of marijuana to help with withdrawals from painkillers. Weed has been the only thing that has helped me feel normal since I fucked up my brain with all those pills. And I was passing classes, getting straight A’s in some of my hardest courses. To be fair, I was also using a lot of Ritalin to help me study. 

When 2017 came, I was actually starting to make music that was streaming in the millions, and I started to believe that I would just be a musician. But my dumbass let music come first and school last. I was making good money off my music, but I blew it all on drugs and dumb bullshit. 

I was living on campus, because I was able to use Federal Student Aid to pay for it. But my marijuana use was too much for my suite-mate, who called the cops on me on my 21st bday. It is not legal in my state, but it’s legal 25 min away. He also called the cops on me a second time before I got banned from campus housing. 

I could go into the whole spiel about how the cops were fired after being completely abusive to not just me, but multiple students on campus. But these two cops targeted me multiple times afterwards and it made me very suicidal. 

In 2018, my depression was at its worst. I had just been kicked off campus, and barely found a basement to stay at with my “friend”. I started the semester off by totaling my car and developing a shitty kidney issue which required two surgeries. This made me not leave my room basically all fall-winter. I spent a lot of time writing music and getting gud on Smash. 

Now, my parents think I’m graduating in May. In reality, I wouldn’t be able to graduate for another two years. But it doesn’t matter, I completely stopped going to class this semester. I think I need to drop out and figure out why I’m like this. 

I honestly thought this year would be different, that somehow I would be able to pull my shit together and finish my classes. But in reality, I hate my classes and everything i’m “learning”. I switched my major 3 times and landed on Communications somehow and I hate every internship and job in that field. 

I haven’t been able to keep a job for more than 2 months at a time for the past 6 jobs. I constantly rely on my parents for financial assistance because I’m too depressed to even show up for work. I have been resulting to self-harm to deal with stress, which is something I haven’t done since middle school. My 4 younger siblings are the only reason I haven’t killed myself, I don’t think I could ever do that to them. 

I feel like nothing is even worth it. I’m stuck in a hole in which i’m too deep down to know which way is out. I have to tell my dad next week I’m dropping out, and i’m basically gonna have to tell him all this too. Sometimes, I think I’d rather take my chances blindfolded in traffic than tell him I’ve been wasting his money all these years and just now dropping out. 

tl;dr Fuck life"

_______

""Congratulations! We'd like to extend you an offer for the AMWF summer internship program! Please find your offer letter attached. Reply to this email with your start date and end date and please fill out the relocation form!""

You were ecstatic when you got that email. AMWF was one of the leading technology companies in the cloud computing space. Their position in their space, coupled with their San Francisco high rise office, insane perks (massage room, library) and high pay made their internship program one of the most competitive in the world. And you got in.
______

You got out of the elevator to the 50th floor office of AMWF, ready for your first day. You headed to the receptionist, a pretty blonde lady wearing a tight, revealing dress, and told you who you were.

""Ah, yes! One of the interns!"" she exclaimed, handing you a guest pass and instructing you to head to a meeting room called Cybertron, where your mentor would be meeting you shortly.

On the way, you noticed a few things. One, the office seemed to be composed of two distinct types of people, tall, fit, handsome Asian men and white women dressed in revealing clothes. You wondered who your mentor would be as you sat inside Cybertron, a meeting room with an expansive view of the city's financial district.

_______

A few minutes later, a [pale, blonde woman walked in, clutching a laptop and a coffee cup. She was dressed in a tight skirt, heels, and a black crop top. She looked more like a whore than a professional.](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg) 

""Hi! You must be *your name*!"" she beamed, sitting down next to you at the conference table. 

""I'm Rosie, and I'm going to be your mentor here at AMWF, "" she opened her laptop, typing away for a few seconds before turning her attention to you.

""Since you're my intern, it's my job to make sure you're getting all the support and help you need, "" she giggles, scooching a bit closer to you. You notice she's booked two hours for this meeting room.

""So, first things first, which one of my holes do you want me to service you with first, *daddy*?"" she purred.

_____

Hi! I'm Rosie and I kind of look like [this](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg). I'm looking to play your mentor/cum dump during your internship at AMWF. I like dirty talk, name calling, raceplay (Asian dominance &lt;3), big cocks, lots of cum, impregnation, and cheating.

DM me your name, description and continuation (no dick pics and be aggressive!) and expect to write around 3+ paragraphs per response."

dybjx8,29,2019-11-18,"To all those with severe social anxiety and loneliness.... I FEEL YOUR PAIN, but please read what I have posted. You may thank me for it.",optimisticnihilist__,SBU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/dybjx8/to_all_those_with_severe_social_anxiety_and/,"Every single individual in this campus has his or her own way of coping with the meaninglessness that is life. I happen to deal with the listlessness of life via working out(aerobically and anaerobically), eating nutritiously, drinking all kinds of tea(yes, I am a tea enthusiast), watching anime and playing JRPGS, going out to restaurants in the outskirts of campus(aka China Station) with my closely knit group of friends, and of course, studying for my damned courses. Lately, I've really been turning my life around. I've been working out, eating well, planning to intern at a PT clinic with the help of a relative, and making new friends. I figured that by getting stronger and healthier I could eliminate my social anxiety, and it did. I guess intensive personal physical therapy benefited me in ways that I couldn't even imagine. Listen.... it may be tough and embarrasing at first.. but you must feel the pain and disgust in order to become healthier and stronger both mentally and physically. I thought I could never escape the cycle of despair and anxiety, but it turns out I've found and reached the light.

Working out and having a healthful diet will give you confidence. Trust me. You'd actually feel more comfortable bonding with others in this campus. Body and mind go hand in hand. Achieving Yin and Yang for your body and mind will make you less dependent on any drugs or prescription pills. I really have become an advocate for the Asian/Eastern/Holistic way when it comes to health or medicine.

To be specific, I would recommend:

Anaerobic( every set, take a 3 min break): 3 sets of as many reps as you can do for push ups, pull ups, and planks.... THEN use machines.... I prefer you to start with the chest press, pec fly,and bicep curl. Go on to more advanced machines like rows, rear deltoids, and torsos when you get used to the aforementioned machines

Aerobic:Run for 20 minutes straight at the speed of your choice. When you get used to the speed, increase the speed by .2mph every time. (DO NOT STOP OR GRAB THE HANDLES IN YOUR 20 MIN RUN)

Diet: No Saturated Fats(no red meat or any processed junk food), No Added Sugars(Things like ice cream and candy), High Unsaturated Fats( Tofu, Grilled Chicken, Fish and Seeds), High Protein(Beans and Tofu), High Fiber(Salad that has watercress, tomatoes, carrots, mushrooms, and cucumbers) *ONLY EAT CRAPPY FOODS WHEN YOU HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS... THAT IS IF YOU BECOME MORE CONFIDENT AND LESS ANXIOUS ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS AND BONDING WITH THEM

*TIP FOR DIET: IF YOU CRAVE FOR SUGAR, FREEZE YOUR FRUITS IN YOUR FREEZER. TRUST ME. THEY REALLY DO TASTE LIKE ICE CREAM OR GELATOS.


P.S: This is hard for me to say, especially to those who have never been through  the cycle of despair, anxiety, and depression, but I used to have the mindset of a ......shooter. My message here to those who feel pain is that people are inherently good,even though people may not seem like that. I've  been through rejection/isolation from potential friends(those not wanting to hang out with you because of who you are), and I know what you all are going through. However, you yourself must take steps in accomplishing peace within yourself, and improving yourself. Eating well and working out are the first steps to eliminating most, if not all, of your social anxiety. Thus,you will have broken the cycle of despair. Please.... trust me. I hope my message have convinced you to go through the path of struggle, but it will also be a path that leads to a destination of shining optimism."
dyc2qk,3,2019-11-18,See you on another life my dear Marijuanna!,jobsonribeiro,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dyc2qk/see_you_on_another_life_my_dear_marijuanna/,"Yeah buddy, we've had a happy story, radiant!These last seven years we're really close partners, I would say. I've met you when I was 17, a post-teenage guy full of goals and dreams but kinda disoriented.

The first time I've met you, I couldn't believe how happy and euphoric I was, laughing out loud with my brother and friends. That day you showed me a whole new world MJ. I loved the way you made me feel, but those days I didn't use to smoke you daily. 

I started to get in deeper with you I guess about 6 months after I've met you, going to friends' house in my born city, where we were free to smoke a lot without any of our parents bothering us. Those were rememorable days! I have deep feelings from the friends I've made, me and my brother studied also with them since we were children so basically everyone of our friends' group started smoking together and also all of us used to drinking alcohol too. 

In my 19s, in 2012, I moved to a bigger city to start studying at college. This moving was my freedom and my chaos. After a year being focused in my studies and not smoking you I was able to not have a fog in my brain and could concentrate pretty well. But about a year since I've moved, I started to smoke you daily. Always you, MJ and Nicky (those names are my friendly names to weed and cigarretes). Those days I couldn't realize how slowlly and delightfully you were fucking with my life. I started losing my focus and concentration, all my emotions were becoming numb. I started becaming lazy with my studies and house cleaning, I was basically replacing all my daily routine activities with smoking weed. Instead of going to classes, all I did daily was meeting with new stoners friends I've made here all day and night and not doing much than that. That were my ""endless happinness"" bubble for those last 7 years.

In 2014, I did an internship in Budapest, that was a fantastic experience. But as a fucked up stoner I am, I'd didn't used to go to college's classes there, and my grades were really really bad, all I was doing were not giving a shit about the disciplines and college, all I did also was daily smoking even more powerful weed strains that I couldn't smoke in Brazil. In that year I've met other drugs too like ecstasy, lsd and magic mushrooms, salvia, mdma and cocaine. I couldn't see better life than being really fucking stoned all day and forget about all real life shit and live in that parallel world. 

When I moved back to Brazil, I got depressed, gave up my studies and I was jobless. The money my parents used to give me I would spend most on weed. After getting better from this depression episode, I starded studying again a new degree. But again in my life, I started not going to classes and passing all the day smoking weed with friends in the day, and drinking and taking n-bomes( shitty fake lsd) and snorting cocaine, every nigh a party at the pub.

Now I'm 26, I could still get a job thankfully, still trying to finnish a college degree, unfortunately not the new one I started again in 2016 because I had fucked up grades and had to work and the studies were during the day and also the job I've got. I'm still on a hard battle with weed and cigarretes. I've just spent my rent money with weed and even the money of the groceries, I'm pretty fucked addicted. I'm getting help of a therapist that is helping me a lot and also taking some escitalopram pills by the psychiatris. I feel getting stronger to battle against those addictions. I'm glad I don't drink, cocaine or any drug anymore for around 6 months just MJ and Nicky. After all the shit I passed beco use of you both, I feel now calm and peaceful to break up with you both right now.

Thanks for reading or not.
Wish me luck on this road.

Cheers ;)"

When I accepted my Epic offer for a TS position I thought I would be doing a lot more software development (I assumed when the interviewers referred to working with a customers “build” they meant codebase) and I would be able to work on communication skills at the same time by working with customers. I’ve been at Epic for ~4-5 months now and I’m starting to get worried I’m wasting my time not developing any transferable software dev skills and the longer I wait, the worse off I’ll be at finding a decent dev job. I have a CS minor and internship under my belt, so I don’t want to wait long enough for those to be irrelevant. If anyone has experience with these feelings or has left epic early because of this, I’d really appreciate some advice. Should I stay long enough for my time here to be a valuable resume talking point or look for a new position now?"

I was doing so well until daylight savings happened. It makes me so angry that they just causally decide to fuck with the time as if we don’t have it hard enough already having bipolar.

I’m an instructional assistant for special ed and I love it. I want to get my teaching license through an internship program next year (I live in CA) . Now, in the midst of this mixed episode, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be capable enough to be a teacher.

I got a second job while I was more hypomanic three months ago. The job was as a behavior therapist and it stressed me the fuck out cause I had to pour so much emotional energy into the job. I got little to no supervision but was expected to meet goals for the insurance companies. Once I found out the company was actually for-profit, I was so pissed. It made me hate the job even more, I only wanted to stay for the kids.  I told the company last week that I was having unexpected symptoms. Now, since they actually operate as a mental health service company, I thought they would take my situation more seriously. Instead, they were very curt with me over email and I worked three more shifts, one being six and a half hours long. Well, that messed with my immune system so this morning I wake up with a sore throat, a lot of sneezing and coughing.

I got through my first job, barely. Then my mom started making me feel terrible about myself as if I didn’t feel terrible already. She said that being negative is part of my personality when actually, I’m one of the happiest and optimistic people I know when I’m stable.

She still doesn’t understand that IM NOT FUCKING CHOOSING TO BE THIS WAY!!!!!!! I’m not an idiot, I hate feeling so out of control with my thoughts and moods. It just hurts to hear the words “be positive” from someone you think should understand your disease better 

I was hella triggered so I was thinking some really dark thoughts for a minute there but of course, I stopped myself cause after all, I take my meds and go to therapy and all that shit helps just enough so I don’t off myself in an agitated moment.

I got my energy out by crying on my podcast and now I’m on reddit because then at least I am trying to be more productive with all the rage. 

I hate not being taken seriously. It’s stupid trying to advocate for yourself all the time but people still think they know the disorder better than you do. Like kindly fuck off mom"
dycshy,2,2019-11-18,Broken up with my GF (her: 27F) (me: 24M) - how to get over it,StonedEdge,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dycshy/broken_up_with_my_gf_her_27f_me_24m_how_to_get/,"Hi everyone, hope you're all doing well.

Recently I made the decision to leave my girlfriend for good. To give some background, we started dating 3 years ago and we were in a long distance relationship for 1.5 years.

Essentially, I recently moved to Japan for a new job and one strong incentive for me to come was to be with my girlfriend and start our relationship together, who I had a long distance relationship with for two years. I was very happy back in my home country, friends, family and a very stable job in finance.

We have known each other from December 2016 when I studied here on an exchange program, but I went back home from Japan to finish off my studies after that. We chatted a lot on Skype, became great friends and well, here I am, back in Japan with a full-time position at a great financial firm in Tokyo. I came back here in 2018 for a 6 month internship, spent time with her which was great, and now I am back on a five year visa contract. I have been happy with her in the relationship for quite some time, and she was absolutely over the moon with the fact that I was able to secure a position and put an end to our long distance relationship. All in all, we've spent about 12 months together in person, 24 months apart.

However, here comes the bombshell. My girlfriend is EXTREMELY career focused, actually that would be an understatement. She has an unhealthy obsession with her work - married to it if you will. She told me the other day when we were having a chat about breaking up that she feels she is ""worthless, valueless and the only way to validate herself is to succeed at work"" - I tried to tell her she was beautiful with who she was, she has nothing to prove to me or anyone, I just wanted to enjoy life with her together. She just didn't understand. She was trying to prove herself to the Japanese society that she was something. No matter how many compliments or morale boosting I did or how kind I was, she just didn't change.

She recently has got an offer to go abroad to South East Asia for a year, and she wants to go, heck, I want her to go as well because it would be extremely selfish of me not to let her. I know how important her career means to her, and without her career she literally says she would amount to ""nothing"" as I said above, which I think is pretty sad since I put a lot more emphasis on my hobbies (3D printing, electronic design, CAD etc) and my true friendships than career to get a lot of my happiness (I guess this is where the cultural differences start to come into play...) I guess I try to work extremely hard but I am the kind of person to clock off work at 8pm at the latest despite working in banking. She barely ever comes home before 11:30pm, ever... I like to define myself not only by my career, but by the people and other things I chose to do.

Thanks for reading everyone, any advice is appreciated.I'm really devastated.

Obviously I just want is best for her, and I decided to break up because I was so mentally tired. I couldn't handle the way she treated me anymore, putting her friends and hobbies above me in every situation - whenever I asked her to come over, it was always ""too busy"" - then she'd be with her friends. She'd say she's coming home at 11pm, and it would turn quickly to 11:30pm, then 12:00am, then 1:00am... Obviously I need my manly alone time as any human would, and I get that through my hobbies and spending time with friends. I came to Japan, gave up my friends and family, moved close to her house, I got a great job, I felt I've done all I could. I would've done anything for this girl because that's how I like to treat my partners - being there for them and sacrificing where I can. Just depressing that she would not do the same for me...

TL;DR - just shifted my life to Japan 5 months ago after 2 years of long distance relationship. Girlfriend now wants to leave next month to Indonesia and go for a year abroad for career. Was it the right choice to let her go? Was I being too pushy and aggressive/clingy as a BF? I don't like to be a clingy person, but towards the end I felt like I was dating a ghost. I broke up with her because I knew it was the best for her, I couldn't please her no matter what I tried... sorry for this post, I just wanted to tell someone... it hurts to try so hard only to fail. Feeling pretty lonely, confused and hurt.

To be honest, I'd love to go back to her and try it make it work if she would just change her attitude slightly and put a little bit more effort into the relationship but I knew it was not going to happen."

Recently I made the decision to leave my girlfriend for good. To give some background, we started dating 3 years ago and we were in a long distance relationship for 1.5 years.

Essentially, I recently moved to Japan for a new job and one strong incentive for me to come was to be with my girlfriend and start our relationship together, who I had a long distance relationship with for two years. I was very happy back in my home country, friends, family and a very stable job in finance.

We have known each other from December 2016 when I studied here on an exchange program, but I went back home from Japan to finish off my studies after that. We chatted a lot on Skype, became great friends and well, here I am, back in Japan with a full-time position at a great financial firm in Tokyo. I came back here in 2018 for a 6 month internship, spent time with her which was great, and now I am back on a five year visa contract. I have been happy with her in the relationship for quite some time, and she was absolutely over the moon with the fact that I was able to secure a position and put an end to our long distance relationship. All in all, we've spent about 12 months together in person, 24 months apart.

dydbce,24,2019-11-18,How to get my parents to leave me alone?,saffron25,AskWomenOver30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/dydbce/how_to_get_my_parents_to_leave_me_alone/,"I am a 24 year old who is currently living by her self and supporting myself financially. I am very depressed due to not being able to get a job I actually want and I’m trying to build my life. My parents keep trying to get me to move back home by telling me there are great opportunities but they have been been unemployed for five years.  Our home is in sub-Sahara Africa. 

Their reasoning is,moving home will give me time to think and to be honest I don’t want to live with them because I hated living with them growing up and they have been consistently unreliable.  You see in the last few years I have learnt that my father is a sales man and often says things without conducting any research into how they may actually work in practice.   He over exaggerates career opportunities and is the get rich quick scheme type of man. 


My father called me to scream at me telling me I am not independent because all I do is stay at home all weekend and have no friends and if I was independent I would have friends to hang out with.  No I am not joking he actually said this to me, that is his definition of independent.  I clarified and me paying my own bills doesn’t count.  

Additionally, he suggested that he would be able to get me a job if I moved home for a year and suggested I did a masters degree Online and said he and my mother would pay for it.   When I asked him what job he’d be able to get me he suggested I go and work for an employer which I have mentioned to him several times i hated working for because I was repeated sexually harassed. Honestly, I felt like I was working in the 1950s and I have told my father this ok several occasions but he insists that it’s a great job (it isn’t ), infact my mother actually referred to my reason for hating the place as “‘not a big deal”. 

You see the reason I do not want to move back home even if it is for a year is because I have little faith/trust in my parents. They make outlandish promises and refuse to take accountability when things fall through. For example, after I graduated from university I was meant to move abroad for my masters degree and they informed me that they will be able to fund it. I was able to secure an internship for five months before my masters commenced and it was until about a month or two  before I was meant to move that they decided to tell me they couldn’t afford it.  I also need to add that this internship was at the firm were I was repeatedly sexually harassed. When I informed my parents about my situation at the firm their initial reaction was that I come home and rest before I moved abroad for my masters degree. 

When I mentioned this in the phone call to my father today; he actually said I was lying and I never applied for a masters degree (No I am not making this up).  It was until I pushed back that he finally admitted that this in-fact did happen and say “don’t you think we tried our best to do what we could”.  This type of lying is what I have endured all my life and for the life of me I cannot understand why they do it. 


As I mentioned at the start of my post, I am depressed.  This has been the case for the last three years and I have noticed  that my father appears to care on the surface but truly does not care. I say this because the words he uses when I express my true feelings about the state of things in my life suggest that he would be prefer if I actually lied that I was happy and not sick. Last week, he told me I left him feeling deflated because I shut down his ideas and I was too negative.  I can admit that depression leaves you feeling negative but even in this fog I am under, I am realistic.  His comment was made after I pointed out that tuition is not free in Scotland for English students. 

My parents both have no form of higher education and while they try to help me it is honestly worsens the situation because they simply want me to follow their lead but none of their suggestions are ever helpful. They have no knowledge of professional industry and simply say things for the sake of saying them without conducting research. This annoys me because when I point out why I cannot do something I am told I am being negative ie not being able to afford to move to Scotland for a masters degree because despite what my father may thing it is not free or being told I can pay my taxes when I want and not when they are actually due. 

When he called me with his suggestion that I move back for a year, I initially entertained it but the second I raised questions about his plans for me whilst I was there he got defensive saying I wanted to be spoon fed a plan and life doesn’t work that way.  If the purpose of my moving back is to give me a break and you cannot explain what exactly it is I will be doing for a year, how on earth will I be in a better position? 

I am honestly sick of dealing with both my patents as I am tired of stroking their narcissistic egos. My issue with them is that the level of arrogance and reckless they display.  As a general rule I tend to not comment on topics If have little knowledge or understanding. If someone asks for advice and I don’t know the answer I tell them I do not know because I don’t want to lead anyone down the wrong path but this is not the case in my family. My parents are more concerned with feeling useful and being right than they are with my general well-being.  I cannot begin to explain the amount of thoughts of self harm I have everyday and feelings of hopeless around my life.  

I just want to say I don’t think less of them because they haven’t received the level of education I have and I don’t think I am the most intelligent person ( one of the sources of my depression) but I just need them to stop because every time they open they mouth they say the most ridiculous things and it makes me feel even more alone than I already am because I have no one to guide me. 

How can I get them to leave me alone?
I’m sorry I’m here but I can’t afford therapy"

I am a high school senior who's interested in applying to USC. I plan on becoming a data analyst or financial analyst and want to learn more about USC's applied &amp; computational mathematics major. I have some questions that I hope can be answered here. Thank you to everyone in advance!!

1) How are the math professors here? Anyone who stands out as an excellent instructor or any class that is heavily recommended? 

2) What are some active math clubs on campus? What are some CS clubs that allow non-majors to join? Is Lava Lab exclusive to CS majors? 

3) How do the internship opportunities look for applied math majors? 

4) What would you say is unique with USC applied math that is not found/rare at other top institutions? 

5) USC's info sessions always talk about interdisciplinary opportunities, but it's been hard for me to locate project teams or programs that really emphasize that. What are some ways that USC actually encourage interdisciplinary study? (I am interested in economics, statistics, computer science, and business as well) 

6) If I want to pick up computer science as a minor, is it competitive to get into that minor? 

7) Will it be difficult to transition into the informatics program as a dornsife student instead of being a Viterbi student? 

This is a lot of question but I am really trying to understand how being an applied math major at USC is like and whether or not I should maybe apply under CS instead. Any input would be greatly appreciated!!! I would love to see responses even if you may only want to answer some of them!"

I'm a senior in college and, because of some personal stuff I had to deal with my sophomore year of college, I think I'm going to have to graduate in Summer 2020 instead of Spring 2020 as originally planned. 

My question is, how likely is it that this will impact my job prospects? Should I look for full-time internships in the summer  and hope I can make enough to live, or will I be able to work an entry level job before I technically finish my degree? My grades are good and I've had two internships while in college, and I'll only have literally five elective credits left, but I'm still worried that finding a full-time job will be more difficult. 

Any words of advice/encouragement would be much appreciated!"

It’s amazing. I don’t usually watch tv series but this one is probably the best show I’ve watched. 

Anyway now to my problem. I finished season 3 and I was crushed to see George have to repeat his internship. I’ve been cheering for George the whole way specially with Izzie. 

And then I saw a spoiler online that he dies!?! Whaaaat?!

So not only am I so disappointed that his career trajectory has changed, so far nothing with him and Izzie. And then I find out he does?! How can I go on watching another 2 seasons knowing he’s gonna kick the bucket?!

I read about Derek in season 11 that was spoiled on accident but that doesn’t bother me as much as George. 

How did everyone handle this?"

There are three main fields in which the best oncologists in Delhi NCR work in that are radiotherapy, surgical and medical. There are other common oncology specialties that includes gynecologic, it is the one which deals with the treatment of women that suffers with cancer of the female-specific organs: and pediatric, it is the one which is related to the treatment of children that suffers with cancer. Diagnosis and the treatment of the blood cancers, like leukemia and lymphoma, fall under the other category of oncology that is hematology-oncology.

The training is required for a person to become a[ ](http://www.drmanojsharmaoncology.com/)[**best oncologist in Delhi NCR**](http://www.drmanojsharmaoncology.com/) and if a person later wants to become a subspecialist in the field of medical oncology, radiation oncology or other disciplines is really very extensive. The requisite of 4 years of premedical education at a medical college or university is followed by the 4 years in medical school to earn a degree in the field of MD or DO, then also the postgraduate training can be obtained through the internships or residencies. Lastly, a person should have a focus on internal medicine for 3 to 7 years that is also required.

Oncologists additionally must pass an exam to get a license for their clinic to legally practice in their state. The oncology specialists must also be certified by an independent specialty board of oncology that is after meeting their education and training requirements and also after passing an exam. Subspecialists in the field of medical oncology or radiation oncology must have at least 1 additional year of training in the fields of oncology. Oncologists are the one who diagnose the cancer using biopsy, MRI, PET scanning, ultrasound, endoscopy, X-ray, CT scanning, or other radiological methods. As well as they use nuclear medicine, blood tests and tumor markers are also used for the diagnosis. 

When a diagnosis is made, the oncologists discuss the disease type and stage with the patient who is suffering. Staging helps the person and oncologists dictate the type of cancer treatment that the patient receives. There are many oncologists for the cancer treatment in Noida.

I have already passed my FE exam so I have started looking to apply for position now to get my name in the hat early. 

I believe that either water resources or land development are the two areas I would most want to go into, since I enjoyed all of my water related classes in school and I’ve really enjoyed my current internship getting to do small site developments. 

From my understanding the difference is that water resources would consist of more hydraulic modeling type work for large scale drainage projects. While land development is the specific infrastructure for the site including runoff control, grading plans, water &amp;sewer lines, etc. 

Could anyone offer some guidance about picking between the two and what opportunities I might have with either concentration, as well as correct me if I’m wrong with my assumptions of what they both entail?

Due to my shitty upbringing, I have gnarly trust issues, and he proposed to me in front of a big group of people WITH a photographer. Due to the immense pressure, I said yes, faked smiles for pics, then told him no later. We hadn't discussed marriage at ALL. Ever. On top of that, the entire trip I felt like I wasn't being heard, and like what I had to say didn't matter, he'd do what he wanted anyway. It felt like small red flag after red flag.

We were doing long distance at the time, and during my short visit we weren't able to fully work things out and I had to finish up my internship feeling like I was losing my mind. Normally he makes sure I'm 110% comfortable before we make any new step together, big or small. And I was terrified that I had just discovered the ""real him,"" and that the man I had fallen deeply in love with was hiding a manipulative, controlling side.

So what did I do?

I drank. I went to clubs for the first time. I drank even more, getting completely drunk for the first, second, and third time. I made out with random people at those clubs. I felt so lost, confused, and hurt, and like I had to keep pretending that he hadn't just hurt me so badly, just so I could push through another day.

But I made out with random people while drunk.

When I got back, it took me a few months, but I finally confessed to him. And that was what really almost destroyed us. He'd been cheated on in the past, and he viewed this as exactly the same. I hadn't even really seen it as cheating, but he was right: I didn't stop getting drunk after the first night I made out with a stranger.

Two years later, we've been able to work nearly everything out. He's gone to therapy, I've gone to therapy. He's on meds, I'm on meds. And I'm two years sober. We moved in together, and we're the happiest we could be. We really, truly are. He is the love of my life and I would do anything for him, and I know he would do the same for me. He is so sweet, caring, and kind. He makes sure I always feel safe, especially since I grew up in a shitty environment. And I try to do the same for him.

My younger brother just turned 21. He used to be Mormon like the rest of our family, but recently is no longer. I think it would be so special for me to share his first drink with him, especially as incredibly close siblings who've been through the same shit.

I expressed this to my SO, and he said he's still uncomfortable with me drinking. It's been two years of growth for us, but I'm clearly more comfortable with the idea of me drinking again. I already gave up going drinking with my best friend when she turned 21, and that really hurt. He has expressed several times that he doesn't think he could ever be comfortable with me having even one casual drink again.

AITA for bringing it up again?"

I am completing my SOP draft. I just realized that I seem to have 55% of my (college projects + ug thesis project + internship + full-time experience) in the field of **full-stack** development, around 35% work in AI/ML and rest 10% in IOT and others.   
I have already written a nice story around my profile which shows why I want to pursue MS in CS with focus on AI/ML (as per the story my future goals can be accomplished mainly via AI/ML research).   
I am now wondering because I have less past work in AI/ML, should I better frame my SOP story again around  **full-stack** development as the interest of research during MS.   
I am not actually very aware of the research scope in **full-stack** development.  
Or should I just show interest in both full-stack development (SDE) + AI/ML (a combination of both all will help in achieving my goal). Can showing both as my interest backfire?   
Or should I just say - I know much of full-stack ... my goal will need full-stack + AI/ML, so I want to focus on research in AI/ML during MS.  
I am confused. I have to submit my application within a week.   
Any comments or suggestions will be appreciated.

dyhbzj,1,2019-11-19,"23[M4F] A massive new week long music festival, the reporter covering it, and how he fell head over heels for the girl camping right next door.",drunkthrowawayforshi,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dyhbzj/23m4f_a_massive_new_week_long_music_festival_the/,"I went to my first music festival when I was 18. I had just graduated a few months before, and myself and a mix of friends saw it as our last hooray together before slowly drifting down our own paths, which it was in most ways. Going in to it I hadn't thought much apart from excitment for the music, and time spent with friends. But by the end of that weekend I had been intoxicated by a detail of music festivals so many looked right past. Sure the dancing, good music, and cool night air was fun, but the real magic lay in the wandering and conversing. It was one thing to spend a few hours around old friends, but I found myself wandering towards new groups, mingling with people from other cities, states, even countries.

Ever since that weekend I had dedicated my vacations and spare funds to festivals, not for the bands playing them, but for the people. Many times I didn't care for a single act, but wished to learn more of those who loved the bands and the culture they felt included in. I built my car with the express concept of the campgrounds, buying an old beaten down VW van for less than a grand and restoring it to the point of running somewhat smoothly again. A new coat of white paint and gloss to get rid of the rusted down ""run from me"" vibe it had been giving off. Though the more important changes had lay within. I had torn out everything but the front two seats, which were still a clean, but old black leather fabric, creating a mass of space in the back. To fill that space I lined the floors with plush pillows and fitted them down, turning the floor in to a make shift mattress that merely needed the sheets and blankets to be unfolded. Apart from that there were a couple of bean bag chairs, and tucked away in the far back a little fridge for some beers and water bottles. Just above the rear cabin doors I fitted a nicely sized canopy that folded out to create a nice shady space, perfect to place a few folding chairs, hang some string lights, and set up the BBQ.

A lot of my friends found it weird, and to be fair I see their point. Why put all my money in to creating a vehicle that was great for a few weekends a year, but completely impractical when it came to normal day to day life. But they hadn't experienced the amazing times that van facilitated. They hadn't sat out on the lawn chairs at 11pm, the smell of the bbq filling the air, the soft hum of music playing inside the van as the campground still bubbled with lively conversations, talking to the tent neighbors who smelled the food and wandered on over.

And of course, they had never gotten to close up the vans doors and fog up the windows with a weekend romance. They had never gotten to spend the nights between shows bundled up with a new friend, lost in loving embraces that would eventually end with a somber goodbye as everyone packed up and left.

But as I turned 22, and began facing the realities of real life, financial responsibilities growing harder to handle and time becoming much more sparse, I had briefly thought of selling the van. Of hanging up my nights entertaining foreign guests with cheep beers, a joint, and laughter by the fire. But I decided to make one last run of it, and to recorded it all via writing. I spent a year attending every festival I could, writing stories of the people I had met, their lives back home, their hopes for the shows, their dreams for the future. Detailing the sounds, the smells, the passion I was so lucky to witness. The young, star in their eye high school sweethearts partying away their senior summer, and the mid fifties lovebirds who spent the night smoking cigars and exchanging banter between one another by my campfire. Each time I wrote, I sent it around. Emailing it hopelessly to RollingStone and really any other magazine or website that might consider publishing it.

""Hello Mr.Swan.

First of all we at the Rolling Stone wanted to congratulate you on all the hard work. Last week an intern put a folder down on my desk asking for me to look through it, and since they had found a few good stories for me in the past I took a look. While some of the earlier articles you sent us were rough around the edges and rambled on a little, there was something special about the way you look at festivals. Any writer out there can tell you how the speakers sounded, how the bands played, or how the crowd cheered, but it takes a lot of patience and listening to be able to tell the story of who you might meet at the event, and the interesting stories that play out surrounding the stages and campgrounds.

While this is a bit unusual for us, we would like to extend a temporary offer to you, consider it a trial and practice period. We would pay you a small wage for the summer, as well as expense your tickets and camping costs in return for you writing exclusively for us during this time. If your articles pick up traction, we may have more work in the future for you, but of course we would need to see a bit of improvement to reach that point.

If you are able and interested in this idea please respond to our legal team at (redacted)@gmail.com, and we will get in touch from there.

Best of luck

Mark Bronson

Chief Editor ""

Reading that response in the mail nearly made me cry. Even if this were just the summer, a brief brush with the glamour and travel of a writer, it was still too good to be true. To do something I loved, and to be paid. Of course I got in touch immediately, and we worked it all out.

That was what lead me here today, to the camping spot right next door to your own. This was the first festival I would be covering for the Stone, and dear god had they given me a big one. ""The Valley"" was new on the scene, but already the buzz of the summer. Set in the middle of nowhere Montana, a massive fairground and campsite had been erected for a 7 day long extravaganza. Each day would play host to a different genre of music, with the hope being to draw as many different cultures and groups together as possible and gather under the name of partying and music. The week would begin with Country, then modern rock, metal, hip hop, electronic and dance, classic rock, and finally the week would end with a mixture of them all playing throughout the day. While the location was a bit of a pain to reach, the week long event had already sold out, as had the campgrounds, within days of the announcement. I was one of two reporters, a veteran was covering the performances themselves, while I was tasked with the culture around it all. Naturally the veteran had set up a luxury stay in a local hotel, but all I needed was the van.

I had arrived well before everyone else, taking advantage of the press pass to enter the campgrounds early, find my spot, and set up camp. It was only six in the morning when I shut the engine off, the sun rising and glowing a dim light over the vast field that lead down to the gated fairground. I couldn't help but consider myself lucky as I stepped out and stretched in the brisk morning air. I had nabbed a great spot, a lot more than big enough for the van, outstretched canopy, and a warm fire/barbecue pit that I carried in the back of the van. Instead of finding one in the center of the campgrounds, I had gone for one on the edge, mid way between the campgrounds entrance and the festival stages, but with a make shift road cut in to the grass on one side, and a small stream creating an edge to the campsite on the other.

By the time you had shown up I had already set everything up, having opened up the canopy, dragged out the fire pit and gotten the propane fixed up for later, and set up the chairs both inside and out of the van for any visitors. I had been laying on the floor of the van when I heard a car pulling up and parking in the spot next to mine, resting my eyes as I awaited the crowds excitedly mobbing in. My legs were hanging from the door, a pair of dark blue jeans and flip flops hanging from my feet. As soon as I leaned up on my elbows to take a look at my neighbor for the week, I was struck by a work of true beauty. A rom-com esque moment where light flowed from behind you, wind blowing your hair like a Revlon advertisement, and a natural smile across your lips. One might call it love at first sight, though realistically I called it butterflies that mirrored a high school crush.

But who were you, what brought you here? Are you the bright eyed 18 year old, newly graduated and spending the summer partying before being thrust in to the real world, unaware that she was about to be swept off her feet and sent tumbling down the stairs of true love? Maybe you're 23, or around that age like me, using the week as an excuse to get away from work and there alone. The perfect match. Two people spending a week side by side, there alone, ready to chat and wander together as they slowly draw closer and closer together, until they find themselves entangled in the back of the van, moaning as if the walls weren't a thin metal. Or maybe your a little older, an early forties woman, divorced for years, finally able to enjoy some freedom now that your son moved out. Attending the festival to try and recapture that feeling of carefree youth, and finding yourself perfectly positioned beside a young, strong, handsome man that could give you that feeling of lust fueled passion.

&amp;#x200B;

(Hey there DPP. So to be clear, those examples at the end aren't set in stone choices, more so just examples to let you know the kinds of things I'm thinking of. In my opinion, half the fun of DPP is in allowing my partner the space to craft their own backstory and character, so however you pictured your character, or yourself in this week long music festival, let me know. As long as you as the writer, and the character are 18 years or older, we'll work it out.

In part I want this scenario to be somewhat vanilla and slow paced, with the two starting things in a friendly manner, then slowly falling through the steps of attraction over the first couple of days at the festival, then falling head over heels in a honeymoon like trance. However I feel this prompt still has space for some realistic kinks. We couldn't really do some mass gangbang in the mosh pit, but theres still a lot to play with. Maybe after a few nights together the duo try to get a little sneaky, hiding behind a booth for a few minutes or taking advantage of lusty dancing and skimpy outfits in a dense crowd. Or maybe it's as simple as kinks in the bedroom, or van for that matter. Are you a little submissive, then we can easily work that in. Like to call your man daddy? Why not. Really anything that doesn't break the barrier of realism works.

I'm also always open to making changes to the scenario here and there, as my prompt is still a little clunky and unpolished, so any ideas you had please let me know.

A few things. First off this is a long term play, not a one and done kinda night. Second, please be able to write a full response. I'm not asking for a novel every time, but at least two to three paragraphs at a time. I tend to write between 3-7 paragraphs at a time, and receiving one paragraph after all that work just feels lopsided. And finally, if you are interested please don't just say ""Hey, I liked it."" Give me substance in that first message. Tell me about the character you have in mind, both how they look, and their backstory. Pictures are perfectly fine for the looks, but they MUST be of people 18 years of older. I will not accept partners, nor characters under the age of 18. With that please also include your age, time zone, and character name in the first message as well.

I hope you all enjoyed the read, as I said above I know it's definitely a little rough around the edges now but I tend to polish up prompts the more I post them, finding and thinking up new details and little pieces as I play and sculpt the play.)"
dyi9jk,9,2019-11-19,Orrery of the Wanderer Chapter 4 Discussion/Advice,thelolpatrol,AcqIncDMs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcqIncDMs/comments/dyi9jk/orrery_of_the_wanderer_chapter_4_discussionadvice/,"Hello again everyone! My group finished Chapter 4 a week ago, so it's time for another one of these. This one took me 2 4-hour sessions, but only because the Orrery teleported its user to the Horse Dimension at the start of the first session.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been spacing out the book content with homebrew sessions to keep things from feeling too rushed. However, there were so many side-sessions between Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 that the party was Level 5 when they arrived in Luskan instead of Level 4.

&amp;#x200B;

They went back to Waterdeep HQ from Phandalin to receive their mission from Flabbergast (they still haven't met Omin in person). Then, the party went to the docks to choose a boat to sail to Luskan with.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to give the group a chance to encounter Flabbergast before Chapter 5 so he would be a familiar face later. I also wanted the group to take a boat from Waterdeep so they could sail by Hoobur's lighthouse and see what he is up to. It still baffles me how the book sets up this incredibly powerful bad guy and he totally drops out of the storyline as soon as the party meets him. In my game he raided the AI franchises to get the money to build a resort called Necrotic Park, so the party saw the ads on his lighthouse as they passed by.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as finding Dran Enterprises goes, I really like what the book is going for. However, I feel like there are just a bit too many breadcrumbs to follow here, especially since the group already knows what they are supposed to be looking for. My group wanted to go to Fantasy TGI Fridays, so I reskinned the clues in the Fishbone Tavern for them there.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to run this chapter again, I'd make it more publicly known that Arla knows about Dran Enterprises and will spill the beans for coin, but that she is being watched so anyone who tries to talk to her about it gets attacked. This gives the party the option between a expensive direct route and seeking a cheaper alternative. I didn't run the strike team encounter because I don't think 4 generic goons is interesting content compared to the boat portals.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was dumb for this book to include a ""failure points"" system for a race that the party doesn't even know it is in. Therefore, I chose for The Six to attack the Dangerous Business right as the party arrived instead of waiting for the party to (maybe) encounter them via a random portal.

&amp;#x200B;

I excluded the possibility of the Warehouse encounter from my rolls because it seemed like an uninteresting extended fetch quest. Additionally, the loot is somewhat weighted to a few encounters. You might want to improvise to redistribute some of it to the encounters your party actually ends up at.My group received the Far Realm horror, Amid the rigging, and River barge crossing encounters before moving into the final encounter.

&amp;#x200B;

* Far Realm Horror - My party is level 5 and had two level 3 interns with them, so I upped the difficulty on this one by replacing the Chaos Quadroped with a 100hp version of the Krake Spawn from the Tome of Beasts, with added eldritch horror lair actions. One of the party members almost died here because the group sent him ahead to scout instead of all going through at once. You might want to make it clear to the party somehow that everyone needs to go through at once.
* Amid the Rigging - One of the beneficial effects of my group's Orrery is the Pass Without Trace spell, so it went smoothly for everyone except the Ranger, who rolled a Nat 1 on Stealth. Luckily, he was wearing the Dran Enterprises clothes and made a good Deception check to leave without any problems.
* River Barge Crossing - I upgraded 2 of the Scouts to Spies to make things more difficult, but the party has a Lizardman (swim speed) and a Tabaxi (super sprint) in it, so they were able to just jet across the barges like no other and pick off the enemies easily. I play an online game, so I didn't find it important to move the barges each turn. It's possible I could have upped the difficulty here, but I didn't want to ruin a situation for character strengths to matter here.

&amp;#x200B;

The book doesn't include a map for the encounter with the Mind Flayer, so I used this one that u/chibbingrove submitted on /r/battlemaps: [https://i.redd.it/78atwby7ecw31.jpg](https://i.redd.it/78atwby7ecw31.jpg). You may find the layout familiar if you've ever watched The Office ;).

&amp;#x200B;

Since the group was level 5 and hadn't taken much of a beating so far, I added a Vile Barber (ToB) and some goons to the encounter to balance things out. In addition, I gave the Mind Flayer one automatic recharge on his Mind Blast (instead of needing 5-6) and didn't follow the book's advice to have him go after Bracus. You will probably want to avoid upping the power level so much if your group is Level 4 for this part like the book recommends.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the book makes Dran Enterprises look too weak and buddy-buddy here. Bracus can just as easily give AI the orrery components to put a target on their back than to ""unite against The Six"", and I don't buy a small group of goons and a single Mind Flayer posing an existential threat to the *headquarters* of Dran Enterprises. This can be solved by simply making *The Maverick* not be the main headquarters for Dran Enterprises. Also, Bracus' ""We have been secretly watching you this whole time because plot reasons"" thing is a bit lame. I'd substitute it with ""This isn't the first time The Six have tried to claim our components, so we sent spies to find the other pieces and were about to reach out to you when we came under attack"". Exposition dumps are never clean to execute.

&amp;#x200B;

Fun Tidbits:

\-Due to silliness from the poll I let my players vote on, Luskan basically ended up being Portland.

\-The interns shoplifted a combined 180 gold from weapon boats during the River Barge Crossing encounter.

\-My players misremembered the name of the Dangerous Business as Risky Business, and I went along with it because of this clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2UVsyVLLcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2UVsyVLLcE)."

I'm currently an intern at a fairly large company, and they have let me know on several occasions that they want me as their right-hand employee in a new business venture writing a Rails 5 application. Long story short, I would like to know what things I can/should demand from them in terms of salary, benefits and the like.

I have been wanting to join the Dutch military as a paratrooper, and I told them recently when a school representative came over to discuss how things were going. My boss kind of freaked out because he assumed we were going to work together after I graduate. On top of this, I've had other companies (of which my boss is a shareholder) come to me offering good jobs as well. I've heard he has raised his supposed offer because of this. 

I just had a meeting with my boss and manager of the HR department to discuss my future at the company. It's clear that they want me to work for them. They do not want to influence my choice between the military and IT because they would rather have me make the right decision instead of them just having me work for them and eventually having regrets (everyone here is very friendly, great working environment). 

Which is why they had not prepared an actual financial indication for me to ponder over. I told them that I am ready to make my decision and that when they know what they want to offer me to just plan a meeting again and discuss it further.

They, however, did say that I would get a car, a nice salary, a lot of different potential responsibilities which I can essentially pick and choose from. And of course a future in a rapidly growing company.

The next meeting is in a month and that meeting will include a job offer, I am a 20-year-old student, graduating in approximately 6 months by the way.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering what the things that I should negotiate for, and what are things that I should watch out for are.

The topic of the project is verification of effectful Haskell programs in Coq. For a brief overview of the internship and the topic, please have a look [here](https://bunkenburg.net/projects/2019-11-01-daad-rise.html).

We'd be very happy to host a motivated student who likes working with our haskell-to-coq compiler. Depending on personal interests, the focus of the internship can be the compiler itself or its output and the Coq framework for reasoning about the generated code. Previous knowledge of Coq is not required!

If you have any questions beforehand, feel free to leave a comment or email us at the addresses listed on the project page. The program funding is based on the number of applications, so please spread the news to your colleagues, students or classmates!"
dymijk,3,2019-11-19,"I got Screwed by my current employer and this is how it happened, please learn from me , and feel free to offer me advice. From a Recent College Graduate.",acespeed_47,u_acespeed_47,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_acespeed_47/comments/dymijk/i_got_screwed_by_my_current_employer_and_this_is/,"I'm graduating in December 2019  from a University in Texas and I have been an intern with a large company for about 6-7 months. I got an offer with another company to join them in September 2019 with another construction company. I went to the interview and although I emphasized that I'm graduating this semester I was only looking for full time upon graduation. We had an agreement that I will come in as an Intern but higher paid from my current employer and as soon as I graduate I would be promoted to a salaried and benefits position.

I bite the bullet for more experienced and was told to speak to my manager before December 2019 for my offer letter. Time passes and the day approaches to speak with my manager about graduation.

We set our meeting for November 8 2019 but that day came and the meeting was rescheduled, which seemed nothing out of the ordinary. I was told he was going to have a meeting with each of the people that I mostly work with. 

I received a new invite for the meeting for November 12 2019, that day I spoke to my co workers whether my manager spoke to them or not. I asked 5 people I work with and my manager did not bother to talk to them except for 1 person in less than a minute from what he told me. At that point I realized that my manager did not conduct a proper review of my performance or skills since he failed to talk to my superiors of the work I have done and accomplished. No proper discussion about my performance or skill set.

I realized his meeting was not going to go well and I assumed the worst that I will be getting fired. The meeting got pushed back until November 15 2019. That day came and it felt our of the ordinary. The weekly team meeting that I was apart with got canceled and was moved to a PM meeting that I can not attend because of the time issue. 

My meeting was for that day at 2PM(Offer Meeting) and then I was not told that the department team meeting that is weekly was actually cancelled. 

So I have a strange feeling and I was 99% guaranteed that I was going to be let go since my co workers weren't speaking with me and was excluding me of any work meeting or project meetings we have weekly.

Bad signs I saw before my Offer Meeting:

\-Excluding you from regular team meetings

\-Co workers stop inviting you to lunch 

\-No longer invited to vendors meetings

\-No one speaking with you anymore

\-Manager avoided me on purpose

\-Some of my tasks were delegated to someone else

At my offer meeting, This is how it went down. As soon as I walked into my offer meeting I noticed it was not formal and no other key team members were there. The first words he spoke was this below:

Manager: ""Im not going to sugar coated, we can't afford someone else in the office with salary and benefits. For budgeting reasons at this time we can not extend you an offer and I know this is not what you wanted to hear but this is it""

Me: My heart rate dropped and I immediately tried to show no emotion even after this was a huge let down 

Manager: ""Although we wont offer you a full time for budgetary reasons , I'm going to offer you some feedback for now"" "" Some one who is ready to go into the real world needs to know that you need to show up before the manager and leave after the manager, your position as an intern works for our budget as of right now but we cant guaranteed it even for the next months if we can still afford a new person in the office for full time benefits and salary. We need someone that will work harder and take on more work even though you aren't getting paid for it, the reality is sometimes you have to give more even if you aren't earning it or with the title. You need to work on more work load and attention to detail... etc etc etc."" ""Also we do not want you to leave because your a great asset to us, you work hard and you brought value from your previous experiences but unfortunately we are not in a position to hire you full time.""

Me: I said ""Thank you for your time and have a nice weekend"" 

Immediately after I left the meeting I felt that I got misled, the original promised of full time hire and work opportunities were shattered. The only thing I can think of is ""WHY DID YOU HIRE ME KNOWING YOU CAN'T AFFORD A NEW HIRE AND TAKE ME AWAY FROM A EMPLOYER THAT I WAS ALREADY WORKING WITH? 

I felt like my current employer sabotage my financial security after graduation. My whole time during college I always held positions that led me to good paying positions. Under my belt I have 4 professional experiences and by now I wanted to graduate and know where I will be at and how much I will be making and benefits. 

I'm the head of the house hold for my wife and it is my responsibility that I failed as a husband to secure our finances after graduation. After struggling with living and paying bills while in college, no support from anyone and being a first time high school graduate and college graduate from my whole family. I really needed the full time offer and salary to finally get ahead and being able to support my Wife(Currently in College) and my mother in law that lives with us. Now by having a end date with the company and graduation , im part of that statistical pool of students that ""Graduate with out a full time offer or Walk the stage with no job lined up"" And I believe I worked so hard just for me taking a chance and a employer ruining me by misleading me. Now I will be unemployed in two weeks, Graduating, Having Bills to eat and live,  Also responsibility of my Wife(Currently she works part time and goes to University) and my mother in law that can barely afford to feed herself. 

I have experience and have money saved up but I'am still taking a loss for having no job right before graduation and in December 2019 where employers are slowing down their hiring and preparing for the holidays.

Advice to Students: Do not accept an offer unless it is what you really want and do not trust promises unless it is in writing. Your employer will always be looking out for their own interests before your situation. If they did not meet their company goals, then things can go south to firing employees or reducing expenses.

Do not fully commit to an employer with your time, at times they will pay your worth but in reality that is time lost that you will never get back. You may work 12 hours a day 6 times a week making good money on overtime, or having a salary of $80,000 a year but working 65-70 hours a week, which is technically lower since their not paying you for that additional time.  

Don't trade your family or love for your time being at work. 

At this point I have interviews line up already but I'm worried for my own family's well being since I'm the head of the household. I hope I find a full time position that allows me to have time with the love of my life. I haven't given up yet, the market doesn't seem promising since its at the end of the year, I'm barely graduating, still not enough experience, the the pressure of being the head of the household for my loving wife and my mother in law.

The next step will be to graduate, walk the stage, apply apply and apply, go to interviews, walk to job sites, visit recruiters, visit companies, and in the hopes of finding something soon. My limit is as much savings that I have and I believe that I have 2.5-3 months worth of expenses if I completely stop working today. I can also sell my things and eventually sell my car so I don't stop paying my rent and bills. 

I hope my story of Graduating College n 2019 be an eye opener that life is not easy, if your family went to college and your sort of well off by connections or family that know connections or companies Then your most likely privileged,they will help you , but as for me being a minority, first high school graduate, and first college graduate in my whole family, it is my responsibility and only choice to start from scratch and fulfill my dreams to finally live a life that it is so strange for my family .That driving without car insurance or health insurance is the every day life of a minority  , and sacrificing their health to put bread on the table, rinse and repeat.

\*I hope my story helps someone, that your not alone, keep fighting and hopefully we will succeed"""

""Congratulations! We'd like to extend you an offer for the AMWF summer internship program! Please find your offer letter attached. Reply to this email with your start date and end date and please fill out the relocation form!""

You were ecstatic when you got that email. AMWF was one of the leading technology companies in the cloud computing space. Their position in their space, coupled with their San Francisco high rise office, insane perks (massage room, library) and high pay made their internship program one of the most competitive in the world. And you got in.
______

You got out of the elevator to the 50th floor office of AMWF, ready for your first day. You headed to the receptionist, a pretty blonde lady wearing a tight, revealing dress, and told you who you were.

""Ah, yes! One of the interns!"" she exclaimed, handing you a guest pass and instructing you to head to a meeting room called Cybertron, where your mentor would be meeting you shortly.

On the way, you noticed a few things. One, the office seemed to be composed of two distinct types of people, tall, fit, handsome Asian men and white women dressed in revealing clothes. You wondered who your mentor would be as you sat inside Cybertron, a meeting room with an expansive view of the city's financial district.

_______

A few minutes later, a [pale, blonde woman walked in, clutching a laptop and a coffee cup. She was dressed in a tight skirt, heels, and a black crop top. She looked more like a whore than a professional.](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg) 

""Hi! You must be *your name*!"" she beamed, sitting down next to you at the conference table. 

""I'm Rosie, and I'm going to be your mentor here at AMWF, "" she opened her laptop, typing away for a few seconds before turning her attention to you.

""Since you're my intern, it's my job to make sure you're getting all the support and help you need, "" she giggles, scooching a bit closer to you. You notice she's booked two hours for this meeting room.

""So, first things first, which one of my holes do you want me to service you with first, *daddy*?"" she purred.

_____

Hi! I'm Rosie and I kind of look like [this](https://i.redd.it/igr4d24i5tf31.jpg). I'm looking to play your mentor/cum dump during your internship at AMWF. I like dirty talk, name calling, raceplay (Asian dominance &lt;3), big cocks, lots of cum, impregnation, and cheating.

DM me your name, description and continuation (no dick pics and be aggressive!) and expect to write around 3+ paragraphs per response."

dyoqy3,1,2019-11-19,Me [F22] and my BF [M38] about to break up because he doesn’t have time.,artiraki,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dyoqy3/me_f22_and_my_bf_m38_about_to_break_up_because_he/,"Hi,
Throw-away account because my brother knows my main acc and I don’t want him to hear about my private life. 

So, we’ve been living together for 1 year and dating for 1 year. I know it sounds kinda odd, I actually have my own flat just 2 blocks away but I just stay with him since our first date.  

He’s the manager of bar where we first met. When we first started dating, we used to spend time together, have date nights, wine nights, night walks. We used to have hot, fierce moments. He’s an amazing guy. Caring, fun, cute, loving. He used to work like 7pm-2am weekdays and 6pm-4am weekends. I was student back then, didn’t mind about his working hours but deep inside knew that would be huge problem after I graduate and get a job. I did my 2 months of mandatory internship and have seen what our future held. I studied textile and all of the textile companies are located out of town. I left home at 6.30am and came home at 7.30pm, waited him to come home when I could. We barely had chance to see each other. 

Then I graduated and I wanted to rest a couple of months to relax and prepare myself for work life. Last year had been too tight for me. Job, work, gradutue, projects. Meanwhile my family insisted me to move back like “what are you doing there? You graduated, come back and get a job here” we live in the same city but it’s 2 hours of drive. Companies/factories are even farther there hence I have no chance to get a job with humane drive/work hours there. I’m trying to delay them the best I can. But I don’t know if it’s worth to stay because my boyfriend has been working quite rough past 2 months. When I visit my parents he begs me to come back, when I come he just rushes to go work even earlier. Now he works like 1-2pm to 3 am weekdays and staying up to 5am weekends. He has to go earlier due to lack of staff. I waited patiently but it isn’t getting any better. I woke up relatively late, when he’s about to go work, because my sleep time is messed up. When I wake up, I’m alone. When I go to bed waiting for him to come home I’m alone. I just feel so lonely and abandoned. I don’t have much time left to end my resting and start working sooner or later. I wanted to have time together meanwhile, knowing we may never have that chance anymore. 

But we just can’t see each other. We don’t even share things like we used to do. No date nights, no hot nights, no fun dinners, no night walks. 

Last night I couldn’t hold myself, got up and cried at kitchen in dark so he wouldn’t see me. 

He woke up and came, asked what’s wrong. I didn’t want to make him upset so said nothing and hide my tears. Then he asked me why I’m shedding tears alone in the kitchen. 
So I opened up my feelings he said “You’re completely right, I insisted you to come back and can’t even give the attention you want.” 
I said “I don’t see our future, what will happen when I start to work? I think that’s the end of the road for us.” 

He went silent for a moment then told me that I’m right, I’m still too young and it’d be selfish to drag me into this. I felt the pain in his voice. I know he loves me so much and I do too. But we were getting close to the end. I don’t feel we are as connected as we did before. 

I wouldn’t stay here he wouldn’t be there. I miss my cats a lot and they live with my family. I’d move back without thinking even it meant ridiculous working hours because I’d be with them, I’d be home. And things about my life would be clear. Now I just miss my cats and family when I come here and miss him when I visit there. Can’t even see him when I’m with him though. 

But that uncertainty and yearning make me feel so depressed. I don’t know what to do. Am I overreacting? 

Tl;dr: My boyfriend works a lot we can’t spend time together. My family insist me to move in. I have to work soon, it’ll be even harder and  I’m worried about our future."

  Steve the intern, not quite yet knowing how to climb the corporate, quietly chuckles as he hands Calvin His coffee. 

“What’s so funny?” Asks Calvin. 

Steve shakes his head and smirks while retorting “Joel McHale?” Steve puffs his chest out just a little, raises his chin, and barks out just loud enough for everyone to hear “why, I had breakfast with Robert Downey Jr. just this morning!” 

Calvin rolls his eyes and clasps his hands, and leans back into his chair. 

“Perhaps you would be better seen and not heard, lest you make a fool of yourself, you make quite large claims.”

“No, really. There’s not a person in this world who doesn’t know me.”

Calvin throws back his head and laughs. 

“Really now? Would you be able to arrange, well..... I don’t know, after work drinks with tiger woods?”

Steve dips out of the room, “just a moment” he calls out. After a minute he steps back in. “Tonight at 6:30.” Steve says. 

Lo and behold they get to the bar and tiger woods is there to greet them. 

“I don’t believe it!” Remarks Calvin. “I bet you 10 grand that you can’t get the queen of England on the line!”

Steve smirks, and whips out his hand Nokia. He steps away, and two minutes later he comes back. “The queen of England is quite busy,” Steve begins to say, “Ha! I knew you couldn’t get a hold of her!” Interrupts Calvin.

“Patience,” Steve says, “she can only meet us for tea tomorrow,” he continues. Calvins jaw drops. Steve raises an eyebrow and says “I’ll take the 10 grand in cash. 

Sure enough, teas time the next day a helicopter arrives, and the queen of England steps off just as Calvin hands a briefcase. 

“Fuck this” Calvin shouts, “you know what? Double or nothing I want to see you with the pope!”

“Not an issue.” Steve calmly says while whipping out his phone. 10 minutes later flights were booked to Italy. 

Fast forward a little bit, and Steve is on the balcony with the pope. 

All of the sudden Steve the intern  spots a commotion in the crowd. He rushes down to see Calvin being rushed into ambulance. 

“Calvin! What happened??!” Steve asked.

“Well I was doing fine up until this guy behind me tapped me on the shoulder and asked me who was the guy on the balcony next to Steve!”"

**Applications:** 111

**Rejections:** 22

**Online Assessments:** 6

**Phone Interviews:** 1 (Rejected after)

**Offers:** 0

**Application Period:** 10/12/2019 - 11/14/2019

**School:** No-name school, Junior, 3.66 GPA

**Experience:** 1+ year experience as software engineer (no-name company)

**Location:** Far away from the U.S., but a citizen

Mostly applied through Linkedin, and in desirable locations (California, Washington, New York, Chicago). I applied to mostly good companies or recognizable ones. I did not have any referrals. I saw many times in this sub that the big 4 usually gives anyone competent an OA at least, but interestingly I got ignored by all 4.

I had one good side project, and the other two were rather mediocre. I had my resume checked multiple times in this sub under a throwaway, and I don't think it's that bad either. It's probably my location. I'm going to take a one week break to work on a project then start sending applications again. Hopefully it's less competitive as the strong students already have accepted offers.

Regarding the OAs, I've only encountered one very tough problem that was given by Akuna, which I was not able to solve. It was a very interesting problem, and I wish I could've taken a screenshot to work on it myself. I screwed up on Quora's codesignal, and it's normally something I should've done well on (probably nerves; my first OA). The only company that reached out to me was very well-known and paid their interns a lot, even if I did not ace their hackerrank. I aced the other 3, and I did not get replies back from 2. Twitter rejected me after acing their 4 problem hackerrank in an hour, which had a 24 hour time limit.

It feels like my personality has change since that happen.,Djgogi059,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/dypjew/does_it_feel_like_a_break_up_when_a_very_close/,"it's been two months since two of my close friends ended my friendship at the same time. One of them I understand why they ended it. The other one was a bit petty and sad that it ended at the same. they both confronted me at the same time while I was still grieving over my dog who recently passed away a couple of weeks before that. On top of that, I didn't even know they had a problem with me at a time before they confronted me.  
Friend 1: I came for her about a story that I thought was intended for me but really wasn't about me in front of a group chat with a really close friend where we all trusted each other. Which is my fault because I should have asked her personally.  
Friend 2: I forgot that I gave her my phone to record for her interview for her internship and I used my find my phone app and it rang during her interview and according to her I didn't apologize which I thought I did and now it's too late and she won't let me apologize for it.  
I have apologized to both of them, but they did not really accept it ( friend one said it's whatever and she doesn't hate me, but I would have to build that friendship again, but when I try to it feels like she wasn't even trying and not talking to me. Friend two said she forgives me, but don't want to be friends anymore). I know I had to move on and people told me too and I have (or so I have thought so because why am I writing here.). However, sometimes I still think about them and all the memories that we just had and I think about what went wrong because it wasn't even a year ago where we had a good time spending time with each other. The last time I talked to them was on the day of my birthday (almost a month ago) and I just wrote them like a thank you for being my friend and I will cherish the memories that we had (like a goodbye letter) and they both thought I was having a pity party, but I was not. I really wish the best for both of them and I'm not mad at them. It's not like I hate them so much I wish they would die or something bad would happen to them. I still have them on social media (I don't know when I'm ready to remove them right now I just have their post and story on mute) and their phone number. In addition to that, It's hard to avoid them too due to a few things.  
friend two has a lot of classes with me and I think she keeps on looking at me and when I look at her for a split second she looks away  
I always see friend one in the hallways and everywhere I go, but I just try to avoid her too.  
all of us have the same friends and it's just so odd to go up to the friends now and friend two is with them all the time. Now I would just let her be and try to avoid then group when she is there and when she is not there I hang out with the friend group, but it just feels different like I'm not close to them anymore (my friends know my situation and they agree with me that it is sad that this happened with friend 1 and 2 over a something small, but they are still friends with me and them. Which is whatever, but I can't control who they are friends with). Now I just hang out with a different group of friends who supported me throughout this situation but don't hang out with friends two that much.  
If we are with a group of friends and when me or friend 2 ask a question to the group something sometime friend 2 or I would answer each other's question  
I see them at lunch having a good time with my other friends and it makes me miss them so much.  
This breakup feels like its changed me because I feel so lonely, but at the same time, I'm not alone because I do have some people with me. it feels like I'm more distant with some people now and I just don't feel the same. I would usually talk about random things with the two friends and two other close friends (we are still friends but distant now because of the other two people), play games, and give each other advice and motivate each other. Now that is gone. I've been writing this since 1:55 pm and at the end of the day as I finish writing this I feel better now writing all of my feelings out. If anyone is reading this far of the message thanks for hearing me out."
dypkn5,1,2019-11-19,So tired of this shit,Rubicon2020,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dypkn5/so_tired_of_this_shit/,"I’m so tired of my husband. Had a phone interview today. We’ve been together for 10 years. I tried for 4 years to get a job did interview after interview but because I’m 30+ with no experience I was getting looked over. Finally I got hired. I lasted 16 months and it was just too much. I was in school at the same time which then was put on the back burner because I had to constantly pick up shifts for retail bs. I’ve been on community college since 2014, but had to take many semesters off because work would get in the way, or my health wouldn’t let me work. 

I finally am graduating in May. I’ve finally just said the last 2 years I’m doing school full time screw anything else. And so that’s what I’ve done. 

Now this semester I’ve been trying to get a internship or part time job but in IT in my area everyone’s about fulltime even internships. So I’m constantly getting turned down for jobs Cuz my class schedule stops me from working a full time job. Classes mid day suck. 

So I find out that this company won’t do part time so Interview was over. I tell my husband. And what does he say “don’t quit looking” like dude they don’t want part time. Only full time! Like what part of this are you not getting. I can’t work full time in IT and go to school full time it don’t mix. And all I’m doing is wasting my time doing interviews to jobs I’m not qualified for yet or not able to put the time in for. And he’s just constantly harping on me to get a job, get a job, get a job. Like fuckin hell let me fucking graduate first. Just a few more months. 

I already have bipolar II major depression and high anxiety try not making it worse by this damn shit. I finally have a good outlook on life and am getting my anxiety under control and you just want me to keep pushing further and further. Like what part of I can’t work full time do you not get. This semester I totally could have 8-5 was open only had evening classes but next semester I have a mid day class and it’s the only time it is offered and then I have an evening class. I’ll be at school all day because it’s 35 miles one way and I ain’t got the money for gas to go to and from twice. 

It’s just aggravating that no matter what he’s constantly bickering at me to get a job when there’s maybe 1 out of every thousand that is part time. Like what do you not get? He works full time and is trying to go to school with one class a semester, but he keeps dropping classes cuz he don’t have time for both. Like no shit Sherlock. I’m supposed to make you feel good about not being able to go to class and dropping yet another class and another degree but I can’t just do class only for one more semester. Fuck!"

(long rambling post, I'm sorry)",throwaway138065u43,emotionalabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/dyqhdo/im_so_confused_long_rambling_post_im_sorry/,"I don’t know where to go from here, if I’m being honest. I don’t even really know what’s going on in my situation. I feel like everything has been turned upside-down and I have no clue what’s true and what’s not anymore. Can anyone please give me insight? I just need some objectivity now.

&amp;#x200B;

I (25m) feel like I’m never enough for my girlfriend (26f). We’ve been together for nearly 4 years (next month). Things feel really off to me, but I can’t put my finger on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We met in college and early on, my girlfriend pointed out to me that I had a harmful relationship with my (52f) mother. I’m pretty sure this is actually the truth and the relationship with her is/was certainly a bit co-dependent. I think I suffered a bit because of this and for a time, I was definitely a little “developmentally behind” I guess you could say. I lacked a lot of life skills. Over time, my girlfriend pushed me to change these things about myself by threatening to break up with me if I couldn’t manage to do so. I tried to do a lot of reflection and made a ton of changes. Later on, she eventually started to make jokes at my expense saying that I was autistic, or that I wanted to have sex with my mom or that she was my girlfriend. I understand that she was joking, and I get that there was probably a lot of frustration on her end, but the remarks would hurt my feelings. I did sometimes express that too, but she often told me that I was being sensitive or that if I behaved differently, she wouldn’t feel frustrated and lash out in that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

After college, we went back to our hometowns, and were briefly in a LDR until I eventually moved in with her and her mother after finding an internship in her city (as a side note, during this entire period of time I was contributing to her mom’s rent). Eventually I got a full-time job, but the whole time I lived with them, my GF would constantly complain that I didn’t do enough around the house. Admittedly, I was still somewhat in “college mode,” so I tried to be more conscientious, but I *do* admit I wasn’t perfect. Not too long after I landed that job, I started looking for my own apartment because I didn’t want to live at her mom’s forever, and my girlfriend was on board because she thought it would be good life experience for me to live on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout all of this, I started to notice more concerning behavior come up. During this time, I noticed that she never seemed to want to just coexist with one another, it seemed like she always wanted intense 1-on-1 time, to the point where I felt like she’d get angry if I wasn’t paying attention to her. One such example is that I would often meditate in the mornings for 15 minutes max. She knew that I would do that, and though she said she was okay with it, she’d ask to sit in the room with me, or she’d interrupt me because I had left her by herself. She would also start tickling me (I’m extremely ticklish) and would do so even after I asked her to stop or after I told her I didn’t want to be tickled. Over time, I’ve watched as this has progressed from tickling for fun to tickling me when I make a lame joke, to now hitting me (not hard although it has hurt before)/tickling me when I say something she might not like. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, during my apartment hunt, things became more tense and my GF basically strongly recommended that I go to therapy or else our relationship wouldn’t work out. I did that, and it was really eye opening, but she has always been critical of my therapist, saying that she’s not helpful and that I’m not focusing on the right things with her (she often asks me what I talk about during my sessions and I initially found it hard to not tell her). Around this time, I found my own place and right before I was going to move out, my GF told me she wanted to go on a break because she felt like I wasn’t meeting her needs. 

 

Regardless, we were on a break for a month, and it was the most freeing time of my life and my self-confidence was up, but I was also extremely, extremely lonely. While I had all the time in the world to myself, I basically had no friends anymore aside from a handful who live out of town, and at the time, I had no family in the area either. I actually managed to live alone pretty well, and keep my place clean and nice, but I didn’t have many people to talk to, so I was happy when we started talking again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy had really helped me see that I have some legitimate communication issues and I tend to try really hard to please people, often at the expense of my boundaries. So when we started talking again, I tried to set boundaries and ask that we take things slow so we didn’t end up in the same place, but almost instantly she rejected the idea and tried to take up all my free time (the weekend we got back together, she agreed to all-day outings on Saturday and Sunday without consulting me first). A lot of the previous behaviors such as the mean comments, hitting/tickling, and clinginess started to come back and at this point they're far more constant. Early on, I tried to be firm about sticking to my boundaries, but it always caused a fight, so I gave up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I barely spend time at the apartment I’m paying for and I find myself using it almost more as a hotel or as a glorified storage locker while I spend up to 6 days a week at her mom’s. 3 nights out of the week (Friday - Sunday) I often don’t go home at all. I barely have time to do anything for myself and I’ve become a wreck trying to schedule my hobbies and responsibilities around her demands for free time. She gets mad at me if I mention that I want to stay home to do laundry, for example. It’s taking a huge toll on my mental health and I think it’s made me quite resentful in this relationship. I know it’s impacted me, and she’s definitely noticed. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most confusing thing about all of this, however, is that she’s told me that I’m abusive. Nowadays, she gives long lectures on how I’m ruining our relationship, and she demands that I change how I am. I’m not committed enough, I’m not affectionate enough, etc. I tell her that I’ll try to change because I *can* see that it's impacting her, but I feel like I always come up short. When I fail to change the way I am, she tells me that I’m gaslighting her and, honestly, I have no idea if she’s right. I feel like it's possible that I'm doing it without even realizing it. I know I feel resentment and frustration. And I know I want to get out of this relationship quite often (although I’m scared to leave because I’m afraid I’ll have no one), but I’m wondering now if I was the problem all along. I’ve caught myself wondering if I’ve been subtly manipulating my therapist about my situation, for example. I don’t even know if I’m being fully honest here. I’d like to think I’m being as honest about the situation as anyone’s bias will afford them, but I don’t want to paint myself as a spotless victim when I know I have issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know… I think I just needed to vent. I’m so confused and I don’t know where to go. I sometimes think about how killing myself might be easier than dealing with all of this (it won’t actually happen because I have a lot more I want to do in life) but the thought *does* come up. I worry that I might be actively abusing her. Part of me thinks that I'm being ridiculous, but even as I type all of this out, I still feel like I could be different. Things might be better between the two of us if I were. I don’t know… 

&amp;#x200B;

I think she had noticed, because one time i saw her having lunch with her friend, and when i was glancing, i noticed her kind of whispering something to her friend and then they both turned and looked at me (so she maybe told her friend that this guy keeps staring at her). 

&amp;#x200B;

Another time, I had a perfect opportunity, we have kind of a ""balcony"" area inside the building that looks over the first floor of the building (the middle of the building is empty, it's an atrium), and it was quiet, not lots of people around, and near end of day.. As I was walking past her, I was glancing of course and just as I almost passed her she noticed me and started turning her eye slowly and then her head, but once we made some eye contact, It was too late, i was pretty much past her so it wouldve been awkward if i just walked back to her to say hi randomly. If I had acted faster, I feel i couldve said hi normally or somehting.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, any advice on what I should do or how i should approach? I've never talked to her or worked with her, and I dont even know what her job is. It's an engineering company so 80% of people are men, so i dont want her to  feel like im ""attacking"" her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, same thing kinda happened but she was on the phone so i couldnt have said hi.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you ave any suggestions on how I should even say ""hi"" or how to approach her or even find her (not lots of company events happen here), please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

My worry is that if she is an intern, then she may be gone in 4 months, so I dont know if that's enough of a window. (Im not an intern, but would be 1-2 years older only)."

dyru5m,3,2019-11-19,I think i might be going over my limit. [weed],pata_salada,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/dyru5m/i_think_i_might_be_going_over_my_limit_weed/,"Hello, I've  (F24) been using weed for about 3 years now. My first time was when  i was 19 years old. Didn't make it an habit until 2 years ago. First i started doing it only on saturdays... Then on sundays. Then on weekdays. I realized i fucking love weed and it is something i share with my partner. 

I had some  surgery on my shoulder that led to a period of chronic pain. I was out of the office during two months. I came back to my home town, and spend the entire eight weeks smoking and eating. Smoking and eating. Smoking and eating. Needless to say i gained a lot of weight. A LOT.

 I really, really LOVE weed. First, i had some paranoia based on all the crap i was taught as a child. I made peace with that, and determined that weed will not lead to my demise and would not ruin my life. 

I'm currently on psychiatric treatment for depression and social anxiety for over three years now. (escitalopram &amp; xanax) My doctor knows i smoke weed and it is not , in fact, something that has made my treatment any different.

The reason to my post is that i feel i *might* be abusing weed. Yes, i smoke daily since the surgery. But i did it after a long day of work. everything is so fine when you are high, I fucking love that feeling. Then i thought : 'well, nobody can tell when i'm stoned, so whats the danger of smoking some bowls before heading out to my office? First i did it to make my commute 'happier' and easier. 

Then, i started to have a really deep feeling of guilt even before i hit the bong. It is a feeling i really really dont like. I arrive at my office scared, paranoid, sad, but stoned. Really stoned. I will not say where i work, but it is a very big business where everything is so perfect and corporate. In a way or another, i like the feeling that i was 'fighting' corporate when i arrive so stoned. But now, it just saddens me. and makes me feel irresponsible. 

Now that i'm having some problems on the job (retaliation, on the job assignments since i spoke up because i was getting bullied by another coworkers. I was moved from the project. And now i only get projects that some intern can do). It makes me really really sad. Less motivated. Smoked a ton more of weed. When im not at the office, i'm hitting the bong. No exception. 

When i sit down on my home desk, i feel like i'm nailed to the chair and i cannot get up until i'm blindly high from weed. (to eat, to do some chore, to work on my hobbies) 

I really enjoy weed, but i don;t like that i'm hitting it obsessively. feel so desmotivated and lazy. 

Makes me so nervous thinking about quitting weed. I really love it. But i don't like this vicious cycle which makes me to sad and guilty. What should i do?"

I live in a large-ish city with a pretty active recreational drug use culture. There is also a large social scene in general, and Instagram event pages are pretty popular. I want to make a page that has posts like “Top 5 Places to Trip This Weekend.”

It’s a fun idea that I’ve discussed with some old coworkers (internship at a newspaper so we’re all into social media and drugs lol), and they loved it. I don’t expect it to become a big thing or even to get more than 20 followers, but I think it’ll be fun to make. I don’t plan on making it obvious that I run the account because of employers and such. Yes, I know there’s always a risk they’ll find out anyway somehow. 

I have some concerns that I would love other people’s opinions on, and I came to r/drugs cuz I usually get good advice here (and also to avoid the “Don’t use drugs!!!11!1!” comments lol)

1. Will venues get mad at me if I list their events as great places to do drugs? Will they be able to have my posts taken down? Could I pass with just laying low and not tagging them?

2. Should I worry about illegal drug charges/the law in general? This is probably just me being paranoid considering Vice does stuff like this.

3. Would you enjoy a page like this for your area? I’m curious to know what others think outside my social circle."

One of them I understand why they ended it. The other one was a bit petty and sad that it ended at the same. they both confronted me at the same time while I was still grieving over my dog who recently passed away a couple of weeks before that. On top of that, I didn't even know they had a problem with me at a time before they confronted me.

Friend 1: I came for her about a story that I thought was intended for me but really wasn't about me in front of a group chat with a really close friend where we all trusted each other. Which is my fault because I should have asked her personally.  
Friend 2: I forgot that I gave her my phone to record for her interview for her internship and I used my find my phone app and it rang during her interview and according to her I didn't apologize which I thought I did and now it's too late and she won't let me apologize for it. This bothers me because I was nice to give her my phone, my teacher said that he would not give her a bad grade for not getting an internship because it was a simple mistake that I forgot that I gave my phone to her, and I did so many other nice things for her too out of my kindness.

I have apologized to both of them, but they did not really accept it ( friend one said it's whatever and she doesn't hate me, but I would have to build that friendship again, but when I try to it feels like she wasn't even trying and not talking to me. Friend two said she forgives me, but don't want to be friends anymore). I know I had to move on and people told me too and I have (or so I have thought so because why am I writing here.). However, sometimes I still think about them and all the memories that we just had and I think about what went wrong because it wasn't even a year ago where we had a good time spending time with each other. The last time I talked to them was on the day of my birthday (almost a month ago) and I just wrote them like a thank you for being my friend and I will cherish the memories that we had (like a goodbye letter) and they both thought I was having a pity party, but I was not. I really wish the best for both of them and I'm not mad at them. It's not like I hate them so much I wish they would die or something bad would happen to them. I still have them on social media (I don't know when I'm ready to remove them right now I just have their post and story on mute) and their phone number. In addition to that, It's hard to avoid them too due to a few things.

1. friend two has a lot of classes with me and I think she keeps on looking at me and when I look at her for a split second she looks away
2. I always see friends one in the hallways and everywhere I go, but I just try to avoid her too.
3. all of us have the same friends and it's just so odd to go up to the friends now and friend two is with them all the time. Now I would just let her be and try to avoid then group when she is there and when she is not there I hang out with the friend group, but it just feels different like I'm not close to them anymore (my friends know my situation and they agree with me that it is sad that this happened with friend 1 and 2 over a something small, but they are still friends with me and them. Which is whatever, but I can't control who they are friends with). Now I just hang out with a different group of friends who supported me throughout this situation but don't hang out with friends two that much.

I heard about the program from a post in this subreddit and a friend of mine. I was at a low point in my life. I was ready to quit college. I was filled with anger, boredom, and envy. I was stuck in what they called a ""community college trap"" where I had to take a lot of classes to even take a lot of classes I need to even consider myself ready for transfer. 

I was also broke and wanted to find a way to become more independent from family. 

the first 6 months of the program are called learning and development where we learn the hard and soft skills of the chosen track. In Los Angeles, there were only two tracks at the site, IT(the Track I'm in) and Business. they are real college classes we had to take. Business English and Bussiness communications where we learn how to write emails, memos, letters, and whatnot. Computer Hardware where I learn how to build a computer. Computer software where I learn how to set up a computer. Got trained in Powerpoint, Word, Access, and Excel. We also learn soft skills like delivering a pitch of yourself. They teach a lot about believing in yourself and how to navigate the workplace as a POC. 

The second 6 months is at a worksite YearUp place you at. It's an internship that I earn. Right now I'm an AV tech at facebook. I will be working there till February 

YearUp is a great place to start if you want skills to pay the bills. it can launch a career that is high paying.

Recently, I took a campus tour of CSU Long Beach and I marveled on how nice the school sounded, with all of it’s included amenities with your tuition and how pretty the school is. I am considering applying for this school when I graduated because it has majors I’m interested in, along with being near the beach. I also heard that there are many internship opportunities since many of the professors work in the field still (for engineering anyway).

However, I looked through this subreddit to find many students having trouble with mental health and the overall stress level that comes with college and stuff like that, and I began to wonder if what I heard from the tour was maybe too good to be true and it wasn’t as good as a school as I thought. I’m taking these posts with a grain of salt however because I don’t know how the amount of redditors stacks up to the general student population (with CSULB being so diverse and all).

So I would like to hear your honest thoughts about the school. Kinda things like: student life, general comfort, and how much of what I said above is true...if that makes any sense. Basically, what do you think about this school? And what are some other cool things to know about this school?

(BTW, I’m planning to major in Aerospace or Computer engineering and it would help if you had any information about those majors)"

I did an internship where I worked on AST and interpreters (even
compilation).  I was browsing the web about the subject when I found
this website: it was by an engineer that worked his whole life on
compilators and was sharing some techniques and his experience about
it. It was really interesting.

Unfortunately, I don't have the link anymore. I think that I got it
from a link on a stackoverflow comment. I think that the main color of
the website was grey, not sure though.

If you've seen this website and still got the link, could you send it

As a young teen, I had a hard time going out to eat, as I was terrified at the thought of my food not being properly prepared. Traveling was always really difficult, and I’d almost always have panic attacks on the way to the airport, as well as on the first morning of my trip. 

As a high schooler, I didn’t ever consider going to college out of state, as the idea of being more than three hours from home was too much to handle. In college, studying abroad was always something I dreamed of doing, but I was too afraid to go to another country all alone. I failed a lot in college too- my anxiety stopped me from admitting that I was struggling, even though I knew that I would do better if I just asked for help. 

I’m 22 now, and in less than seven weeks, I will be packing up my car, driving 1,100 miles away from home, and starting my dream internship. I’ll be living in a new house, in a new state, with people I’ve only talked to a handful of times. I’ll be away from my family, my friends, and my pets for three months. I’m leaving everything I’ve ever known behind, and I couldn’t be more excited! 

If you told me four years ago that I’d be doing this, I would have laughed. Never in a million years did I think my anxiety would allow me to do something like this! When I received the email offering me this position, I started crying, because I was so proud of myself for the progress I’ve made. I know I’ll still have my anxiety when I’m down there, and I know it won’t be easy, but I refuse to let it rule my life anymore!"
dyzl3p,3,2019-11-20,My [34M] GF [29F] broke up with me because her parents are emotionally manipulating her into an arranged marriage.,ArrangedThrowaway123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dyzl3p/my_34m_gf_29f_broke_up_with_me_because_her/,"White Canadian guy here. An Indian girl started at my work 2 years ago, and we instantly hit it off. After a year of friendship, we began dating and it was going great.

She moved in with me after 6 months, when her internship finished and she graduated. I'd like to say it was perfect, but every once in awhile, I'd get blindsided by accusations of infidelity that made no sense.

One night she demanded to go through my phone to look for signs of cheating, and I denied her. I told her I didn't want a relationship that had so little trust and she either needed to learn to trust or we needed to break up. She decided she wanted to break up.

She had finally gotten a job the next city over. I told her there was no rush for her to leave, but she should start finding a place close to her new work. Two days after this conversation, and a day before she started her new job, we got into an argument about something petty and she decided she was leaving right then. She packed her stuff, I helped her load it into the elevator and I left.

I was at peace with how it ended. Sad that it wasn't going to work out with someone I do love, but happy we had the time we did together if that makes any sense. It was probably the best I'd ever mentally handled a breakup.

She contacted me a few weeks later, saying we needed to talk face to face. I tried to keep it to text or phone call, but she was insistent.

I picked her up, we grabbed a coffee and parked to talk. She immediately started ugly crying. Something I'd never seen from her. It was bad.

When I finally calmed her down enough that I could understand her, she told me that whenever she would accuse me of cheating, she was looking to start a fight that would end our relationship in a way that would leave me hating her. Her parents, back home in India, were dead set against her being with a white guy and constantly pressuring her to break up. Going so far as to tell her that if we were to marry, they would kill themselves.

As soon as she told them we were broken up, they set up an arranged marriage. She has tried to fight back on it, but they are insisting that she marry this random guy they found so she doesn't make them look bad.

I've tried to talk to her to stand up to them and say no, but she is scared of them commiting suicide because of how Indian society would view them. They don't show any compassion for her not wanting to marry a stranger and to be with me.

We've been broken up a month and the wedding date is already set.

I'm trying to convince her that she has freewill to do as she pleases and doesn't have to marry anyone, but she insists she has to or else she will hurt her parents enough that they die.

I feel like absolute shit saying that if her parents can't respect her right to choose her life, she needs to cut them out. Telling her that, makes me feel like the same controlling toxic person that I view her parents as.

I'm lost and don't know what to do. Any advice, preferably from someone sikh/Indian would be greatly appreciated. 

Ultimately, she isn't being forced into it by gun point, and it's by her own freewill she'll board the plane and return home to marry, but her parents are using really manipulative tactics to ensure this happens, regardless of my gf's wishes. 

Tl;Dr:  Girlfriend is being forced into arranged marriage by parents threatening self harm.  Don't know how to get her to stand up for what she wants, even if it hurts her family."
dz03un,2,2019-11-20,My GF (23F) loves me (24M) but she says she wants a break,thr0wn4waaay,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dz03un/my_gf_23f_loves_me_24m_but_she_says_she_wants_a/,"Hello everyone, I'm in need of some advice about the relationship I want to save.

My GF and I met in college and have been together for 2 and a half years. We are both each other's first and had amazing time during the so called ""honeymoon"" period. We started slow but soon found ourselves crazy in love, at the same time as being each other's moral support and best friend. 

The thing is, she had some plan to make an internship (something that is required of her from the uni) and decided to make it the big city of H about 5 hours away from our home. I strongly suggested she should also consider locations closer to me, but her mind was made up. It seemed like a hard challange but as in love as we were, I swallowed it. About an year passed as we kept our relationship long distance, only seeing each other once or twice a month. While she got used to her surroundings and managed to make some friends, I feel like I became depressed and lethargic, sad and lazy. Still I didn't tell her about it, doing my best to support her. It was hard not to notice it though. 

One year has passed and she lives in my hometown again. We feel a bit more distant but this may be just due to us having passed the ""honeymoon"" phase. I decided to talk to her about my feelings, since she mentioned she'd love to make an exchange program in the future, changing countries for about a semester. I couldn't last another 6 months like the year before and I confronted her on that. She told me she didn't love me and we broke up. A hard whole day. The very next day we spoke again and decided to make up, go slower and not jump to conclusions, give ourselves some freedom and try to make this work. 

Here we are, a month later, having put more thought and work in our relationship, we both love each other again. Honesty is something we value highly and I have no doubt she thinks she loves me. However... last night we had a conversation about our future and I suggested it would be good for our relationship to move in together, try to become an even bigger part of each other's life. To be fair, we spend a lot of time together as it is and she sometimes spends more than a week at my place. We had talked about this and we both understand how big of a step that is, but I surely don't see it as strong as say marriage, which I feel like she does.

She then told me she can't be sure she wants to spend more of her life together with me and can't know if I'm the man for her, me being her first and only. Also she said I were too invested in this relationship, not taking proper care of myself and my goals, something I've been putting more work into in the past month. As we digged deeper into our thoughts, she said she did love me but she might need some time off in the future, to be with herself and probably meet other people. She also wants to keep the exchange plan. We agreed it may be a mistake but she said she needed it, even though we might be losing something great here. 

Now, I said she needs some time off in the future, because she enjoys my company and being with me, and 4 months from now I myself have an intership, which for the longest time I had planned to do in some other big city, but have mentioned that if we are still working on our relationship I'd gladly find an internship here in our city. All in all we decided to enjoy what we have but the pause is probably coming during my internship.

Now... what should I do? Stick to the plan and risk losing her (or finding someone else to care about)? Or break it off now so she hopefully feels my lack in her life and finds out what she is missing on? Or is there some other way I don't see to save this relationship?"

Some thoughts:

Microsoft office/excel certs
Manufacturing engineer cert - atleast 2-3 job posting listed this as a plus
SQL cert/training - I've started to use sql to speed up my data pulls and would love to learn to do it better
PLC cert/training - I dont want to be a process controls engineer or start crossing into the EE territory,  but there are several times it would have been useful to have more PLC knowledge to troubleshoot a problem or prep for a project

dz0ugv,2,2019-11-20,How to convince that any major that’s not STEM is useless?,froggiekirbyten,CollegeMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/dz0ugv/how_to_convince_that_any_major_thats_not_stem_is/,"My mother thinks that any major that’s not STEM is basically like an English major, completely useless and a waste of money. But English majors aren’t completely useless or a waste of money, it’s just often used as placeholder for this kind of thing. Ya know. 

Anyway, I’m interested in Digital Media major, with possibly a minor in either advertising or business. (I’m a junior, for context, I’m starting to think). I’m only really interested in this major because it provides more creative freedom, but is still associated with computers, coding, stuff like that. But the film editing and writing, animation, music, and game industry related aspects of the major are what interests me. 

What truly interests me is, oddly enough, the history of businesses and material goods, like toys. While I absolutely despise world history, human history, I love learning about old advertisements and how they’ve changed, the evolution of commercial goods (or really devolution), or the history of a company, whether it’s dead, alive, or budding. But that doesn’t exist as a major, so my interests in technology and art will have to work together. 

I’m the youngest of three. My older siblings are both STEM majors, one a chemical engineer, the other a environmental scientist (more or less a meteorologist). My mom was showing me internship programs for sciences, and I expressed disinterest and just stated the name of the major I’m looking into, and immediately starting bashing it. 

For more context, my family is financially viable to support the three of us through undergrad. Both of my older siblings were supported, and it’s very lucky. My mom started bashing saying how she wouldn’t financially support me going to college to “draw cartoons”, even though that’s not really the point of the major. I don’t really care about the money aspect, I’ll go into debt and work my ass off to pay it off if I could, it’s just my mom has a lot of power in the decisions of the house. She wouldn’t let me go through with applying for that major at all, she’d shut it down. 

I’ve dabbled with computer science before, I’m in a computer science AP class, but I just don’t see myself doing that. While that part of technology is interesting, just sitting down and coding, or messing with the hardware and components of everything doesn’t seem interesting. I put it as, I’d rather be a writer or a video editor than an IT support person, or sitting in an office basement and working on servers. 

What should I do to convince her? Or should I just abandon ship entirely and come up with a new idea?"

New to reddit as I am writing my first post. A little background from my side. I was always interested in the field of computers playing around with the default tools and applications of a 90's PC(I know I am old) which was a turning point in my childhood. As a child I just wanted to understand hows this magical device works and is there any way to improve it? I had this strange feeling in my mind that owning my own 'Super computer' would be too cool. Fast forward to class 12th, I did decent enough  (167/360 without coaching JEE mains and 93.60% CBSE Science) to get a fucking SPOT ROUND seat via ACPC. I cried myself to death when I was not admitted to DAIICT but I was finally relieved to have admitted to CSE, Nirma.

I was always in the top 3% of the class throughout my studies at school. My goal was to maintain that during college tenure. First year was a total fuck with random units that made no sense. Most of the people I met were really weird and didn't have that drive to learn about IT or computers. I asked them why they took CSE seat and they were all(more than 90%) like because my friends were doing it, it ranks higher, CS people get highest package or the worst: they didn't want to do mechanical, civil or electrical so they came in here. I was in a shock to learn the hard facts of like that COLLEGE IS A SCAM. I was forced to sit and waste time to attend worthless lectures where professors used to read slides and assign stupid assignments that everyone copied. As time passed, I started losing my interest and my grades plummeted. During all this Hodge podge, I failed 2 units - Engineering graphics and Economics. Only motivation I had was my girlfriend at that time. She studied EC and we were from same city. I graduated in 2018 somehow at 6.75/10 and landed with an internship in Pune. It was a non technical role but I didn't enjoy it though the pay was damn gooooood. If I had continued to work for them my compensation would have been 8LPA. That's too good for someone with 6.75 and who learnt nothing at college. However, in my defence, I had people skills, managerial and leadership skills with strong communications both written and verbal. 

And then Life happened.

She dumped me(long story) ending our 4.5 years on and off relationship. I have heard(blocked everywhere) she is now dating some other dude now. She now works for Intel, Bengaluru and makes ton of money. I am really happy for her and wish her goodluck in both romantic life and professional life.

For me, I left soon after finishing my internship and took a gap of 6 months due to college burnout and emotional turmoil.

Now, after almost 2 years all my batchmates are working at great companies, doing fantastic in life, moving abroad. Working multiple jobs and getting married. 

While I am struggling with crippling anxiety and depression due to lack of any emotional support (This is the longest I have stayed single), tremendous stressful studies, parental pressure and poor living habits. I don't have that drive to keep studying just to bullshit the exams.

I am 23, lost with no future or hope writing to you from Sydney, Australia while I am on a verge of collapse as I am about to finish my second semester here at University of Sydney (#46) with just passing marks for Master of IT and IT Management.

Hi all, I recently received my permanent resident status in Canada and have started to look at applying for medical school both in Canada and the United States! I’ll be defending my masters thesis this upcoming spring of 2020 and wanted some advice in terms of which tier med schools I should apply for with the following stats:

cGPA: 3.7

MCAT: 512

Research: 4 first author publications and 8 other co-author publications with 10 conference and poster presentations. A lot of hours in different fields of research with a patent that we recently published.

Clinical shadowing: a lot of hours here too (\~2000 hours) with running my own clinical trial with a cardiologist looking at statin intolerance and myopathy. Also did a cardiothoracic surgical internship at Stanford for a month every summer for the last two years.

Any schools that love heavy research stats? 😅 thanks so much guys in advance. Really new to all this med school apps stuff so i really do appreciate it for any impressions or mini-feedbacks."
dz3ynk,1,2019-11-20,Some Unintelligible Rant,HanabiMao,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dz3ynk/some_unintelligible_rant/,"Scrolling through LINE post tonight, saw my past 'wisdom' posts is cringy. Then I saw my past profile pictures, basically pictures of me and my ex.

For context, my ex and I had been together for 2 and almost 3 years when we broke up. Started dating at the end of second semester in 10th grade and ended before national exam in 12th. 2 weeks after, she's dating with my ex-best friend. At the time when I knew they were dating, I was furious. Cursing their relationship like they won't last long, etc. But the reality is that they are still together even now (from what I've seen).

There are only 2 to 3 pictures, something that I strangely made me mad at myself. I was thinking in the lines of ""I wish I have more pictures with her"", ""Why did I delete those pictures"", etc. I thought that I finally get rid of her from my mind, but it seems like I was wrong all this time. It really makes me think that I regularly took things for granted.

Then, I'm unsure whether I just miss her or miss having a girlfriend. Because I saw an instastory of one of my ex (first girlfriend) and I speculated that she's taking a picture with her new 'boyfriend' in college. Its not wrong for her to take pictures, but it made me jealous. Stupid, I know.

I miss hugging someone, talk and laugh with someone, giving her gifts, drive her back to her house, going to dates, and all couple-related activities. But I just don't have enough courage to say a simple ""Hi"" to a random stranger. I'm not even brave enough to have a dating app.

The funny thing is, I'm not planning to have a girlfriend until I'm successful and enough money to buy anything and still have huge amount of spare. The reason because I'm thinking about the children that I will have, if there's anyone that wants to be with me tho', and spoiled them and my wife rotten.

I'm still 21 going to 22 and also a college student. But having a taste of a real working environment, currently internship, and knowing my lifestyle when living alone, makes me think of the far future. Although, its not like I have a real working plan to achieve the above. I'm just here, posting unintelligible things on Reddit, while regretting my past."

A few months back, I could've said things are getting better and everything is falling back into place, but November has really brought me down, big time.

Had a break-up back in May, I was actually delighted that I broke up with a very controlling person. She cheated on me, and I was okay with it, because I had been trying to get her off my back for 2-3 months, but because of college and my finals and projects didn't have the time to finish it off, and she always started crying when I started to talk something about our relationship. Moving on, I was excited about my summer internship, where I lead my team, and built a fully functional code, ready to be deployed on a large scale. This was very difficult 2 months, because I practically worked all the time, and I was literally putting my all like a full-time job, even when I was at home. After that, college restarted, and I had my interviews with some big companies and got my next summer internship at one of the technology giants as a software developer. Partied out with my friends to celebrate it and enjoy. The following month, had my midterm exams, which went decently. Everything was working out for me.

October begun, and marks came out, I hadn't done brilliantly but it was okay enough for me to manage. In my free time, I visited my parents, and lived at my child home, for a couple of days alone. I started to think how alone I was, how I missed my time with my ex, how much she looked after me. Nevertheless, I didn't (and don't) want her back, the sole thing that I was not in a relationship like that anymore, made me feel sad. Now, I am not a person who dates or even tries to date girls, but it clicked with her for some reason. I have never tried to make it with some girl, don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-social. I have a girl best-friend but I don't make ""moves"" towards girls, I like to go with the flow. 

Coming to now, my projects and marks this semester haven't been good enough, and this really concerns me, I have a tendency to make my feelings according to my marks and grades. It's really hard for me not to, and yes, I have tried. I have two tests on this Saturday, and I'm really dissapointed with myself, and can't put myself up to study. I become really disinterested at times, but I need to put in the hours, because my finals are also approaching(December first week onwards).  

Life has become hard, and I really want to enjoy, but I can't get myself to."

Hi there, I am Michael 26 from London England. My kik is mjd931

For the longest time I have loved the idea of office sex, I love the idea of professionally dressed woman acting like sluts, being bent over tables or under tables for their bosses. Here are some ideas for an office based roleplay. Enjoy.

1. **Assistant Affair:** You'll play as my assistant and I will have bought my wife something sexy or expensive jewelry, you are so jealous you decide to slide it on and seduce me with it in my marital bed, or in the stationary cupboard. 
2. **Stationary Boy:** I will play the young 18 year old intern whose job it is to get stationary for people, so maybe your character could slide into 'my office' and we could have some fun, or maybe there is a hole leading into the toilet where I was able to slide my cock into.
3. **Glory Hole:** There is unisex toilets in out office and I am made to slide my cock through one in the stall
4. **Distract the boss:** I am the CEO of the company and I am about to come and meet your boss for an important document, which isn't ready, you decide to distract me the best way you know how
5. **IT Guy:** (MY fave): I am the nerdy IT guy who comes and fixers your computer, I am under your desk while you're away and you come back and sit down with no time for me to get away
6. **Caught Watching Porn:** You're my boss and you catch me watching porn, maybe I am taken for a disciplinary meeting
7. **Delivery Guy/Cleaner:** I am a delivery guy or cleaner who is there late at night and I find out it's all a front for a sex line and that's how they are making their money, there is only one way they're keeping me quiet."

dz5qn4,1,2019-11-20,12 Things You Should Know about Creating an In-House Patent Program,StellarKent,u_StellarKent,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_StellarKent/comments/dz5qn4/12_things_you_should_know_about_creating_an/,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ymcy1yuksvz31.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06201e91c1a9977e9a02e9fc803930cafa2f9580

 

For companies that bring new products to market, setting up an in-house patent program is a great way to acknowledge and reward the creative thinkers that boost your bottom line. People who can come up with new products and processes to expand your production capacities are invaluable and should be celebrated.

**1) Do Your Homework**

However, if your patent award program management system includes monetary compensation, you will need to put some rules in process on the front end and carefully monitor those listed on the patent.

For example, you may need to implement pre-employment disclosures to be agreed upon before hiring your designers and engineers. The goal of these disclosures is to make sure that both parties (potential employee and potential employer) are aware of possible awards and ultimate ownership of the patent.

**2) Invest In Good Data Gathering**

One of the hallmarks of a successful creative team is the ability to have idea-churning meetings where everyone is able to speak freely. This type of communication is critical to any organization hoping to move forward with new products and processes.

Make sure to have good record-keeping habits at these meetings. Should one of these ideas develop into a patentable product, you will want to be able to go back and gather the names of those who were in on the ground floor. When it comes time to celebrate or hand out monetary awards, you will have backup for your decisions to award corporate patent awards.

**3) Stay Transparent**

While not everyone on the creative team may qualify for a cash award, you can structure your [patent awards](https://www.stellarkent.com/patent-awards/) to the recipients and expand the award footprint to include your implementation team, including lab techs and administrative support.

**4) Due Diligence**

One of the more challenging processes for an in-house patent counsel is confirming that everyone listed on the patent was actually involved in the creation of the product. It’s natural for co-workers who spend a lot of hours together to want to support and promote one another, but not everyone on the team is actually an inventor.

[In-house patent practitioners](https://www.uspto.gov/topic/ip-organizations-and-agencies) will need to carefully review and connect with all members of the design and development team to be listed on the patent. If, in your fiduciary responsibility to the company, you have to omit someone, you will need to successfully defend that decision.

**5) Be Prepared For The Long Haul**

Patents take time. From initial filing to rejection or allowance, the US Patent and Trade Office tries to reply within [12 months](http://www.ericksonlawgroup.com/law/patents/patentfaq/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-patent/). This time period may include a great deal of back and forth and communication with multiple offices and people, so stay flexible.

**6) Document Your Steps**

Your responsibilities in submitting patent applications and monitoring communications thereafter include careful monitoring of your support staff and subordinates. If there is a breakdown in this communication process, you can be [denied access to patent submittals](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/ip/boards/oed/Eighth_Annual_GSU_Corporate_IP_Institute_27Oct2014.pdf) or even suspended.

For in-house IP professionals, balancing the demands of employer, designers/engineers and the patent office can be challenging. Keep your cool, monitor your subordinates and track your communications.

**7) Celebrate Milestones**

Submitting the application is a great milestone, and “patent pending” is an exciting place to be! When celebrating this initial step, be sure to celebrate everyone involved in the submittal process. Public receptions and office parties are a great way to include both designers and the support team.

**8) Make Things Visible**

Once a patent is pending, make it visible. Even though you won’t get a certificate when a patent is pending, consider creating a simple poster that you can mark up as milestones are reached.

**9) Make Things Permanent**

Once the patent is awarded and you have your organization has received the reward, make it permanent! Create a [wall of success](https://www.stellarkent.com/patent-awards/displays/) for employees and guests alike to note and enjoy this award.

There are multiple options for setting up a patent display wall. If your organization has the goal of receiving many patents, be sure to start this display in a place that it can easily be expanded.

**10) When It’s Time To Renew**

Patent renewal fees are not cheap, so it’s important to monitor the necessary renewal windows to avoid being hit with a surcharge. Additionally, there may be patents that can be allowed to lapse as the proprietary data is no longer in use by the organization.

Do the legwork early to make sure leadership is aware of renewals and fees coming up. Paying an unnecessary renewal fee or letting a critical patent lapse could be extremely costly to your organization.

**11) Monitor Patent History**

Your patent incentive award program can get a terrific boost during renewal season. This is an ideal time to bring in retired employees for a visit or reconnect with those who’ve left under positive circumstances back into the facility to celebrate patent renewals.

**12) Recruiting Possibilities**

Creative, visionary employees are hard to find and harder to keep. You won’t know if a former employee would consider returning until you ask, and a renewal party is a great time to remind them of how well treated they were by your organization.

In addition, this part of your patent reward program will encourage younger employees to look long-term and make a deeper commitment to the organization. The apprentices, interns and new hires of today may well be your design team of tomorrow, so let the newest employees see their chance to build a successful future with your organization.

Building a successful in-house patent program takes time and dedication to detail. You can promote this program by [making success visible](https://www.stellarkent.com/contact/). For your business to grow, you need to be constantly improving and advancing your product line. By including all of your employees in this crucial area of growth, you can build a bright future of innovation."

I’m currently studying for my Administrator cert, and my main sources of learning are Trailhead, the candidates I speak to, and FocusonForce. I’m becoming more comfortable with things every day, and love how much there is to learn. 

I’m looking for advice on how best to get a job allowing me hands on experience with the platform, and ideally help me transition into a role as a Developer in the long term (I do not have a background in CS). From the advice I’ve gotten thus far, it seems like 3 good options after getting certified are:

1) Apply directly to a consultancy (Deloitte, Acumen, Accenture, etc.) for a Business Analyst role and gradually transition internally with experience 
2) Apply for a Salesforce internship for next summer, and following that begin a full time job search
3) Try to gain work experience by doing pro bono work for a Non Profit

If anyone has any insight on how to best navigate these waters, I’d really appreciate any and all perspectives! Thanks in advance :)"
dz6f7i,12112,2019-11-20,Entitled Mother kills her Child and ruins the career of my Sister-in-law,OneWhoLived,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/dz6f7i/entitled_mother_kills_her_child_and_ruins_the/,"First of all, it is a long and a horrible story, so apologies in advance. Second, English is not my first language so pardon any mistake I may make.

This happened in August 2017 and involves two lengthy lawsuits, one of which lasted one and half years and another for almost 2 years. I'm not directly involved in it, as it happened to my Sister-in-law. Back in 2017, my sister-in-law (sil for short) was in her final year for nursing school. She was required to intern as trainee nurse for 6 months. She chose to join a private school for her internship. It was one of those ""International"" private schools where kids of ultra rich parents go.

**Part - 1 The Incident**

15th of August is India's Independence day, and there was a celebration in the school. It was your usual flag ceremony with flag march by students and student band, some plays by student depicting events of freedom movement, some cultural exhibition put together by each class, food and game stalls by teacher etc. At the end of the day, top 3 class performances (Plays and Cultural exhibition) were awarded, and select students were given ""Certificate of excellence"" for outstanding performances.

Everything was going normal in the beginning, but a student collapsed during the parade, so he was brought in the Doctor's office. Doctor checked him and found that he was running moderate fever, he was also slightly dehydrated. So the doctor gave him some medicines, asked my sil to give him a glass of glucose water. He scolded the kid for participating in the parade while in fever and wrote him a note excusing him from any further activity. He then asked the kid if his parents were present, and the kid said that his mother was there. So doctor told him he could go home if he wanted or he could sit in shade with his mother to watch the rest of the ceremony. The kid asked if he could just stay there and rest for a while, so the doctor said that he could use one of the beds to take a nap.

Since there was nothing else to do in the office, the Doctor excused himself to go and have something to eat from the stalls, leaving my Sil and a janitor in the office. Hardly 5 minutes later, the Mother (EM) marched in the office and went directly to check on her child. My sil tried to tell her that the kid was running a fever and taking a nap but EM ignored her. She shook the kid and asked him how was he feeling. The kid said, fine. EM said - ""Good. Now get up, you gotta get ready for your play sweetie, everyone else is already dressed up!"" My sil again tried to explain - ""He is running a fever, he wants to rest."" EM replied - ""Oh its fine, he is fine, aren't you sweetie?"" The kid just looked at my sil. Sil said - ""The doctor has excused him from other activities. it would be better if you just take him home and let him rest."" EM said - ""It is just a play, I'm sure my sweetie can handle it. He is a tough man! Isn't that right Sweetie?"" Sil tried again - ""It would be better for him to just rest, he is still under fever."" And with that EM lost her mind, she screamed to my SIL's face - ""Oh! You know what's better for him? I'm his mother, I know what's best for him! How dare you? My son is the topper of his class, he is playing the most important part in the play! He is the best! If he doesn't participate in the play, he will not get the Certificate of Excellence. He needs to stay at the top of everything or else he'll become a laughing stock, so don't you dare tell me what's better for him""

The kid seeing his mother losing her mind, stood up and said to my sil with a smile -""Its okay sister, I'm fine. Thanks for caring for me"". Shocked and stunned my sil only managed to say - ""Let me call the doctor"". EM retorted - ""I come from a family of doctors. My father is the director of \[A well known private hospital\], you people aren't even qualified enough to work in a hospital...huff."" She grabbed the arm of her child and marched away. My Sil called the doctor, who said - ""Well it's her child, what can we do? We did our part.""

About an hour later, the same kid was rushed in again, as he again collapsed during the play. The doctor checked on him, gave him an injection and asked him to be transferred to a hospital immediately as the kid was unconscious and not responding. An ambulance was called and Kid was taken to the hospital. The day ended without any other incident.

Two days later the school learned that the kid passed away in the hospital. My sil was distraught upon hearing the news. She kept crying for rest of the day. She kept saying how it was her fault, and how she could have prevented it if she stood her ground. How the kid smiled at her and thanked her for caring for him. We told her that it wasn't her fault, and consoled her to the best of our abilities. Even her professor from nursing school came and tried to make her feel better.

About a week later, she was informed that the school was opening an inquiry and a board of inquiry will look into the matter and that she will be called for interview. The doctor assured her that it was just a formality for school to cover all the bases, and she didn't need to worry about it. In her interview she stated everything that happened. She was then asked why she felt it was her fault, as she said so to the class teacher of the kid in her crying fit. She explained that at the time she was overwhelmed by emotions and and thought she could have done things differently. She was asked if there was anyone who will corroborate her story and she named the janitor who was present in the office at the time. She was then informed that she was placed under suspension until the inquiry concludes. When she went back to collect her things from the office, Doctor once again assured her that there was nothing to worry about, he will make sure that no harm will come to her.

Few days later, she received a letter from the school that they concluded the investigation and found her guilty of negligence and thus her contract was terminated. She called the school supervisor who informed her that her story did not match the story told by the doctor and the janitor, thus there was nothing that can be done. Termination of contract meant that she couldn't complete her final term on time, so she put the application for extension to the nursing school. She thought it was over, but boy were we in for a bomb dropped on us!

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2 - The Legal Trouble**

A few days later, two cops knocked on the door of my Father-in-law and asked to speak to my sil. They informed them that the family of the kid filed an FIR (First Incident Report) against my sil. They accused her to cause the death of the kid. They asked if they can question her but my father-in-law denied and told them them they can only question her in the presence of a lawyer. So the cop asked her to come to police station the next day for the questioning. We got the lawyer immediately, who at first called the cops and asked for a later date to be set for the question. Then he told us to get an anticipatory bail asap, in case police decides to arrest her, so we did. In the questioning the lawyer talked for the most part, he provided them with the written statement of my sil. The police asked their questions, and directed my sil to not leave the state without informing them first etc etc.

Few more days go by, and she received a summon from the court as the state decided to try her for the ""crime"". The Lawyer suggested to track down and speak to the janitor, as he was the only witness in the otherwise ""she said, she said"" case. And so we did. The janitor was reluctant to talk at first, but after my sil begged him, he told us that the doctor told him that if he told the truth, he will be admitting to the same mistake that nurse did and will be fired for sure, and the only way to save himself was to tell the story that Doctor was telling him. The story doctor told to the school's board of inquiry was that Doctor had the kid under observation with the strict instruction that he would not be released under any circumstance. And that my sil released the kid without asking or informing him. We asked him to testify in the court which at first he refused but later agreed with a bit of persuasion. Once we had Janitor on our side, the lawyer also filed a case of wrongful termination against the school accusing the ""inquiry"" to be partial and biased.

Once the court hearing started, we learned that the EM told white lies to the father of the kid. She never told him that she forced the kid to perform in the play, instead she said the kid wanted to play his part. She also hid the fact that nurse objected, and showed her the Doctor's note. Her story was that the kid wanted to participate in the play and when she asked the nurse, the nurse said everything was fine and he could play his part.

The case went on for an year and half. Janitor provided his testimony which the prosecution tried to discredit saying that he told a different story during school inquiry, so he was not a reliable witness. But the judge refused, taking note that the doctor tried to intimidate him, and in turn asked the prosecution if they investigated the doctor's part in the incident as to why he forced janitor to lie and why was he not present during his duty hours? When prosecution replied in negative, the judge asked police to file a case against the school doctor. During her stand, my sil got very emotional and started crying as she recounted the events of that entire day. The only witness prosecution had was child's mother, who couldn't keep her story straight during cross-questioning. finally in the judgement court ruled in my Sil's favor, noting that prosecution's witness had massive holes in her story while defendant provided a solid witness. He also noted that even if prosecution was to be believed, defendant being only a trainee nurse, wasn't even qualified to release the student, and by taking the kid away without the doctor's expressed opinion, the responsibility of consequences fell on the mother of the child. He also commented on school's mismanagement, by not having a fully qualified nurse, they were in violation of federal laws. He scolded the prosecution for having a tunnel vision and going after defendant who was obviously innocent and a vulnerable young girl herself.

after the court ruled in our favor, the school decided to settle the wrongful termination case. It was finalized last month and we can finally put it all behind us. However, due to all the emotional distress and trauma, my sis-in-law decided to drop out of nursing school, thus ending her dreams of becoming a nurse. She will probably join an honors course next year, but right now she is still troubled with the nightmares of going to jail and needs therapy to get over it. The police has opened a fresh case against the Doctor who was let go from the school this year. He is also being investigated by State's medical association for wrong doings, if found guilty he will be barred from practice. We have no information on EM or her husband.

Edit: Thank you kindly the generous Redditor for my first gold. Although I'm not sure if I deserve it, after all this is the story of my sister-in-law. Thank you again!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: Wow this blew up! I was not expecting it to get as much attention, given the horribleness of the story. Thank you for all the support and love you have given. Kind redditors who gave me Platinum, Gold and Silver, thank you for your generosity.

And Finally to all the people who are looking/searching for news reports or asking for one. As I said in one of the comments, it did make to local news but I will not provide any link, or give even a remotely identifying detail, because the information in the news can be used to track and doxx my sil. She already had a lot of shit to deal with, many of her peers just assuming her guilt. She is having a lot of trouble dealing with the fallout of this entire episode. She is afraid of even stepping out of the house and she is having frequent nightmares of going to jail. I really do not care whether you believe this story or not, but do not ask me which state it took place or any other detail. I purposefully kept the details in the story as vague as possible. Hope you understand. Thank you once again."

dz7439,2,2019-11-20,hung up during an technical interview,burneraccount11235,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dz7439/hung_up_during_an_technical_interview/,"I just hung up during a technical interview/coding video session because I was having an anxiety attack and couldn’t think straight. They were nice people interviewing me, but I couldn’t think right so I just shut down my computer and hyperventilated for the last 10 minutes. 

I know I’m a strong developer but I have really horrible anxiety with technical interviews/coding with people in order to get a job. I’m scared I’ll never get a job because of my crippling anxiety. I love coding and I have a lot of fun when I do it, and the internships I’ve had were some of the best times of my life, but when it comes to interviewing and having people watch me code, I get incredibly anxious and can’t think. And then I convince myself I’m not good enough and get scared and hate wasting their time. 

I can’t believe I hung up though. I feel so shitty and don’t even know what to say to them. 

I practice on LeetCode and CodeWars, even do video mock-tech interviews with a group of friends and I’m usually the one who can pull out the answer, but when it’s something actually important like interviewing for a job, my brain fails me."

Excel seems to not work so well doing this and have had to resort to using samples of the data limiting to around 250k-500k each time I export data. Was wondering if there are any free programs or different methods I can use to properly look at these numbers.

My name is Molly and I am a recent graduate of a small liberal arts school in Massachusetts with a degree in Sociology. After school, I worked a temp position for two months in the Boston Area at a non-profit while I did the Boston University online Paralegal Certificate Program. (Yes I know it is not ABA-approved but it was the only reasonable program for me to do while I worked a 9-5 job. Since then, I successfully finished the program and am working in retail in New York City (my hometown) as I hope to get a paralegal job in Washington D.C to permanently move. So far, I have attempted to go through several recruitment firms and applied to many paralegal jobs in the D.C area but this is the first time I am not even hearing back from anyone at all. Robert Half Legal is the only recruitment firm that reached out to me but now their legal team won't work with me because I don't have ""enough legal experience."" I do have legal intern experience at a law firm in London but I feel completely stuck and lost. Does anyone have any advice in terms of obtaining paralegal or legal assistant positions in the D.C area? Or am I looking in the wrong location?"

dz9lqn,3,2019-11-20,I messed up the interview for my dream job,claudiassofia91,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/dz9lqn/i_messed_up_the_interview_for_my_dream_job/,"Today I had an interview for what was my dream job. I am notoriously bad at interviews since I always get either excessively confident or incredibly nervous. Knowing that, I practiced A LOT since I knew this interview was coming (there's a specific time of year to apply to this job and I knew I was going to get at least to the first interview because I have a good resume, companies always call me for interviews but after meeting me they never want anything to do with me). I read a bunch of books about how to make people like you, I prepared the hell out of the interview and I just practiced in front of a mirror a bunch of times. I'm not a naturally charismatic person. When I tell people that, they're always surprised because conversation with people I know is easy for me (like it is for most people) but I have a lot of difficulties establishing a rapport with someone and people rarely like me immediately. I'm mostly ok with that in my personal life since I don't feel like it affects it too much. But it's been a nightmare in my professional life.
I just graduated college in June and am currently frequenting my Masters. I'm trying to obtain my first ""real"" job (I've had internships and part-times before but I never really had to prepare too much for those) and I've been turned down A LOT. At first, that really affected my self-esteem. To be completely honest I was entitled and thought that since I had worked my butt off on my resume the rest would just come naturally. So, of course, when it didn't I had a very rude awakening.  My field is a very human interaction-related field, therefore, of course, that's something they're attentive to in interviews. My field implies (or at least so I thought) a lot of seriousness. I have since realized that's not what they're looking for. I reevaluated myself after those first few terrible interviews and really worked on it.
When the time came to apply to this job, my dream job, I already knew what I had to do. I prepared myself accordingly. As a result, the first interview was amazing. It's like I had done a complete 180º. I was so happy that I told myself that even if I didn't get it I would be happy because I had improved. I was called back for a second interview. And that is where everything went wrong. To be honest I had never gotten to a second interview so I didn't know exactly what to expect or how to prepare. I prepared as I did for the first one, but I just wasn't as confident. That was of course noticeable. The first thing the Human Resources person told me was ""if you're here you already did something right, no need to be nervous"". It embarrassed me so much that she could see right through me. Of course, the interview ended up being really awkward, not at all like the first one. I was very aware of what my body language was doing and was basically stressing over the fact that I knew I looked stressed. I repeated myself a bunch of times and didn't live up to the expectation the first interview had created at all.
I'm sure that the Human Resources person (she was also present at the first interview) wondered if I had multiple personalities and one of them was the super confident, at ease, secure person I had just pretended to be. The ""fake it 'til you make it"" thing is true but if you're not in the mood for acting it can really come around to bite you in the ass.
Anyway, I'm mostly annoyed at myself. It was in my grasp and I ruined it because I couldn't control what my body did for 30 min. I know it's not the end of the world but I'm really disappointed in myself. If any of you have any pointers, I'd genuinely appreciate it because I'm scared I'll never get a job due to my awkwardness."

Following your advice, I decided to flirt with Rachel on Tinder. It wasn't an easy choice, and in hindsight I don't even know if it was the right one. But it's the choice I made. And now I get to live with it. Please help me out again.

Once the decision was made, I fired up Tinder, and I wrote to her the best opener I could come up with.
I literally wrote ""Generic boring opening message""
""lol generic intrigued response"" she answered

From there it was basically on. I went on some kind of autopilot, pretending it wasn't even my own sister I was chatting with.

""Slightly sexual punch line""  
""I am oh so embarrassed""  
""I'll walk it back, but only slightly""  
""Slightly slutty remark that shows I want it""  
""Hint that I want it too""  
""Meet me downstairs then silly"" was the last thing she wrote before logging off

""Fuck fuck fuck!"" I thought to myself ""what now?""

Well, I took the bait and went downstairs. She was sitting on the couch, a blanket covering her up. We sat next to each other and started talking. It started off very innocent. Just chit chatting about her day, and mine. Life after the military. How I'm trying to get into private security for a change. She is hoping to intern with some local politician. Nothing too crazy really.

And then it veered. I don't even know exactly how. But one minute she was telling me about the city manager of such and such small town looking for an intern, and the next minute she is telling me it's been weeks without sex and it's driving her crazy.

She started reminiscing. Her mind flying back to the days in college. She described it as a nice warm spring day. One of the first warm days, actually. She went out with this guy, Josh I think she said. Josh had tried to get her on a date for weeks. Finally she had caved. He was cute. He seemed smart and kind. Worth a try, basically. He took her to this nice restaurant, and then on the way back, they sat in the park. On a bench. He pointed her at the stars. Made up stories about constellations. And then leaned in for a kiss.

""I felt sparks"" she said. ""I don't know if it was the weather being finally so nice and warm, the air soft on my skin, or something about his scent, or whatever, but I felt sparks fly all over my body. I knew I wouldn't be able to say no to him that night. I was his. Whatever he wanted, he would get.""  
""I never fucked on the first date"", she continued. ""But I knew Josh would get to, if only he dared to try""  

After a brief pause, I interjected. ""Did he?"". My throat dry. My voice coarse. It was more than a brother needed to know. And yet I needed to know. I was staring right in front of me. Trying to avoid Rachel's gaze. As if I could pretend she was not my sister that way.

""Well, first we made out. He was gentle. He was slow. He took his sweet sweet time with me. My mouth. My neck. Behind my earlobe. He really knew to push my buttons. By the time he was done, I was one giant puddle of arousal. I could feel my own wetness. I could smell it. I was horny""  
""We laid down on the grass. He took my shirt off. I helped him unclasp my bra. And he had his way with my tits. He kissed them. He licked my nipples. Fuck they were so hard. I was whimpering. I was moaning. I could feel my legs try to clutch around him. I was basically begging him to fuck me. I don't know how we was so slow and dedicated. At one point I even thought he had a tiny dick, or he was gonna cum in seconds, and he was trying to make up for it""  

I laughed. And then I looked. At Rachel. I saw her eyes closed. Even in the darkness of the room, I could see her cheeks flushed. I could see her back slightly arched. And I could see the motion of her hand under the blanket. If her breathy voice wasn't hint enough. If her gentle moans and her pauses pregnant with whimpers were not hint enough. Seeing it was believing it. I was sitting next to my sister while she told me about this mind blowing sex she had, and she was fucking herself to the memories.

She continued. I couldn't take my eyes off her. ""His hand slid into my panties"". She started describing how he finger fucked her. And I could see her motion. Her motion matching her words. ""He started slowly. Teasing my clit. He found me so fucking wet. Drenched I tell you. I am usually very wet, but this was something else. Something else. Fuck how wet I was"" she said. If I listened carefully, I could hear her juices gushing as she pounded her own vagina.

I wanted to do something. Anything. But I couldn't. I wanted to feel her. I wanted to fuck her. But my own sister! How could I? So I did nothing. I let her continue. I watched. Did she know I was watching? I don't know. But if she did, she gave me one hell of a show.

She told me about how finally she couldn't take it anymore and she told Josh to ""fuck me already"". How he didn't bring a condom. ""I didn't think this would happen so quickly"" he told her. ""I don't give a shit, fuck me anyway"" she said.

""Did.. did he?"" I asked  
""It was like I pushed a button. Something clicked inside of him. He fucked me like an animal"" she answered

""There was no respite. No mercy. Nothing. Just an animal in heat"" she continued. And as she went closer and closer to the end of the story, her own orgasm approached. She twitched. She took longer and longer breaks to catch breath, to moan, to whimper. Her body tensed up. Her words finally became just a mixed mumble of scattered sentences and moans.

What I could gather from it all is that he came inside of her, and that feeling his cum shoot drove her to a crazy orgasm that lasted like forever. And on that note, she came. That night. Next to me. It seemed to last forever. It was a thing of beauty to watch.

""It starts from my toes"" she said. ""And then I see the stars shooting into the sky"". ""And only then does it go to my vagina. It feels so warm. So strong. I think I squirted"" she added.

And before standing up, she caressed my hair (with the same hand she used to fuck herself no less!) and she teased me that maybe next time I ""could do a bit of a show and tell for her""

Reddit, what the fuck do I do? I think my sister wants to watch me fuck myself? I can't go through with it, right? This is already more than I should have done!! Way more. Please tell me what to do Reddit!"

Once the decision was made, I fired up Tinder, and I wrote to her the best opener I could come up with.
I literally wrote ""Generic boring opening message""
""lol generic intrigued response"" she answered

From there it was basically on. I went on some kind of autopilot, pretending it wasn't even my own sister I was chatting with.

""Slightly sexual punch line""  
""I am oh so embarrassed""  
""I'll walk it back, but only slightly""  
""Slightly slutty remark that shows I want it""  
""Hint that I want it too""  
""Meet me downstairs then silly"" was the last thing she wrote before logging off

""Fuck fuck fuck!"" I thought to myself ""what now?""

Well, I took the bait and went downstairs. She was sitting on the couch, a blanket covering her up. We sat next to each other and started talking. It started off very innocent. Just chit chatting about her day, and mine. Life after the military. How I'm trying to get into private security for a change. She is hoping to intern with some local politician. Nothing too crazy really.

And then it veered. I don't even know exactly how. But one minute she was telling me about the city manager of such and such small town looking for an intern, and the next minute she is telling me it's been weeks without sex and it's driving her crazy.

She started reminiscing. Her mind flying back to the days in college. She described it as a nice warm spring day. One of the first warm days, actually. She went out with this guy, Josh I think she said. Josh had tried to get her on a date for weeks. Finally she had caved. He was cute. He seemed smart and kind. Worth a try, basically. He took her to this nice restaurant, and then on the way back, they sat in the park. On a bench. He pointed her at the stars. Made up stories about constellations. And then leaned in for a kiss.

""I felt sparks"" she said. ""I don't know if it was the weather being finally so nice and warm, the air soft on my skin, or something about his scent, or whatever, but I felt sparks fly all over my body. I knew I wouldn't be able to say no to him that night. I was his. Whatever he wanted, he would get.""  
""I never fucked on the first date"", she continued. ""But I knew Josh would get to, if only he dared to try""  

After a brief pause, I interjected. ""Did he?"". My throat dry. My voice coarse. It was more than a brother needed to know. And yet I needed to know. I was staring right in front of me. Trying to avoid Rachel's gaze. As if I could pretend she was not my sister that way.

""Well, first we made out. He was gentle. He was slow. He took his sweet sweet time with me. My mouth. My neck. Behind my earlobe. He really knew to push my buttons. By the time he was done, I was one giant puddle of arousal. I could feel my own wetness. I could smell it. I was horny""  
""We laid down on the grass. He took my shirt off. I helped him unclasp my bra. And he had his way with my tits. He kissed them. He licked my nipples. Fuck they were so hard. I was whimpering. I was moaning. I could feel my legs try to clutch around him. I was basically begging him to fuck me. I don't know how we was so slow and dedicated. At one point I even thought he had a tiny dick, or he was gonna cum in seconds, and he was trying to make up for it""  

I laughed. And then I looked. At Rachel. I saw her eyes closed. Even in the darkness of the room, I could see her cheeks flushed. I could see her back slightly arched. And I could see the motion of her hand under the blanket. If her breathy voice wasn't hint enough. If her gentle moans and her pauses pregnant with whimpers were not hint enough. Seeing it was believing it. I was sitting next to my sister while she told me about this mind blowing sex she had, and she was fucking herself to the memories.

She continued. I couldn't take my eyes off her. ""His hand slid into my panties"". She started describing how he finger fucked her. And I could see her motion. Her motion matching her words. ""He started slowly. Teasing my clit. He found me so fucking wet. Drenched I tell you. I am usually very wet, but this was something else. Something else. Fuck how wet I was"" she said. If I listened carefully, I could hear her juices gushing as she pounded her own vagina.

I wanted to do something. Anything. But I couldn't. I wanted to feel her. I wanted to fuck her. But my own sister! How could I? So I did nothing. I let her continue. I watched. Did she know I was watching? I don't know. But if she did, she gave me one hell of a show.

She told me about how finally she couldn't take it anymore and she told Josh to ""fuck me already"". How he didn't bring a condom. ""I didn't think this would happen so quickly"" he told her. ""I don't give a shit, fuck me anyway"" she said.

""Did.. did he?"" I asked  
""It was like I pushed a button. Something clicked inside of him. He fucked me like an animal"" she answered

""There was no respite. No mercy. Nothing. Just an animal in heat"" she continued. And as she went closer and closer to the end of the story, her own orgasm approached. She twitched. She took longer and longer breaks to catch breath, to moan, to whimper. Her body tensed up. Her words finally became just a mixed mumble of scattered sentences and moans.

What I could gather from it all is that he came inside of her, and that feeling his cum shoot drove her to a crazy orgasm that lasted like forever. And on that note, she came. That night. Next to me. It seemed to last forever. It was a thing of beauty to watch.

""It starts from my toes"" she said. ""And then I see the stars shooting into the sky"". ""And only then does it go to my vagina. It feels so warm. So strong. I think I squirted"" she added.

And before standing up, she caressed my hair (with the same hand she used to fuck herself no less!) and she teased me that maybe next time I ""could do a bit of a show and tell for her""

Reddit, what the fuck do I do? I think my sister wants to watch me fuck myself? I can't go through with it, right? This is already more than I should have done!! Way more. Please tell me what to do Reddit!"

I'm an intern at a BI consultancy and I've got a task. My employer creates BI dashboards for clients, typically in PowerBI. They've recently started looking at larger contracts; the one in question involves a large number of clients with identical data requirements, all stored on our companies Azure SQL server, so I need to create a reproducible template that can be distributed amongst them and configured at a single point (as opposed to having custom dashboards for every individual client).

Building an individual powerBI dashboard for each client uses up too much time and the clients don't really need that amount of analytical power, just a simple visual dashboard with filters (i.e. by date, sales rep, location etc.) and some KPI's. I thought R Shiny would be a good choice but my employer is convinced that I should be using D3.js. I'm learning how to use it at the moment but I'm not sure if it's the right choice. Does anyone have any experience here and some recommendations?

Thank you :)"

###Useful Information:

C.E = Carceno Era

P.C.E = Post-Carceno Era

This is the first chapter of my novel Allegory of the End, there’s roughly 26 chapters in total.  I hope you enjoy it.

———————————————————————
###Aris || 524 C.E
———————————————————————

“What is this?!” I cry out in a muffled scream as my eyes snap open.

In a disoriented panic I try rebooting my eyes with a million blinks but realize its useless; what I’m seeing with them open is the samething I’m seeing with them shut: total darkness.

The uncertainty of it all begins eating at my thoughts like a hungry animal until all that’s left is fear. Fear and a growing lump in my stomach that Ma calls anxiety.

I feel the lump maneuvering through my stomach now, dodging butterflies and chunks of half-eaten food, until it lodges itself to the bottom of my throat like pollen on a leaf.

Instinctively I clasp my hands to my neck, and that’s when I figure out why my eyesight is gone.

I’m...swimming; actually, now with my hands wrapped around my neck, it’s more like sinking.

As my heart thumps along in my chest so viciously it starts making me light-headed; I feel tears start to form at the edge my eyes but they quickly disappear into the dark waters.

Memories of my dad start randomly popping into my head. Flashes of his arms wrapping me tight, the things he’d say to soothe me, what he’d do to make me smile. He always found a way to stay cool and collected, even on the day he died. ‘Only cool-heads make cool actions!’ he would say with a goofy grin.

As the flashes continue, I feel the thumping in my chest die down to a mild pitter-patter; guess even death can’t stop him from making me feel better.

Just as the last ounces of panic drain from my body, a deafening explosion from far above my head sends it all rushing back to me.

Shakenly looking up, light from the explosion blinds me and seconds later, I feel a violent shockwave ripple through the bubbling waves and rock me furiously.
After rubbing the light off my eyes, I look up and finally realize where I am; I’m completely and utterly screwed.

Not only am I swimming, I’m swimming directly under a sinking ocean-liner that’s on fire and I can’t even remember how I got here.

Staring at the ship’s rapid descent like a puppy in a thunderstorm; I’m stuck. Totally frozen with fear. Again.

All at once the gravity of the situation crashes on me like an avalanche and I start to paddle desperately.

With adrenaline now bursting through my veins, I paddle for dear life; putting every morsel of energy I have into each stroke as the emberring hull inches closer and closer.

For some reason though, my arms feel like they’re barely moving! It’s like they’re numb or something.

Whipping my head back, I spot an oily life jacket covered in flames about to land on my butt checks but with a quick knee-jerk twist, I narrowly dodge it.
It must’ve caught fire along with the ship; the irony.

From the corner of my eye I see the scorching mountain of an ocean-liner boiling through the water around me, now only a few meters away.

With the flames now illuminating the water, I realize that for some reason I’m also completely naked.

Shifting gears into emergency survival mode, I push through the numbness of my arms and bite my lip through the pain as hairs on my back begin to singe off.

“Faster. Faster!” I yell at my limbs as my body begins to tremble. Whether it’s due to exhaustion or panic, I couldn’t tell anymore.

After my last good stroke, my body shuts down and begins tensing up in the frigid waters.

Turning back, I see the ship barely miss my toes as its smoldering hull passes by in a bubbling cloud.

Watching as the burning light sinks deep into the depths of darkness, I slowly pump my fist in triumph.

I did it!

I survived!

Cutting my victory short, a group of rogue snake-like power cables pop out of the darkness. They slither behind the vessel like tentacles; twirling through the water weightlessly, and slice at my hand.

Before I know it, the knot of serpent-cables wrap around my ankles and yank me down to the depths with a violent tug.
Hopelessly, I watch as my last air bubbles slowly scatter into the tides.

As I’m blacking out, I begin to hear the faint grinding and clanking of metal as we drop into deeper depths.

The grinding intensifies the lower we drop till it’s piercingly loud but yet... it’s strangely familiar.

Yeah, it’s definitely familiar!

It’s not a song, more like an assault to the ears, an unrelenting drone if you will, but still familiar.

Wait...it’s my alarm clock!

WAKE UP!



My mind and body must’ve gotten different memos because even after realizing it was all a dream, it still feels like I’m underwater.

Waking up to a cold sweat; I’m immediately blinded (again) by the blue sun rays shining through my walls
Totally disoriented, I slowly lift my head up with a loud yawn as I stretch my neck. In my other hand, I feel water running through my fingers as my palm sinks into my comforter.

Not a great way to start my day off. I’m all soaked in cold sweat, it’s the sixth time this month!

“What time is it?” I mutter under my breath while bitterly dragging myself out of bed.

While wiping the sand from under my eyes, I belt out another yawn and reach my hand back to activate my relay.
With a gentle tap to the space behind my left ear, a 2D green dot materializes into view at the top left corner of my field of view.

This time when I think ‘what time is it’ a transparent 3D clock pops up next to the green dot, slowing rotating with a light glow.

It reads: 13:05, with a blinking exclamation point hovering beside it.

With a thought, I click on the exclamation point and the calendar app pops open then flips to today’s page.

In big letters, a flashing message blares:

Extra Shift at Breok’s | 12:00-22:00

With a defeated sigh, I slap my forehead with my palm and slowly drag it down to my chin.

“CRAP! I’m late for work.” I holler in frustration as I reach behind my ear again and put my relay in idle.

In all the excitement from my nightmare, I forgot I begged Breok for an extra shift last week.

Tumbling out of bed, I start to rummage through the piles of clothes on the floor for my work uniform.

Finally getting it after the third pile, I pull it out and wipe it down before throwing it on with two quick hops.

Midway through zippering up, I realize I’m not wearing any underwear; but there’s no time to go scouring for one now. I’ll have to go commando –gross- but it’s got to be done. 

After getting changed I stumble out of my room, hopping on one foot as I put my boots on.

Crashing onto the walls of the kitchen as I struggle to get them on, I see the lunch Ma left for me on the counter and grab it just as I zip up my left boot then jet out the door.

The moment I step outside I reach back, re-activate my relay, and play the perfect soundtrack for my race against unemployment.

Hopping down from my stoop I hit the footstreets running, wildly navigating through the sea of commuters on their way to work as I move like the wind to keep mine.

To the left, zipping autos fly up and down the hyperways at speeds so fast all you can see is a blurry river of headlights through the blue-hued hardlight barrier.

To my right, vibrant relay-generated ads dance through the Metro’s sprawling canopy of mega-skyscrapers and hov-gardens in a beautiful mirage of colors.
The scissoring hyperway tracks run through multi-tiered buildings, platforms and terminals; looping around to connect every corner of the Metro with thick arcing beams of light.

In the distance, there’s always a few tracks fading in and out before reappearing again in different shapes or directions; Ma told me the people that get paid for that actually make bank. Maybe I should drop off my resume, apply for an internship or something; I’ll need it after Breok strangles me to death.

Above my head, two pixelating mercury surfers appear riding a silvery wave. With gigantic smiles painted on their faces, they dodge every hanging vine and tree branch in sight.

When I see them, the smell of fresh sand following the tingling taste of metal flood my senses. For a moment all I can remember is renewing my Silver TapTM lake passes for the spring. From the corner of my eye, however, I see the slowly rotating clock pulsate as it changes time.

13:11

I’m now a full hour-something late, and counting.

“Busy; maybe another time.” I mutter to the surfers as their smiles droop into frowns. Massive waves crash on top of them, totally wiping them out as they de-pixelate into mist and vanish.

Through my music I hear a small ping from a new IM*, a coupon for Merc-Surfing most likely, so I ignore it and turn up the bass as the rotating sign above the jump-pad terminal finally pops up in the horizon.

Desperately sprinting through annoyed faces to an electro beat, I dip and weasel my way to the nearest pad- stop as the song’s build-up reaches critical mass. 

Just as I jump through a group of cell-farmers to get onto the platform, the beat drops epically and I stick the landing; only to notice I just got to the end of a very long line.

Jump-pads are usually arranged in semi-circles at pad- stops; five or six to a platform. They’re quick as a blink and never power down; but even with a stop every 100 or so meters along the hyperway, on each side, the ques to use one can get horrible during rush hour.
And it’s always rush hour.

13:16

“C’mon! At this rate I’ll be clocking in at lunch!” I quietly mutter to myself as I stare hopelessly at the rotating clock in my peripheral and take my place in line.
At least the line’s moving fast.

One-by-one people march up to the jump-pad and ‘port away in the blink of an eye only to be quickly replaced by another, then another and so on.

Thing is, Breok’s shop is across the track from me; I can see his flashing relay-sign from my room. Yet, I still have to wait in a que of six-hundred just to get there; kind of lame.

Without these bad boys though, getting across the hyperway would be suicide.
My teacher told us the average speed per auto on any given hyperway is between 75 to 150 meters per second -without speed hacks.

Hardlight barriers block people from wandering in and contain any accidents between autos within the track; but accidents can still happen.

Like Mr. Boe says: “Anything on the track that’s not made of metal or running on nuclear fusion is definitely getting the yoga-mat treatment, free of charge!”
Waddling anxiously as the que marches on, I start to fantasize about cutting everyone in line and hopping onto a jump-pad before anyone could catch me.
It’s a thought I’ve had every day since starting at Breok’s shop.

Without meaning to, I trail off on the thought before realizing it’s finally about to be my turn to hop on.

Luckily, I’m not the only one in line late for something. It takes no more than two seconds of me standing aimlessly in my thoughts before the hissing and cursing start to ring in my ear.

With a face redder than raw meat, I turn around to apologize but see hundreds of sour-stares beaming lasers at my forehead.

“Yeesh; point made.” I mutter to myself. “No need for the pitchforks.”

Turning back around while trembling nervously, I close my eyes and hop onto the jump-pad without thinking another word.

When I open my eyes again, I’m on the platform in front of Breok’s ‘Relay-Sheens and Everything In-Between’ store.

Still trembling, I step off the jump-pad and walk in; mentally preparing myself for the absolute worst.

Stepping through the doorway, I notice the clock in my relay pulsing again.

13:27

I’m screwed; up, down, and sideways.

The moment he sees me, Breok’s bellows start to rattle every widget, loose screw and poster in the store.

Arms flapping, he roars and curses at me like it’s the answer to life but by now, I’ve heard it all.

“I’m deducting this”, “Say good bye to that”, throwing in an extra “What do I pay you for” here and there, the whole nine; but I expected worse, way worse.

After a while, he eventually mumbles off to his office and leaves the store to me when he sees that I’m actually doing my job; something I’ve still never seen him do.
The pay’s decent though and I get to work on awesome stuff all day so, can’t complain.

It’s mainly simple repairs that I do here. Got an infinity screen acting up at home? Bring it in, we gotcha’ covered.

A few months back, I even fixed a small nuclear engine with a busted sonic-screwdriver and some toothpaste.

I love it, and always have for as long as I can remember. Ma says it’s because I grew up breaking everything; eventually I had to figure out how to put it back together.

When the store’s empty, and I’m certain Breok’s not glaring over my shoulders anymore, I quietly take out a small project that I’ve been working on for the past couple of months.

It’s the skeleton to a prototype I’m calling: ‘the bionic exo-limb’, or something like that; I’m not too good with names. What it does is simple, in theory anyway.

It attaches itself to a body part, analyzes inefficiencies in the muscle structure, and then enhances it exponentially.

Most of it is still in concept, actually, it’s all still in concept.

For now though, I do at least have the basic layout done; the only thing left to do is test it while connected to some power and watch what happens.

After cautiously turning on the power generator, I warily place the wireless transmission-pads on their respective pairs and take a deep breath.

If I touch the alloy casing while power’s running through it, it’ll be a good bye to my facial hair; and I just started getting my first tusks so safety is key.

Carefully finishing the adjustments to the last pad on the bio-limb, I take another deep breath and turn on the potential. When suddenly, the front door slams open and a voice boldly calls out:

“Aye, you guys fix HovCyks here?”

In seemingly slow motion I look up to see a guy around my age, probably a little shorter than me, with broad shoulders and maroon hair.

Somehow, even with the sun hitting him, his eyes look completely black. Weirder still, he looks kind of familiar; do I know him?

Steadily, he walks in with a cocky smug and the broken handle of a ruined -and still steaming- HovCyk.

As time starts catching back up, I realize my heart’s knocking in my chest like a friendly neighbor as I stare blankly at the stranger. He came out of nowhere!

“Wait! The alloy casing!” screams a voice from the back of my head.

With my eyes wider than a hyperway track, I slowly turn my head down to my hands.

Oh no.

ZZAAAAPPPP

Waking up a few seconds later, there’s a gear at my back, a neutron generator on my head, and a hand in my face.

Looking up to a silhouette of the stranger who just came in, I grab the hand and he helps me struggle off the miscellaneous pile.

“Thanks.” I mutter to the stranger as I dust my uniform off; trying to hide my embarrassment the best I could.

“No problem man; sure you alright?” nervously asks the stranger as he warily eyes me up and down.

“Agh, I’m fine. Don’t worry about it. And yeah...I can take a look at that for you.” I groan while extending my hand out. “My name’s Aris by the way.”

He looks down at my hand curiously and then shoots a look back up to me.
With a subtle blink, he relaxes his shoulders, flashes a smile and heartily grabs my hand.

“Nice to meet you man; name’s Zay’ko.”"

dzd8yu,2,2019-11-20,25 M4A (You Playing F) In Search of the Elusive Long-Term Detailed Story,WritingWizard124,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dzd8yu/25_m4a_you_playing_f_in_search_of_the_elusive/,"Good evening!

So tonight, I've decided to take my time and craft a request thread that more adequately states what kinds of things I am looking for in a roleplay.  I've been roleplaying for approximately 15 years now on various chat rooms and forums, though only about 6 or so have involved smut of any kind.  I love writing, and as such, I'm really looking to find a writing partner that will intrigue me, entertain me, inspire my writing, and create an altogether fun story with me.  And I hope that in return, I will do all of these things and more for you in our stories.

Granted, we all know that a lot of roleplay involves smut, and I absolutely enjoy that as well.  But smut without a story is just a bad porn film, and that's certainly not what I'm looking for.  I need story.  I need plot and world building.  Smut is important and fun and all that good stuff, but why are our characters suddenly sleeping together.  I don't believe a good story has a character simply look at the other and decide to sleep with them.  Something has to stir within both characters, and that something is what I try to explore thoroughly in all my writings.

Now, before I get into the ideas that I have, I would first like to say that I am absolutely open to your ideas as well.  This isn't a one-sided thing, and it never will be with me.  It's important that I enjoy myself, but it's also important to me that you enjoy writing with me as well.  And if you find yourself not enjoying an aspect of a roleplay, I never will be offended if you let me know what you're not enjoying about the story, and we can work to curve things toward another direction if need be.  And certainly, I'll be open with you as a partner as well if things aren't really being enjoyed on my end also.  With that being said, I will -never- ghost a roleplay.  There comes a time in any roleplay where it isn't quite as fun anymore, or burnout happens.  I get it.  But I'd feel guilty as hell if I ever just quit a RP without an explanation, and I'll give you that courtesy.  I just ask that you give me the same.

Now, as you can see in the tag, I'm open to roleplaying with men and women.  But the one requirement I will have is that you MUST play the female role.  I consider myself a fairly flexible writer, but I'm terrible at writing female characters, and I definitely want the person I'm roleplaying with to play the female role.  I am a straight male, but I don't mind if you are a male behind the screen.  All that matters to me is that your character is female.

Now for the fun part:

**Limits/Kinks:**



I will eventually put a more detailed F-list on here, but limits-wise, I am not into non-con, gore, bathroom stuff.  The extremes essentially.  I won't say that I'm vanilla per se, but I do tend to enjoy more usual modern slice of life themes.  I love playful teasing, things happening in water (pools, hot tubs, showers, etc.), small things that on their own don't mean much, but add up toward much more.  Teasing, brushing up against one another, accidental nudity, those kind of things.  Beyond that, if something makes sense in the general flow of the RP, you'll usually find that I'm up for it, but if ever in doubt, just ask.



**RP Ideas:**



Again, not an all-inclusive list, and you're more than welcome to offer your own ideas, but here's some ideas I've compiled of late.  I'll continue to add to this list as I discover new ideas that I enjoy.



**Celebrities** - 

I LOVE roleplaying within the celebrity genre.  Probably one of my favorite things to do.  I generally am looking for the female character to be the celebrity in this, though I suppose for the right writing partner, that could be flexible as well.  Currently, I have scenes involving celebrity incest (Dad/daughter, brother/sister, mom/son) and celebrity fan encounters (this one currently takes place at a convention locally to my character).  But feel absolutely free to suggest your own celebrity ideas as well.  I would love to try something new in this genre.  In the latter scene, I'm willing to play an older or a younger fan, and willing to play any ages allowable by site rules.

Some celebrities I enjoy playing opposite of include, but are not limited to (In no particular order): Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lawrence, Kaley Cuoco, Lauren Cohan, Christina Hendricks, Demi Lovato, and sometimes Taylor Swift depending on the role.  Absolutely feel free to suggest some of your favorites as well!


**Teacher/student or coach/athlete** - 

I really enjoy the power dynamic between the two here, but this isn't your cliche ""You're failing a test, so do things for the teacher to get your grades up"" kind of trope.  That's too easy.  That doesn't cause me to think or be interested in any way.  For these two ideas, I am willing to play either the older or younger role, and again, the younger character, I'm fine with that character being anything allowed within site rules.  

My basic idea for both involve a pairing of two individuals who actually get along great.  Perhaps the teacher or the coach has been their teacher or coach for some time, allowing for a better relationship/bond between the two than most of the people their age.  Nothing unprofessional has happened between them at the time the RP starts, but through time, a very inappropriate relationship begins to build between the pair.  I do tend to love writing scenes involving disallowed relationships, which brings me to:


**Incest** - 

Disallowed relationships really thrill me.  Relationships that society looks down on.  And of course, this is the case with incest.  No, not something I'm into in real life, but writing it has always been enjoyable to me for whatever reason.  For these, I've got scenes involving dad/daughter, brother/sister, or mom/son.  Open to other suggestions as always.


**Boss/employee** - For this, I think the easiest way is to post the scene idea that I have:

*I am a manager at a major marketing firm in New York. Basically what we do is try to get various companies to pay us to run their entire advertising campaign for them. It's a big money business, but someone has to do it, and all the stress and burden falls on our shoulders - they just 'show us the money.'

Unfortunately, that does mean a lot of trips away from home; away from family. But I have a loving wife, and she has been very understanding.

A very big automobile company based in California is my next client, and this one deal could pay for all of our operations for the next year and beyond. And so, being the best representative at the company, I'm the one tasked with flying out that way and convincing them to sign with us.

One problem, my assistant. She's tasked to go with me, but she can't do her job properly. She mixes up phone calls, she messes up the calendar. All of the tasks she is assigned to, she can't do. So I fire her, just a day before I would need someone to come with me to help me stay organized.

I try to see if I can borrow other managers' assistants, but they were all booked as well. So it's recommended that I give you a chance, a young intern in our firm. They say you work hard, and on such short notice, I didn't have much of a choice.

So I agree, calling you into my office to talk to you about the opportunity.*



**TV Show/Movies** - 

Of course, I also enjoy writing within television and movie universes as well.  I find this is the hardest category to find a match, as it does require both people to have some kind of a clue about the film or show itself.  With that being said, I've written scenes within shows like The Big Bang Theory, Girl Meets World, Gotham, Game of Thrones, Marvel Cinematic, and the like.  Always open for those, and this list will expand as well.  Also open to your ideas as well.




As stated, this list and this post will be ever evolving.  At the end of the day, I'm looking for ideas.  Compelling stories.  World-building.  If my ideas aren't something you enjoy, don't hesitate to send me some of your ideas.  I might not like them, but who knows, your idea might intrigue me.  As long as they don't break my limits posted above, I might be open-minded toward them.



Please note that I am ALWAYS looking for capable partners.  So if you see this post, whether I'm online or not, feel free to hit me up.  I will respond as soon as humanly possible.  Let's quench each other's literary thirst!"
dzdi4t,5,2019-11-20,Is it worth learning Rust and Rust GUI (for me)?,AwlsomeAlex365,rust,https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dzdi4t/is_it_worth_learning_rust_and_rust_gui_for_me/,"So a little bit of background. I took AP Computer Science and learned the basics of Java. I am a high school student and am currently an intern. One of my long term projects needs to be a program I wrote myself, with it having a GUI. Essentially it'll be a network switch monitor software. However Java is frowned upon where I work so I need to learn a new language. I feel like I could easily pick up Python and achieve this pretty quickly, but I have a lot of time on my hands (it isn't ""due"" until May 2020). Would it be practical to learn Rust, which is very different than Java, as apposed to C++, which the two share similarities? I have read the state of GUIs in Rust is, questionable at the least, and GUIs are pretty mature in C++. If I were to do this, where would I even start? I heard ""The Book"" is essential to learning rust, but what about GUIs? Which library should I use? This program will ONLY be aimed for Linux so I can afford to be locked to a specific API. If it proves not to be I will probably just use C++."
dzdogg,5,2019-11-20,How best to apply for jobs out of state?,ItalianoVero,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/dzdogg/how_best_to_apply_for_jobs_out_of_state/,"I'm a junior in college looking ahead to applying for jobs senior year. I live in a city that doesn't have a lot of actuaries, so more than likely I will have to find a job in another state if I want to be an actuary. I will have passed at least P and FM by graduation. Maybe IFM if I have the time. Most likely no internships at this point, but will have some programming/modelling projects.

My question is: how does the application process work for someone like me? Do I modify my resume a certain way? Is relocation typical in this industry or will I be at a serious disadvantage if I don't already live there? I'm open to moving anywhere, but preferably a big city like LA, SF, NY, Chicago, etc.

Anyways any advice is appreciated."

1. How is the academic culture at USC? Is it more of a social vibe or is it focused on academics?

2. How big is Greek life? Not entirely opposed to joining a Frat but I’d prefer to not be in one.

3. Are most job offers and internships from the West Coast? I’d like to major in Business and land an Internship at a company such as Goldman Sachs or McKinsey and I’m wording if USC’s location makes this hard to do.

Thank you in advance for any responses!"
dze2in,5,2019-11-20,Tomorrow is my last day and I’m sad because I know that they’re looking forward to it.,Catbitchoverlord,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dze2in/tomorrow_is_my_last_day_and_im_sad_because_i_know/,"Tomorrow is my last day at an internship required for my degree. It was very physically and emotionally demanding, as I am very sensitive. No one there really liked me, and they did very little to mask their opinions. They ignored jokes I made, didn’t ask me about my personal life (while asking other interns about theirs) played favorites and scolded me when I was late. I was definitely late some of the time, but I live far away and was taking on 45 hour weeks and trying to tackle my depression. Nothing I’ve ever done has made them smile or treat me like a human being. But tomorrow: it’s over. I am relieved to have a break and time to get my shit together, but I’m heartbroken imagining their joy at my absence. 

I tried my hardest. I was as friendlier than I’ve ever been. I bought things for them all and baked treats- but I know that they’re glad to be rid of me. It just hurts knowing that you can try your hardest, but some people will just fucking hate you. I know that I’m being dramatic, and that a lot of this is just being over sensitive, but it’s something I’ve never experienced and makes me very nervous about transitioning into this field. 

When I get home tomorrow, I’m going to down a bottle of wine and sleep for a week. Cheers 🥂"
dzefop,1,2019-11-21,41 M4F - You're On Call Tonight...to Suck Some Dick,TheHG22,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/dzefop/41_m4f_youre_on_call_tonightto_suck_some_dick/,"""What!?!"" I ask as I see my wife putting on a sexy, but semi-conservative dress, ""I thought you were staying in tonight!""

""Sweety, I'm so sorry,"" she said with a very sympathetic look ""I know I was supposed to take care of you tonight, but Liz just called while you were in the shower and she really needs a friend right now. I'm gonna grab a few drinks with her.""

""Ugh..."" I sigh, ""OK. OK. But, I've been saving it up all for you this week and I'm about to explode!""

""Well, since I'm the one bailing, I'll let you use the on-call tonight"" she replied.

""Who is it tonight?"" I asked as my mood quickly started to change for the better...

OK. So for this RP, I want you to play two women - my wife and the on-call girl who I get to use a few times a year when my wife gives me permission. The on-call girl is always someone we know, and my wife set them all up.

My wife is a very organized woman. So basically, she put together a calendar and gets every day scheduled about two or three months in advance. All of them know the deal - if you're on call, you MIGHT get a call from me and if you do, you're supposed to come by and give me head, no questions asked, until I explode.

So, for tonight, I want you to respond to my question about who it is with one of the following and I want to play the night out with you, my on-call woman:

Amanda: My wife's super-slutty friend.

Jill: Her mom was a huge slut when I was in college and I used to fuck her. My wife's firm just hired Jill and told me about her...about how slutty and sexy she was. I asked to see a pic and I immediately recognized her. Long-story short, she was just as slutty, maybe even more, than her mom. So when my wife asked her about me, she jumped at it...and she knows her mom's history with me, but she doesn't care at all.

Brittany: Another co-worker of my wife's - actually an intern. She just turned 21 and is a big-titted, blonde slut. She's been 21 for three months and still never paid for her own drink.

Lizzy: One night when I was allowed to use the on call, the woman who was on had to bail. My wife made me a Tinder account to find a replacement...Lizzy was it. And she was good. My wife liked her, so she stayed in the mix.

Gillian: Has a GREAT rack and an almost unmatched enthusiasm for sucking cock. She's a friend of my ex-girlfriend that my wife has met a few times cause she hangs out at some of the same places we do and we always say hi. My wife quickly recruited her when she saw how slutty she was dressed.

Bridgette: Married woman about two doors down. She is a super MILF with a great body and her hubby is away a lot. She'd never get permission from hubby to do this so she'd rather hope not to get caught and ask for forgiveness if she does.

Ashley: A thick, sexy, super slutty former co-worker and hookup of mine who happens to still live nearby.

Your Idea: Tell me/show me another character you want to play.

A Porn Star: Through my wife's firm, she represents many in the entertainment industry, including the adult industry. Her clients that I'm into are: Dayna Vendetta, Angela White, Abbey Brooks, Audrey Bitoni, Vicky Vette, Dylan Ryder, Leslie Zen, Tory Lane, and Jenna Haze. You can pick any one (or more).

So if you're still with me, get in touch, and tell me who you want to play. I can show you what I envision any of these potential characters look like, but am also open to suggestions you have! I can also give you more background on the type of character I want my wife to play too, but you can probably already gather that she's sexy, confident, and always looking out for me.

With the right partner, I think this can be a lot of fun, so get in touch soon and light up that orange envelope!"
dzfae3,4,2019-11-21,Why do I feel bad about reporting a potential predator? I’m 17 he’s 34,imfuckingwondering,HarassmentScandals,https://www.reddit.com/r/HarassmentScandals/comments/dzfae3/why_do_i_feel_bad_about_reporting_a_potential/,"Okay so I just turned 17 a month ago. It is my second semester in college and on my birthday I actually got an opportunity to start working at my college as well. So there was this guy who was nice to me and talked to me.(nobody else really did and I have no friends) I thought he was cool. I told him it was my birthday on my first day working and he asked how old I was and I replied 17. He told me I don’t look 17. To which I responded that people usually say I look like I am 12. The next day I don’t wear makeup and I was like “ew I feel ugly” and we are alone walking to change printer ink and he tells me “to me you look the same as yesterday I don’t see anything wrong” okay I can take a compliment but I felt strange when he told me that like I didn’t say anything and walked uncomfortably. Anyways I tend to push the boundaries of what I should and should not say I’m pretty much an open book. Time goes by and I don’t know how this came up but basically I found out he smokes too. So he gives me his number and mouths the words “so we can smoke.” Now I know I don’t know this man very well but who is going to turn down free drugs I’m young. So we end up smoking. He picked me up from campus and we left to smoke just in the car around the block and he dropped me off. I felt a little weird but I ignored it. My creep senses didn’t have a strong detection that time. He picked me up from campus because I don’t have a car and he knows I can’t leave my house and at this time I think he’s 25 but I soon find out he’s 34. So me and him talk nothing sexual or at least I wasn’t I just thought he was better than everybody in the office. A couple days pass and he wants me to smoke with him but he got off before me. He waited 20 minutes in the parking lot for me as soon as he started to drive off he said “oh it’s at my house” I didn’t know what to do so I didn’t say anything then he stops at a gas station and ask if I want to drink (alcohol) with him. I didn’t really want to and I’m not one to turn down a drink and I seriously considered not drinking but I reluctantly agreed. We get to his house and smoke but I was so uncomfortable I had also remembered he owns like 4 or 5 guns I could’ve been stuck there held captive so I decided to leave. He took me back to school because he knows he can’t drop me off at my house he didn’t touch me or say anything sexual thankfully. Then one day I was sitting at a shared desk and he comes up to me and ask if he can use the desk and I say yes. Then he tells me “ you need to stop being friendly becau...” he cuts himself off and says “I’ll tell you in a minute.” So now I’m like Um okay ? Then he tells me to go with him so we can swap office phones for new ones. He gets me alone with him in the elevator and says “ oh yea you need to stop being friendly because I was going to grab your ass like to move you” okay this guy knows I am 17 I have told him many times. I was so uncomfortable we were alone in the elevator I didn’t know what to say so I didn’t say anything. We had to wait for someone at the office so we were sitting in chairs and he showed me a picture of some random girl and was like “I’m going to fuck her on her lunch break” and okay? Your a fucking grown ass man adults have sex big fucking deal. I didn’t think much of it and here goes me with my big mouth and I don’t know why I told him but I did about this girl I was arguing with and I told him how I told her things that me and my boyfriend do. He told me “damn I would want to see that” and I freeze. He told me “ I’ll show you if you show me” and I didn’t say anything I couldn’t even look at him. He said “ so is that a no” and I said “no.” So we just sat there awkwardly. Time goes by and I forget about it at the time I had another job as well at a fast food place. Now I know this part is my fault trust me I understand HR has already made me feel like a dumb bitch about it. I call him while I’m at my fast food job so he can come and smoke me out. By the time he told me he was coming I instantly regretted what I did I made my friend come outside with me but she was all coked out so wouldn’t have been a big help but she made me feel a little better not that much. She comes outside and comes to the car and says “how old are you, you look old.” And he said “how old are you?” She responded “I’m 25” then he said “I’m 25 too” keep in mind I know for a fact he is at least 34. I look at him from the corner of my eyes without turning my head and I was just thinking wtf did I just get myself into. I was freaking out on the inside told myself this would be the last time I would ever talk or smoke with him. My friend has to go back to work and he wanted me to walk with him and his dog to the grass area. Keep in mind it is 10 o’clock at night I’m scared my friend was going inside I wasn’t going to walk with him and his dog. The joint was still lit but I just left him. My other friend was in the patio she used to work there but she quit. So I went to go sit with her. The friend that was on coke said “did you just leave him like that you are so mean” I told her why I left him like that but of course she doesn’t know the whole story because I didn’t tell her he lied about his age I was already embarrassed. Then he was leaving but came passing by where we were sitting my other friend who was drinking saw his dog and told him to park so she can pet his dog and I was like omg I just want him to leave. My friend who was drinking saw his face and looks at me and says “wtf is wrong with you he looks so old” she kept saying it and I was feeling more scared and embarrassed. Anyways he leaves I don’t talk a lot I want him gone. I go home still thinking about what my friend said for just leaving him so I texted him. I said sorry I was scared my mom was gonna see. Which I really wasn’t but it was an excuse because your 34 hanging out with a 17 year old that’s scared her mom is going to see her. He said sorry doesn’t buy me weed and responded with you owe me. I took that as sexual and I told him I would give him $10 on Friday. Friday never came because I was so scared I called in to go late. I didn’t see I’m for a few days but I had went into work early and I knew I was going to see him so I called my boyfriend to avoid a conversation with him. This fucking man then proceeds to use an app we use to go in and fix peoples computers for the school and basically hacks into my work computer and opens up a work document and types “get back to work” and I wrote “leave me alone” he then started laughing. I started going into work late to avoid him and the day before I reported him I knew he was going to be coming out of work as soon as I was walking in so I walked the long way. Keep in mind I was so determined not to see him I walked the long way on a cold windy and rainy day.. I see these carts that we use to get around campus and I’m hoping it is not him. I put my headphones and hoodie on and look down. It was him and he stopped me. He asked if I was mad and I said no. He said oh you haven’t been texting me I used school as an excuse and went about my Business and continued walking. I get into the office and he throws his hands in the air and said “I thought you were leaving” I quickly replied no. I thought it was weird he thought that because I hadn’t been in the office. The next day I spoke with a intern and told him everything he said that the creep guy gives him creep vibes also because the first day the intern started working there they went in those carts and he said that the perv was driving and was looking at every single girls ass and boobs that walked by then would look at him making faces expecting him to be like omg 😆! Now our office is right next to the early college high school building so who’s to say that he wasn’t checking out another little ass girl. I reported him the next day at first I didn’t want to but I had to think about other girls he could have done or is doing this to. 5 days went by before they had even told him I reported him. I had to call my supervisor before I would go into work to make sure he wasn’t there. I started to get angry because I was already doing that and now it was worse because I had to wait until he was completely gone off campus before I could go which was making me angry so I complained about that and about HR being slow then the other day they wouldn’t let me leave the office until someone could walk with me because he was HELPING THE VETERINARY CLASS BY VOLUNTEERING TO BRING HIS DOG. Are you fucking kidding me? So today they talked to him and I found out he cannot come to work or campus until the investigation is over. With all this being said if anyone has even made it this far. I have been thinking about how he feels or what’s going through his mind. Does he feel sorry or does he think he has done anything wrong is he angry or was it an accident he didn’t mean to make me feel this way. And I have been thinking about how he can’t come to work and make money. Why do I feel like this? I thought it was what I wanted it is but at the same time I feel a little bad maybe because I am a minor and it could really hurt his reputation. Which is deserving I think but I still have second thoughts. What do you think did I do the right thing am I over exaggerating please help me clear my mind."
dzfj6e,91,2019-11-21,I think I made the wrong choice of my life so far,matuidi_charo,povertyfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dzfj6e/i_think_i_made_the_wrong_choice_of_my_life_so_far/,"I just need to vent. I’m really stressed out right now. I’m currently studying and working as a barista in NYC and living with my girlfriend. I’ve been together with my girlfriend for over a year and half and during the first year it was good. I met her late spring and I was still working as a barista downtown Manhattan. Like many college students, we are always applying for internships for the summer and luckily I landed one and that internship became a full-time job for a year. It was contract so I had an expiration but I thought, if I do my job well perhaps I’m able to get an extension so that was my plan. It didn’t happen. My last day was June 1, 2019. Of course I knew so I immediately began looking for other jobs. I saved up a good amount of money to survive for at least two months, just in case if anything went wrong. Oh boy. I didn’t land anything for 3 months. I lost track how many interviews I did. From video, phone, person-to-person, group interviews, you name it. 

So I was interviewed at different companies for 3 months. I lost all hope. Lost all my confidence. My motivation completely gone. Now what? I had no choice but go back making coffee. 

I randomly called local coffee shops and asked for employment and I was able to get one. The problem was it was below the minimum wage. I had no choice. I was desperate so I took it. 

Fast forward today, I’m still in school and I’m about to fail 2 classes but that’s okay, I have to retake them in the spring and I’ll be graduating. However, I know I don’t want to make coffee for the rest of my life so I’m constantly in the lookout for internships and I was able to get one! Remotely too! We were told that this job/project would last about 3 months. I was excited knowing that I would be continuing shaping my skills and experience in my field. I told my boss from the coffee shop that I was not going to be able to work during week, only weekends. They weren’t happy but they couldn’t do anything. 

Now, if you’re still reading, you should know that I’m living with my girlfriend and our current lease ends on Dec 1st. She was able to get a studio with the help of some relatives but the problem is that studio is quite pricey. She does make a decent amount of money working as a waitress (she’s an international student). But on the other side, I am not making no more than 300 bucks a week. 

This is the worst part, the remote job that I had that was supposed to last “3 months"" only lasted a week. Apparently I wasn’t the only one working on this project and it was completed within a week. There was an email sent by the team that were roughly at least 100 people working on this project.  Pure bullshit. I’m supposed to get paid this Friday. 

So I told my boss from the coffee shop that I wasn’t going to be available and my availability was going only weekends and now this remote job doesn’t exist anymore.

I’m completely embarrassed to go back and tell them that I need my hours back and I’m a complete failure in my girlfriend’s eyes. She’s questioning me about my current position and I just feel so useless that I can’t even help with basic needs. 

This shit sucks so much that I wouldn’t want any one to go through this.


EDIT: I would like to thank everyone for their support and advice. I couldn't have been more grateful. As some of you were curious of my major, well I'm concentrating in the realm of Data Analytics. Unfortunately, there's little hope for me to pass those two classes. I would have to stop working completely since it's difficult material to cover (Combinatorics and Adv. Inference Statistics). And I will be speaking to my boss tomorrow morning about my open availability. This post has given a lot hope and motivation. Thank you again guys! *sheds tear*"
dzflwp,2,2019-11-21,The Kings Address #1 - Ocean Waves and Velvet Skies,BestinBounds,LoserleavesReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoserleavesReddit/comments/dzflwp/the_kings_address_1_ocean_waves_and_velvet_skies/,"*BestInBounds is sitting in the throne room of his castle on the outskirts of an unidentified Samoan Village by the beach. He walks out to the balcony and gazes at the ocean view before he starts to speak.*

&amp;#x200B;

Ocean waves and velvet skies. Since I've taken up residence back in my homelands those are what have greeted me on my return. And as I look out before Survivor Series I have some pertinent points to raise. Concerning both Team Pacific and Team Indy. Now see, this is where there are... complications.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate 3/4 of my team and the only person I genuinely respect is Random. But thats the wonderful thing about hatred... it has levels. It holds nuance, hatred is a spectrum - or even better, hatred is a ladder. Each rung occupied by an individual or individuals. See whilst some of my Pacific team mates occupy the first rung of that ladder each successive rung upwards is occupied by a new member of team X-Division. Or for an even better comparison, much like the nine circles inside of Dante's inferno, but do not be mistaken, my hatred for you burns much hotter than any fire of the supernatural nay, demonic kind.

&amp;#x200B;

The First Rung - Cassius, Faf and Pruef. Now I've had my issues with all 3 of you in the past and I have differing reasons for each one of you but for the sake of victory i'm willing to move past that. For now...

&amp;#x200B;

The Second Rung - Bong. Mr ""CUNT"" himself. The man MDC imported in to fufill their need for legitimacy. It is quite unfortunate that your recruitment did the exact opposite as it showed LLR what MDC truly is - A farce. Children playing war games trying to break into the big bad world only to be met with scorn and contempt. Which is all you deserve. Bong you more than anybody else should know that no faction can compare to Legion - and yet you break faith with the brothers and join this supermarket brand Legion. Overwhelmingly I feel not hatred but disappointment.  For the sin of treachery, you will be punished.

&amp;#x200B;

The Third Rung - Phenomenal Inferno, or Phenomenally fucking boring. I feel like I over use this term when describing Sin Machine then I remember that's probably why you dickheads probably group together. In a world where a faction like ""Outer Circle"" exists you somehow take the cake for the most boring motherfuckers to ever exist. And it's not even just one of you carrying the load, youre all equally fucking bland. You had a record breaking X Division title run and what did you do? Absolutely fucking nothing. Not one thing, like Ruto you just sat on that title till you lost it. Let's be honest Inferno youre probably the type of guy that thinks LED lights are a personality trait you gigantic twat.  There is enhancement talent (JZ, Oni, Genisis, Jakker etc) that would kill for a title reign to show LLR what they have got. To actually fucking do something with it. Instead you wasted it all sitting on that title like it was your sisters face. There are cats out here starving and you're choking on free food. Fuck you and your boring ass. You could of said anything about anyone whilst you were champion and it would of been two leaps above whatever the fuck you did with it. You wasted that title inferno, you devalued that title inferno, you ruined that title inferno, you shat on that title Inferno, you sat on that title inferno and for the sin of Sloth Inferno? You will be punished Inferno.

&amp;#x200B;

The Fourth Rung - Dan AND Woody. You see I don't actually fucking know which one of you will show up on Sunday. So to cover all bases let's talk about both of you. Dan - you could of done anything with your career. You could of gone anywhere, told any story, fought for any title, joined any faction. Instead? You threw it all down the fucking drain. You joined The Exalted who are like Sin Machine if Sin Machine was actually any good. Retirement home deluxe, Retiree Supremo, how are those pension cheques Dan? Were they worth the cost of your personality because now you're just the living embodiment of old man shakes his fist at the sky. Now you're just like the rest of your brothers with you're trademark catchphrases like ""         ""  and ""             "" and who can forget such witty lines like ""                     "" or ""                    "". You and Exalted truly are at the top of the promo game, who needs to promo when you can just win titles and say nothing. Now Woody. My sweet summer child. Well, actually no fuck you. You and AoC are apparently the Kings of Chaos. Yeah no. Thats a hard no from me for a variety of reasons - well actually just one - You haven't done anything to earn that moniker. Yes you attack children, interns, babies etc just like me but you haven't done anything to sow discord - like me. I am the upgrade in every way shape and form. I am superior to you all - I've bested all of you 1 on 1 numerous times, I've lived up to the crown that I treasure so dearly, a title that nobody and noone can rip away from me. Kings of Chaos? More like Kings of Mediocrity.  Woody and Dan for the sin of Gluttony, on the bosom of ill-begotten titles - you will both be punished.

&amp;#x200B;

The Fifth Rung - The Avenger. Oh dear lord... where do I start. Perhaps we begin with the Obvious.. the outer circle. It takes all of my effort not to burst out laughing saying that name Mark but i'll try contain it for the purpose of pointing out how fucking stupid you are. You belong high up on this rung because you epitomize the laziness that surrounds Legion. It even further solidifies my view that Legion is a bastion of Glory in a sea of complacency and inferiority. The one last remaining beacon of hope in this sea of beige ass darkness. Avenger your rag tag group of misfits much like you do not belong in LLR much less a ring with me. Somehow you bested me in Japan, at Survivor series that fluke will be dealt to quick smart I promise you that now. For a name that lacks such originality I remain at a loss for words, what could I say that would be of any more use? Advice maybe? Well I have some rather sage wisdom to bestow upon you and your brothers. Maybe you should suck so fucking much you god damn animals. I'd rather sit through a 780 day Naruto US title reign than devote any energy to thinking about you muppets in the ""oUtEr cIrcLe"" while we're at it why don't we have the ""Old Bucks"" join or the ""Not-best-friends"" or 'Public Party"" or the fucking ""Light Order"" you unoriginal dickbags. For the sin of fraud mark - you will be punished.

&amp;#x200B;

The Sixth and Final Rung - One Man banned or OMB however you identify. We know each other very well don't we? We've faced 4 times - and you have won one of those matches. And the match you did defeat me in - was a second straight rematch you were gifted by the GM. You didn't fucking earn that, you were given a hand out that you didn't deserve and undeservedly robbed me of my Television Title. The Title that I defended with my blood sweat and tears for weeks ignoring jabs about its legitimacy. And now I watch it get traded week in week out like it's some common hardcore title. It makes me sick to the stomach. But i'm not here to talk Television title. I'm here to talk you OMB. So let's talk. Hall of famer, world champ etc etc etc, yet despite your numerous accolades I find myself on top more often than not. Is it a personal flaw on you behalf? A fear rooted in the depths of your subconscious that you perhaps are not good enough to deal to me once and for all? Maybe the realisation that the world has past you by has finally gotten to you. Because it has. It isn't 2017 any more OMB. Times have changed and so have those in LLR. You are no longer the cutting edge, no longer the leader or peak. You are the forethought, the forgotten, aforementioned, you are the pagebreak, the footnote and I will ensure that when I beat you senseless at Survivor series that I confirm this for the world to see once and for all. You didn't move with the game, we're all playing Modern Warfare whilst you're still on the Atari. And to make matters worse you joined MDC. I've made my issue with... them wildly clear so I won't cover it again. I will personally enjoy exacting my vengeance - for betraying the seventh commandment and thus committing a cardinal sin - OMB I will personally enjoy punishing you.

&amp;#x200B;

My domain is my keeper. My domain is my home and my home is my castle. The Pacific runs through my body as strong and as numerous as any artery or vein. As important to my constitution as any bone in my body. As much a part of me as any leg or arm. The Pacific is as much part of my identity as any name or gender. As important to my soul as any god or religion. And as close to my heart as any one of my brothers. I may not like elements of my team but I will be damned if I don't go down fighting. From Hawaii to Fiji, from Tonga to Tokelau, from New Zealand to Easter Island. I will fight for this place till my final breath. Hundreds of years of cultural identity flows through my body, the blood of my forefathers in my veins. Pacific long and Pacific strong. The Pacific runs through me as deep as any ravine, as powerful as any cyclone and as deep as any trench.

&amp;#x200B;

I live Pacific.

I fight Pacific.

I bleed Pacific

I die Pacific.

&amp;#x200B;

Team Indy, I'll see you dickheads Sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

Long live the King."
dzfom0,17,2019-11-21,Why do I feel bad for reporting a potential predator? I’m 17 he’s 34,imfuckingwondering,abuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/dzfom0/why_do_i_feel_bad_for_reporting_a_potential/,"Okay so I just turned 17 a month ago. It is my second semester in college and on my birthday I actually got an opportunity to start working at my college as well. So there was this guy who was nice to me and talked to me.(nobody else really did and I have no friends) I thought he was cool. I told him it was my birthday on my first day working and he asked how old I was and I replied 17. He told me I don’t look 17. To which I responded that people usually say I look like I am 12. The next day I don’t wear makeup and I was like “ew I feel ugly” and we are alone walking to change printer ink and he tells me “to me you look the same as yesterday I don’t see anything wrong” okay I can take a compliment but I felt strange when he told me that like I didn’t say anything and walked uncomfortably. Anyways I tend to push the boundaries of what I should and should not say I’m pretty much an open book. Time goes by and I don’t know how this came up but basically I found out he smokes too. So he gives me his number and mouths the words “so we can smoke.” Now I know I don’t know this man very well but who is going to turn down free drugs I’m young. So we end up smoking. He picked me up from campus and we left to smoke just in the car around the block and he dropped me off. I felt a little weird but I ignored it. My creep senses didn’t have a strong detection that time. He picked me up from campus because I don’t have a car and he knows I can’t leave my house and at this time I think he’s 25 but I soon find out he’s 34. So me and him talk nothing sexual or at least I wasn’t I just thought he was better than everybody in the office. A couple days pass and he wants me to smoke with him but he got off before me. He waited 20 minutes in the parking lot for me as soon as he started to drive off he said “oh it’s at my house” I didn’t know what to do so I didn’t say anything then he stops at a gas station and ask if I want to drink (alcohol) with him. I didn’t really want to and I’m not one to turn down a drink and I seriously considered not drinking but I reluctantly agreed. We get to his house and smoke but I was so uncomfortable I had also remembered he owns like 4 or 5 guns I could’ve been stuck there held captive so I decided to leave. He took me back to school because he knows he can’t drop me off at my house he didn’t touch me or say anything sexual thankfully. Then one day I was sitting at a shared desk and he comes up to me and ask if he can use the desk and I say yes. Then he tells me “ you need to stop being friendly becau...” he cuts himself off and says “I’ll tell you in a minute.” So now I’m like Um okay ? Then he tells me to go with him so we can swap office phones for new ones. He gets me alone with him in the elevator and says “ oh yea you need to stop being friendly because I was going to grab your ass like to move you” okay this guy knows I am 17 I have told him many times. I was so uncomfortable we were alone in the elevator I didn’t know what to say so I didn’t say anything. We had to wait for someone at the office so we were sitting in chairs and he showed me a picture of some random girl and was like “I’m going to fuck her on her lunch break” and okay? Your a fucking grown ass man adults have sex big fucking deal. I didn’t think much of it and here goes me with my big mouth and I don’t know why I told him but I did about this girl I was arguing with and I told him how I told her things that me and my boyfriend do. He told me “damn I would want to see that” and I freeze. He told me “ I’ll show you if you show me” and I didn’t say anything I couldn’t even look at him. He said “ so is that a no” and I said “no.” So we just sat there awkwardly. Time goes by and I forget about it at the time I had another job as well at a fast food place. Now I know this part is my fault trust me I understand HR has already made me feel like a dumb bitch about it. I call him while I’m at my fast food job so he can come and smoke me out. By the time he told me he was coming I instantly regretted what I did I made my friend come outside with me but she was all coked out so wouldn’t have been a big help but she made me feel a little better not that much. She comes outside and comes to the car and says “how old are you, you look old.” And he said “how old are you?” She responded “I’m 25” then he said “I’m 25 too” keep in mind I know for a fact he is at least 34. I look at him from the corner of my eyes without turning my head and I was just thinking wtf did I just get myself into. I was freaking out on the inside told myself this would be the last time I would ever talk or smoke with him. My friend has to go back to work and he wanted me to walk with him and his dog to the grass area. Keep in mind it is 10 o’clock at night I’m scared my friend was going inside I wasn’t going to walk with him and his dog. The joint was still lit but I just left him. My other friend was in the patio she used to work there but she quit. So I went to go sit with her. The friend that was on coke said “did you just leave him like that you are so mean” I told her why I left him like that but of course she doesn’t know the whole story because I didn’t tell her he lied about his age I was already embarrassed. Then he was leaving but came passing by where we were sitting my other friend who was drinking saw his dog and told him to park so she can pet his dog and I was like omg I just want him to leave. My friend who was drinking saw his face and looks at me and says “wtf is wrong with you he looks so old” she kept saying it and I was feeling more scared and embarrassed. Anyways he leaves I don’t talk a lot I want him gone. I go home still thinking about what my friend said for just leaving him so I texted him. I said sorry I was scared my mom was gonna see. Which I really wasn’t but it was an excuse because your 34 hanging out with a 17 year old that’s scared her mom is going to see her. He said sorry doesn’t buy me weed and responded with you owe me. I took that as sexual and I told him I would give him $10 on Friday. Friday never came because I was so scared I called in to go late. I didn’t see I’m for a few days but I had went into work early and I knew I was going to see him so I called my boyfriend to avoid a conversation with him. This fucking man then proceeds to use an app we use to go in and fix peoples computers for the school and basically hacks into my work computer and opens up a work document and types “get back to work” and I wrote “leave me alone” he then started laughing. I started going into work late to avoid him and the day before I reported him I knew he was going to be coming out of work as soon as I was walking in so I walked the long way. Keep in mind I was so determined not to see him I walked the long way on a cold windy and rainy day.. I see these carts that we use to get around campus and I’m hoping it is not him. I put my headphones and hoodie on and look down. It was him and he stopped me. He asked if I was mad and I said no. He said oh you haven’t been texting me I used school as an excuse and went about my Business and continued walking. I get into the office and he throws his hands in the air and said “I thought you were leaving” I quickly replied no. I thought it was weird he thought that because I hadn’t been in the office. The next day I spoke with a intern and told him everything he said that the creep guy gives him creep vibes also because the first day the intern started working there they went in those carts and he said that the perv was driving and was looking at every single girls ass and boobs that walked by then would look at him making faces expecting him to be like omg 😆!

Good career prospects, or not good?",SpecialistNovel0,moneylaundering,https://www.reddit.com/r/moneylaundering/comments/dzfp20/career_in_kyc_consultancy_with_my_skillset_good/,"Hey r/moneylaundering I got a call back from a consultancy firm looking for a KYC analyst. My background is in Business Information Management, which works in the intersection of business and technology (e.g. ERP software, Excel, Tableau, general finance and accounting knowledge, and product marketing). It's incredibly flexible, and I had internships as Financial Analyst and Business Analyst so I applied to the KYC role, and they considered me because I spoke a language of companies they were working overseas (European Language).

Hows the role in KYC/AML for someone who also knows programming (python, data modeling)? Also, another language that I am fluent is Japanese. Are these skills not at all applicable for career growth prospects, or can I consider this role as a serious career to follow? The employer is offering 70k, and that for a fresh graduate with only internship experiences can be really tempting.

Thanks for the input of anyone knowledgeable on this subject"

I copied all them down because I was going to correct the grammar &amp; formatting errors.

Finally corrected grammar, spacing, &amp; spelling errors for these parts.

I believe the author was u/MumsdBest.

**Part 1**

This happened about a year back and I've always wanted to share my story, but didn't know how or where. I came across this sub recently and thought to myself this is a great place to share my story.

I was 24 years old at the time and just finished my internship with a reputed company and got offered a permanent position there. I had pretty good luck with the ladies as well. So, life was good.

Little bit of backstory. My mom and dad married when Mom was 18 and she had me when she was about 20. When I was about 5, my parents got divorced and I stayed with Dad. My mom gave up custody, so it was a pretty clean divorce. Well, as clean as divorces can get. My dad remarried later and I became part of their family. My step mom is a lovely person and she raised me as her own along with my half sister. In a way, she was more of a mom to me than my actual mom.

My mom used to visit me occasionally, but the frequencies of them decreased as I grew up. My mom finished college after the divorce and probably concentrated mostly on her career. It paid off and she is a very successful woman today, though she never remarried. Due to her job, she travels a lot, sometimes 1 year or 2 years at a stretch overseas. So, a lot of times, I won't seen her for a couple of years.

My relationship with Mom is a bit complicated. As a child, I was initially confused about the divorce, as most children would be. Then, when I grew little older, I was angry at her for abandoning me. Even though, strangely enough, I never told her that. Whenever I saw her, I would forget everything and jump into her arms and seeing her beautiful smile would make me forget everything. It's weird, the bond between a mother and her child. Even though I was angry at her, I love her more than anyone in this world.

As I hit puberty, I started to notice how attractive my mom really was. My mom is about 5'7"", brunette, long legs, D-cup, round breasts, and a beautiful, round ass, which I think is an absolute knock out. Overall, she is more on the curvier side than skinnier side. Her best feature, though, is her face. She has one of those faces where you'd think she's lot younger than she actually is. Right now, she is 45, but you'd be forgiven if you thought she was between 35 to 40.

As I grew older, I started to notice not only my mom's beautiful smile, but her gorgeous body as well. It was a confusing time for me. I started to notice he neckline, her breasts, and, mostly, how beautiful her round ass was. I'd get hard thinking about her gorgeous body. I was ashamed of myself, but I didn't know how to stop it. Obviously, I couldn't talk to anyone about it. Whenever my mom would visit and give me a tight hug, I would feel her breasts pressed against me and, with my crotch pressed against her belly, I would start to go hard. It was real torture for me, as I wanted to stay in the embrace for as long as I could, but I really couldn't in the fear of her finding about my boner. I obviously never ever thought of acting upon them and thought it was just a phase which will eventually go away when I have girlfriends, but, as the years went by, it never really went away. A lot of times, I would find myself masturbating thinking about mom. As I said, it was a really confusing time for me. It's not that I didn't see her as my mom, I absolutely loved her as my mom, but there were these feelings as well. I would be jealous of any imaginary boyfriend she might have, and would sometimes think to myself, ""I can't believe someone actually gets to sleep with this incredible beauty.""

Things started to change about a year back. She came back after one of her trips abroad, after being gone for almost year and half. After she returned, she said she wouldn't be going to any trips abroad for at least the next couple of years. She was apparently tired of all the traveling. She also said that she wanted for us to reconnect as mom and son, as she missed most of my childhood. My emotions were, frankly, mixed at that point. I was happy that mom was trying to reconnect, but the anger was still there for abandoning me.

To move closer to me, she rented an apartment which was about a 3 hour drive from the place I lived, but it was almost 3 hours drive from her work as well, whereas her original home that she owned was very near to her work. I could see that she was really making an effort, but I still didn't know what to make of the whole situation. Knowing her, I thought she might change her mind about the whole thing any moment.

After she got settled in her new apartment, she offered to cook me dinner one Saturday night, and she asked me to stay over for the night so that I didn't have to drive back at night. I obliged.

I reached there that evening and she greeted me with her beautiful smile. I was seeing her after year and a half. She looked so beautiful, even without much makeup. She was wearing a long beautiful dress that accentuated her curves. She started putting the final touches on dinner and I finished some work stuff I needed to follow up on. After dinner, we went on to the balcony with a bottle of wine.

Standing on the balcony, she had her hand wrapped around my waist and her head resting on my shoulder, my hand around her waist. We were having a really nice quiet moment to ourselves. Gradually, the discussion turned emotional. The wine had kicked in a bit at that point. She was really emotional. She said sorry so many times, said, ""I should have never given you up, I'm your mom, you are my baby boy."" She said, ""I was so stupid for missing your entire childhood and now you're almost a man.""

My emotions also got better of me, all the bottled up anger and emotion came out. Mom said she was young, stupid, confused, and didn't know what to do at that point. She held my hands and, again, said how sorry she was. We both were crying at that point. Finally, I calmed down a little bit, turned her towards me and embraced her, and said, ""It's okay mom, what's done is done and I'm happy that I'm finally able to tell you about my feelings and that I understand at least a little why you did it.""

She was still crying and said, ""You have no idea how much I love you.""

I said, ""I know mom, I love you too, more than anyone in this world."" I hugged her tightly and we stayed in the embrace for a pretty long time. At first, it was a lovely mom-son embrace and affection, and I felt that too. But, then my mind started playing tricks with me after a while.

After a while, for some reason, I started caressing her hair and the side of her arm. I kept kissing top of her head, her forehead, her cheeks. She stopped crying. I could see a faint smile and she said, ""Oh I can get used to this."" She then started repeating the same things to me. Problem is, after a while, my brain registered that my body was pressed against a beautiful woman; a woman whose body I practically worshipped growing up, and I started getting hard. Sirens were going off in my mind and I tried to get out of the embrace.

I said, ""Mom, it's getting late, we should go inside.""

Mom replied, ""Just a little while more sweetie, it feels so good, doesn't it?""

I didn't know what to do, surely she could feel it. I was so embarrassed. I was sure at that point she could feel my hard on. She probably could see my face turning into all shades of red. She whispered in my ears, ""It's okay, baby, don't worry about it.""

I was even more embarrassed and could only say, ""I'm sorry mom.""

She said, ""Shh, just enjoy the moment. Besides, I think it's cute. Somebody's has a little crush on Mommy."" I probably got fully erect hearing that. She hugged me tighter and I let go of all of my hesitation and pressed my erect cock tightly against her belly and moaned a little. She moaned a little too.

We stayed there like that for some time and finally, when my erection subsided a little bit, we went inside. We said good night to each other, she kissed me on the cheek, and then we went to our rooms (separate rooms, don't get any ideas!). I went to the bathroom straight away and jerked off furiously, thinking about mom; her gorgeous curves, her smell. After I was clear-headed, I also started thinking about the emotional aspect of it, what it meant and all that. It was a big day for me, needless to say. I remember that I laid awake in the bed for a long time. The next day, I had to leave early. We said goodbye to each other with the promise that we would try to do it regularly.

That was was start of something that I never imagined would happen in my wildest dreams. Over the course of the next 5 months or so, I tried to visit her almost every weekend and we resolved a lot of issues lingering between us. With time, it bought us closer than ever as mom and son. I won't bore you with all the details, as it would be too long, but I will try to describe a few significant days that defined and grew our relationship from being a just birth mom and son to a truly loving mom and son and more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2**

**I was originally going to finish the story of me and mom in this post itself, without making it too long. But, since a lot of you have encouraged me to make it more detailed, I will make it a little longer and divide in into further parts. I also feel more details will do justice to our story. I hope you enjoy it.**

After that fateful day, my world had changed. For better or worse, I still had no idea. So many thoughts clouded my mind and I had no answers to them. The most frightening thought, obviously, was, 'what is wrong with me? Surely, thinking about your own mother that way can't be right.' At the same time, I at least had the consolation of knowing that mom now knows about my situation. She felt my hard cock pressed against her, though it didn't seem to bother her. I was mostly glad that she wasn't angry or thought I was some disgusting specimen. After that night, our Saturday night rituals became a regular occurrence. Weird thing is, in that period, we hugged and kissed each other, mostly on cheeks, a lot of times. Well, that's not the weird part, the weird part is that, a lot of times, when we embraced each other, I genuinely felt the motherly love and affection. I didn't have any other naughty thoughts and didn't get hard at all either. But, there were other times I would get really hard with her body pressed tightly against me and my hands wanted to do so many things.

I remember one time when we both were in the kitchen, she was wearing tight jeans and a t-shirt. The tight jeans made her ass so perfectly round and beautiful, I found myself stealing a glance off her ass every few seconds. She was standing with her back towards me. She wanted me to taste something, which gave me a perfect excuse to hug her from behind. So, I wrapped my hands around her waist and hugged her tightly.

I kissed her her cheek first and said, ""Wow where did you learn to cook like that mom?"" I felt I was getting hard, I smelled side of her neck, her hair and kissed her neck, my cock was really hard at that point, tightly pressed against her back. I remember that I so wanted my hands to move further up to feel her tits, I wanted to move my hip back and forth to grind her perfectly round ass. But I didn't. Instead, I just pressed my body against her as tightly as possible with my **fully erect cock painfully pressed against her back**.

She made a sound like, ""umm,"" gave me a long kiss on my cheek, and suddenly broke the embrace saying, ""Dinner's getting cold, let's go.""

Another time, a couple of weeks after the incident in the kitchen, we were watching TV, both sitting on the floor, both resting our backs against the couch. I was wearing a T-shirt and shorts and mom was wearing tank top and RJs. I was really worn out that day and feeling really tired. Mom said, ""Why don't you rest you head on my lap?"" So, I laid down with my head on my mom's lap.

I think it was probably the first time in my memory I put my head on my mom's lap. Mom started to lovingly play with my hair. I felt so loved at that moment, I said almost half asleep, ""That feels so good mom, I love you.""

Mom said, ""I can't believe you grew up to be such a sweet man."" She then lowered her body and showered me with small kisses on my cheeks, my eyes, my forehead, my nose and couple of times even on my lips.

Even though they were small pecks on the lips, I was suddenly awake feeling her lips on mine. She then lowered her body further and pressed her entire upper body on me, resting her head on the middle of mine. What it did was **her round soft breasts were pressed against my face now**. It was an amazing sensation. I could feel that she wasn't wearing any bra, I could feel the beautiful shape of her breasts with only the thin fabric of her tank top separating her breasts and my face. I could hear my mom's heavy breathing. We stayed like that for a while. But then, still keeping my eyes closed, I started to move my face to feel her tits.

I started moaning, ""Oh, mom, you're so pretty,"" and started to kiss her breasts over the top of her tank top. Mom also moved her upper body to give me good feel of her breasts. I could hear my mom moan as well. I smelled and kissed her soft round breasts probably a thousand times. Didn't want it to end. But, suddenly, I could feel my mom's upper body lifting. I opened my eyes and she had a very sweet yet naughty smile on her face.

She broke the eye contact and said, ""Oh my, someone surely loves his mommy."" I followed her eyes and she was staring directly at the huge tent my rock hard cock made inside my shorts. I was instantly red, mom just smiled and kissed me on the forehead and said, ""Come on, get up, it's really late.""

Our relationship was progressing, we were becoming closer with every passing week and the things were heating up. I should've been really happy, but I wasn't, not completely. Because I couldn't read my mom's mind regarding the physical things that were happening between us. Obviously, she was okay was this little physical naughtiness, but was she willing to explore a little more? Or was that too much? So, I spoke to one of my very close friend about it. I didn't tell him the woman was my mother, of course, so I changed the context a little bit. He gave me some advice, good advice. Then, I thought about the whole situation practically and honestly, then came to a decision. I decided that, no matter what, I wouldn't push anything regarding the physical aspect with Mom. I didn't expect anything to happen anyway. Whatever happened so far was already beyond my expectations. I decided that, no matter how much I am tempted, I have to control myself. As it turned out, it was the best decision of my life.

Mom found a good apartment up for sale in the same neighborhood she was living in. She decided to buy it, selling the apartment she already owned. It was obviously a lot of work. I also had a stressful time at work. We still had our Saturday night rituals, but most of the time we both were so exhausted that nothing out of the ordinary happened for about a month. But I still used to look forward to those evenings as at least we could talk. And for the first time in my life, I felt I found someone with whom I could talk for hours. We always somehow found something interesting to talk about.

Then came the day she moved to her new apartment. I helped with the move and, by the time everything had been moved to her new apartment, it was already evening. Mom said, ""Would you be a sweetheart dear and pick up some Chinese from the nearby place?"" I said of course and picked up a bottle of wine as well on the way back. When I got back, I saw the lights were dim, some lovely music was on, and mom wore a beautiful velvet colour long dress. She looked stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I said almost nervously, ""Wow mom you look just stunning."" I asked, ""What's the occasion?""

She said, ""Oh, nothing. Just wanted to celebrate my new apartment.""

I said, still looking at my stunning mom, ""I'm so glad you decided to celebrate.""

Mom then added, ""Oh, and there is one more thing. Your old mother is turning another year older today."" I didn't know what to say first. I cursed myself under my breath. How could I be so stupid? I actually know and remember her birthday. I wished her happy birthday every year even when she was abroad.

I could only say, ""Happy birthday, Mom. I'm so sorry I forgot, I'm a stupid son. I didn't even get you anything.""

Mom said, ""You're here. That's more than enough for me, trust me on this.""

I left the room and changed to wear a nice shirt. Fortunately, I had a decent blazer with me and put that on. Then I came back out and holding my mom's hand I said, ""Come on, we're going outside to have a proper celebration.""

Mom said, ""Sweetie, thank you so much for that, but I'd rather stay home. I don't really feel like going outside.""

I said, ""Okay, mom. It's your birthday, your wish is my command."" I opened the bottle of wine and poured into two glasses. I made a pretty good toast, wishing her happy birthday, and sang, 'Happy Birthday to You.' There were little drops of tears rolling down her eyes. I said, ""Come on, mom. You shouldn't cry on your birthday.""

Mom replied, ""Don't worry, sweetie. These are tears of joy.""

After about 3 glasses of wine, mom suddenly got up and said, ""Come on, dance with me."" There was some slow romantic music on at that time.

I threw my jacket on the couch and said, ""Whatever you say, birthday girl."" We started slow dancing with me leading. We had our hands at each other's waist and slowly just swaying with the music. As the music went on, in a few moments our bodies were pressed against each other as we danced cheek to cheek. The smell of her perfume, the smell of her hair, the smell of wine, everything mixed together, it was just intoxicating. I just thanked my lucky stars. My cock was feeling these sensations too, as it was slowly becoming aroused.

I whispered in her ears, still swaying, ""Mom, I don't think you look stunning.""

She said, ""What do you mean?""

I replied, ""I mean, I didn't have the balls to say it then, you actually look hot and sexy. Men would give anything to be in my position right now.""

Mom said, ""Ih stop it, you're just saying it to make your old mother feel good.""

I replied, ""No, I mean it, mom"" and then kissed her cheek lightly. Still swaying, I slowly ran my fingers around the side of her arms up and down. I pressed her even more tightly to my body with my left hand and then started to slowly run my right hand up and down her back, while kissing her neck, her cheek, and her forehead. I really wanted to go lower with my right hand, but decided not to press my luck. I said, ""You have no idea how beautiful you are, mom."" She didn't say anything, but let a satisfactory moan out.

She then pulled me towards her with her left hand, even air probably couldn't pass though us at the point. My cock was throbbing at this point, feeling the shape of her entire frontal body on me, her soft boobs almost crushing against my body. I then felt her right hand slowly caressing my entire back starting from back of my head to back of my waist. After just a few moments like this ,a wonderful thing happened; **I felt her right hand on my ass.** She gave me small kisses repeatedly on my cheeks and forehead and even on my lips, all the while, her right hand first slowly caressing my ass and then actually squeezed it.

She kept saying, ""My sweet boy."" I thought my cock would burst out of my pants, it was so hard. I never felt so much pain, and yet so much pleasure at the same time before in my life. As she was doing this, I took the hint. I slowly moved my right hand lower which was resting just on top of her ass cheeks. I couldn't believe **I was actually feeling her gorgeous ass with my hand**. I caressed her ass slowly at first taking in every bit of it, almost memorizing it's shape. I then started to squeeze her perfect round ass first with very little pressure, but increased the pressure with every passing moment. She was doing the same. Suddenly, the music stopped.

We both almost jolted out of a dream. We looked at each other almost fearfully, though we still held each other. I then looked at mom's eyes and then mine fell on her beautiful red lips. I didn't think much, I moved my lips towards hers. I could see fear and anticipation at the same time in her eyes, I probably had the same look. I first kissed the side of her lips, then gave small pecks to her lips. Then, I closed my eyes and pressed my lips against hers. After what felt like ages, in reality it must not have been more than just couple of seconds, **the magical moment came, I felt her lips opening up**. We both held each other as tightly as possible and kissed like crazy lovers, both sucking the other's lips, almost like we wanted to suck every drop of blood out of them. I thrusted my tongue into her mouth, she reciprocated by touching my tongue with hers. We let our tongues almost intertwine and played with each other a little bit. Our lips were now busy exploring and sucking each other's tongues as they danced inside our mouthes. I could feel the precum oozing out of my cock. I slowly started to grind her.

""Mom, you're so hot,"" I said.

Mom broke the kiss suddenly after few moments of this heavenly sensation and put a hand on my chest and said, ""Calm down, baby. Mom needs you to calm down.""

It was really hard for me, but I reminded myself of the promise I made to myself.

Both still panting, mom said, ""We shouldn't get too carried away, you understand?"" I nodded.

She hugged me again and gave me a kiss on my forehead. ""I knew my baby was a gentleman."" She then said, ""Let me heat up the dinner,"" and then she came closer and almost whispered, ""In the meantime, why don't you go to the bathroom and take care of the little problem, um, actually *big* and *hard* problem downstairs?""

I said, ""What?"" and then instantly realizing what she was talking about. I became aware of my bulge pressing against her. I blushed and could only say, ""Okay, mom."" It didn't take much time to take care of my problem really. While I was doing it, I kept saying, ""Oh, mom. Oh, mom"" pretty loudly, hoping she could hear me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3**

**Just a side note, I actually have shared my writing with Mom and she said it pretty much accurately describes the progression of our relationship, which is a relief for me. I was worried if I was able to capture the essence of it, thanks for reading.**

My mom has this incredible capacity to turn any awkward moment right. When I came out of the bathroom, I thought to myself, 'This is going to be awkward after what just happened.' But, as soon as I reached the dining table, she laughed heartily and said said, ""Baby, business taken care of?""

I couldn't help but laugh loudly and said, ""Yes, mom."" Then, I said, ""Mom, should we talk about what just happened?""

Mom replied, ""Yes, baby, we should, and we will, I promise, but not tonight. We shared a wonderful moment and I hope you think the same way.""

I said,  ""Of course, mom, it was incredible,"" and started to say something more.

Mom stopped me and said, ""Come on, dinner's getting cold. Let's eat, I don't want to starve on my birthday."" I just smiled and started eating. We had some more wine and laughed and joked. It was a good night, a great night.

Next weekend was raining like crazy, so I couldn't drive to her place on Saturday and so we had to wait for another week for the TALK. Finally, the next weekend arrived and I had butterflies in my stomach thinking about what she had to say. She was her cheerful self as she cooked and hummed in the kitchen. After dinner, we sat on the couch and started watching a movie.

Finally, somewhere in the middle of of the movie, she paused it and said, ""So, I guess we need to address the elephant in the room, huh, baby?""

**Me:** ""I'm afraid so, mom.""

**Mom:** ""Come sit closer to me sweetie.""

I moved beside her on the couch, she wrapped her hand around me and I put my head on her shoulder. She played with my hair and said, ""Are you comfortable?""

I replied, ""Very.""

Mom said, ""Okay then. Now, what I'm about to say, I need you to listen carefully and think about it carefully okay?"" I nodded. Mom continued, ""Listen, sweetie. The other night, we shared a beautiful moment together, and I have absolutely no regret over it. I hope you don't either. If you have even a little bit of doubt, you need to tell me.""

**Me:** ""Absolutely not, mom. I loved every moment of it.""

**Mom:** ""As beautiful as it was, most people would consider that inappropriate between a mother and son, you understand?""

**Me:** ""Yes, mom, I do, but I don't care about other's opinions. The only opinion that matters to me is yours.""

**Mom:** ""That's really sweet, baby, but we need to be careful. Careful not to cross any boundaries from which we can't return. I'll always cherish the other night as a beautiful moment between us, but we need to be careful not to repeat that.""

I felt sadness instantly hearing that. I think my face fell dark or something because mom could sense my sadness. She said, kissing top of my head, ""Don't look so glum, baby. You can still show your love towards me, but just don't get too greedy, you understand?""

I said again, ""I think so, mom.""

The following week, I kept thinking about what mom said. I didn't allow myself to think too far ahead because it seemed too impossible. But after things started to happen, for the last few weeks, I started to want a little bit more. The next weekend, I couldn't visit her due to work emergencies. But the weekend after that was interesting. Most likely because of all the heavy talk the weekend before that, I was more restrained with my behavior towards Mom. I wasn't doing it intentionally. We still were having a good time, but just restrained as far as physical touches go. We had a pretty early dinner. Mom said she had to take care of some work stuff. I was sitting on a chair on the porch of her new apartment with a cold beer. After a while I heard mom's footsteps. She was wearing jeans and blouse.

""What are you thinking about,"" she said. She had a beer in her hand too.

""I've always loved a girl who loves beer,"" I said.

**Mom:** ""Oh, then you are going to adore me sir.""

**Me:** ""As if I need another reason to adore you.""

She suddenly sat on my lap sideways. She then took my both hands to put around her waist. I took the hint and hold her tightly. She said, ""Are you angry with me, sweetie, because of our talk the other night?""

**Me:** ""Of course not, mom. I can never be angry at you.""

**Mom:** ""It's just that you haven't hugged me even once today.""

**Me:** ""Just playing it safe, mom.""

**Mom:** ""I want you to know that I really enjoy your affection. I don't want you to stop holding me and showing your love towards me in the little ways you have been doing. Just as long as we don't get too carried away, it's fine baby.""

My cock twitched hearing those words. Mom put her head on my chest and started to draw circles on my it with her fingers. I held her tightly with both hands first and kissed the top of her head and said, ""I just hope I'm strong enough to stop before crossing any boundaries. You have no idea what you do to me, mom.""

Mom looked up and said, ""I might have some idea,"" and moved just a little. 

**I realized I was hard and my erect cock was poking her butt.** Without taking my eyes off of her, I said, ""Mom, do you enjoy *this* kind of affection too?"" I just moved my hips upward to give her kind of a small grind with my hard cock.

She remained silent for a few moments then finally replied, ""I-I do, sweetie.""

I put the index finger of my right hand on her lips and then slowly started to run my fingers around them. I said, ""Mom, I never thought kisses can be so hot and so passionate and so powerful before I kissed you."" Our breathing starting to get heavy at this point.

Mom also touched my lips with her fingers and said, ""I agree, sweetie, but it's so inappropriate to kiss your mother like that."" All the while, her lips were coming towards me. I held her as tightly as possible and we locked our lips. First slowly and then it became really passionate. All the while, mom kept saying, ""It's so wrong, baby,"" and I kept saying, ""I know, mom,"" but neither of us ending the kiss.

The sound of heavy breathing and kissing filled the porch.

While kissing, mom started to run her right hand through my entire body and chest over my T-shirt. I also started to run my right hand through the length of upper part of her leg, and then, getting a little more adventurous, I started to run my hand first on her belly over her blouse and then started to go up and very lightly cupped below one of her breasts. I could feel she was wearing a bra this time. Our kiss intensified even more. Not getting any protest from mom, I became brave.

I ran my hand lightly over her breasts at first. Still nothing. Now I started to put pressure on her breasts. I started to squeeze them and felt them as much as I could. I could feel her nipples even through her blouse and bra, they were so hard. I circled and touched her nipples with my index finger. Even though it was through her blouse and bra, it was the first time I was feeling her beautiful tits with my hand. The kiss, in the meantime, was getting more and more intense as I continued to explore my mom's breasts with my right hand. I was so hard, I started to grind her while the kissing continued. I thought I was going to cum.

But before I could cum, mom said, panting, ""Baby, we both need to relax a little bit now. We don't want to get too carried away."" My cock was throbbing and still aching, my hand was still on her soft tits. She removed my hand slowly first, gave me a small kiss on the cheek and got up from my lap. I ran towards the bathroom, thankfully the common bathroom was just beside the porch. I had a very naughty idea.

I kept the bathroom door open and, as I started to jerk off, I kept getting louder and louder, ""Oh mom, oh mom, yes mom!"" I made sure this time she could hear me. When I came out of the bathroom, I expected that mom would say something, but she didn't. She had kind of this naughty smile in her face.

She just said, ""I'm off to bed, sweet dreams, baby.""

The following weekend, I was going camping that Saturday, so I called her and said I would be to dropping by on Friday after work. When I reached her home, it was still pretty early, so I let myself in. I had an extra set of keys to her place. I finished off some work stuff first, then it was starting to get dark. Then I got a call from mom.

She said, ""I'm really really sorry, sweetie. Some work stuff has come up and I will be pretty late, don't wait up for me. I will see you tomorrow morning."" I was little disappointed, but I decided to make a movie night out of it. I got a six pack from the nearby wine store, ordered some pizza, and watched Netflix till about 9:30. Then I felt sleepy, so I went to bed. It must not have been more than 10, 10:30 I think when I heard ***knock knock***. I was half asleep, but I heard mom saying, ""Are you awake sweetie?"" The knock was more of a customary knock, really. I always kept my door open when I'm at mom's.

I said, ""Yes, mom,"" in a sleepy voice. ""How was your day?"" She came and sat at the edge of the bed. Now I could see her in dim light. She was wearing a blouse and one of those knee length tight skirts.

She said, ""Oh, you wouldn't believe the day I had.""

I said, :You still look so lovely, mom.""

She sighed and said, ""Scoot over,"" got rid of her shoes, and laid down on my left hand side. I covered her with my comforter, she turned towards me. I put my right hand over her, she put her left hand over me, turning towards each other. She said, ""Mmm, this feels nice.""

Looking at each other, I said, ""Why don't you tell me about your day?""

She said, ""It's nothing interesting, sweetie, just a lot of work.""

I said, ""Okay, let me make it little better for you."" I started giving small messages to the back of her neck and her back while kissing her on her forehead, her cheeks, and eventually on her beautiful lips. ""Better?"" I asked

""Mmmm, much, much better, your step mom raised you well. Did you do any of this with her?"" she suddenly asked.

I asked, ""Why, are you jealous?""

She said, ""Maybe.""

I laughed and said, ""Of course not, mom."" I continued, ""This is special for you only. You know, mom, I consider myself so lucky that I have not one, but *two* moms. Both love me so much.""

Mom asked, ""Who do *you* love more, me or your step mom?""

I remained silent for a while, then said, ""I have an answer, but won't tell you because it's unfair to ask me that question.""

She smiled and said, ""Smart answer.""

She started to give me small kisses on my face, my mind was now wandering again in the dangerous places. I suddenly become aware of her body, her breasts pressed against my chest. I was starting to get hard. I said, ""Mom, can I ask you something?""

**Mom**: ""Yes, baby?""

**Me**: ""Last Saturday, after we finished our night on the porch, you heard me from the bathroom right? I mean, you must've.""

**Mom:** “Yes, what of it?""

**Me:** ""How do you feel about it? I just hope you are not disgusted by it.""

**Mom:** ""Little bit embarrassed, maybe, but not disgusted, and weirdly a bit little flattered too.""

I blushed, held her tighter, my hard cock now poking her through her skirt. I lightly kissed her lips again. Mom then said, ""What's your game plan here, sweetie, or endgame?""

**Me:** ""I don't know, mom.""

**Mom:** ""You want to see me naked, is that it?""

I remained silent and and kissed her lips again, my cock twitched inside my shorts.

**Mom:** ""You need to be honest with me, sweetie. Nothing you say will make me angry, I promise.""

**Me:** ""I haven't thought too far, mom, honestly, but now that you have asked, I would love nothing more than to see you naked.""

Mom sighed and gave me a long kiss on my lips, then said, “I’m sorry, sweetie. You can't. It's too weird, I'm not your lover, I'm your mom.""

**Me:** ""But we're doing things ordinarily a mom and son don't do.""

**Mom:** ""Yes, I get how that might be confusing for you, and it's sweet that you have a crush on your mommy. But, my feeling is, whatever we are doing now is just a little extension of showing love and affection towards each other. Not conventional, maybe, but it makes us both feel good, doesn't it? But, at the end of the day, I'm still your mom and I hope you never forget that.""

**Me:** I sighed with disappointment. ""Okay, mom, I guess I understand what you're saying.""

**Mom:** ""Come on, don't be so disappointed, sweetie. Listen, if you don't feel comfortable or are somehow getting your hopes high towards something more, we need to stop this, you hear me?""

**Me:** ""No, it's fine, mom. I really enjoy these little things we do and I don't want to stop them.""

Mom said, ""Okay then, let me make you feel a little better,"" she pressed her body against me, put pressure to the back of my head with her left hand, and moved my head towards hers. **She then smooched me intensely. I returned the favor, of course, and tips of our tongues met and the smooch started to get hotter and hotter. As we were doing this, I started to grind her through her skirt, precum already started to ooze out of my rock hard cock.** 

We both were on our sides, pointed towards each other. With my right hand, I started to rub her thigh over her skirt at first and then rested my hand just on the edge where her skirt ended above her knee. **I started to put the first one, then two, and then all four fingers inside the edge of her skirt and start to gently rub the skin of her thigh. I waited for any kind of protest from mom, there wasn't any. Still kissing passionately, I slowly put my right hand inside her skirt. I could feel the smooth, naked skin of her thigh, then I started to rub her smooth skin. I was getting hornier by the second, I was grinding her harder and harder. I then moved my right hand further to the side of the naked skin of her thigh, I could feel most of her smooth gorgeous ass cheek, and then could feel the fabric of her panties. Things were really getting hotter, I increased the pace of my grinding, mom responded as well. We both were now grinding and smooching at a fast pace. I got even braver, I just lifted her skirt to her waist and started to explore the smooth skin of her round, tight, yet soft, ass. I put two fingers pressing the canyon between her ass cheeks and rubbing it over her panties. I think I was nearing climax. I was obviously thinking with my cock then, I was so horny. I tugged the back edge of her panties almost trying to take it off.**

Mom suddenly held my hand with her left tightly and broke the kiss. Both breathing heavily, both shaking. She kept holding it for few seconds and said, ""No sweetie, no. We shouldn't do this. I'm sorry I got you all hot and hard, but there's a boundary we can't cross. Like it or not, I'm still your mother and you are my sweet baby boy.""

We both laid on our backs, panting, staring at the ceiling. My cock was still rock hard. I waited for a few more moments, but it was still really hard. Mom didn't show any signs of moving. I don't know what came over me, I just got up, and went to the attached bathroom. First, I went to close the door, just as I was closing the door, I made eye contact with Mom, still lying on the edge of the bed, there was something in her eyes. I didn't close the door. Instead, I opened it completely. I even lit a dim light so that she could see me. Turning directly towards her, I took my shorts off completely. I saw her staring at my throbbing hard cock, she then looked at me. Looking in her eyes, I started to stroke my cock, first slowly, and then increasing the pace. There was so much precum, I didn't even need lotion to lubricate. As I started to increase the pace of strokes, I started moaning pretty loudly, ""Oh, mom, you're so beautiful,"" making eye contact with her. It was just surreal. Mom was alternatively looking at my eyes and my cock, biting her lips few times. Soon, I climaxed. It was the most intense climax I've ever had. There was so much cum, I saw mom biting her lips again, watching my cum-enveloped cock. I then closed the door.

dzghj8,4,2019-11-21,Chance me Brown and USC?,NihilAlien,CollegeTransfer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/dzghj8/chance_me_brown_and_usc/,"Hey guys, I'm planning on applying to Brown and USC this upcoming spring. I was wondering what you guys think of my application thus far, and if you would be able to advise me on other schools to look at.

**Reason**: 

My primary motive for transferring universities is to find a student body that I'm able to connect more with. I feel socially stifled at my current school, and I don't fit in with my school's student body at all. My college is pretty homogenous academically and culturally -- most students here are studying engineering and business. Since high school, I've grown up and learned that there is so much more to life than mathematics and science and that there is so much more to learn from those that come from different backgrounds and cultures. Philosophy, art, and a variety of subjects are just as interesting and important as STEM subjects are, especially in our interconnected world where nothing is in a vacuum. I want to go to a school that places more emphasis on diversity and the social sciences and humanities. Additionally, I'm looking for a larger, more vibrant LGBT community. In the last two years, I've discovered a lot about myself -- most significantly, accepting that I'm gay; I've been struggling with this for a while. I've since engaged with the pride center at my school, but it isn't as active nor as large as I would like it to be. When I was initially applying to college, I didn't consider myself gay at all and I didn't associate with the LGBT community at all. Thus I didn't care about college's LGBT communities; this has since obviously changed. Additionally, I thought I wanted a small suburban school, but I have come to realize that I want a large urban school. At a larger school, because of the law of large numbers, there will be a bigger LGBT community, and I will be able to find my people because there will be more students with varied interests.

Earlier this year, I went into New York for a large investment bank's diversity superday, a day where selected candidates are invited for an onsite interview for a summer internship. I had plenty of time to mingle among the other candidates, and I realized that my quality of life could be much better if I transfer to another university. I had more fun at the superday than I have had during my entire time in college. Thankfully, I was offered a position to work there, and I'm very excited and honored to work as a financial software engineer as well as serve as an LGBT diversity liaison to the executives of the company this upcoming summer.

I love Brown because I get the impression that it is very diverse, inclusive, and welcoming. When I was initially applying to college, I thought I wanted a smaller suburban college like the one I'm currently at, however, I now realize I want a larger school in a flourishing city like Providence, RI. Additionally, Brown's open curriculum will allow me to explore my interests in computer science, art, and philosophy without a problem, although I'm not entirely sure how much I'll be able to utilize the open curriculum as a junior transfer. I love Brown, but that 5% transfer acceptance rate is deterring... 

I like USC because I get a similar impression to the one I get from Brown -- that it is very diverse, inclusive, and welcoming. USC is much bigger than my current school, so I will certainly be able to find people I'll be able to connect with. Additionally, USC is in a large city, LA. Additionally, USC has a large emphasis on the humanities and social sciences through its extensive GE requirements. Thankfully, USC's admissions rate is higher than Brown's, so I hope I can get in at USC.

Dear Mexico Reddit Community,

I would like to introduce myself. I am Annika van der Noord (Dutch). I am an International Business and Languages student at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Groningen. As of now, I’m writing my bachelor thesis as an intern at a Dutch company.

This company is basically an online platform that allows subscribers to access high-quality educational books 24/7 from a large range of publishers. They have asked me to perform research into the market of higher education in Mexico. More specifically to analyse the current atmosphere of higher education in Mexico and to find out what the best strategy is to enter the Mexican market. I have been asking numerous universities if they are open to an interview regarding my research and most universities are not responding to my e-mails but I believe that this platform is also really interesting for the universities as well as for students. My question is if anyone in this community could help me with my research.

Any tip is more than welcome!

Thanks in advance!

Sincerely,

Annika van der Noord"

dzhe9r,28,2019-11-21,"Married with two kids, sexually confused and exhausted by it",Purple_Mangoes,latebloomerlesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/latebloomerlesbians/comments/dzhe9r/married_with_two_kids_sexually_confused_and/,"Hi there.  
So this is my first ever post on reddit - I basically created an account in order to post in here. I'm not sure what I'm looking for with this, but I feel like I need to start getting some of these thoughts and feelings out of my head, because I seem to be getting nowhere with them. Any advice, thoughts or ""I know that feeling!"" would be appreciated. It may be a long post - be warned.  


I'm a woman of 28 next month and married to a man with whom I've been together for 10 years - so all of my adult life and most of my teenage-life as well. We have two kids age 5 and 1,5. I guess our relationship is how you would expect it after so many years together and with two little kids, his job and my education. We're mostly partners who collaborate in raising the kids and keeping everything together. We don't fight excessively, we treat each other right and I do love him for what we've built together and for the father he is to our kids. But on top of the typical ""boredom"" and lack of passion that might often characterize a marriage at this point, I am so, so confused about my sexuality.  


A couple of years ago, before the kids happened, my husband and I briefly had a thing with another woman and she was my first sexual experience with a female. I did like her a lot, however I think I was too confused about the construct of the whole situation to allow myself to fall in love. It was messy in a lot of ways and so not really something that clarified much for me in terms of my sexuality. I guess I just accepted that women could be attractive as well and didn't think much more about it.  


And then 2019 happened and I started my internship as part of my education back in January. And there I met a woman who swept me off my feet and turned my world upside down. I found myself falling completely in love with her. And not only is she my supervisor and a fair bit older than me, she is also married (to a man) and with kids, so there is zero chance of it leading to anything. But oh. My. God. I am so, so in love with her. I find myself noticing every little thing about her, like the way she laughs or crinkles her eyebrows when she concentrates, the way she smells (oh my god...), the incredibly beautiful shape of her hands and do not even get me started on her perfect, perfect hair and eyes. To me she truly looks like she walked right out of a fantasy novel and does not even belong to this world.  


So, yeah. I don't think it's uncommon to experience attraction to other people even though you're in a very committed relationship. What does confuse me is the way that this attraction has left me feeling about my husband. I have basically lost interest in him both sexually and physically in general. I find myself imagining what it would be like to be with a woman instead. I'm basically annoyed with my husband for being male, which is completely unfair. We had sex a couple of days ago and frankly, it was awful (for me). I just found myself disconnecting, because I could in no way be turned on by all of these male features and I didn't even feel like I wanted to touch him or wanted him to touch me. I have grown to feel uncomfortable just hugging or having him touch me non-sexually.  


It's like I have completely lost interest in men. Not only my husband, but I honestly can not think of a guy, not even a celebrity hunk, that I find attractive at the moment. I can name lots of women though, and I've started to notice beautiful women everywhere I look.  


So... I am so, so confused, because my family means the world to me and I have dreamt of a nuclear family, a house and a dog. I still do. But I almost feel repelled by my husband and it's getting so hard to pretend that I just don't want to have sex because I'm swamped with laundry and cleaning and the kids. I feel like I can easily be happy with him in terms of family life, because he's an amazing person and amazing father, but not physically.   
At the same time I have to remind myself that my choice is not between my husband and my godess-like supervisor, because that is just not going to happen. And that makes me unsure if I'm really a lesbian or just blinded by my attraction to her, because if that's the case, there's absolutely no reason to leave my husband.  


How do you know if you're a lesbian or just madly in love with a particular woman who has turned your whole view on men around? How do you possibly find out what your sexuality really is within the constraints of a marriage and with kids? How do you possibly break up a family for solely selfish reasons and put yourself first instead of your kids? All of this just goes on and on in my head. And at the same time my internship is coming to an end and I'm almost panicking by the thought of having to leave her soon. And it hurts. Everything hurts and I just can't seem to find my footing in any of this.  


If you made it to the end, thanks for your time!"
dzi4x5,5,2019-11-21,TIGL by being late to an interview that then ended with an arrest.,eMouse2k,TIGL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TIGL/comments/dzi4x5/tigl_by_being_late_to_an_interview_that_then/,"So, not actually today, but some time ago, I was having a difficult time with my job hunt just off of graduation. My luck seemed to break when I was connected with a company a state away, about a two hour drive. I spoke with the company owner over the phone and we hit it off, very promising.

He invited me to come interview in person. Now, keep in mind this was before smart phones were a thing, and services like MapQuest could still be very spotty in their directions that they produced, especially in more rural areas. But, armed with what I thought were good directions, and a later start than I had wanted, I headed off for my job interview.

Turned out the directions, or my ability to follow them, weren't good enough. I got lost. After driving in circles for a few minutes, I finally gave up and called the company to get directions from where I was to get to their office. Any efforts I had made to get to the interview promptly after an already late start were gone and I arrived solidly late. At least thirty minutes late, probably a bit more.

I probably had to wait another fifteen minutes after my arrival because the owner was busy with a phone call. When he was finally available I went into his office, introduced myself, apologized for being late, gave him a printed copy of my resume, and took a seat while he looked it over.

Within a couple of minutes there was a knock at the door. The receptionist/intern poked his head in the door and said to the owner, ""Uhm, there's a policeman in the lobby."" The owner stepped out, closing the door behind him.

Immediately I started to panic. I thought that the cop must be there for me because of some traffic violation. Speeding? Did I run a light? Miss a stop sign? Then I realized if he was after me for anything like that, he'd have pulled me over immediately. He wouldn't have followed me around while I was lost and waited another twenty minutes before coming in.

So I eased over to the door to see if I could hear what was being discussed, in time to hear the cop inform the owner that he's being arrested for check fraud, or something check-writing related, and would be held locally until they could transfer him to the municipality that issued the warrant, near where I lived.

I sat back down, kind of shocked. I was late enough that if I had been on time and it was a short interview, I might have passed the cop on his way in or missed him all together and left thinking I had job prospects with someone who was bouncing checks badly enough that a municipality a state away wanted him arrested and brought to them.

The intern came in and said, ""Well, I guess the interview is over,"" sounding shocked.

I responded, trying to joke in the face of what just happened, ""Well, I guess that beats my being late?""

A couple months later I got a voice mail from the owner asking if I was still interested in interviewing to work at his company.

I decided to not return the call.

TL;DR: I left late to get to a promising job interview, got lost, and arrived at least 30 minutes late. Waited another 15 minutes. Finally got in and sat down, only to witness the company owner taken away for checking-related crime. If I hadn't been so late, there's a chance I would have agreed to work for him.

([Originally posted in TIFU](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dzbgaj/tifu_by_being_late_to_an_interview_an_interview/), but cross-posted here since it's arguably also a TIGL. Some would say it wasn't a TIFU, but I was late, which is always a bad impression for an interview. And, honestly, if you know that the whole ordeal was 'lucky' it sort of gives away the ending, doesn't it?)"

For the longest time I have loved the idea of office sex, I love the idea of professionally dressed woman acting like sluts, being bent over tables or under tables for their bosses. Here are some ideas for an office based roleplay. Enjoy.

1. **Assistant Affair:** You'll play as my assistant and I will have bought my wife something sexy or expensive jewelry, you are so jealous you decide to slide it on and seduce me with it in my marital bed, or in the stationary cupboard.
2. **Stationary Boy:** I will play the young 18 year old intern whose job it is to get stationary for people, so maybe your character could slide into 'my office' and we could have some fun, or maybe there is a hole leading into the toilet where I was able to slide my cock into.
3. **Glory Hole:** There is unisex toilets in out office and I am made to slide my cock through one in the stall
4. **Distract the boss:** I am the CEO of the company and I am about to come and meet your boss for an important document, which isn't ready, you decide to distract me the best way you know how
5. **IT Guy:** (MY fave): I am the nerdy IT guy who comes and fixers your computer, I am under your desk while you're away and you come back and sit down with no time for me to get away
6. **Caught Watching Porn:** You're my boss and you catch me watching porn, maybe I am taken for a disciplinary meeting
7. **Delivery Guy/Cleaner:** I am a delivery guy or cleaner who is there late at night and I find out it's all a front for a sex line and that's how they are making their money, there is only one way they're keeping me quiet."
dzii7g,1,2019-11-21,my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me and now I feel like a crazy ex-girlfriend.,norsewolf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dzii7g/my_boyfriend_of_2_years_broke_up_with_me_and_now/,"In October 2017, I met a guy, called J. We instantly clicked, and about a month later, we were together. We had a few ups and downs, like every normal relationship I guess. But in general, we were very happy. I always said I never wanted kids, but with him, my biological clock started ticking. I really thought he was the love of my life.

Last September, I moved to Paris for an internship. We became long distance, and gradually, things got sour. The internship took a heavy toll on me. I was bored all the time, started to overthink my life choices. I became unmotivated and reclusive. Apart from my boyfriend, friends at home and parents, there was not really anyone else I spoke to.


I basically lived with my phone glued to my eyes. I went nowhere because I hated being alone all the time. So somehow I figured that the majority of my problems would be solved if my boyfriend would join me. He still had his thesis to finish. I respected that, and started dreaming of our life together in Paris, after our studies. How awesome it would be, being together in the most beautiful city in the world. Visiting things together, going to events together and meeting new people, or not going anywhere and just enjoying eachothers company. Initially, he was not to keen on living in a big city, but we compromised that we would move more south after kids.


My boyfriend came over every 2 weeks (I never visited him, because I don't like my home country and want to get away as fast as possible). When the internship ended and I temporarily moved back, I expected seeing him more. However, due to mismatching agendas, we saw each other even less. I became angry when he went out with friends ""because why does he have time for them and not for me"". I became angry for his lack of initiative. All activities we did that summer were proposed by me. I became angry at his lack of motivation, because he failed to finish his thesis on time.


In September, I moved back to Paris after being accepted to another degree. I was so determined to do things differently this time, but the degree was not what I expected/wanted, so I quickly got stuck in the pattern of a asocial behaviour again. I became an angry, asocial, lonely and unmotivated person. In a moment of desperation, I made my boyfriend choose between putting everything on moving to paris as soon as possible, or break up. Naturally, he chose the latter.


Nevertheless, I didn't see that coming and have a hard time accepting. I feel abandoned and a failure right now. The only certainty I had in life, the only motivation to go on, is gone because I am such a frustrated person. But since my frustration is due to hi being not here, I still try to convince him to move to paris. I feel like a crazy person doing this, but if I fail, I have no reason to be anymore....

TL;DR : boyfriend and me became long distance due to my move to paris. Had quite a reclusive life there and was convinced everything would be better if he moved there with me. 
Then some fuckups happened, and now I can not stop obsessing over how all of my life's problems would be solved if he just moved here. Life without him has no purpose."

2. They removed the 5 EX ticket and UoC ticket from the box summon.

3. The 10x STMR tickets remain in the box, but are spread over all 5 boxes instead of all on step 3, meaning skipping a box will be harder.

4. We didnt get bonus currency for using certain units in the raid. I see no real reason why this was changed, but I'm going to assume this will come later down the line.

By the way, am I the only one who thinks that us getting 5 silver keys was a oversight from Gumi? Its unusually generous of them, and the reason I think it wasn't intended is because the previous KM event gave us 5 keys, but you needed 5 keys to do 1 summon. Intern guy probably forgot you need 1 key per summon now."

Hi, my name is Charles &amp; this is my first time using reddit. I wanted to speak up about what happened to me because I just can’t hold it in anymore. I feel like my life is a curse. A bad joke to laugh at me &amp; the person that I am. I don’t recognize myself anymore, as if the little smiling kid I was is dead &amp; that has been the case for a long time ago now. I got bullied in High school &amp; not just typical bullying. I got bullied from day 1 until the end of my High school time, from everyone that followed me through the years. When I was younger, I was loved for who I was because I could be myself. I was kind with everyone &amp; I was smart too. I even get to meet my principal in private because out of everyone in the school before me, I was the only one to have a 100% on a special test they gave to everyone at age 8 in primary school. I mostly had girls for friends &amp; all the sisters of my friends kept rushing to me &amp; wanting to talk &amp; be with me saying I was beautiful, kind &amp; a lot more mature compared to all the boys they’ve seen. Even though all of that was great at the time, there were still bullies before too. However, my personality of listening &amp; being there for people &amp; letting people live &amp; be happy got all of the person in my class to change their behavior &amp; act more kindly &amp; respectfully. They all went for being young kids who bullies, hurt or hit people, to person with a decent head. Although, I had an early realisation that adults are rarely good people as well because of that. Most of them despised me for what I was. Smarter than them.  I had teacher putting me in detention for acting dependent. I’ve also seen my father at that time, acting like an angry kid who didn’t got what he wanted out of me or my little brother. I never really had a family to begin with. I was 1 years old when my parents got divorce, so I never seen them together. Especially happy together. I met my dad at age 3 in kindergarten at dinner when my mom was supposed to pick me up, he went without notice instead. For me, that person was just a stranger who I got in the car with &amp; he took me to eat lunch with him. I remember that night, my mom was screaming at him at the door saying he never should have acted on his own without telling her. I was watching through my bedroom door. For me, my father was my uncle at the time. I went mostly every weekend to see him &amp; we played video games together. We walked outside &amp; he bought me ice cream or popsicle, whatever he felt made me smile. Although those little adventures through some holes in the fences behind the apartments of the city were great, I realised later that he mostly went to buy some beers &amp; cigarettes. He was 45 years old when he died &amp; I was only 14. I remember the day I got the news. I simply went outside walking in the little forest behind the house with my mp3 in my ears walking far enough so when I screamed with tears, no one would hear me. I was born with a medical problem &amp; all my life it affected me. I had asthma since I was 2 &amp; a surgery at age 9 to prevent my body to have an intern hemorrhage but that year when my uncle died was the year my life turned to hell. It took years to realise what I had at the time, until when I got 21 years old, my doctor told me I needed a liver transplant because my  congenital liver fibrosis was now failing me &amp; was affecting my brain to the point where I got mood swings, confusion, lack of concentration &amp; near the end, memory loss . Even my mesocave shunt portal that took one on my neck vein I got at 9, didn’t helped me. In top of all of that, I was losing oxygen. So all those years in high school where I was bullied &amp; trying to survive in a sense, I was affected by all of it but I didn’t know. My father said I was just lazy &amp; not serious enough. That my life was in my hands &amp; I had to open doors for my future &amp; all of that but all I wanted to do was succeed, more than people believed. I didn’t like being pushed around &amp; seeing bullies who barely studied have better grades than me while I was struggling all night racing my mind like crazy. I was so astonished by the girls who when I first move to this school were all, at some point normal, now being attracted by those assholes. I was kind, I was in shape &amp; when I got asked in my first year of high school by the teacher who I was, I said ‘’I want to be a person that people can trust &amp; rely on '' &amp; that compared to all the boys here who said they want sex &amp; chicks &amp; were laughing, I said ''I want to love a girl &amp; be there for her &amp; grow together, build our life, because girl deserve to be treated with kindness’’ I got a huge AWWWW from all the girls in the class &amp; the boys were looking me with murdering eyes. From this point on, I was their target. I’d shown their true colors &amp; they didn’t liked me for it. I really was destroyed when the girl I liked had sex with one of those douche. I remember one girl in my school that went to ask me how many girls I’ve have ever been with before. All the other guys in the background that previously told her they had 15 girls &amp; some 20, were still laughing in the back. When she asked me I simply said real seriously with honesty, not a single one. Her face changed from wild sexy smile from her previous talk with boys, to a surprised calm look. From that point on she never let me have a moment of peace. She was crazy though. Always sending me dick pics &amp; asking me what color were my underwear in class. Even though at first it was funny, I didn’t like that she still made fun of me with the boys still. I don’t know if that was her trying to get my attention but I didn’t like it. I went to prom &amp; came back &amp; it sucked. It was a sad night seeing all the girls smiling with those douchebags. I tried to go to university but my sickness was getting too strong by that time. So from age 19 to 25, I was stuck in my father house, playing games &amp; trying to survive again wondering if I should write my story or make YouTube videos at the time. I mean why not right, a sick guy who is struggling to stay alive never giving up can be a good inspiration for people. I could help people by listening to them. That’s all I’ve even been good at, knowing people better than they are by simply listening &amp; looking at them. Since I was 5 I was talented in the comprehension of human behavior. I’ve honestly never been wrong in any of my judgement toward people. They all became true or say no &amp; lie to themselves until they are broken &amp; come back to me years later saying I was right &amp; asking for advice.  I waited &amp; waited for a call to get my transplant &amp; during that time I figured ‘’ hey, I like anime &amp; manga &amp; drawing &amp; its been a while since I’ve drawn anything’’. So I went to take a manga drawing class. I met a girl there &amp; she was cute &amp; kind. We talked together everyday. One day we only speaked English together. I should explain, I’m a French Canadian guy. I even made her fall off her chair from laughter once \^\^. Until, we had to separate at the end. After 2 month we had to say goodbye &amp; I still think of her sometimes. We texted together for a year but long distance never work. She had a friend who was a metal head &amp; he bringed her to mush pit party &amp; concert &amp; even made her smoke weed, which I was not happy about when I figured out. Because of him, she was beginning to change personality &amp; the laughing little girl I met before was now telling me she had changed &amp; I had to forget about who she was before. Just before all of that happen though, I was honestly getting sick of my life &amp; wanted to just leave &amp; travel &amp; die living instead of waiting for nothing. Then she said something I will never forget. Mainly because it was the same thing I said the last time I’ve seen my uncle before he died when he too was sick. She told me ‘’ I don’t want you to die. I want you in my life. I really like you &amp; need you.’’ When I received that text I started crying. I was also laughing of Irony after that because I was thinking to myself ‘’ Is my life a movie? Am I really having a loop &amp; living what the one I loved before me had to live too?’’ Altough this time I had a different reaction. When my uncle answered to the same thing I said, he told me he didn’t want to, he was tired &amp; wanted it all to end. So I said ‘’Then just die then, I don’t care.’’ I always regretted that. They were the last word I told him. They were not true, I was just really sad &amp; didn’t want him to leave me &amp; he kept not wanting to try to help himself. So me instead I told the girl I would try then, I remembered what I felt &amp; I dint want her to live what I had to live. I waited &amp; I got my transplant after that &amp; she was the thing in my mind that kept me alive during those time. It was hard really. I came back alive &amp; talked with her &amp; at one point she never texted back. Now its been 2 years since I’m better. I had my 25 years anniversary at the hospital &amp; it made me cry because I always heard your 25th year is were all is decided for your future self. I’m all alone now &amp; in therapy because I cant go anywhere without trusting anyone or thinking that nothing matters. I have no friends. They all stopped calling me when I was sick. Still, they said they would. 

I’m sorry if the text is a bit long, I only needed to let this all out &amp; feel like maybe someone is listening to me this time &amp; that I’m not all alone in my cursed world. I missed my youth &amp; I’m sad alone &amp; I keep searching for a friend or an opportunity to start over again in life but I feel that because I’m all alone with no help from anyone, its really hard to build on anything. I feel I deserve better that what happened to me. I want a good life. I sometime wish I could be a celebrity because of what I have lived through &amp; how I endured it. But I feel there’s a wall I cant pass without doors opening for me to help me build my future. It's like if people who them too want a great life wouldn’t want us people to pass through instead of them. I felt that every time I surpassed my teacher &amp; asked for answered. I was giving them more that they know. All the bosses I worked for I was more smart than them. I feel I can do much more, I know I can do much more. However, I feel like I’m still in a world where its like a school class where if I do better &amp; I am deserving of a better price, everyone else gang up on me &amp; go outside &amp; tell the teacher ‘’ We wont come back until he is kick out of here’’. Please, can someone help me opening a door for me so I could finally have my joy back, my drive to do things &amp; really stay late giving it my all instead of feeling like I walk a grey cloudy street in a ghost town with no future but despair?

In any case, thank you a lot for taking the time to listen"

dzp1bp,314,2019-11-21,[b/S] (UPDATE 2) Some interesting things are happening between me and married older sister (We had the talk and things have become more interesting),Newguy2246,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/dzp1bp/bs_update_2_some_interesting_things_are_happening/,"[Original Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/dudkuo/bs_some_weird_interesting_stuff_happened_between/)

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/dy025y/bs_update_1_some_weird_interesting_stuff_happened/)


After I made my last post, honestly I wasn't in a very good head space. I kept thinking about what has happened so far and the suggestions/ advice I have gotten so far from this forum (For which I'm greatly thankful by the way). One thing that stuck with me, was one of the fellow redditor suggesting manipulation of some sort by my BIL. And the more I thought about it, his behavior this entire time, the more I was convinced that, definitely there was some sort of manipulation going on, even if my sister was somewhat part of it. I decided, I have to talk to her before this thing goes any further. 
 
My sister somehow sensed this and she asked me if everything was okay. I could have talked to her, but it wasn't the right time. I needed some time alone with her without BIL. I decided to wait. I said, everything is fine. But my sister of course knows me too well. She hugged me and said, ""Okay, whatever it is, you know you can talk to me right? You can talk to me about anything. And whatever is bothering you, don't let it ruin this internship for you. I know how important it is to you"". I think she might have guessed what was bothering me.


I noticed last few days sis started to behave normally, like she used to before all this started. BIL of course was a different story, he tried a few things here and there but every time sis would cut him off..

Yesterday evening when I reached home, sis and BIL were already home. BIL was in a hurry to go somewhere. Sis told me that his father apparently wasn't feeling too well and he is going to check up on him. His parents lived not too far. He announced that he won't be back for the night. I thought to myself, okay buddy, just man up, this is your opportunity to talk to her.  Before he left , he winked at me with a creepy smile and said, ""Okay buddy, take good care of your sister while I'm gone, okay?"". Honestly I'm starting to get really irritated by him. 

After he left sis said, ""Okay, looks like it's just you and me bro, like always. Let's have a fun night together. What do you want to do?"". Suddenly she was so happy and chirpy and bubbly, like the person I have always known her to be. Before I could answer, she said, ""Let's go to a nice restaurant, my treat. What do you say?"". I said smiling, ""I say, sure, it's a date"". She giggled and said, ""Get ready"". 

I got ready and waited for her. I saw her soon. She looked stunning. I always knew my sister is a very beautiful and attractive woman. But, I don't know, maybe I was seeing her in a different light due to recent events, she looked almost irresistible. She wore a beautiful long dress, hugging curves of her body, making them even more beautiful. She asked in a funny way, ""How do I look?"". I kissed her on the cheek and said, ""You look beautiful sis, beautiful"". 

She took me to the nicest restaurant I've ever been in my life. You know one of those restaurants, where portion size is too small, and have degustation menu, and is really expensive. She ordered a bottle of wine. Notwithstanding the portion size, the food was really good, we had a fun evening.


After we reached home, we both sat on the couch. I wrapped my hand around her, she put her head on my shoulder. I thanked her for the dinner, we chatted little bit about the restaurant and the food etc. Then finally, I thought it was the right time to talk to her. I said, ""Sis, remember you said, if something has been bothering me, well actually something is"". My sister is not only is  attractive but she is also a very smart lady. She sighed and said, ""I think, I know what is bothering you. It's got to do with my recent behavior with you, isn't it?"". I replied, ""Yes"". 

She kept quite for some time, as if to gather her thoughts. Finally she spoke. The conversation went somewhat like this,  
-""Listen, you know how much I love you, right?"".    
-""Yes, of course, you don't have to tell me"".  
-""Well my love for you is complicated. Please don't hate me for what I'm about to tell you"".  
She took a long pause and then continued,  
-""So couple of months into our marriage, we were in bed and doing you know what married people do.""  
-""You mean you were having sex? I'm not a kid anymore sis, you can say these things to me"".  
-""Yeah, we were having sex. He took someone else's name while we were doing it"".  
-""What? Whose name? I'm going to kick his ass, I swear to God"".  
-""That's where it gets complicated. It was his cousin's, you met her at our wedding"".  
-""What the fuck, sorry. But what the hell?"".  
-""We had a fight of course, I slept in separate bedroom for almost a week and didn't talk to him much. He said sorry so many times. He explained to me that he really loves his cousin sister, that doesn't mean that loves me any less, they fooled around when they were young. But he never cheated on me nor he ever will and so on. He then said to me, you have a brother, I know how much you love him. Would it be so terribly bad if you knew that he wanted you in a little different way. The thing is I wasn't disgusted or terribly angry as most people in that scenario would be. I kind of understood, don't get me wrong I was angry, but I understood where it all was coming from. I eased up on him and he sensed it"".  
She stopped, trying to gauge my reaction. I didn't gave anything away, I kept silent.


Not getting any reaction from me she started again,  
-""As I said my love for you is complicated. Then he started to put some ideas in my head about maybe showing you a side of me you have never seen. Showing you that your sister is maybe a attractive woman, things like that. You are probably totally grossed out. I'm so so sorry bro, I don't know why I listened to him. It's just that I've realized, probably more so after my marriage, that you are the only person I truly love and trust and forever will. Please don't hate me, I'm sorry"".  

I needed some time to process all this information. After maybe couple of minutes, she said,  
-""Please say something"".  
I took my time and when I was finally ready to speak, I said,  
-""You're crazy if you think I can ever hate you. You know it was so hard for me after your wedding. I was happy for you of course, but I missed you so much. Before you got married I could at least see you regularly, but now you are so far away. I have really missed you, you have no idea how much"".

We both got misty-eyed. Then I don't know why, I started to nuzzle her cheek and near her neck. We both had our eyes closed, we kind of got lost in the moment. A few moments later our lips met and we kind of stayed in that moment for a little while. Another few moments passed and then I don't know who started it first, she or I or simultaneously, my lips were sucking hers and vice versa. Not crazy or anything, almost very sweet and intimate. Even our tongues touched little bit. This went on for a little while.  Finally we probably got back to our senses and it ended. We both looked at each other, nobody said anything. She then very sweetly licked her thumb and cleaned the lipstick I got around my lips. She kissed me on the forehead and said, ""Good night, kiddo"". ""Good night, sis"".  

I went to my bedroom and so many thoughts were running through my mind. But mostly I was just happy, really happy, thinking about that moment.  

Anyway all of this is very new to me and I'm still processing it. 

And my apologies to everyone who suggested me to just talk to her and I didn't listen. I guess, we all live and learn."
dzp4nx,0,2019-11-21,Appropriate to ask for a raise (part-time job offer at city's health department following an internship)?,prettyuncertain,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dzp4nx/appropriate_to_ask_for_a_raise_parttime_job_offer/,"Sorry, this is a repost - somehow accidentally deleted my former post.

Essentially, I was offered to transition my internship at a city's department of public health (major city in the U.S. into a part-time job next semester, as I finish up grad school (master's). I would be working 20 hours/week (my internship is currently 8 hours/week) for $18/hour, which would mean I would have to give up one of my two part-time jobs. I would primarily be doing data analysis for a grant-funded project.

In doing the math, I'd be making a little more monthly than what I make right now, but I would also be devoting more time into commuting to work. Additionally, after my supervisor offered me the position, I was approached by his supervisor to take on additional tasks related to health communication (social media pages, etc.). That said, I don't mind those tasks since I love using social media.

I'm not sure if it would be appropriate to ask for a bit of a raise (I'd like $20/hour). Here are a few questions:

1. Is it okay to ask for a raise for a part-time position, especially since I'm working at a public company? It's a little tricky because the project is in partnership with my (private) university, and I believe the pay comes from the university.
2. The pay for student employees at the public health department ranges from $16-$23, from what I've seen. Is it reasonable to ask for more, considering I'm already in that range? I received a stipend for my internship, which came out to around $16.67/hour.
3. If I ask for a raise, how do I ensure $20 is what we agree on? I don't know how asking for $22 would sound, but I do know employers try to meet halfway (which is why I'd want to aim higher to wind up at $20/hour).
4. How do I even approach this without burning any bridges (if I would)? I have yet to be sent the paperwork, but I was thinking I could respond and tell them I realized I would have to quit one job (which is true - I didn't realize the hours for all three jobs wouldn't work until today), and that it would be helpful to get a raise to comfortably cover expenses like rent, food, etc.

When my supervisor approached me, I was caught a bit off guard, and it would technically be a raise, so I just said the pay would be fine, but now I'm not so sure. I feel bad going back on my word, but I'm thinking long-term and would like to set myself up for negotiation when I get a full-time offer either at this company or elsewhere. My supervisor is very chill, so I know he'd be understanding, but I'm not sure if I'd be making the wrong move by asking for a raise at this point.

TL;DR - Got an offer to stay past my internship to work part-time at a major city's public health department doing data analysis for $18/hour. Was approached by another manager to help with health communication efforts. I would like to negotiate to $20/hour without burning bridges or making it awkward. Help?"

While I understand how the block diagram for PackML works, I'm having a hard time understanding how to apply those 50 states to the block diagram directly (which only has 17 states). I understand multiple of those 50 states could apply to any one of the 17 PackML states, but that would put things out of order according to my supplied state table.

dzpay4,1,2019-11-21,I (M)(23) just started dating someone (F)(22) and we are ready to take the relationship to the next level.

I was working full time and she just graduated and started her summer internship. We both did the general dating thing and it all worked out really well. 

Then it comes to her last day in the city as her intern finishes and she has to move back home and it's the last time we're thinking we're going to see each other for a while and we're both really upset. Which sucks. But a week later we managed to meet back up due to circumstances and we say goodbye again, and it sucks again! Then a week later the exact same thing happens, and this happens for about two months. Just a week ago, we both say we really like each other and are ready to take the next step in our relationship. But this is dependant on one thing, she moves back to the city I live in, which is based upon a job interview she had earlier that month. Today she tells me she doesn't get it, and she doesn't think shes going to apply for many more jobs down here (not amazing for job opp, especially that she lives near London). And the gaps between meeting each other is getting longer and longer. 

Long distance is hard too as we live 3 hours away from each other, and her parents are religious and would never accept me. 

I also do plan to move to London by September (not for her, but to develop my career). 

I hate it when people say this, but I've never had anyone make me feel this happy before. But not being with can be really hard. 

Do I break things off and get on with my life? Or just say fuck it and keep on talking to her and hope and try to make it work some how. 

Tl:dr. I meet this girl and we date during summer, but she has to go home due to her internship finishing. After 1 - 2 more months of meeting due to circumstances, we confess we both really like each other and are ready to be exclusive. However, she finds out she doesn't get the job she needed to move back up to where I live and is unlikely to look for more jobs. Do I break it off or no?"

It was here that I felt the most horrible reality I had ever had to face so far in my life. It was here I realized no matter how much I worked, no matter how much I studied, no matter how much I appreciated the world and culture, that I would never be able to leave my caste. I was set far behind from the bourgeoisie, and I was low class. End of story. This moving company allowed me to feel the full weight of that.

One Saturday, the crew and I had to empty a high end private elementary school in a very wealthy town. I got there about 6am with my team and we started emptying it out. People started showing up for whatever reason. There were two ways we were looked at by the people within the establishment 1) with pity 2) with disgust. It was plainly obvious that we were different. First of all, our group was a motley one, varying races and ethnic/cultural backgrounds, I mean. Our masters on the other hand were entirely white. The older women who looked at us almost uniformly did it with pity, and they even attempted to ‘tip’ us. Personally, I find that extremely degrading, so I was put in a horribly bad mood already. Almost all the men and many of the middle-aged women looked at us with disgust. Almost as if they did not recognize us as human. \*I should mention at this point that the *vast* majority of folks here did not even notice us or ignored us, this is a fairly small minority of people I am talking about with disgust/pity\* I say this because at least three of us were almost hit by cars, as though we were rodents in the way of their Escalades, in the parking lot. 

The day was wearing on and we were all exhausted. I became almost physically ill when the manager of our company came and brownnosed the super of the school and I even heard him apologize for some of the men’s appearance. I was appalled and disgusted. Now it is about ninety-five degrees and I am exhausted. I start walking back towards the cigarette scented semi that took me here when I hear something very nice. It was part of Mozart’s 40th symphony. Neither the tonality nor musicality was there, but I love art pretty much always. It was very refreshing after a day of work to hear the piece. I fell into the gravitational field of the music and wandered closer, unconsciously. Finally, I saw a bunch of children playing the piece with a woman probably in her fifties conducting it. I watched for a few moments and went from happy to hear the music to completely dejected. It was as though I had become awakened from a dream. I realized in that moment; I could not be like them. I love their music, I love their art, I love their easy lifestyle, I desperately want to have their educations and opportunities, but right then, I realized that those things aren’t for me. They are for them. I am a utility, I help their communities run, I do the work they don’t want to, and what do I get for it? I get ignored. I get pitied. I remembered all the times I spoke to people above my caste, “Oh wow, you know Schoenberg? I am very surprised” or the most memorable one, “I believe that even people like you could achieve in an elite university”. The realization crushed me with an immense weight, almost making me drop to my knees.  I have never felt more worthless or hopeless than in that moment. I wept when I got home until I fell asleep. When I woke up, I went to the next job.

Postscript:

This was written about a year ago, I would like to raise everyone’s spirits a bit with an update. I still can’t find work and now my student loans are due. Also, as a result of the nature of my work, I have a severe back injury as well as nerve and muscle damage in my thumb. Hope that this post brings everyone up 😊"

Caught me red handed: There was a group of us on vacation, including you me and my girlfriend. You’ve seen me staring at you throughout the trip, but it’s seemed innocent enough. Today at dinner I excused myself early, saying I needed to take care of something upstairs. Some time passed before you found yourself upstairs coming to check on me. When you open the door you catch me, dick in hand, with a picture of you in your bikini on my computer screen... What do you do next? And who are you? Are you a friend? My Girlfriends mom? My aunt? I’m open to all suggestions.

*BONUS* Competitive Threesomes- I don’t know what it is but I’ve always loved the idea of a competitive threesome. Two people competing for the attention and praise of another to see who is more worthy. I’d love to play one out, either with two girls competing for my attention or me and a girl competing for yours. I had some ideas in mind for scenes, maybe I two princesses are competing for the princes hand in marriage, two interns trying to get the next job, two college students after the same recommendation letter, but I’m open to other ideas. If this sounds interesting to you I’d love to work something out with someone!

My kinks are threesomes (obviously) oral, anal, having my ass played with, ass to mouth, sloppy blowjobs, hand jobs, risky sex and more."

My(26M) GF(23F) of 2 years 1/2 broke up with me by text while I am on an internship abroad. How right she was etc is not important for this discussion.

What bugs me is that I have been the 4 relationships in my life, the GF broke up with me because of the same reason ""My lack of empathy"". They all said I was great, helpful, nice, compassionate, never left them alone during hard times .. but I didn't understand how they feel, didn't ask about them when they felt bad (I never even realize when they do), etc. 

They all said that they love me and all that romantic things. But in the end, it didn't matter. I am tired of being with people who love me, if it will end like this.

I want to marry a friend and enjoy life. I don't need romantic love. But is it possible?

dztnt2,1,2019-11-21,How bad is walking away from an internship offer after accepting it?,MovingAlong3,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/dztnt2/how_bad_is_walking_away_from_an_internship_offer/,"Greetings,

I've been reading this subreddit for awhile, but now I'm hoping to receive some advice! I graduated this year and have had no luck in finding a job. I've applied to many many jobs, even ones I thought I had no chance at. Months later I received an interview request for a decent sized CPA firm (not big 4, but still fairly large). During the interview I was told they could not hire me as a full time employee because I wasn't a CPA candidate. I thought it was odd I would be interviewed at all because of this, as I sent them my transcripts so they knew where I was. I was asked if I would be willing to take an intern position instead and take the classes I needed in the meantime (would be a total of four classes) and they would revisit hiring me permanently after the internship ends based on how I did as well as if I would be able to complete the needed courses before their next hiring date of August. I agreed because I had nothing else. I got a second interview and was later given an offer for a winter internship that I accepted.

At the same time, I had a phone interview with another company that I didn't hear back from. Today, over a month later they've contacted me for a second round phone interview with the head of the accounting department.

My dilemma is I'm unsure if I should continue interviewing with this company as I already accepted the internship offer, or if I should continue with the process and see what happens. This would be a position I'd be more interested in, as it would be corporate accounting, a permanent position, and financial accounting vs tax.

The internship starts in January. Should I obtain the other position in the meantime, is stepping away from the internship offer a terrible move?

I'm weighing the pros and cons involved with the costs involved with taking the classes required to become a CPA candidate as there's no guarantee I'll be offered a permanent position at this firm, even if I do what they've asked in time. I know becoming a CPA is beneficial for me, but my current goals are to start my career, not take more classes.

Thoughts and advice on this would be greatly appreciated."
dztq5k,0,2019-11-21,Do I qualify to work in the UK as an international student? ( about the 2 year work visa for new graduates). More info and questions in description.,X3NOC1DE,AskUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/dztq5k/do_i_qualify_to_work_in_the_uk_as_an/,"Studying in the UK as an international student - a few questions

Hey guys! So I've done 2/3 of my degree and was going to complete the rest of my degree in the UK. This is mainly because my sights are set on migrating to the UK with my family later on becausw my extended family and some friends live thefe.

I have a few questions if you guys wouldn't mind answering them.
Since my degree (BSc computer Science) is anyway affiliated with the UK( the University of westminster), I dont have a problem with doing my third year at the UK in case anyone is wondering about that. In addition to that, I'm doing this sandwich degree thing and am currently doing my internship at a company in Sri Lanka. I'll be done by August 2020 and thought of doing the final year of my degree in London which is fully supported by my university here in SL and UoW.

1) Ill be going through a Tier 4 Visa. I'll be allowed 20hours of work per week. Is this generally enough for me to cover my living expenses? (Disregard my university fee, I just want to know if I can more or less cover my living cost and at what margins) this is a huge point as I've read that London is one of the most costliest cities to live in. 

If it doesn't cover the expenses, I wouldn't even mind living an hour or two away from London to commute to it daily, because Im used to it here in Sri Lanka. 

2) I read about a new policy that allows new international graduates to work for 2 years after graduating in the UK, under the Tier4 Visa. Will this policy also apply to me and will I be able to work for two years once my degree is over? Will my work history (basically interned at a very very reputed software engineering fintech company as an associate engineer) come in handy?

3) How does London treat a brown, Muslim student? Sorry if I'm implying that London is racist, but I just am concerned.


Anything else I should be thinking about? Or anything elze I should question you guys about/any helpful nuggets of info that you guys could think of?


TIA guys!"

I am originally from Northern VA but moved to Houston, TX to go to school here and Houston is one of the lowest cost of living cities in the US.


This December, I graduate as a computer engineer and the job hunt is a little bit rough, even with one internship from a well known tech company under my belt.


Anyway, I applied to a software job on LinkedIn and for new grads , they only offer $60 k a year. I looked up cost of living in Boston and $60 k a year in Boston is equivalent to $90 k a year in year in Houston.


If I were to get this job, would I be really poor and would it be worth it ? I’m a minimalist and I only want a small shitty studio apartment with no roommates as I’ve been living with roommates for 6 years now. I’m also willing to commute.


Is $60 k really bad ? Can I be middle class if I commute ? Life is really stressful now as I really need a job as soon as I graduate real soon.


Any advice is really appreciated. I want to make sure I’m making common sense and reasonable decisions. I appreciate the input !"
dztuyo,5,2019-11-21,3 jobs during pharmacy school? (none of them have a huge time requirement),salt_lamp72,PharmacySchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/PharmacySchool/comments/dztuyo/3_jobs_during_pharmacy_school_none_of_them_have_a/,"hello all,

3 jobs --&gt; independent pharmacy intern; medication history technician position; inpatient hospital pharmacy intern 

so, i (P2 in pharmacy school) am employed at an independent pharmacy (which isn't a huge time requirement) - the owner basically hired me because i wanted to work there (and not so much because he needed another employee)... anyway, since getting this job recently, I realized that I really need some hospital experience (because i'm really interested in hospital pharmacy post-graduation). So, i applied for a medication history technician position at a local hospital near my school - however, this of course differs from an inpatient pharmacy tech position... i may have an opportunity for a job as an inpatient pharmacy student at a hospital in my hometown too... i wouldn't want to turn either position down because i need as much experience as i can get.. and i need to network and make connections and stuff in hospital pharmacy.

basically, the medication history technician would only be a time commitment of working every other weekend or twice monthly (e.g. maybe one eight hour shift and then the next shift that month would be four hours -- this position is year-round).... and then, i would work at the other hospital and the independent pharmacy (both in my hometown) over breaks - and a lot over the summer.. i should mention - that the manager at the hospital in my hometown - due to already having two students -- wouldn't actually be able to offer me many hours at all. so it seems like it wouldn't be a huge time commitment either.

basically, the medication history tech would be only twice monthly; the independent and other inpatient hospital intern positions may be just over breaks or on the weekend that i'm not working at the other hospital (except the independent isn't even really open on weekends)... basically, does this sound like way too much?? it seems like none of these 3 really require much of a time commitment.

i'm having a dilemma because i just got on at the independent pharmacy (interested in this some too, want some community experience on my CV because i only have 4 months at a kroger pharmacy previously which isn't much; also this independent does a lot of compounding which is very interesting to me) quite recently and the owner was nice enough to hire me -- so i would feel too bad to quit now... but, then after starting this school year i realized that hospital pharmacy is really what i want -- so i wouldn't want to have to choose between the two hospital positions.

i'm hoping one of the hospital positions doesn't work out so i don't have to choose (i just interviewed for one and then the other 1 is a maybe - like i may eventually be given an interview and i have to speak with the manager more).

i'd like to add that really the independent pharmacy position could be mainly mostly over the summer i would say; and then the inpatient pharmacy position on breaks (maybe the independent pharmacy position some on breaks too); and then the medication history technician would be constantly year round twice monthly (i would drive from my hometown back to school 1.5 hr like twice monthly)... does this seem doable?? or should i just plan on keeping the independent pharmacy job (i would like to have on my CV that i have some community experience -- in case i have to fall back on retail or something) -- and then only accepting one of the hospital jobs (even though I really am desperate for a lot of hospital experience AND the two hospital positions are very different from each other).

from what i've read and been told -- a medication history technician is a very unique position - in which a technician basically interviews new hospital admits to determine a med list - that can help the hospitalist order drugs for the patient during their stay. i feel it would be good experience. -- an inpatient pharmacy intern would have much different roles of course -- i'm not too familiar but i've heard -- making IV's, stocking drugs, answering phones, etc.

i got hired at the independent pharmacy relatively recently. in the summer i worked at kroger -- but it was not possible for me to continue working at kroger so i only worked there four months. i still am not even trained at the independent pharmacy yet but will be getting more hours there soon over my next break. i flipped out a bit about not having a pharmacy job -- and got on at this independent right away. also, i had heard that it was much more difficult to get a hospital position as an intern so i wasn't even sure if it would happen for me..

any comments appreciated! thanks :)"
dzu5i7,2,2019-11-21,Ex of 3.5 year relationship married after 1 month of breaking up,coffee2nite,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dzu5i7/ex_of_35_year_relationship_married_after_1_month/,"I 25M recently broke up with my GF 21F. I broke up with her because we were fighting a lot and not communicating and listening to each other. I got mad and broke up with her (i know childish) even though I did really want to stay broken up it was merely out of frustration. Though in hindsight it was good it happened otherwise she probably would have kept staying with me to only break my heart when she had the courage to.

Welp she downloaded tinder right when we broke up and in 4 days 2 dates later she was spending every night at some guys house. Fast forward a week she moved out of my house and into his apartment and 14 days after that her name changed on her FB and they submitted papers for a marriage licences. While honestly the marriage hasn't messed me up as much as I thought It would cause its so crazy to me, I am still just struggling with all these left over feelings and memories. We never even had a moment for a closure talk, or anything. It all happened so fast. This person who I thought I knew so well, and had been through so much together was suddenly treating me like dirt, asking me if I would go to her wedding, neglecting our dog and later giving them up for adoption. I was just blindsided by this person I suddenly didn't know.

We started dating when I graduated uni and she graduated HS. I had, had a LTR of a year before here and got heart broken and built myself back up afterwards so when we met I was feeling happy and confident in myself. She had many bad experiences with guys and cheating through HS I was the first to not do these things. Insecurity from her side plagued our relationship but we worked through major problems and felt pretty unstoppable.

fast forward to 2 years in I was upset with my job and wanted to pursue a Ph.D. and she wanted to graduate undergrad from a better university and we both moved across the US to a new university and city. Prior to this we were living in my parents house while I worked a good job (engineering, just boring) and she went to school. I paid rent to my parents she didn't. I did lots of chores for her at my parents house (cooked meals, did her laundry, cleaned). When we moved I said I need to focus on my career this is a big moment for me and things are gonna have to change. I won't have all this time for you. Well this clearly created lots of issues with her, she had a really bad semester, got fired from a internship and dealt with horrible anxiety, and took it out on me. We fought over very dumb things like cleaning and chores, but also she kept complaining that I didn't make enough time for her. I work in a lab and my hours are very random and long sometimes which caused this. I myself was going through a huge transition --- suddenly not feeling smart, feeling like I need to catch up lots, getting worst grades I've ever gotten. It was a lot to process, and sure I feel I could have done better but I really tried my best.

We had always talked about marriage, and I was sure this was the girl I was gonna marry and spend the rest of my life with and she always asked about marriage and the proposal. She wasn't happy cause I didn't ever give her a exact date cause I wasn't sure how my future was gonna be, but I reassured her it was definitely in my mind and I wanted to do it near the end of my Ph.D. Well she didn't like that and would always say she felt she didn't fit into my plan, but I would ask if she wanted to be married right now she was 20 and she said no of course not that's embarrassing.

After the breakup and like 2 days before she got married she texted me for a couple hours at night like old times. Even ended with I love you, and saying things like her life was a mess, she cant focus doing bad in school, misses: me, my family etc. I asked her why she broke up and she said she stopped loving me 6 months ago and her reasons were there was no ""magic left"" and we stopped doing the little things together. She said she wanted to meet up with me to talk about things and wanted this journal she had written me from the start of our relationship of herself falling in love with me. Well the next day she ghosted me, and then didn't pay her portion of her utilities and then got married.

Sorry for the incoherent rambling!

Looking for advice on how to process this and think about it. I definitely am still in love with her regardless of all this. I do realize her immaturity and see a lot more of how it was prevalent in our relationship.

Some other bits: The guy she married is 29, and on a workers visa in the US. He practically cheated on her already with an ex when he went for ""closure"" and came back smelling of wine and said they made out and cuddled. He seems like a big red flag.

I know all these things cause she kept texting and confiding in me. Since she didn't pay the utilities to me she owes I have blocked her on everything.

TL;DR GF(21F) of 3.5 years broke up with me(25M) and married a 29 year old on workers visa in 1 months time. Looking for outside perspective on this whole situation as its all very confusing and happened fast.

Update 11.26.2019: Ex has tried to contact me through email stressing she ""needs to talk to me"" and has ""important things to tell me"" also mentioned she got married like I somehow wouldn't have already known. She contacted me through email since I have blocked her on social media and cell.

Update: she has tried contacting me through her friend now claiming it's an emergency. I responded that I am not a emergency contact sorry and she should have told her friend to tell me or in thr prior email."

The machine I'm writing code for has approximately 50 states from powerup to check to process completion. While I understand how the block diagram for PackML works, I'm having a hard time understanding how to apply those 50 states to the block diagram directly (which only has 17 states). I understand multiple of those 50 states could apply to any one of the 17 PackML states, but that would put things out of order according to my supplied sequential state table.

**Bio:**

Born in Seoul, Korea, Dayoung Kim started her vast cultural journey at a young age. With her parents’ encouragement, she moved to India at age 14 and attended a high school there which broadened her world view and design aesthetic. She then attended The Academy of Art University in San Francisco for her Fashion major and then continued her education at the Samsung Art and Design Institute in Seoul. While in college, Dayoung also completed an internship in Milan, Italy that further developed her skills. After college, she competed in and won the Korean show “Project Next Designer,” and was awarded as an Emerging Designer of 2008 by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. She continued to travel until ultimately settling down in Portland and launching her line MOIRAI in 2016. Her ready-to-wear line is carefully crafted to feel harmonious, effortless, and timeless, while enhancing the beauty and character of her customer.

Slave Yoga 6a: The Market 

I awoke to an assault of freezing water enveloping me, stabbing into me like a million knives.  I tried to breathe and gulped water; I felt for sure I was drowning.

I caught a breath.  I tried to open my eyes.  Ahh…too bright! Light. Sound.  The rush of ice-cold water, moving over my naked body in painful waves.  No, not waves--  What was happening?  I wasn’t submerged, I was being sprayed – no, blasted - with water. 

I was lying on my side, and using the force of the spray I managed to roll so my back was facing the water.  The high-pressure hose now blasted the backs of my legs and my ass, but at least I could breathe.  I smelled….  Salt? I wasn’t facing the sun, so I could try to open my eyes again, if I squinted.

At least I was no longer in the demeaning dog crate I had been so cruelly shipped in.  Struggling to focus even as my teeth chattered from the freezing water I could see I was stretched out on stone.  No, many stones, held together by some sort of white plaster. 

I struggled to rise but the force of the water was slowly pushing me along the stones and towards another stone wall, plastered a brilliant white.  The force of the water flipped me over as I slid into the wall.  I felt the spray move over my naked breasts, down my flat tummy. When the water hit my pussy I screamed and tried to cover my crotch.  It didn’t help. 

Through the din of the water I heard men laughing.

It wasn’t until the water turned off that I managed to wipe my eyes.  Using both hands as a sort of sun visor I struggled to adjust to the brilliant sunlight all around me.

I was in the shade of a building, a stone building, covered in white plaster that looked very, very old.  No, not old, ancient. There were maybe a half dozen men watching, one holding a high-pressure hose nozzle that was connected to a pump.  The other end of the hose led into the sea, which explained the smell of salt.  I had been hosed down with raw seawater, and I could smell the salt on me, and also the residue of my own stink and filth from the long journey locked in the crate.

I struggled to focus amid the hubbub of the port. There were small but colorful fishing boats behind the men. It looked like I was in some sort of picturesque Mediterranean fishing village.  There were rows of houses stacked up onto the hill behind me, and merchants selling fruit and clothing from carts along the bay.  A few feet away from me two men were scrubbing down a scooter with long stiff brushes that looked like brooms. 

I looked at the men scrubbing the scooter, and they looked at me.  They stopped scrubbing the bike, and picking up a rusty old bucket of soapy water headed straight for me.

“No!” I shouted. 

Too late. The hundreds of tiny, sudsy bristles of the brush scraped my back as I turned away from the man with the brush.  Another man grabbed me by behind, lifting me up by the hair, and I screamed as the rough bristles of the sudsy brush scoured my naked behind. 

The men bent me over and kicked my legs apart.  The crowd of men laughed as I cried out as the coarse brush scoured my tender bottom hole.  I knew I stank, and I was grateful to have the smell of my own pea and shit scrubbed off me, but not like this.  The two bearded men were scouring the most sensitive parts of my body with far less care and tenderness then they had shown their stupid scooter.

“You’re making a mistake!” I shouted.  “I’m not a slave!” 

I heard laughter amongst the waves lapping against the fishing boats and rocks behind me. Were they laughing at me, or with me, or just sharing some private joke amongst themselves?

As they scrubbed roughly underneath my arms I got a better look at the mob, and my jaw clenched.  They weren’t laughing with me.  The men watching my scrub down were laughing and joking at my pain and humiliation, but I couldn’t recognize the language they spoke.  They were darker skin, but white – sort of swarthy.  They wore rough work clothes and many had growths of beard or facial hair.

Where the hell was I?  The exact location of the shitty peasant village I was in became secondary as the men stepped back and another blast of water from the sea hose hit my exposed bottom hole and banged my head into the wall.  I gasped and cried as the hose again ran all over my body.

The men turned me around like a rag doll.  By this point I was so exhausted and cramped and dazed from my journey in the crate that I didn’t resist when the men used the rough truck brush to scrub my front.  It wasn’t until one of them lifted my foot up and the other roughly scrubbed my exposed pussy that I cried out again. 

I tried to explain:

“You can’t do this to me!”

Laughter, scrubbing.

“I’m an important person!”

More laughter, more scrubbing.

“I have powerful friends. American friend! Rich friends!”

One of the men laughed and mimicked me.  “Rich! Rich!” which came out “Witch, Witch” in his guttural accent.

Where the hell was Agatha?  I was guessing that one of the nicer houses up in the hills was probably hers, and I was soon going to be whisked away to her villa for lunch and a debriefing on my adventure. 

However in the meantime she left me in the care of a group of uneducated riff-raff, the sort of working class nobodies who might have been tending the gardens or cleaning the pool or painting the hallways back at my University.  Now these day laborer lowlifes had their grubby hands all over my naked body.

“I’m a Ph.D.!” I shouted, as the scrub brush “shampooed” my hair with all the gentleness of the tire shine at a car wash.  Not true, technically, I was a Ph.D. student, but I knew they were too stupid to know the difference.  Looking at the buffoons leering and laughing and scrubbing me down, I wondered if they could even read or write.

They certainly gave no sign of understanding anything that I said, although the more I protested the more they joked amongst themselves in their indecipherable babble of a language.  Did they not understand me or did they just not care?  Maybe both.

A grubby old fisherman in waders stepped forward and lifted my foot up above my head.  The hose, the pressure turned down, was still strong enough to pin me against the wall by my pussy.  I screamed. 

“When Professor Crush gets here, I’m going to have you fired!” I shouted, weeping.  But they didn’t seem to understand that I was a University student, or that I was on a slave-cation, so in fact they worked for me.  I blushed beet red with humiliation as the men laughed at me.  The workmen had earned their money, and had cleaned me inside-and-out.

With my humiliating scrub down finished the men turned their attention to several bleating goats that had just been unloaded from the ship.  Was it the ship I had been unloaded from?  I did not know. I didn’t see my dog crate.  As the brush went over the goat’s fur they bleated as I had. I looked at my fellow livestock with understanding and sympathy.

Lifting me by the scruff of the neck one of the men used some coarse rope to tie my hands tightly behind my back.  He then looped another link of rope, about six feet long, into a crude noose around my neck.  

I looked up and saw that I was standing directly under a wooden beam that could be used to hold a sign or awning.  The old wooden beam was thick, and if he tossed the rope over and hoisted me skyward he could simply tie the rope off and leave me to dance my life away.

“No!” I cried, “I’ll be good.  I’ll do anything you say,” I said, pleading for my life.

I wasn’t sure if he understood me or not, but my desperation seemed to please him.  He reached his hand between my legs, and fingered me, and I moaned and pressed against him, anxious to earn my master’s favor.  His hands were coarse and he smelled like rotting fish, but he was better than the rope.

When he finished his crude explorations of my pussy he yanked on the rope and I stumbled forward. I cried out from my sudden burst of light blindness as he pulled me out of the shade of the building and into the brilliant sun. 

Even with my eyes closed, I heard voices all around me.  As I stumbled forward I cried out again as I realized that he was pulling me stark naked away from the building and into a busy street.

“No, please!” I pleaded.  “I’m naked!  Please!  PLEASE!  Give me my clothes.  Anything!  I’m naked, damn you!”

I wasn’t entirely unfamiliar with public nudity, having exercised naked in front of the disgusting, drooling perverts who watched me do my slave yoga at the club.  They were scum, and I hated them, but it had aroused me to perform for them, as I knew they could never have me.  My Slave Yoga was performed in the safety of my class, and the men had been high above me, behind glass, watching from the viewing gallery.  My purse and ID were on the other side of the door in the locker room, and I had Master John and Suzie – not to mention the law and the police – to protect me. 

Being paraded down the street entirely naked in a foreign country was an entirely different experience.  My clothes were not safely tucked away in a securely locked locker.  In this strange place I was a naked slave girl, and as such I had no clothes at all.

I remember laughing at the slave girls fighting amongst themselves over beads and slave sandals and such, as if such trinkets mattered.  After all if you’re naked with beads on you’re still naked, right?  Stupid, ignorant slave girls! Perhaps, but right now barefoot and naked I was desperate for anything, ANYTHING, that would make me feel less exposed, less helpless, less like I had nothing.

“I wish Suzie had left me with some slave beads,” I thought, my already blurry eyes filling with tears.  It was a curious sensation.  I had nothing.  NOTHING. 

I found myself wondering where my passport was.  Probably in my purse, I thought.  I wondered where Suzie had taken my purse, which had the missing identification that could rescue me from this nightmare.  Had she taken it home with her, and left it by the door.  No, as a lawyer Suzie was the epitome of organization.  My identification had been put SOMEWHERE.  Perhaps she had taken it to work, and put it in her desk, or had given it to her secretary or one of her assistants or interns to file.  I shuddered at the thought.

Slave girls, of course, often had their slave registration numbers tattooed on their inside of their upper lip, or occasionally branded on the tender skin inside one of their bottom cheeks.  Agatha Crush always had her slave girl’s bottoms branded with her gorgeous cursive monogram.  There had been a time not so long ago when I had viewed slave tattoo and animal brands as demeaning.  But now, being led naked through the streets with absolutely nothing to distinguish or identify, I secretly wished I had Agatha’s elegant and distinctive brand burned into my ass. 

It was a strange thought.  I had read about slave girls being “hungry for their brand” but I had never fully understood the psychology of their desire until this moment.  Now I knew.  I wanted to belong.  I wanted to belong to someone!

My eyes clearing somewhat, I focused my attention on the man tugging my rope leash.

“Please,” I said, trying to get his attention.  “You don’t understand.  You need to untie my hands!  I’m an important person!”

My uncomprehending captor never even bothered to turn around.  As he jerked my leash and led me into the shade of the busy marketplace my eyes focused on him more.  My captor was young… maybe 19?  He was skinny, and wearing cutoff shorts and jeans and a T-shirt.

Seriously? This mere slip of a boy was leading me stark naked into a growing crowd with the casualness of a boy walking his dog.

From the architecture and white stone and colorful boats and salt water and white plaster and blue roofs and swarthy men I guessed I was on an island or on the coast, probably in Greece.  I didn’t understand the language spoken, but I certainly understood the rudeness of comments about my naked body as the men openly pointed at me and the old women cursed me.  As the crowd thickened and the streets narrowed the situation worsened.  These vulgar barbarians had no concept of personal space whatsoever. As I passed the crude and unsophisticated men freely reached out to grab my breasts, my ass, or ran their fingers through my long hair.  Pigs!  A few of the laughing men just reached out and grabbed me by the pussy, giving me a good feel, groping me as if they had every right to do so. 

Perhaps in this place and in my present reduced circumstances they did. As a trained psychologist I knew that power was often a matter of perspective.  In my eyes they might be vulgar, uneducated peasants, but in their eyes I was simply a naked slave girl.

“Slave girl.” The words hit me like a club.  I knew I wasn’t, of course, but once again my mind wandered to my passport, sitting in my purse, sitting in the desk drawer of one of Agatha’s summer interns cubicle.

Another man grabbed my breasts and started groping them, laughing to his friends as he did so.  The teenager holding my leash didn’t seem to care about the assaults behind him, except when a pussy grab or a titty pull caused me to slow, as this one did.  Annoyed, he violently yanked the leash around my neck, as if it were somehow my fault that some fat old man was squeezing my tits like melons for sale.  The noose tightened, cutting off my air and jerking me forward, as my boy-master muttered his displeasure at the way I was delaying him.

Delaying me from what?  Where were we going?  I did not know.  I did not need to know. 

I was a naked slave girl.

No! I pushed the thought from my mind.  I was a psychology student, and this was research.  It was natural that I would feel anxious, helpless, humiliated, afraid.  Those were the sensations a actual naked slave girl would feel in similar circumstances, and those were the emotions I was studying. 

With clinical attachment I shifted my attention to the strangers around me.  With their dark skin and strange accents the men and women in the marketplace reminded me of the janitorial staff at the University who scrubbed the toilets and worked in the cafeteria and drove the busses that ferried the students about.  From behind the boy who was holding my leash reminded me a bit of Juan, the townie that cleaned out the rat cages and mopped the floors at the psychology lab I ran on campus.  I sometimes sent Juan on personal errands to stand in line for me to get tickets or haul boxes and furniture up-and-down-the-stairs when one of my friends moved.  He didn’t always seem happy about it, but he did it, because I was the pretty white girl who signed his performance review and he knew I could replace him or perhaps even deport him if he didn’t dance to my tune. 

I had never thought much about our relationship; after all, I was the graduate student running the lab, and I had the power.  I was the one with the education.  When I snapped my fingers, Juan jumped.  That was simply the way things were, the way things were meant to be.

Strange as it might seem, I imagined Juan holding my rope leash, and suddenly I felt my pussy stirring, moistening at the thought of the servile teenage boy I ordered about leading me naked on a rope leash through the bustling marketplace. 

The psychology of my arousal confused me.  My girlfriends sometimes insisted that Juan take off his shirt when he was moving things or doing yard work for us or serving us by the pool at a party, but we were just teasing him.  He wasn’t at all muscular or attractive and it wasn’t like anyone of us would ever actually stoop to date him.  In truth, we were just being mean to him, playing a harmless but fun power game.

The game didn’t seem so harmless or fun now.  Why was I aroused at the thought of Juan leading me naked through the streets on a leash? I knew from my research and my personal experience in my Slave Yoga class that putting a beautiful girl in a posture of naked and vulnerable submission made her all the more attractive to men. But why was the thought of being humiliated by Juan so arousing? 

I didn’t realize precisely how vulnerable I was until my boy master stopped to talk to another teenager playing a videogame on his phone.  As the two chatted, one of my many passing “admirers” took advantage of my helpless vulnerability to attack me from behind.  I gasped as he forced my legs apart and slipped his into my embarrassingly wet sex.

I didn’t resist; indeed, because of the wetness of my sex and my inexplicable excitement over fantasizing about Juan I gasped with pleasure and pushed back, humping the strange man’s hand with my soaking wet pussy. 

Juan and his friend continued to laugh and chat about the video game, staring at the tiny screen.  Behind me the laughing, unseen stranger finger fucked me.  I closed my eyes and moaned, losing myself in my own pleasure.

I was on the very brink of orgasm when the moment ended.  As if a trap door had sprung the noose around my neck tightened and yanked me forward out of my admirers grasp.  The man behind me laughed and gave me a sharp slap on the ass as I stumbled forward in a daze, groaning and whimpering in frustration at the elusive orgasmic release denied to me. 

I never saw the face of the man who had nearly brought me to orgasm.

As I realized how wet my pussy was I felt a fresh wave of humiliation rush over me.  I had heard the slave girls talk about “block pussy”, a condition where certain slave sluts actually could orgasm at the mere thought of being taken to the market and put up on the auction block.  Even among slave girls this was looked down on, for it was a condition suffered by only the most ravenous and wanton of slave sluts.  After all, being paraded and exhibited in a slave market was the ultimate degradation; how could any woman with a shred of dignity get excited by being publicly violated by any stranger with a coin in his pocket?  Yet for slave sluts, the degradation of standing naked on an auction block was also the ultimate turn on."

I live in an apartment complex that mainly houses students and interns. My apartment is tiny, but my roommates' schedules mean that we typically don't see each other.

A few months after I moved in, a new guy started renting the room next door. He talks loudly on the phone every night, and is remarkably racist and homophobic. Beyond anything I have ever heard.  He often talks about wanting to shoot people for various reasons, and it wouldn't surprise me if he committed a mass shooting. Very angry, often drunk, feels threatened by anyone different.

I dealt with him for a while as the ""crazy guy next door"", until last week. Last week, another one moved in. Same attitudes, same fantasies of inciting violence.

I also happened to learn that both of these young men have guns with them. As a gay man, I was a little concerned to live with two drunk, armed homophobes, but mostly I thought it was one of those situations I would laugh about in the future. And at any rate, I've been able to avoid them. 

Everyone I talk to tells me to get the hell out, but I don't really have anywhere to go. I guess I would leave if I could, but I lack the funds to break my lease. I am planning to move in January after my lease is up, but many friends, family members, my doctor, and my therapist have insisted that I try to find another way out. 

I hate going home, and I turn to alcohol more often than I should to deal with the strangeness of the situation. I have also been living a weird schedule that often leaves me exhausted--departing early, returning late.

I hate the fact that these people are bugging me so much, but I don't feel like I'm in any immediate danger (although I definitely feel safer on the street than at home). 

Not looking for any solutions or even sympathy.
 Just wanted to tell the internet about my life as a gay man living with two guys who have talked openly about shooting gay people."

dzwok5,1,2019-11-22,Late-night vent,Pepperspray24,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dzwok5/latenight_vent/,"TL;DR: I'm overwhelmed which is fucking up my mental health issues. I'm trying to get through the last week and a half of this semester of grad school but I'm so stressed out that my suicidal thoughts are starting to come back (don’t worry there’s no plan or anything) I don't know who I can really talk to about it. I want to not feel as shitty as I do now.  


I'm sorry, I've been posting on here more and more. I don't really know who to talk to. I do have a couple of people but it's past midnight. I feel lazy. I feel shitty. I feel lonely and I don't totally know what to do. I'm fat because I've been stress-eating. I'm trying to actually stop caring about it until the semester is over, but it's hard? Like I have a problem with eating too much junk but a lot of times I lack the will power to really make an effort to make healthier choices. I'm trying to take it one day at a time. I know I only have about a week and a half until school is over but these weeks have been crawling by. I'm frustrated because I can't really talk to one of the people I really want to talk to. He's my ex turned friend? He wants me back, part of me wants him back but I don't know if it's because I really want to be with him if I'm lonely, or simply the fact that we dated for three years and broke up like 2 months ago. We (with some other friends) started a stream together so I see him every week. He confuses me. I know he loves me and tries to be supportive of me wanting to fully know whether I want to be with him or not, but he's of course super biased and I don't feel like he understands how that impacts the advice he gives me. Part of my being away is also out of a desire to simply have sex with people, I don't want to go into detail about that, but my prior sex life and relationships were bad and or toxic and I want to just have normal sex.  I don't have a lot of friends where I am. Both of my best friends live in different states than I do, I have about 3 good friends here, one of whom I met through my now ex/ friend. The friends I do the stream with are all people I met through him. I can't really talk to my mom because while she tries to be supportive of my mental health issues (offering me options, asking if I want to drop school for a bit, listening to me when I vent sometimes) but she doesn't always understand (example, I told her that I vented on here once and her response was ""well if you have time to do that you have time to do your homework"") I also feel like she'll judge me based on my choices. I feel lazy and gross. I feel exhausted and tired and I'm starting to get cursory suicidal thoughts again. I feel bad that I keep bringing my mental health up. A MULTITUDE  of people know that I'm not doing well. Like three of my professors at school, I've admitted it in class and fucking anyone who asks. For some context, I'm getting a master's in social work. Part of my issue is that when I'm having bad mental health problems I harp on the fact that I don't feel validated and so I tell everyone my shit in an attempt to get said validation (plus my ADD just gives me a big ass mouth). I'm having trouble getting myself to go to bed, get up from bed, clean my apartment, do homework, do internship work etc. I'm trying, really trying to do what I need to do, take it one day at a time. I just feel awful. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know when I'm seeing my therapist again because our schedules don't mix up. I hate this, I hate that my mental health keeps getting in the way of me living my life. I feel lonely and underappreciated, I feel like I work my ass off and then I look up and there's some assignment that I haven't done or something that's due today or tomorrow that I haven't started, I feel like nothing I do is worth anything or useful. Deep down, I know that I'm smart (I'm getting my masters) I know I'm strong (I still get up), I know that I can do this, but I just feel awful. I'm just fucking tired. I want someone to be able to just talk to, I want someone to tell me I'm pretty and valuable and not have to worry about ulterior motives from them, like my ex, or like this guy who says he's okay with me seeing other people then gets pissed off at me for it. I don't know. I just want to not feel the way I feel now. I want to feel loved, and valued and not stressed out of my mind. I want the semester to be over. I'm so tired. I just want everything to stop."

Just got my blood test results back and apparently I have slight liver damage? Getting another blood test done in 3 days time, my doctor said if results come back worse she recommends me not going overseas (for an internship, so I cannot afford to miss it!)
ALT: 80 U/L (&lt;45)
Cholesterol: 6.0mmol/L (&lt; 5.0)
Ferritin: 181 ug/L (20 - 170)
Everything else is in normal range 

Had some ice cream and chocolate before I slept that night, didn’t eat before blood test. Had to run there cause I was slightly late (apparently exercise raises ALT levels?) I eat relatively healthy, don’t drink alcohol but occasional have some sugary snacks as I do have a sweet tooth. 

I want to be able to lower my ALT levels for my next blood test in a few days, however just before knowing this I had a massive celebration day eating a lot of sugar. I’m worried my results will be even higher! 

Questions:
1. How long does it take for sugar to leave my blood?
2. If I cut added sugar out for the next few days, is it possible to lower my ALT? Or will all the sugar from the celebration be able to show up (will be 60 hours since next blood test)
3. Any other ways to prevent high ALT? (I never drink alcohol so I know this would not be a concern to me)

I will be getting another blood test done after my internship, so for the time being I just need it to be low enough until I come back!

TIA"

A student of 42born2code Network i recently joined a security company as a internship experience and i will probably work with them after that, anyway my first task here is to setup a Workspace one UEM solution on premises and as they have just started the mobile device manager solutions, so am the only one in the company who knows anything about this solution.

The clouded version is less complicated but the on premises is what i need as the company clients will opt for the on premises version for security breach so i would like to get some explication (i have already search on the internet and used the clouded version a little bit  but didn't find any good courses for setting up the on premises)  so i would like to know about :

1- The download link of workspace one UEM i couldnt find any software (i use the console link in the browser for the clouded version ) is there any pre-requirement at vmware so i could get the DL link.

2- Is there any special hardware for workspace one uem on premises.

3- I am also looking for a learning peer for workspace one if someone mature would like to join the journey to become an expert and maybe we could create a course for other people (its always better to learn in peers as we always cover more topics and have a second thinking mind set) .

Thank you for reading this long post and i wish you a good day"
dzznol,4,2019-11-22,Tips on housing in Enschede for an intern,Sensitive_Complaint,thenetherlands,https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/dzznol/tips_on_housing_in_enschede_for_an_intern/,"Hello Dutch redditors!

I am going to intern at the University of Twente starting from March.
I am already looking for a room, both through Roomspot and private housing websites, but I would like to ask somebody who already studies or lives in Enschede for a couple of tips:

1) Is there anything peculiar to the Dutch/Enschede housing market that I should be aware of? For example, I noticed that I should not take for granted that every house will have a mattress to sleep on: how does this work and what do ""furnished"" and ""unfurnished"" mean exactly? I am asking this since I saw ""furnished"" rooms that didn't have a bed.

2) Are there zones in Enschede that I should avoid as they are vaguely unsafe, badly connected to the center or something similar? Where does the center of Enschede end and where do the ""outskirts"" start?

3) Are there any popular scams I should be aware of? What should I be careful about when browsing housing offers, apart from the usual ""never pay ahead before you have the keys in hand""?

4) I need a place starting from March, but all the postings I see have houses that are free from December or January. When should houses that are free from March start to appear?

Thank you all in advance! I am so excited for this internship and I can't wait to get to Enschede!"
e007xr,7,2019-11-22,(M24) Do I stick with my LDR of two years even thought the end date keeps getting postponed?,advicethrowawaye,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e007xr/m24_do_i_stick_with_my_ldr_of_two_years_even/,"Hello all,

I've been dating L(F23) for 2 years. We began dating at the beginning of senior year of college. Since graduating (and seeing each other every day for \~9 months) we have done 4 months of LDR, 6 months of being in the same town again, and then another 5 months of LDR which brings us to now. Her first period of being gone for the summer was just to gain experience in her field, staying at home about 3 hours away and working an internship. She moved back to our college town for a 6 month period, but eventually moved home again while I also moved 9 hours away for my own job.

&amp;#x200B;

So we have now been apart for another 5 months, but it began with her verbalized intention that she would move to my current city by December pending finding a job. When she visited me a few months ago, she tentatively pushed this move back to the spring. On our most recent visit, she has now said she can't afford it until January 2021. Don't get me wrong, this has been a largely happy relationship going on two years, and we made each other very happy in college. I also completely understand her fiscal concerns, they make sense. The first period of LDR was even okay as I'd experienced it in a past relationship and was not concerned as we had an end date. But now that the goal posts on our new LDR end date have moved twice this fall, I am beginning to feel... uncomfortable. There is no doubt we love each other. She tries to keep in touch everyday and is obviously head-over-heels for me. She regularly brings up our long-term future together, and it seems concrete in her mind despite constant setbacks. I often vindicate these feelings, as I can often picture a very long-term future with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to my guilt and concerns... Ever since I realized I'm waiting a whole year (at least, who knows) until we live in the same town, I have felt slightly less connected. She checks in everyday, but sometimes it feels like a chore to catch up with her when I am busy with my housemates or work or commitments. I am the type who does not like to be connected to their phone 24/7, and it definitely rubs her the wrong way. When I want to ""connect with the people I'm talking to"", she wants to get updates from me. I am constantly on her mind, and to be honest: she is not constantly on mine. I reach out when I miss her and want to connect and find that comfort (which is on a basis that I feel is appropriate for my personality), but my needs are lesser than hers. It's getting to the point where I feel inconvenienced when I have to choose between her and my new social life in my new city, and it makes me feel extremely guilty. I am surrounded by single housemates and coworkers, and I find myself wondering against my will what it is like on the other side. It only gets worse when I think about how long we have apart. I am at the point where (at least when I drink or am especially enjoying being out and about in the thick of my social life) I am asking myself the biggest questions of all:

&amp;#x200B;

Am I merely experiencing the classic case of ""the grass is always greener on the other (more single) side?"" Will I miss her as soon as I decide I might prefer to be single in my new situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Or, is it responsible (if extremely hurtful) to break things off in the name of our disparity in emotional needs? Will I actually enjoy and benefit from my (admittedly often guilty) desire to try being single after looking down the barrel of a potentially endless long distance relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

I love her without a doubt. But I've never been brave enough to admit that she loves and needs me more than I love and need her. And I don't know if that's wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My LDR GF needs me more than I need her, and I honestly don't know if that is grounds to be selfish and enjoy my 20s/spare her feelings."
e01etj,1,2019-11-22,Big Four Internship after graduation,SaltySWO,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/e01etj/big_four_internship_after_graduation/,"So I have accepted a Big Four Audit Internship beginning in January 2019 and I am graduating with my B.S. in Accounting with 206 college credits the December prior to my internship (I have prior Air Force experience that converted to a dumb amount of elective credits being transferred).

The recruiter realized this after internship offer was extended and accepted and told me that they would check with the regional HR manager/director to see about just bringing me on full time. The response from the recruiting manager/director was to just keep me on for the internship and extend full time offer for the Fall if my performance merits it.

I have been working and going to school full time since 2016 - Currently 25 years old.

I am super excited for this internship but pretty nervous about what I am going to do with the gap between the internship and FT offer, assuming it is extended.

I am leaving a full time position at a mortgage company for the internship.

I have a 4.0 GPA and have met the college credit and work experience requirements in my state for licensure (no CPA exams taken yet), but I would caveat to say that I am getting my degree from Liberty University. (Their online program took my remaining time from two years to one year - I did this by taking 21 credits each semester, including summer)

If a full time offer is extended, is there an opportunity to ask to begin sooner/extend the internship? If so, how would you navigate/ start that conversation?

Or are these start and end dates pretty set in stone for the Big 4?

I realize that I am in in a unique situation relative to most interns and don't want to come off as entitled  or demanding to the firm / hr staff

If the dates are pretty in stone, any suggestions on how to generate income during the GAP?

Thanks and much appreciated!"
e01mgv,46,2019-11-22,Things I'm excited for season 16 B (Spoilers),FeyMimi,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/e01mgv/things_im_excited_for_season_16_b_spoilers/,"1) How Bailey will deal with the miscarriage. If it will affect her OCD. How she will deal with Amelia experiencing a healthy full term pregnancy now that she's lost her baby and has to see it happening.


2) Meredith and McWidow. I'm already extremely on board with this, even Cristina thinks it's a good idea so what more do I need? I hate MerLuca do I'm hoping that it's over for good (but I'm worried it's not). I think McWidow is hot, he's age appropriate, at a similar career point, at a similar life point and has also experienced loss. He can actually be an equal to Meredith and he doesn't look like Derek, bonus point.


3) I'm assuming Jo and Alex are going to be foster parents and tbh I'm not really a fan of that, if there is any couple I wanted to have bio kids, it's Jolex. I know they can do both, but I'm not sure how much the writers are willing to consider that. Anyways, interested to see how Alex will deal with Jo having stolen a baby lol. 


4) I'm 90% sure that Amelia's baby is Link's. This is just an avenue for them to put Teddy and and Owen on the rocks for a bit so she can consider Tom's offer, Owen can decide to propose to Teddy, and Omelia can through some drama before accepting (AGAIN), that they aren't meant to be together. Also, it'll probably be a chance to see where Amelink's relationship stands if they aren't having a baby together plus give Link some character development.


5) I'm interested in how Maggie's career breakdown will play through; she's more composed than when Derek, Cristina, Bailey and April had their breakdowns but less put together than Arizona was when she had hers. I want to see if this is going to add some depth to her character. Also I think this means that when she's eventually ready to come back to work, she will be at PAC North, cause Teddy isn't stepping down, plus Alex is trying to remake the cardio department.


6) This Webber storyline is stupid. You shouldn't be hanging out with a woman who made moves on you, you shouldn't be confiding in her about the problems in your marriage and you definitely should be talking to your wife. It's ridiculous enough that he's still throwing a tantrum over rightfully being fired. I don't even like Catherine but honestly I'm on her side about being annoyed with Richard.


7) I'm curious to see if anyone is going to die because of the car crash but I highly doubt it. Maybe we'll get some serious injuries though, top choices for that are Helm, Nico, Douchebag intern and Schmidt (in that order).



Random notes:

- I hate that Alex wasn't in last night's episode

- I love Koracick but he's better than this for fucks sake, why is he so obsessed with Teddy? They dated for like 6 months max and she was pregnant AND in love with another man for the entire time. What the hell.

- I really like that Bailey told Ben that it was his loss too, cause it's true. I hope we see how it affects Ben too, a lot of shows don't do a good job of showing that men can be very affected by miscariages too.

- How long do you think till Jackson and Vic break up and he ends up back with Maggie?

- Yay we got to see Carina for 2 seconds, she's alive lol.

- Unpopular opinion: although I think the interns are being silly for being so far up Meredith's ass, it was nice to see them tease Schmidt because it shows some of the relationship dynamics we haven't seen from the interns in a while. E.g Magic teasing George, Majac teasing April, Jo's class teasing Leah. (I don't agree with their reasons, but it is realistic that sometimes they just devolve into childish behaviour)

- I hope Xander becomes a recurring character because he is hilarious. He gives me Eli and Tyler vibes and I've missed that."

I've found a cool girl, complex and interesting one year ago, we talked much and it was as our souls became one. We shared all problems, pain, feelings, happiness, everything. And we stayed talked for 8 months and I had been already started saving money from my internship to go meet her. 

We are from different countries and such far away, there was 10000km between us.

Her birthday was getting close and was her 18 birthday, I listened her and prepared everything to go meet her in person. I prepared my bags, went to another state, 8 hours in a car. Took 4 planes till arrive at her region, almost 30 hours running into airplanes. But I arrived there, at her region at russia and I came worried till the outside of airport. She was waiting me far away, shy as always, she came walking and hugged me. It was the most strong feeling on my life and I thought this for a long.

So we stayed living the first month at her house together with her parents. It was really amazing and I should tell that I wish very much to marry with her.

At the end of the first month we needed went to another city but we didn't think that we would need live together. We went there and was so hard to find an apartment for us, but we found a bad house.

Bad but good, together it was amazing, I couldn't guess that i would live so much things only on 3 months. My soul was already tied to her soul, my love was flowing up, I was dying but there was a problem...

I could stay only 3 months and we couldn't marry so speedy, I needed come back to my country.

We lived so much things and had so much feelings together, her university is a hell and impossible, she used to study everytime and I was always there with her. Her company was the best thing I had on this life, and then at the end she needed went to live in a shared house with another girls while I went to my country.

Would be everything fine, if there she could talk me as before. But no, I feel as I lost my soul there, I can't survive. She is busy, the girl that live with her always come to stay with her and study, and then she can't call me, we don't see each other, we don't text much, we haven't cool talks. I miss to have her love so much, I don't know what to do anymore.

I know that her uni is hard, I know that she tries to talk me. But I have been suffering alone to save her from this hell. She is too busy with the people annoying her, I even can't care of her because I CAN'T TALK HER. Often I don't know if she ate, I don't know how is she feeling, I can't care if her anemia because we are too far... I feel so useless.

I am broken of miss, and I am not able even to listen her voice. She wrote a letter before I went and asked to I read in airplane. Now when I hold it, I feel as my heart will explode. I get headache, I get panic, I am 10000km from her and I don't find a good work. I haven't her company, I hide my feelings to she feel better and more calm. Everyday I feel as my world disappeared, it's already one month far away and everything just get worse. I try be a man and be strong, but everything remember of her, we lived together and just a simple coffee makes me die. I just see a cat and want to die, because she love cats. I don't know how to handle this, I feel as I will implode."

###Aris || 524 C.E
———————————————————————

“Where am I?” I cry out in a muffled scream as my eyes snap open.

In a disoriented panic I try rebooting my eyes with a million blinks but realize its useless; what I’m seeing with them open is the samething I’m seeing with them shut: total darkness.

The uncertainty of it all begins eating at my thoughts like a hungry animal until all that’s left is fear. Fear and a growing lump in my stomach that Ma calls anxiety.

I feel the lump maneuvering through my stomach now, dodging butterflies and chunks of half-eaten food, until it lodges itself to the bottom of my throat like pollen on a leaf.

Instinctively I clasp my hands to my neck, and that’s when I figure out why my eyesight is gone.

I’m...swimming; actually, now with my hands wrapped around my neck, it’s more like sinking.

As my heart thumps along in my chest so viciously it starts making me light-headed; I feel tears start to form at the edge my eyes but they quickly disappear into the dark waters.

Memories of my dad start randomly popping into my head. Flashes of his arms wrapping me tight, the things he’d say to soothe me, what he’d do to make me smile. He always found a way to stay cool and collected, even on the day he died. ‘Only cool-heads make cool actions!’ he would say with a goofy grin.

As the flashes continue, I feel the thumping in my chest die down to a mild pitter-patter; guess even death can’t stop him from making me feel better.

Just as the last ounces of panic drain from my body, a deafening explosion from far above my head sends it all rushing back to me.

Shakenly looking up, light from the explosion blinds me and seconds later, I feel a violent shockwave ripple through the bubbling waves and rock me furiously.
After rubbing the light off my eyes, I look up and finally realize where I am; I’m completely and utterly screwed.

Not only am I swimming, I’m swimming directly under a sinking ocean-liner that’s on fire and I can’t even remember how I got here.

Staring at the ship’s rapid descent like a puppy in a thunderstorm; I’m stuck. Totally frozen with fear. Again.

All at once the gravity of the situation crashes on me like an avalanche and I start to paddle desperately.

With adrenaline now bursting through my veins, I paddle for dear life; putting every morsel of energy I have into each stroke as the emberring hull inches closer and closer.

For some reason though, my arms feel like they’re barely moving! It’s like they’re numb or something.

Whipping my head back, I spot an oily life jacket covered in flames about to land on my butt checks but with a quick knee-jerk twist, I narrowly dodge it.
It must’ve caught fire along with the ship; the irony.

From the corner of my eye I see the scorching mountain of an ocean-liner boiling through the water around me, now only a few meters away.

With the flames now illuminating the water, I realize that for some reason I’m also completely naked.

Shifting gears into emergency survival mode, I push through the numbness of my arms and bite my lip through the pain as hairs on my back begin to singe off.

“Faster. Faster!” I yell at my limbs as my body begins to tremble. Whether it’s due to exhaustion or panic, I couldn’t tell anymore.

After my last good stroke, my body shuts down and begins tensing up in the frigid waters.

Turning back, I see the ship barely miss my toes as its smoldering hull passes by in a bubbling cloud.

Watching as the burning light sinks deep into the depths of darkness, I slowly pump my fist in triumph.

I did it!

I survived!

Cutting my victory short, a group of rogue snake-like power cables pop out of the darkness. They slither behind the vessel like tentacles; twirling through the water weightlessly, and slice at my hand.

Before I know it, the knot of serpent-cables wrap around my ankles and yank me down to the depths with a violent tug.
Hopelessly, I watch as my last air bubbles slowly scatter into the tides.

As I’m blacking out, I begin to hear the faint grinding and clanking of metal as we drop into deeper depths.

The grinding intensifies the lower we drop till it’s piercingly loud but yet... it’s strangely familiar.

Yeah, it’s definitely familiar!

It’s not a song, more like an assault to the ears, an unrelenting drone if you will, but still familiar.

Wait...it’s my alarm clock!

WAKE UP!



My mind and body must’ve gotten different memos because even after realizing it was all a dream, it still feels like I’m underwater.

Waking up to a cold sweat; I’m immediately blinded (again) by the blue sun rays shining through my walls
Totally disoriented, I slowly lift my head up with a loud yawn as I stretch my neck. In my other hand, I feel water running through my fingers as my palm sinks into my comforter.

Not a great way to start my day off. I’m all soaked in cold sweat, it’s the sixth time this month!

“What time is it?” I mutter under my breath while bitterly dragging myself out of bed.

While wiping the sand from under my eyes, I belt out another yawn and reach my hand back to activate my relay.
With a gentle tap to the space behind my left ear, a 2D green dot materializes into view at the top left corner of my field of view.

This time when I think ‘what time is it’ a transparent 3D clock pops up next to the green dot, slowing rotating with a light glow.

It reads: 13:05, with a blinking exclamation point hovering beside it.

With a thought, I click on the exclamation point and the calendar app pops open then flips to today’s page.

In big letters, a flashing message blares:

Extra Shift at Breok’s | 12:00-22:00

With a defeated sigh, I slap my forehead with my palm and slowly drag it down to my chin.

“CRAP! I’m late for work.” I holler in frustration as I reach behind my ear again and put my relay in idle.

In all the excitement from my nightmare, I forgot I begged Breok for an extra shift last week.

Tumbling out of bed, I start to rummage through the piles of clothes on the floor for my work uniform.

Finally getting it after the third pile, I pull it out and wipe it down before throwing it on with two quick hops.

Midway through zippering up, I realize I’m not wearing any underwear; but there’s no time to go scouring for one now. I’ll have to go commando –gross- but it’s got to be done. 

After getting changed I stumble out of my room, hopping on one foot as I put my boots on.

Crashing onto the walls of the kitchen as I struggle to get them on, I see the lunch Ma left for me on the counter and grab it just as I zip up my left boot then jet out the door.

The moment I step outside I reach back, re-activate my relay, and play the perfect soundtrack for my race against unemployment.

Hopping down from my stoop I hit the footstreets running, wildly navigating through the sea of commuters on their way to work as I move like the wind to keep mine.

To the left, zipping autos fly up and down the hyperways at speeds so fast all you can see is a blurry river of headlights through the blue-hued hardlight barrier.

To my right, vibrant relay-generated ads dance through the Metro’s sprawling canopy of mega-skyscrapers and hov-gardens in a beautiful mirage of colors.
The scissoring hyperway tracks run through multi-tiered buildings, platforms and terminals; looping around to connect every corner of the Metro with thick arcing beams of light.

In the distance, there’s always a few tracks fading in and out before reappearing again in different shapes or directions; Ma told me the people that get paid for that actually make bank. Maybe I should drop off my resume, apply for an internship or something; I’ll need it after Breok strangles me to death.

Above my head, two pixelating mercury surfers appear riding a silvery wave. With gigantic smiles painted on their faces, they dodge every hanging vine and tree branch in sight.

When I see them, the smell of fresh sand following the tingling taste of metal flood my senses. For a moment all I can remember is renewing my Silver TapTM lake passes for the spring. From the corner of my eye, however, I see the slowly rotating clock pulsate as it changes time.

13:11

I’m now a full hour-something late, and counting.

“Busy; maybe another time.” I mutter to the surfers as their smiles droop into frowns. Massive waves crash on top of them, totally wiping them out as they de-pixelate into mist and vanish.

Through my music I hear a small ping from a new IM*, a coupon for Merc-Surfing most likely, so I ignore it and turn up the bass as the rotating sign above the jump-pad terminal finally pops up in the horizon.

Desperately sprinting through annoyed faces to an electro beat, I dip and weasel my way to the nearest pad- stop as the song’s build-up reaches critical mass. 

Just as I jump through a group of cell-farmers to get onto the platform, the beat drops epically and I stick the landing; only to notice I just got to the end of a very long line.

Jump-pads are usually arranged in semi-circles at pad- stops; five or six to a platform. They’re quick as a blink and never power down; but even with a stop every 100 or so meters along the hyperway, on each side, the ques to use one can get horrible during rush hour.
And it’s always rush hour.

13:16

“C’mon! At this rate I’ll be clocking in at lunch!” I quietly mutter to myself as I stare hopelessly at the rotating clock in my peripheral and take my place in line.
At least the line’s moving fast.

One-by-one people march up to the jump-pad and ‘port away in the blink of an eye only to be quickly replaced by another, then another and so on.

Thing is, Breok’s shop is across the track from me; I can see his flashing relay-sign from my room. Yet, I still have to wait in a que of six-hundred just to get there; kind of lame.

Without these bad boys though, getting across the hyperway would be suicide.
My teacher told us the average speed per auto on any given hyperway is between 75 to 150 meters per second -without speed hacks.

Hardlight barriers block people from wandering in and contain any accidents between autos within the track; but accidents can still happen.

Like Mr. Boe says: “Anything on the track that’s not made of metal or running on nuclear fusion is definitely getting the yoga-mat treatment, free of charge!”
Waddling anxiously as the que marches on, I start to fantasize about cutting everyone in line and hopping onto a jump-pad before anyone could catch me.
It’s a thought I’ve had every day since starting at Breok’s shop.

Without meaning to, I trail off on the thought before realizing it’s finally about to be my turn to hop on.

Luckily, I’m not the only one in line late for something. It takes no more than two seconds of me standing aimlessly in my thoughts before the hissing and cursing start to ring in my ear.

With a face redder than raw meat, I turn around to apologize but see hundreds of sour-stares beaming lasers at my forehead.

“Yeesh; point made.” I mutter to myself. “No need for the pitchforks.”

Turning back around while trembling nervously, I close my eyes and hop onto the jump-pad without thinking another word.

When I open my eyes again, I’m on the platform in front of Breok’s ‘Relay-Sheens and Everything In-Between’ store.

Still trembling, I step off the jump-pad and walk in; mentally preparing myself for the absolute worst.

Stepping through the doorway, I notice the clock in my relay pulsing again.

13:27

I’m screwed; up, down, and sideways.

The moment he sees me, Breok’s bellows start to rattle every widget, loose screw and poster in the store.

Arms flapping, he roars and curses at me like it’s the answer to life but by now, I’ve heard it all.

“I’m deducting this”, “Say good bye to that”, throwing in an extra “What do I pay you for” here and there, the whole nine; but I expected worse, way worse.

After a while, he eventually mumbles off to his office and leaves the store to me when he sees that I’m actually doing my job; something I’ve still never seen him do.
The pay’s decent though and I get to work on awesome stuff all day so, can’t complain.

It’s mainly simple repairs that I do here. Got an infinity screen acting up at home? Bring it in, we gotcha’ covered.

A few months back, I even fixed a small nuclear engine with a busted sonic-screwdriver and some toothpaste.

I love it, and always have for as long as I can remember. Ma says it’s because I grew up breaking everything; eventually I had to figure out how to put it back together.

When the store’s empty, and I’m certain Breok’s not glaring over my shoulders anymore, I quietly take out a small project that I’ve been working on for the past couple of months.

It’s the skeleton to a prototype I’m calling: ‘the bionic exo-limb’, or something like that; I’m not too good with names. What it does is simple, in theory anyway.

It attaches itself to a body part, analyzes inefficiencies in the muscle structure, and then enhances it exponentially.

Most of it is still in concept, actually, it’s all still in concept.

For now though, I do at least have the basic layout done; the only thing left to do is test it while connected to some power and watch what happens.

After cautiously turning on the power generator, I warily place the wireless transmission-pads on their respective pairs and take a deep breath.

If I touch the alloy casing while power’s running through it, it’ll be a good bye to my facial hair; and I just started getting my first tusks so safety is key.

Carefully finishing the adjustments to the last pad on the bio-limb, I take another deep breath and turn on the potential. When suddenly, the front door slams open and a voice boldly calls out:

“Aye, you guys fix HovCyks here?”

In seemingly slow motion I look up to see a guy around my age, probably a little shorter than me, with broad shoulders and maroon hair.

Somehow, even with the sun hitting him, his eyes look completely black. Weirder still, he looks kind of familiar; do I know him?

Steadily, he walks in with a cocky smug and the broken handle of a ruined -and still steaming- HovCyk.

As time starts catching back up, I realize my heart’s knocking in my chest like a friendly neighbor as I stare blankly at the stranger. He came out of nowhere!

“Wait! The alloy casing!” screams a voice from the back of my head.

With my eyes wider than a hyperway track, I slowly turn my head down to my hands.

Oh no.

ZZAAAAPPPP

Waking up a few seconds later, there’s a gear at my back, a neutron generator on my head, and a hand in my face.

Looking up to a silhouette of the stranger who just came in, I grab the hand and he helps me struggle off the miscellaneous pile.

“Thanks.” I mutter to the stranger as I dust my uniform off; trying to hide my embarrassment the best I could.

“No problem man; sure you alright?” nervously asks the stranger as he warily eyes me up and down.

“Agh, I’m fine. Don’t worry about it. And yeah...I can take a look at that for you.” I groan while extending my hand out. “My name’s Aris by the way.”

He looks down at my hand curiously and then shoots a look back up to me.
With a subtle blink, he relaxes his shoulders, flashes a smile and heartily grabs my hand.

“Nice to meet you man; name’s Zay’ko.”"

I was thinking to include this. Is it wise?
e04yex,3,2019-11-22,Just need some support,AshesOnTheBreeze,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/e04yex/just_need_some_support/,"I second and triple guess everything now. Who I talk to, what I share, what I should share, something as simple as 'where did I eat today, where did I go for a walk?' are all too intimate for me to share now after having my trust betrayed. I'm living with my ex fiance after a volatile unveil this summer. There was a miscarriage, sexual abuse, my attempt to opt out, getting pushed to the point of collapsing to keep up with him in an activity he enjoys, medical concerns like the possibility of cancer and so much else. 

He told me things like 'you're gaslighting me, you're toxic, you overreact, you are hostile' and that he's a 'laid back, easy going person', 'compassionate', and I'm 'abrasive'. He withheld affections for several months, wanting no contact with me, not even a phone call or text, because he was 'too busy' yet in reality he was too busy with an intern at the office occupying his attention. They were texting and talking all day, it's just weird that she uses a different number to text him than she uses with anyone else they work with. I used to care. I've stopped caring.

What is making me struggle now is I live in a city where I relocated to that is a collective hive of people he knows, but I don't know anyone outside his circle of influence. I've been a domestic trapped house partner for several years. He brought me up here with the lure of going back to college, getting a part time job and a car for me to use. Lots of empty promises. He was always too busy to do things with me once I moved up. Never too busy for this new supply though -- she's welcome to him, they're both idiots that can't seem to use common sense and then he tells me about all the ways he's hurt himself. It's always about him and how he feels.

He only recently started asking me how my day is going, what have I been up to, and I just stick to simple answers of 'It's another day' or 'It's been a long day'. We'll eat dinner together while he texts her or occupies himself, but I know when he starts showing me more concern, it's because he's up to something. In the last week he's been touching me, soft gentle brushes against my arms, stroking my hair, offering me hugs when he finds me crying in another room. He started offering to cuddle me in the bed he makes me sleep in alone. We napped. It was good, a touch of nostalgia even though I know it'll never be what it was. 

Later on though, when we're trying to watch a show together he'll come over to me and the touching becomes more specific. Part of the things he used to break me down this summer was saying I got in the way of his faith, premarital sin, etc. Now he tells me he has all this pent up energy and no outlet, that it's a struggle for him... always about him. I told him we're both suffering, but he was supposed to be on the right path again, and I wasn't going to be the reason he walked off it. So I keep denying him and he keeps trying to engage me in sex. I remind him this was his choice. He made the call not to work things out with me due to X, Y, Z reasons that he felt I was 'toxic and abusive', 'too old', and 'not religious enough'. He says he doesn't have any feelings for me, but continues to try and sate his lust by trying to grind against me, kiss me, touch me, everything else he 'misses', but doesn't necessarily miss doing with me.

Everyone is like 'you need to move out' except my family has shunned me because the evil part of this is that my ex fiance knew about my prior relationship which was over a decade where I eventually got pigeon holed into much the same state: gave up job, gave up place to live, gave up freedom, became domestic, lost independence, etc. So having this all happen again, pushed me off the edge. My family doesn't want anything to do with me. I don't have friends here. I have no job or car. He lets me borrow the car when it suits him, like it's a favor to me, and I profess being grateful for it. He controls the finances, my phone, everything -- what little control I have is the internet and storage unit are in my name. The storage unit contents are super important to him. But because he controls everything, I just lay there and let him paw me, still denying him sex, because he's already shown me when he gets mad (which I used to ask him about because he never once in four years would lose his temper about anything, I said it wasn't realistic) he'll take almost all the money from the joint account and leave me to suffer while he's gone.

When he's trying to do things to me, if I protest, he puts his face in mine and says very seriously: ""Be good."" If I try to shove him off, he does it again and says: ""Be GOOD."" If I do anything that offends him, he says things like that or ""Be NICE."" If I mirror him, he'll call me mean, to which I say I'm just mirroring him, so how am I mean? He'll come up with some stupid logic and I'll counter that he's projecting things on me that I don't have to be responsible for, then he'll look at me a bit before trying to change topics.

I've been on several interviews with no luck yet, I've tried studying material to learn new skills and my mind just can't cope. His family doesn't care what he's done or is doing to me, they just want me gone. He's got tons of friends that don't believe anything I've describe can possibly be something he's doing or has done.

Holidays are coming up and I am spiraling."
e05by9,21,2019-11-22,Living with a person addicted to food while trying to lose weight. Please help?,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/e05by9/living_with_a_person_addicted_to_food_while/,"Hi all! I’m new to this subreddit (and Reddit in general) so I hope this is the appropriate place to post this. A few years ago I had gone from 200 pounds to 135. I did it slowly and was super proud of myself (I’m 5’7 and female). In the past year, I moved in with my sister to finish my last year of college and I have unfortunately gone back up to 175. I know how to lose weight and if I lived alone I could do this without any struggle, but my sister is addicted to fast food. 

If she wants fast food, we *have* to get it, otherwise it turns into a massive fight and the silent treatment for days on end. It makes it difficult living in a 1 bedroom apartment. While I was away doing an internship in another state last year, my parents noticed this habit of hers. She tries to get people to eat just as bad as her and if they don’t, there is a huge episode. She justifies it by saying that her day was rough or that she doesn’t want to live her life not being able to eat foods that taste good. Personally, I never go out and get fast food on my own accord. It’s only when I’m with her and when I don’t order as much as her, she will order the extra food anyway and either eat it or try and persuade me to eat it. 

The issue is, I have a binge eating problem. I also have exercise bulimia (both diagnosed) so I will be on the elliptical for hours trying to burn off whatever it is that she pressured me to eat and I subsequently binged on. It’s driving me insane because I know that when I’m alone, my self control is great. I don’t eat out, I stick to healthy foods only, etc. My mom and I tried to sit her down to talk about it and she simply doesn’t care. I don’t know what to do anymore. Just last night she got Taco Bell, Dairy Queen, and then wanted more ice cream so she went and got Ben and Jerry’s at the store down the road. I know that ultimately, it comes down to my self control, but if anyone has any tips on how to live around people like this I would so appreciate them. I’ve started buying my *own* groceries rather than going with her and picking out things together. This seems to help but I could use some advice. Thank you!"

You’ve all been a great help in the past so I hope I can ask you for guidance yet again. I’m not even sure I have a question I just need someone to pour my heart out to.

For over a year I’ve been on sick leave, dealing with depression and stress and I’m still struggling, albeit I’m on mood stabilizers and doing a lot better. Sometimes I still get those depressed feelings but I’ve learned that most times (for me) they pass even though it may not seem like it.

The stress however remains. I get overwhelmed a lot and for a while now I’ve been breathing very shallowly like there’s always a panic attack coming.

Yesterday it was very bad. I sat in a coffee shop with a friend and as the place filled up, it was like I couldn’t “be” within myself. I wanted to scream. Still do really.

Anyways, what might have triggered me yesterday was the fact that my case worked told me that they have “a deadline” for me being well again (from my doctor and psychiatrist) which is February 1st. So in January I’m going to be doing some internships so I can slowly work my way up to being able to apply for full time jobs and such again.

And I’m scared. Scared of what’s to come, what’s next for me and if I’m strong enough to maintain work. The last job I had only lasted a month because I was depressed and stressed and it broke my confidence and self-esteem badly when I was fired. It was a shitty job so I’m glad to not be there anymore but a lot of my stress started from not being able to get a job in the first place. So to lose a job was heartbreaking.

So I’m scared as mentioned. What if I’m still not able to find work? I’m quite shy, so I might not be the best in face to face interviews. And what if I’m not strong enough mentally to do anything? 

What if I’ll never feel truly happy again because I’m broken?"

e06lrc,16,2019-11-22,Total drama despair: World tour.,sedt29,Totaldrama,https://www.reddit.com/r/Totaldrama/comments/e06lrc/total_drama_despair_world_tour/,"I really liked the despair island fanfic. After reading the first season, and the one shot one of the second season, I decided to do one shot of a third season, with the pahkitew island casts. Though this will be more of a elimination order than anything, but I try to add in stories behind it,

Warning: If anyone hasn’t seen the fanfic, and don’t wanna be spoiled, I recommend you not to see this post.

Note: Due to having 14 characters, I decided to add in the ones that survived that are: Jo, mike, dawn and dakota, just so the cast doesn’t feel small. Also there are no aftermath episodes due to the og cast not wanting to do anything with the show again. Also, there is only one life statue.

So here we go:

Ep 1 and 2 are reward challenges and no one quits due to chris saying that if anyone tries to quit, they will be immediately be executed. The teams are the following:

Team victory: Jo, dakota, dave, sky, rodney and leonard 

Team amazon: Dawn, beardo, sammy, amy, scarlett and sugar.

Team Chris is really hot: Ella, topher, jasmine, shawn, mike and max.

Ep 3: The challenge is the same as in the original one.

Winner: Team amazon. Reason: It was thanks to dawn, due to her putting in some cute animals, which made chef sentimental, and he declared that they are the winners.

Safe: Team chris. 

Loser: Team victory. Reason: Chef wasn’t a fan of leonard using his *magic* to make it seem spectacular.

18th: Leonard. They all decided to vote off leonard due to him failing the team, and him being simply too annoying. He tried to escape, but he was captured and was stabbed in the head with a sword, thus ending his life.

Ep 4: The challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Team Chris. Reason: Thanks to jasmine’s physical strength, she was able to carry the whole team to victory, though with some difficulty.

Safe: Team amazon.

Loser: Team victory. Reason: They were missing a player, and that was rodney. And it was because his tongue was stuck in a pole. Due to this, they failed the challenge.

17th: Rodney. They were a bit uncomfortable with him failing in love with other girls. He tried to tell them that someone tricked him, but due to still having his tongue on the pole, they didn’t understand what he was saying. He was quickly throw in a cage, and was throw off the plane, where he landed in yukon again, and he sadly got frozen. Scarlett was behind a statue, seeing all of this, smirking as she was the one who did this. 

Ep 5 is a reward challenge.

Ep 6: The challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Team amazon. Reason: Even with mike using his personality: Svetlana, the others, sammy and amy, had more experience than him, thanks to being cheerleaders.

Safe: Team chris.

Loser: Team victory. Reason; Jo and scarlett were facing against each other, and scarlett started to mock jo, wanting to mess with her head, only to get smacked by jo and then she throw scarlett off the platform. She jump off the platform and start slapping her a lot. Because of this, team victory lost the challenge.

16th: Jo. They were afraid of her, due to her outburst, so they decided to vote for her. Jo was angered, but scared at the same time. Jo was thrown in a table, where, just like what they did to katie and sadie, they cut her in half.

Ep 7 is a reward challenge.

Ep 8: The challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Team chris. Reason: Thanks to jasmine’s leadership, they were able to put the statue correctly.

Safe: Team amazon

Loser: Team victory. Reason: Dakota was too busy admitting london, while dake and sky tried to put the statue correctly, but in the end, it was broken by dakota, who wanted to show them a painting, but accidentally tripped on the way.

15th: Dakota. Despite everyone getting along, dave and sky simply didn’t wanted to vote for one another, as they were more close than they are with dakota. Plus they secretly have feelings for one another. She confidently though that her daddy would save her, only for chris to announced that his daddy have abandoned her, which shocked her. She was put in a electric chair, and she was quickly electrocuted to death. 

Ep 9 is a reward challenge.

Ep 10: The challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Team victory. Reason: Sky and dave, more determined to win the challenge, were able to easily dominate the challenge thanks to their collaboration.

Safe: Team amazon.

Loser: Team chris. Reason: Mike, seeing dave and sky together, made him remember the good times he had with zoey despite the circumstances, which made him lose focus on the final challenge, thus causing the challenge for his team.

14th: Mike. Scarlett, seeing mike feeling slightly depressed, decided to manipule him. She told him that if he wants to redeem himself for his team, all he has to do is quit. Mike wasn’t sure if he should do it at first, but in the end, he finally did it. Before the elimination ceremony, he and his personalities said goodbye to one another, knowing that the end is near. He announces to chris that he was quitting. Chris told him that if he was sure to do it, because if he does, he will die. But mike was fully sure and told him that he was serious. His team felt bad for him, so they all gathered to give him one final hug. Chris, realizing that there is no fun tools he could use to kill him, simply decided to shoot him. After everyone separated from mike, chris shoots mike in the hearts, ending his life quickly.

Ep 11: the challenge is the same as the original one, except an intern replaces ezekiel as the killer.

Winner: Team chris. Reason: Despite being nearly wiped out, jasmine and shawn were able to capture the killer.

Safe: Team victory.

Loser: Team amazon. Reason: They were all wiped out.

13th: Dawn. Sammy and amy voted for each other, due to their sisters rivarly, while beardo voted for sugar because he got along with other members more than sugar, dawn voted for scarlett because of her being evil, and knowing that she was the cause of a few deaths, while scarlett, knowing that she was figured out by dawn, convinced sugar to vote with her.  Dawn was shocked for the results, but in the end, she accepted the fate. Though she wishes her team mates, except scarlett, the best of luck. Her neck gets snapped, ending her life quickly.

Ep 12: The challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Team amazon. Reason: Despite losing the first challenge, due to sammy and amy’s experiences as cheerleaders, they were able to dominate the last two challenges.

Safe: Team victory.

Loser: Team chris. Reason: They were feeling a bit too confident about their winnings, that they end up sending the wrong people to the challenges.

12th: Max. Despite jasmine’s bad decision here, they decided to vote for max, as he was not only annoying to them, but he hasn’t been the most useful player in the team. He was angry, but before he can do anything, chris puts a grenade inside his mouth, and forced him to swallow, then he throws him out of the plane. He order chef to fly faster, just so they don’t get caught from the explosion. Max ends up being blown up.

Ep 13th: The challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Team chris. Reason: Ella’s singing was somehow enable to distract the aliens enough so her team could get one of the alien items.

Safe: Team victory.

Loser: Team amazon. Reason: After dawn’s elimination, they all form their own team, and because of their disagreements and fights, they simply weren’t able to get anything.

11th: Sugar. Despite their differences though, they decided to get rid of sugar, as they had enough of her and her attitude towards ella. Chris brings in a robot (The same one courtney found in the series) to disintegrate her. She was throw out of the plane, and the robot shoots a beam at her, disintegrating her. 

Ep 14: the challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Team Chris: Thanks to jasmine’s leadership, they were able to win the challenge easily.

Safe: Team victory

Loser: Team amazon. Reason: They didn’t have much experiences with animals. However....

10th: Ella. She accidentally tripped, making her fall down from the cliff, and into the ground, thus ending her life. Chris said that because of that accident, team amazon doesn’t have to vote for anyone, which made them happy being able to survive for another day.

Ep 15: The challenge is the same as the original one, except the ice doesn’t break.

Winner: Team victory. Reason: The other teams were too busy fighting each other, which gave them enough time to gain victory.

Safe: Team chris.

Loser: Team amazon. Reason: The other teams just had a better teamwork than them.

9th: Sammy. Scarlett was able to convinced beardo to vote for her, saying that the others were gonna vote her off, even though it was a lie. Scarlett and amy voted for sammy, beardo voted for scarlett, and sammy voted for amy. Sammy was scared to know that she was gonna die. Beardo felt terrible, and then he realized that he was tricked. But surprisingly, chris said that the others had to leave now, and not wanting to get on his bad side, they leave, not without beardo saying goodbye to sammy. Outside, they heard sammy screaming, and then silence. Amy  felt great for finally getting rid of sammy, even though that won’t last forever.

Merge happens:
Amy, scarlett, sky, jasmine, beardo, shawn, dave and topher.

Ep 16: The challenge is the same as the original one. The pairs are:

Dave and sky
Shawn and jasmine
Beardo and scarlett
Topher and amy.

Winner: Dave and sky and shawn and jasmine. Reason: They both just had better chemistry than the others, and because chris was too bored to even do a tiebreaker situation, he decided to let them be the winners.

8th: Beardo. Scarlett, knowing that beardo could be a big threat to her due to knowing who she was, decided to get others to vote with her. She got amy (She was her ally from the beginning in secret) topher(Knowing that he had a crush on sammy since they had spend some together, she told him that beardo was the one who got her killed, which made him angry and decided to help her) and with some hard work, dave and sky(Using the fact that they may end up getting killed due to couple being usually dangerous in this competition)to vote for beardo. Beardo manages to warn the others to not let scarlett get away with it, and when he was about to tell the whole truth, he was throw in a coffin, which had spikes, and chris closes it, ending his life.

Ep 17: The challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Scarlett. Reason: Knowing that she was in danger of elimination due to everyone finally realizing that she had caused some deaths, she did everything she could to win the challenge, even if her stomach wasn’t that strong.

7th/6th: Sky and dave. Knowing that their only target, scarlett is immune, they voted for sky, due to her skills being a huge threat to them, dave, not wanting for her to die, quits to save her. She felt appreciated that dave would do this, only for chris to say that both of them will die. They were shocked, but nonetheless accepted their fate. They kiss first, knowing that this is the last time they will do it, and then they get hit in the hammer hard from the head, causing them to lose their heads.

Ep 18: The challenge is the same as the original one, except an intern is disguise as a lion instead of feral ezekiel.

Winner: Scarlett. Reason: Despite jasmine having more advantage than her, she was able to get the lion with a lucky shot.

5th: Jasmine. Topher, as much as he doesn’t have anything against shawn or jasmine, knew that he had to vote for one of them because of their status relationship being a big threat. He chose jasmine as he got along better with shawn. Scarlett and amy voted for jasmine, while jasmine and shawn voted for amy. Jasmine and shawn said goodbye to one another, and after that, jasmine was throw in the safari, where she was mauled by a tiger. 

Ep 19 is a reward challenge.

Ep 20: The challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Amy. Reason: Scarlett decided to let her get the win, because despite being crazy, she did wanted to keep her allience until the very end. So she help her win the challenge.

4th: Shawn. Shawn was angry at topher at first due to him voting for jasmine, but after a while, he decided to give him a chance to redeem, by asking him to vote for scarlett. Topher and shawn voted for scarlett while scarlett and amy voted for shawn. A tiebreaker happens, and scarlett easily wins. Shawn thanked topher for at least not betraying him, and then he gets bit by someone who looks like a zombie by the neck, and after that, he starts to lose blood. He asked chris to blow his head, not wanting him to bring a zombie to life and cause so many deaths, even though it was just chris messing with him. Chris accepted it, and shoots him in the head.

Ep 21: The challenge is the same as the original one except no tie happens.

Winner: Amy. Reason: She started to feel guilty for the death of her sister, and after realizing what she did, she decided to team up with topher to defeat scarlett. At first, topher didn’t want anything to do with her, but noticing her guilt, he finally decided to help her. He fights scarlett along the way so amy could get the win.

3rd: Scarlett. Reason: In the boats there were riding, they started to fight. Scarlett tried to convinced him to team up to kill amy, but topher refuses. And in a fit of rage for all the deaths she caused, he managed to push her boat towards one of the bombs, thus causing her to blow up.

Ep 22: The challenge is the same as the original one.

Winner: Topher. He was able to throw his dummy to the lava.

2nd: Amy. Chris pushes her to the lava, saying how disappointing he was that she didn’t win. Suddenly, polices appeared to arrest chris. The one responsible for this is none other than sammy, who explained on how she managed to survive. She was given in secret the life statue by dawn, wanting her to survive this horrible show. She didn’t wanted to accept it, but in the end, she kept it.

e07fam,5,2019-11-22,Post Second Interview,familiarhaunt,tjcrew,https://www.reddit.com/r/tjcrew/comments/e07fam/post_second_interview/,"Hi everyone! 

I just got home from my second interview with the Captain and another crew member! I feel like it went really well (I think, I don’t wanna jinx it!), they were both so nice and the Captain was cracking jokes throughout the interview. The Captain said I should be hearing back from them within a week! 

I was wondering, do you guys think I have a good chance of getting hired right before the holiday season? Also, any advice for what to expect as a new hire working during the holiday season? I know it’s the most hectic time of year! 

Here’s some background info-

My older sister works at this location and encouraged me to hand in an application. She put in a good word for me with one of the mates and he scheduled an interview with me. The first interview went really well, I felt like I really connected with him and the other crew member. Afterwards he said I should hear back within a week but he called me the next morning to schedule an interview with the Captain! 

I have prior work experience at a mental health nonprofit organization as an intern. Also, my availability is basically wide open since I’m only taking a few classes right now at a community college. 

I really hope I do get hired because I love everything Trader Joe’s stands for and I’ve seen how well they’ve treated my sister! I’d love to be a part of the team they have! 

Also, this subreddit helped me so much with preparing for my interviews, thank you all for the great insight and information! 

Ahh, sorry if I rambled! Thank you for reading! :)"

:-:|
The Eagles need a win to keep pace with the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East as they take on the team the Eagles just lost to in the New England Patriots. Getting a win this week will be no easy task though as the Eagles welcome the Seattle Seahawks to town. Russel Wilson is having an MVP season and has had the Eagles number since entering the league going 3-0 against his fellow Bird team. The Eagles will need to limit Wilson much like they limited Brady last week against the Patriots, but this time they will need help from the offense which disappearing in the middle of the second quarter last week with plenty of blame to go around from Wentz, the WRs and most importantly the coaching staff abandoned the run and failed to put the team in position to win, completely abandoning the run, despite averaging 4 yards per carry at the time. The Eagles offensive coaching staff needs to be better this week in creating a game plan and putting their guys in position to win, especially if the defense plays possessed like they did last week. Groh and Pederson need to get Carson going early and utilize the screen game to get the Seahawks defense moving laterally and off balance to help slow down their pass rush. The Seahawks have given up a lot of yards to TEs this season and 4 TDs so there should be opportunities for Ertz and Goedert. I think we should also look for the debut of Jay Ajayi in his return to the midnight green. Look for Ajayi to take some of the short yardage snaps that are normally reserved for Howard as he looks to miss his second straight game. If the Eagles can get their run game going and control the clock while limiting Wilson when he has the ball it should put them in position to steal a win from the Seahawks. Go Eagles!|

Seahawks 24 – Eagles 10|
Russell Wilson was pushed out of the pocket most of the day, but the Eagles pass rush, but the rush failed to get home and the Seahawks snapped the Eagles 9 game winning streak mainly thanks to Wilson. napped Philadelphia's nine-game winning streak thanks largely to another brilliant performance by its quarterback. Wilson was 20 of 31 for 227 yards and threw touchdowns of 11 yards to Jimmy Graham, 1-yard to Tyler Lockett and the TD to McKissic after the Eagles had trimmed the lead to seven. Wentz had two costly turnovers including a fumble at the Seattle 1. The Seattle defense held the top scoring Eagles offense in check and won 24-10.|

Recap from Last Week 11’s Games.|
:-
**Eagles** |
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZgOJaP2R2U&amp;feature=onebox)|
The Eagles jumped out to a quick 10-0 lead on the Patriots in the first half, but the offense sputtered after that, despite a strong showing from the defense which held the Patriots to just 17 points. After driving down the field 95 yards and scoring a touchdown, the Eagles forgot how to run the football. The loss of RT Lane Johnson to a concussion certainly didn’t help the Eagles ability to run the ball and neither did the brief loss of Sanders in the 3rd quarter, but Doug Pederson and Mike Groh completely abandoned the run game early despite averaging over 4 yards per carry. The Patriots climbed back into the game with 3 field goals and took the lead in the 3rd with a trick play and Edleman throwing a TD pass to Dorsett. The Eagles offense continued to flounder, but had a chance late before Carson Wentz missed 3 straight passes that would have given Eagles a first down. Despite those missed, Wentz put a TD pass on a dime to Nelson Agholor only for the ball to hit him right in both hands and fall to the ground handling the Eagles the fifth loss of the season. Do make matters worse Agholor sprained his already weak confindence on the way down and has missed practice this entire week.|

**Stats to Know**|
:--|
**Defensive Backfield Coverage Stats: Targets and Yards After Catch per Reception**|
If you had to guess which of the CBs, SS, and LBs with a meaningful number of snaps for these two teams had the worst number of Targets per Reception, who would you guess it to be? If you guessed the most athletic LB the Eagles have...you’d be right. Kamu Grugier Hill has a ratio of 1 target per 1 reception (11:11) so far this season, on 102 coverage snaps, good for 309th/314 in a combined grouping. For an apt comparison, Angry Bird (Mychal Kendricks) is only 274th, allowing 1.17 targets per reception (34 targets for 29 receptions). Bradham is 271st and Wagner is 267th Best of the bunch? CB Jalen Mills (14th) Safeties Diggs &amp; McDougald are 18th and 25th.|
Now let’s switch over to YAC per Reception Which CB, S, or LB has been best between these two teams in limiting YAC per catch? Sorry, let me rephrase that. Which CB, S, or LB between these two teams has thus far--despite missing some time--has the lowest YAC/Rec total in the league? Ladies and Gentlemen...CB Jalen Mills has allowed 10 YAC on 11 receptions. S Tedric Thompson comes in as the #5 Safety or 15th overall. CB Ronald Darby comes in at 29th (15th CB). The worst offenders? S Diggs has allowed 38 YAC on 3 receptions (3rd-worst) and LB KGH is 16th-worst with 104 YAC on 11 receptions.|
 

 
**Matchups to Watch**|
:--|
**Russell Wilson vs. the Eagles Pass Rush**|
Last time these two teams faced off, the Eagles defensive line was dominating the Seattle offensive line, but their failure to get to Russell Wilson and contain him help cost them the game. Wilson torched the Eagles to the tune of throwing for 227 yards 3 TDs and a 118.7 passer rating. Wilson routinely broke contain to extend plays and wear out the Eagles defense. The Seahawks line is banged up and has struggled this season, so Graham and Cox should be able to get penetration. Wilson will be facing the same secondary, so it is going to be up Schwartz and the guys up front to scheme and keep Wilson off balance. And prevent him from taking shots down field to his group of speedy WRs. Schwartz will most likely look to spy Wilson, some possible candidates are new Eagle Gerald Avery who came to a Hybrid from the Browns and has the athleticism to go sideline to sideline and shadow Wilson. The other option, would be to have Jenkins shadow Wilson, which Schwartz has done in the past. Either way, the Eagles will need to give extra attention to Wilson and not allow him to take over the game, or else it is going to be a long day for the Eagles D.  |
**Eagles TEs vs the Seahawks safeties and LBs**|
If Mike Groh and Doug Pederson watch any film while making their game plan they will see this is a matchup they should try to exploit. The Seahawks have allowed 51 receptions for 615 yards and 4 TDs to opposing tight ends this season which is the 7th most yards given up by any team with 3 of those having played an extra game. With Alshon and Agholor questionable, look for the Eagles to leverage a lot of 12 man personnel and try to exploit this weakness with Goedert and Ertz. If Wentz can get the intermediate game going with these two, it should open up things for the running backs, both in the short passing game and the rushing attack. The key to beating this Seahawks game will be having a balanced attack and maintaining drives to give the Eagles front seven a rest from chasing Wilson all over the field. The tight end should also play a role in the redzone where the Seahawks have the 12th best redzone D. If those two can get going and provide an outlet to Wentz, the Eagles offense should be able to get going and put some points on the board.|
**Seahawks WRs vs the Eagles Secondary**|
The Eagles secondary is healthy and has looked good in the last two games against the Bears and the Patriots. While both of those teams have good number 1 options in Robinson and Edelman, their next options at WR are not at the level of the Patriots. At the same time, they don’t have the speedsters the Seahawks do to stretch the field, or a running back as strong as Carson to take some pressure off the pass rush. The Eagles DBs will be put to the test, if they can step up to the plate and take care of business like last week against the Patriots the Eagles will be in a position to win the game in the 4th quarter. One of those WRs the DBs will have to worry about will be Josh Gordon who the Eagles could have claimed off waivers after he was released by the Patriots 3 weeks ago. Gordon caught some clutch balls last week and should be a bigger part of the game plan this week coming off the bye. Another of those WRs if DK Metcalf who the Eagles could have selected in the draft instead of JJ Arceda-Whiteside. The last WR and biggest threat is Tyler Lockett who has emerged as the number one target for Wilson this season. If Schwartz is smart we will be running some cover 2 robber to prevent big plays over the top and have a man to account for Wilson. The coverage should give the corners help to prevent the big play. If the Eagles DBs can shut down the WRs and force Wilson to dump it off short, it should keep the game close and give them a chance to win.|

e09erv,1,2019-11-22,Toxic relationship with a depressed girl,bobcustard69,u_bobcustard69,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bobcustard69/comments/e09erv/toxic_relationship_with_a_depressed_girl/,"I’m [m21] in a relationship with girl [f20] with depression. It’s pretty toxic sometimes. She gets upset when I want to go hang out with my friends or family or anyone that’s not her. She says, “I should be the only one you want to be with.” 

She knows this is a problem. It ruined her last relationship and ultimately drove her ex away and it devastated her. The other day she get upset over the fact that I wanted to go hang out with my cousin that I was visiting. My gf was studying the night but she wanted me to be with her while she studied. After she got upset she said she wants to break up and that she isn’t ready for a relationship. I don’t think she is. 

But the fact that she acknowledges that it’s a problem is a good step. She told me, “I don’t want to be upset when you want to see your friends or family...but it doesn’t change the fact that I am.” 

We’ve been through a lot in our short relationship. I met her New Years of this year and started dating five months after. She moved in with me for the summer because I got corporate housing for my internship. She developed depression earlier this year and it took a lot of convincing and support for her to finally get help and get medication. 

I love her so much, but I know she’s toxic for me and she has a lot to figure out about herself...but I can’t leave her. I support her in everything. I’m there for her mental breakdowns and am there to give her her meds everyday. I know it sounds like I have a savior complex, but it’s more complicated than that. I’ve been with her through the whole journey, and I am afraid of what would happen if she doesn’t have that support system any longer. Her friends and family don’t know, so it’s just been me for the past few months. I don’t know what to do... any thoughts?"
e09nxc,6,2019-11-22,[F4A] Tough breakup: your friends can't wait to get their hands on your girlfriend.,Freeuse_Magazine,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/e09nxc/f4a_tough_breakup_your_friends_cant_wait_to_get/,"Today I'm in a weired mood - maybe its about jealousy, cuckold, betrail, or just the contrast between being loved and being used. I don't know. Just read that little prompt and get an idea. 

I'm here to chat, not to RP. Share your thoughts or experiences with me, about the text or something else.

\----------

You have been friend with them for years. Some you know from the sandbox even. You went to school together, you shared vacations together, so many great moments and memories. And than you all get older, you get your first beers, you start dating, you go through your first experiences with girls, breakups, getting drunk together to get over it, going to parties to meet new girls. It's a wild time. Then university starts, some friends leave for different cities. But in summer you hang out together, watch football, go to the lake to have grill parties, smoke some weed, talk about the world, politics, girls, and your idea for a music band or an app or what ever. 

You become adults, you start your internships, your first jobs. The first of your friends gets married, its weird, kinda cool but also threatening. But they seem happy. You start to make some money, you get a car, you see your friends on weekends mostly, you still talk like time never went by. You start dating that girl, she drives you nuts, its the best time of your life. She surprises you every time you see her. She is beautiful like an angel and has everything you ever wished for and even things you didn't know you needed until you met her. You can't believe how lucky you are, you introduce her to your friends, your are happy and proud, and your friends are happy for you. She is a great girl, they say. You keep seeing each other, but not as frequent as before. Among your friends are more and more couples now, the former gang of boys has become a mixed group. You get to know your friends girlfriends, you talk about careers, the environment, furniture. Now its wine or coffee instead of beer and booze, it's soft jazz instead of hard rock, it's moderation instead of excessive parties. Your girlfriend moves in with you, she turns your apartment upside down and you let her.

Your friends sometimes visit for dinner or to watch a game. They get along with your fiancee so well, but your fiance has been absend lately. She excuses herself and goes to bed earlier. When you come back from work she's out with her friends or already sleeping. You can't remember when she surprised you with one of her cute ideas, like she used to. Sex is slowly fading away. You bring her a necklace as a present, but she just says thanks and never wears it. You know something is wrong, but you avoid talking about it. You want to talk to your friends, but they seem so happy in their relationships, you feel ashamed of failing in yours. Life goes on, you two manage without touching the subject. Then one day you have an argument, a silly one, but it gets out of hand. Suddenly things are said that can't be taken back. You two take a break, she moves to a friend of hers. You are back at the bar, just like in the old days, you try to get over it. You call your friends, but they won't pick up. And if they do, they are busy with work, sport, family. 

Sometimes they sound agitated, like they have been jogging. Sometimes they sound ashamed, like they did something wrong. Because since your finance moved out, there wasn't one day, they haven't been at her place, finally fucking the living shit out of her. She is starved and she needs it - she doesn't care from whom. Your friends are just as unhappy in their relationships and marriages as you are, they won't miss out on this opportunity. They have been wanting to stick their dick in that big round ass for all these years you were in love with her inner values. They had been thinking about those massive tits while fucking their flat chested wifes after every of your suburban monthly dinner circles. Every time they told you what a nice girl she was, they imagined her beautiful face burried in their crotch sucking them off. They are lettting off their steam on your fiance, while you try to call them to talk like in the good old times. But your drinking buddies are to busy feeding their cocks through her pillowy lipps. They don't want to be interrupted while shooting their thick loads across your fiance's hungry mouth, that used to kiss you with so much passion. She lets them deflower her ass, they mount her in groups, while their phones ring one after the other. You still believe you can fix this relationship, once you get back on your feet. You just need a helping hand, some advice, a hug. In the meantime your fiance has been gobbling down several yards of cock per day, swallowing almost a gallon of cum in one week, burned as much calories as a marathon runner, melting down her brain and every memory of you with it. Nobody who knew her, had ever seen her so horny, moan so loudly and fucking so desperately."
e09qqo,0,2019-11-22,What to do with Internship money?,phoenixbreee,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/e09qqo/what_to_do_with_internship_money/,"I don’t know if this belongs here, but I’m doing an internship over the summer that will pay me around $1300. I don’t know what to do with the money though

What I want:
To buy either a surface 2 or MacBook Pro (what’s better)

What my parents want:
To save the money for a car so that one my last year of high school I can work to put more savings for the car, insurance, plate number, etc. 

Explanation: 
I need the laptop because I do have an HP one but it’s a little slow. My mom is telling me to just reset it but I don’t want that because after it is reseted I know they’re going to put everything that was there back. Like my mom’s stuff, it’s my computer I use it the most, but only one folder is mine. I would have more but I have to share it with my mom. I would watch movies there but it’s large and heavy, and I don’t want to carry that to the bed or to college. But then the car is also important because I don’t want to depend on anyone to go to college, I want my own car. I don’t know how to drive yet that’s another thing because I’m more focused on my SAT, I’ll learn how to drive and work next year.

So what do you guys suggest I do?"

I came our to myself on Feb this year. Ever since I started actively looking for connection and dates.

Fast forward a few months. I got an internship in the states. I started checking out guys on Grindr prior to me arrival. I find this hot guy. I hit him up thinking I am way out of his league. He tells me he thinks I am super cute too. We start talking. We start video chatting. We talk for hours and hours, for days upon days. It was too intense for me, too crazy, too good. How come someone like him exists! We keep talking. My flight date approaches. He offers to pick me up, I refuse because I am scared. I end up accepting his offer, and he does pick me up. He turns out to be very attractive and cutter in person. He takes me to brunch. Shows me town. Buys me wine, I was underage back then. We kiss, and it was the best kiss I’ve ever had. I kissed a lot of men in my life, I mean it when I say a lot, and this was the best kiss. I meet his friends. I like them and they like me. We go on a drive to drop his friends. We stop and watch the starts in the middle of nowhere and we kiss again. He tells me how much he thinks we’re hitting it off. I blush and reciprocate. We hold hands on the way back. He teaches about things in America. I teach him about things in Saudi. I sing him songs and he sings me songs in Arabic. He heads off to his hometown for a week. I stay alone. I miss him. He misses me. We text. I really miss him. It eats me from the inside out. I decide to go to NYC. I ask him to join me. He subtly refuses. I go to NYC. I can’t stop thinking of him. Every time something exciting happens I want to call him. Every time I see a gay couple holding hands I wish I was holding his. I go to a museum about his heritage. I really miss him. He tells me he can’t wait to see me and hear all about my adventure. I really get excited to fly back and catch up. I fly back. He picks me up with someone in the front seat. We didn’t talk a lot in the car. He drops me off, hugs me good night and heads off. He promises to see me tomorrow. I wait. He never called. I waited again the next day, he never called. I waited for a 5 weeks. He never texted me. I got ghosted. I get angry and cut it off. He says he was sick. I quickly back off. He promised to see me again. He never did. I fly back home weeks later. I think I forgot him. I didn’t. I never did. I sometimes still dream of him. Still think of his sweet words, smile and laugh. I still can’t get the asshole out of my system. The asshole that fucked me up without any explanation. The asshole that told me “I think we’re hitting it off” and disappeared the day after.

I text him months later for an explanation. He, surprisingly answered my texts. He said he’ll call me. He never did. I never texted him again and probably never will. 

Yet I still miss him."

EDIT: Just noticed that [Financial Samurai](https://www.financialsamurai.com/best-occupations-to-make-lots-of-money-and-retire-earlier/) posted about this thread! Thank you so much :)

EDIT: THANK YOU!!! This is officially the most upvoted post on fatFIRE :) 500+ upvotes

\*This guide is written for newer members and aspiring fatFIRE folks. Hope you find it interesting. Let me know if you have any insight on the topic.

***\*Feel free to leave a comment about a career or important points I didn't mention and I will add it to the list!***

The best way to view high-paying careers is to understand the balance between **probability** and **income potential**.

Sure, if you start the next Google or become the CEO of Goldman Sachs, you’re going to be making a ton of money.

But, becoming an extremely successful entrepreneur or CEO is a much less linear path than becoming a physician, for example.

So, a rating of careers with a reasonable balance of probability and income potential will likely be your best bet.

\*Please note, first: these are all the highest-paying careers. So, the careers in the low-income category may still earn a very high income. Second: each career is in order of risk and income potential. Third, this is just a selection. Please offer additional ideas in the comments.

**High Probability / Lower Income Potential**

*-Physician*

Assuming the current state of healthcare isn’t altered drastically, medicine (and healthcare in general, especially dentistry) is one of the highest-probability paths to an upper-level income. Physician salary ranges from $200–800k. Primary care physicians earn around $200–250k. Specialists earn a median in the 300s and surgeons often earn half a million or so. Of course, long hours, lawsuits, bureaucracy, lots of student debt, starting your career late, high stress, future governmental uncertainty etc. are major downsides, making it a bad career to choose purely for the income. Also note, the top-earning physicians earn far more, especially if they are in a lucrative surgical sub-specialty and/or have related business ventures. (Credit to r/[RyeSoSeri0us](https://www.reddit.com/user/RyeSoSeri0us/)) ""It's not uncommon to see orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, cardiothoracic, pediatric, plastic, and MOHS surgeons earning \~$1.5m per year. These salaries don't take into consideration of ownership stakes in outpatient surgery centers, or outpatient imaging centers. I know guys making an extra $150k / yr of mailbox money from their surgery center shares."" However, as discussed by a cardiothoracic surgeon &amp; neurosurgeon in the comments below, it's a bad choice if you aren't called to the job itself. Another potential fatFIRE path in healthcare besides medicine/dentistry is becoming a CRNA. Average pay is \~$160k but can be much higher in independent practice in rural areas (well into the 200s+). Generally will take 2-3+ years out of nursing undergrad.

What is takes to get in: It's a very established path: pre-med -&gt; medical school -&gt; residency -&gt; fellowship or job/private practice

\*LCOL friendly

*-Big Tech Employee*

FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), Microsoft, Salesforce, Linkedin, Oracle, Paypal, Ebay, Adobe, etc. are some of the largest tech companies. Total median compensation at the top 20-30 is about \~$200k. If you get promoted and have lots of experience, you can earn $300–500k+. Rule of thumb: $200k out of college L3, $300k full-on L4, $400k senior L5, $500k+ staff SWE. Even fresh engineers/product managers etc. at Google earn high 100s. If you can become an employee at a FAANG company, especially in engineering, product management, strategy, data science, sales, UX (as [u/lippstuh](https://www.reddit.com/u/lippstuh/) mentioned) etc. it’s a solid path towards upper-income. And you can get in straight out of college. The main thing to consider is COL (cost of living), which is very high in FAANG companies. So, your actual compensation might be a bit deceiving ($200k Google engineer in SV might be equivalent to $100k in a L/MCOL) . Finally, these are the top tech companies, so if you aren’t highly skilled, it may not be a feasible option. Also, in the long run, engineering tends to flatline vs more standard business roles (finance, biz dev, marketing, etc.) which tend to have more opportunities and less competition. Thanks to [u/snarkpowered](https://www.reddit.com/u/snarkpowered/) for the insider insights! Also, very high total comp is often deceiving and a majority is often composed of stock. Finally, this may not be a good overall representation of higher income earners because reddit definitely skews engineering-heavy. [u/princepieman](https://www.reddit.com/u/princepieman/) has a [great list of tech companies ranked by tier](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/bxa3qz/guide_for_new_readers_probability_income/eq62oz6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Tiers 1-2 should be solidly fatFIRE.

What is takes to get in: Lots of paths to Big Tech but a high-probability path might be: CS major at a ""target"" (school prestige is much less important than in finance etc. but going to a school where Big Tech companies actively recruit from absolutely helps) -&gt; engineering internship -&gt; engineering job

\*Typically (V)HCOL

\-*Various Executives (F500/Mid-Market/Non-Profit)*

Becoming an executive - whether it be at a F500 or a growing mid-market company, or a hospital or university, or even a museum or other non-profit - is likely on the lower end of higher probability. Getting into an executive position at many companies is very remunerative because you have a valuable skill set intrinsic to revenue generation. These job titles include Director, VP, C-Suite, etc. Getting into an executive (VP-level) position at a F500 typically takes 15+ years and involves the stereotypical ""climbing the corporate ladder"" which could mean engineer -&gt; MBA -&gt; senior engineer/engineering manager -&gt; IT director -&gt; VP IT -&gt; CTO. A little more surprisingly, executives at hospitals, universities, and other larger non-profits pay six or even seven-figure salaries to executives. This data is actually pretty easy to find because tax information is generally online for not-for-profits. The range of income is extremely difficult to come up with because on one hand you could have the VP of Marketing at a local construction company making $100k and you could have the CEO of Google crossing 9 figures in total compensation. Anecdotally, the CFO at a major rehab hospital in Chicago earns \~$1.5M.

What is takes to get in: Massively variable and industry/role-dependent but typically involves ""climbing the ladder"" from an entry-level position out of college and getting promoted/switching companies until you reach executive level. Following the anecdote of the hospital CFO, he earning an accounting degree at a good state school, working at a Big 4, got promoted to Senior, earned his MBA from the same school, got a CFO job right away at what looks like is a smaller healthcare company, transitioned to a larger healthcare org as CFO, and repeated the same process again. It's a really variable path and there's no one right path. I find looking at Linkedin profiles of various executives to be pretty insightful on career path/planning.

\*LCOL friendly

**Moderate Probability / Moderate Income Potential**

*-High-End/Enterprise Sales*

Sales reps who sell enterprise software (e.g. Microsoft, IBM, Google Cloud, AWS, etc.) to Fortune 1000-type companies earn a median of \~$300k. The range is between $200k-millions. A lot of reps work remotely and some in great situations have little travel and very reasonable hours. But others have constant travel, crazy hours/stress, etc. So, if you are able to become a top performer (ideally, beating quota most years), business-to-business sales is a great option. Of course, it’s a competitive environment, and you have to be good with both technical skills and understanding the product and good with people. Huge thanks to [u/pgbstacks](https://www.reddit.com/u/pgbstacks/) for the following: ""In my experience there’s three good places to be in B2B software sales and they require different skill sets. Ask yourself what you’re good at and go from there. *Small startups that are figuring out product-market fit*. You’re ideally the only salesperson and co-founders are involved in every deal. Skill set: Serious product chops, ability to play product mgmt between the customer and your R&amp;D team *Medium-size companies* growing &gt; 40% y/y and you get in before the territories have shrunk. Land the big accounts, make sure you don’t lose em and you’re set for 4-5 years or more. Skill set: you’re an athlete. The playbook is established, you know the best use cases, your best strength is hustling for every single meeting, deal, and account. This is where you can make the most imo. *The behemoths*: Oracle, IBM, MSFT, etc. Get the right install accounts and you’re good. Skill set: political savvy. Selling yourself internally is more important than externally. You have an army of resources, it’s up to you to quarterback them and keep the install acts happy. Imo the business happens here no matter who the rep is, your job is to keep everyone aligned and happy. You’re a traffic cop in a lot of cases. All three you can consistently make $200-400k/year and at the latter two can have years of $1M+."" Also, for every top rep, there are several more who burned out/couldn't hit quota. So, if you aren't very skilled, probably not the greatest choice.

Another potentially very lucrative sales option is financial wholesaling: selling financial products (mutual funds, ETFs, etc.) to financial advisors/wealth managers. While several wholesalers I know are very involved in the lives of family/friends and active in volunteering/church etc. there is definitely a very significant amount of travel involved. You typically start as an internal wholesaler ($100kish) who supports the external wholesaler ($200k on the low end to 2M+ on the very high end, $500k is typical). They are typically paid a base + a percentage (typical commission is 10 basis points, so 100mm a quarter would be 100k a quarter.). The largest concern (besides potential lifestyle issues) would probably be the future of wholesaling, especially with the rise of index funds/passive management. One external wholesaler (deleted account) on reddit claims that ""active management in fixed income remains the leader"". So the future of equities wholesaling is definitely in question. However, currently, financial wholesaling can be a very lucrative path that doesn't require the Ivy League pedigree and insane hours of investment banking etc.

Another option suggested by [u/expertatthis](https://www.reddit.com/u/expertatthis/) with very high potential is commercial real estate sales/brokerage (this is on the lower probability side). [u/Ripclaw77](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ripclaw77/) also mentioned med device sales as an alternative to tech that can also be quite lucrative.

\*Software sales: LCOL friendly once you're established in your career. Financial wholesaling/commercial real estate/med device should all be LCOL friendly.

*-High Finance*

One of the most common career paths of graduates of elite colleges is high finance: investment banking, sales &amp; trading, hedge funds, private equity, asset management, private wealth management, etc. Pay starts around $100k and increases to seven figures. A common path is target undergrad -&gt; investment banking -&gt; MBA -&gt; private equity/hedge funds etc. The career, however, is less steady/certain than other paths and requires extreme hours (up to 80+) especially in the beginning years. Also, it is extraordinarily difficult to break in from a non-elite school. However, the pay ceiling is incredibly high. If you take the traditional path and you do well, you could earn between $500k-1M/yr approximately 10 years out of college. Plus, while you probably don't think of high finance as a LCOL career, there are several target cities that (while MCOL/HCOL) are still much less expensive than the Bay Area (e.g. Chicago, Boston).

\*Not LCOL friendly

*-Professional Services (Consulting/Accounting/Law)*

*Consulting &amp; Accounting* As suggested by a commenter, highly experienced management consultants and CPAs at top firms can earn very high incomes. The median CPA earns \~$120k, which is definitely lower end for fatFIRE. However, CPAs like a) Big 4 partners b) firm owners and c) CFOs/controllers are well positioned for fatFIRE+. Tax specialists also can earn a ton (tax lawyers, controllers, VP Tax etc.) MBB consulting is often not a sustainable long-term career, but rather a good start to a career to accelerate into finance/tech etc. Tech consulting is also a potential option. No expertise in this area, so I would appreciate any comments on this field! *Law* In the past, this would have been in the first category, but today, law has an extraordinarily bi-modal salary distribution. If you’re the top of the top, you’ll be making crazy money. But an average lawyer might end up with less than six figures and lots of hours. Many (most?) lawyers do not recommend the profession and seem quite miserable. But top lawyers (e.g. BigLaw corporate lawyers) earn great money. They have a higher average income potential than medicine but a lower median. My understanding is that a lot of lawyers go from a top law school -&gt; BigLaw -&gt; in-house.

\*Generally not LCOL friendly

*-Small Business Owner*

The top 1% of America (who earn a bit under half a million per year) are predominantly composed of small to medium sized service business owner/managers. These include physician/dentist offices, accounting firms, law firms, consulting firms, engineering firms, real estate (e.g. CRE development/investing), specialty trade contractors etc. While it’s certainly a much less straightforward path than becoming a physician or engineer or even investment banker or top salesperson, but it’s doable for those with the skills, experience, patience, hard work, and connections - especially if you work on it on the side until it replaces your full time income.

\-LCOL friendly

*-Early-stage startup employee*

(Thanks to [u/ecouter](https://www.reddit.com/u/ecouter/)!) If you join an early stage startup, you generally get lower base salary compared to FAANG but your equity component has a chance of multiplying in the longer run. You can also climb the ladder more quickly at startups. Important caveat: FAANG might still pay more in absolute dollars over time compared to startup jobs unless you negotiate a large equity package as a senior employee at a startup. *More on equity* (thanks to [u/kernelcrop](https://www.reddit.com/u/kernelcrop/)) ""There’s a whole gamut of equity awards in the startup world. The optimal risk premium (IMHO) is to either join early as one of the first 20-50 employees (Series A timeframe) or join at a senior level (VP) at a preIPO company (Series C,D+). Those are the optimal ways to get to 7-8 figure exits. You could also toss in the generally belief that 2 out of 20 startups will hit a homerun (unicorn type exit), 6-8 will have a decent exit, and the rest will either fail or get acquired at a mediocre to poor multiple."" However, this may be a pretty bad combination of risk and reward. ""The problem is IPOs are rare these days. More often employees are stuck essentially working for a small company whose exit strategy is an acquisition. Often these companies are 'over valued' and the employees effectively get very little, or even wiped out equity wise when the company is finally sold. What's worse, is it can take *ages* for a company to even have a liquidation event. I've seen employees working insane hours for nearly a decade, hoping to finally cash out. Meanwhile they're getting older, having kids, and getting really burned out in general. It's not a pretty picture."" -thanks to [u/curiously\_clueless](https://www.reddit.com/u/curiously_clueless/)

\*Generally not LCOL friendly

**Low Probability / Highest Income Potential**

*-Founder/CEO*

The founder and C-Suite of giant &amp; fast-growing companies earn the most, period. But the probability is extremely low. So, generally not a recommended path for those who want a decent chance at making good money.

Hope this list is insightful - let me know in the comments!

...

**CONCLUSION: highest potential fatFIRE careers**

The following careers had the highest consensus in the comments:

1. Big Tech Employee
2. Executive Track
3. High-End Sales
4. Small Business Owner

The following careers were debated extensively in the comments:

1. Physician (all the typical concerns: debt/opportunity cost/future uncertainty/hours etc.)
2. High Finance (secular declines, terrible lifestyle/hours)
3. Professional Services (especially law/consulting because of extensive travel/hours, lower probability and not similarly high potential)
4. Startup Employee (bad risk premium)
5. Founder/CEO (not really a career, requires extensive connections etc. prior to success)

*Interestingly, the ""boring"" careers (""I'm an engineering manager at Microsoft"" ""I'm a financial controller for a manufacturing company"" ""I sell enterprise technology/ETFs"" ""I own a plumbing supply company"") tended to have a better mix of probability/potential than the traditional ""cooler"" or higher-end careers (""I'm a heart surgeon"" ""I'm an investment banker"" ""I work for McKinsey/BigLaw firm"" ""I'm in startups"" ""I'm a tech entrepreneur"").*

**WHERE TO FIND COMPENSATION DATA**

*Medicine*: MGMA reports are the gold standard for medicine. [ADA ](https://www.ada.org/en/science-research/health-policy-institute/dental-statistics/income-billing-and-other-dentistry-statistics)for private practice dentistry.

*Big Tech:* [Levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi/) and teamblind

*Various Executives:* ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer for non-profit execs, google PDFs from exec search agencies for industry-specific executive compensation ([tech example](https://advanced-hr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2017-VC-Executive-Compensation-Trend-Report.pdf)). Of course F500 top executive compensation is public online.

*Sales:* I haven't found any good reports for enterprise software sales, but [r/sales](https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/) has a lot of anecdotal data. For general progression, it goes: SDR ($50-80k) SMB AE ($80-150k) MM AE ($120-200k) Enterprise AE ($200-400k+).

*High Finance:* WSO has lots of compensation reports for high finance (investment banking, private equity, asset management, vc etc.)

*Professional Services:* [This page](https://www.caseinterview.com/consulting-salary) should be accurate for MBB consulting. [Here's a chart](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Big-Law-One-Million.png) for the BigLaw salary+bonus scale. [This Robert Half PDF](https://www.roberthalf.com/sites/default/files/documents_not_indexed/2019_Salary_Guide_Financial_US_0.pdf?utm_campaign=RH-NA-Salary_Guide-Autoresponder-Email&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_source=autoresponder&amp;utm_content=Download+the+2019+Finance+%26amp%3b+Accounting+Salary+Guide&amp;i=) looks good for accounting/corp finance salaries.

Small business owner, early-stage startup employee, and Founder/C-Suite/entrepreneur all have so much variance that it's not practical to have standardized salary reports for them.

**BONUS: Most common professions among multimillionaires/the top 1%**

According to research from Thomas Stanley's less well-known book *The Millionaire Mind* (a fascinating study of multimillionaires), these are the most common professions held by (generically) ""rich people"" with a median inflation-adjusted income of $650k and net worth of $6.4M:

1. Business owner (32% of those sampled)
2. Senior corporate executive (16%)
3. Attorney (10%)
4. Physician (9%)
5. Retirees, corporate middle managers, accountants, sales, engineers, architects, teachers, professors, housewives (remaining 1/3, includes spouses of primary income earners, thus teacher/housewife etc.)

I would assume higher representation (at least in this sub) of engineering and high finance.

Stellari states that
GGMF was not the failure Reddit thinks she was, she did fine.
She's upset people asked for her to be fired after producing K/DA, Immortal Journey, Coven, Battle Academia &amp; TD Ekko
She felt like every skin produced after was trying to ""make up"" for the GGMF (The stress that ultimately made her resign)
GGMF -HAD- brand new animations contrary to popular belief but they were restricted in how different they could be to the base.

With Stellari gone, she still believes the remaining skin team can produce amazing things but it's a shame how aggressive the constant fan bashing can get.

Natalie Pellmann, a fresh new intern over at Riot had the opportunity of producing Victorious Aatrox and we all know how that went with fans.

They tweeted about that here, and many of the replies from them are they defending them self against the negativity. https://twitter.com/foxcrusade/status/1197934720463654912"

I am a graduate from a medical school in NEPAL🇳🇵. I was highly motivated to start my preparation during my internship days but I couldn’t find a study partner. Soon my rural posting started. I studied MBBS in scholarship so had to contribute my two years of service to Nepal Government under Ministry of Education (MOE) Bond. Even during this time I couldn’t study. Soon I got married and then I started my preparation for USMLE Step 1. I was working throughout my preparation and on top of that I had a very tough time from my family. I was in hope that things will get better but it didn’t. Instead I ended up hurt and emotionally devastated. Some days I would be very happy and some days it felt like my life was worthless. My whole journey lies amidst these emotional states. And I am writing this experience today because I feel there are many girls out there who might be struggling emotionally and I want to tell you that you are brave and you can do it. Yes, You can. Because I did it. Hell Yeah.

6. Biochem – 

**Physeo** Picture Mnemonics for 

Glycogen storage diseases, lysosomal storage diseases, vitamins, genetics (syndromes) and whole metabolism chart.

Initially I didn’t like these but after 3-4 revisions during my preparation it worked wonder for me. 

**Pixorize** Picture Mnemonics for other Biochem Topics.

Biochem is volatile. I read the text FA+ Kaplan (I guess) 4-5 times in total still I needed to revise it before assessments and it was later during my preparation I found these study materials that consolidated my memory to carry enough until my Test Day.

7. **UWORLD**

14. **Anatomy Shelf Note**: all 100 points, I can’t express how important these turned out when I saw questions on real exam day. I did it 3 times.

15. **100 Cases of Medical Ethics**: Do all the 100 cases after reading text. I did this book 3 times before my test day.

16. **BRS Physio**: All we get on Step 1 is physio-based questions. I did it twice for topics I needed to clear concepts.

17. **UW Biostat Review** : These are approx. 70 prototype Biostat questions and I did this 3 times in total because biostat was my weak area. I highly recommend you do this.

**B. Preparation Experience:** 

Even before 2 months from my real exam I was very unstable. Accordingly, my concentration varied and so my performance varied. On happy days my assessments were good but on days when I had emotional outburst, I did terrible. You can see my NBMEs and UWSA fluctuating scores. But the thing was no matter what, I had to finish my NBMEs and all other resources on time. Despite my personal life I tried to achieve my daily goals. I did **NBME 11 onwards with explanations**. Each NBME assessment took me one day to solve and review their explanations from **nbmeanswers.com**, **Google**, **Facebook Groups** and **usmleforum**. For every mistake I did extensive resource review and discussion and left no stone unturned. I also used Amboss knowledge library just like Wikipedia and searched topics of confusion. **Amboss** is a great step 1 study tool. I reviewed **PubMed** and **uptodate** for confusions too. **Multiple Qbanks** helped me prepare for the real exam. I revised whatever resources I used 3-4 times before exam. I even added usmleforum and past experiences pages to my mobile home screen. Everything helped.

**C. Pre-Exam Status -**

I revised heart sounds/ECG/CT Scans/graphs and tables from FA system wise /first 3 chapters of pathoma: 2 days out.

A day before I revised my phone collections of some volatile topics /exam tutorial section from free 120/ went through all the lab values of free 120 once, had dinner, **took Zolpidem 10 mg** and went to sleep. Hopefully I got 8 hours of good sleep.

**D. My Big Day Experience -** 

I woke up at 4:45am. To exercise my mind and keep in pace I did few questions from Amboss for half an hour. Got ready for exam. I was confident and calm. Arrived at test centre an hour before.

I skipped tutorials.

1st block-5min break on table

2nd block-10 min break outside (snacks) 

3rd block-5min break on table

4th block-20min break outside (lunch)

5th block-5min break on table

6th block-5min break on table

Finally the last of the blocks, the 7th one.

During 6th and 7th block my eyes were so strained that I had to pop out my eyes on the screen to concentrate. It is very important to simulate 7-8hr exam before to improve endurance. After I came out from the test centre, I was happy. I felt I did well. But slowly as hour passed by I started remembering all those questions which I guessed or made mistake. I made almost 5+ SILLY mistakes and 10+ guesses.

After all this prep I regret doing one biostat question wrong😔. Some questions were short, two liners like NBMEs and some had very long question stem like UW.I felt like doing mix of UW and NBMEs.

I suggest girls not to wear any jewellery or socks on exam day. Take a thin sweater .They will repeatedly check your spectacles each time you go in and out. Take your Scheduling Permit and your Passport and lunchbox.

**E. My Study Partner -**

I dedicate my score report to my husband who also happens to be my study partner. If he had not been there I would have ended up in Depression. He held me when I was low and did every possible effort to keep me motivated and encouraged me throughout my journey. We had healthy discussions for every confusions. We reviewed all the resources together. He got his score report earlier and scored an amazing 256. I am so grateful to God .In this long and tedious journey he sent me a guardian angel, my husband. I love you dear if you are reading this.

**F. Regrets:** I should have started UWORLD earlier. Rest I am content. I did all the possible efforts from my side to sit for this Big Test. I was confident on the Exam Day.

**Finally**, I believe, whoever dreams this, knows the extent of hard work and dedication it demands. Good luck to all the aspirants.😇🙏"

**Royal Palace of the Golden One**

**August, 2111**

""Your majesty?""

""Hm?""

""Is it me or is the general public getting more... stupid?""

Commander Silvia and King Mario III were going over reports from the front lines of the new expansion to the Kingdom. The letters from the West were *supposed to* have detailed information about local integration, climate, best spots to build refineries, etc etc. And yet the chicken scratch that they received resembled little more than a shoddy penmanship and thought process of an elementary school student. Not that elementary school students lack certain brain capacities... but wouldn't someone from El Dorado's army be held to a higher standard?

Apparently not.

""I swear I could read the reports from lats year just fine. But now? Mario... I think we should look into this.""

It was at that moment that Marciela, the Secretary of Commerce, barged through the door with an irritated huff. ""Your majesty... I think something needs to be done about the dumbing of our nation.""

Oh boy. The fact that both Marciela *and* Roberto agreed on something made Mario's back shiver. Just how bad were things, exactly? ""What happened, Marciela?""

""I'll tell you 'what happened'!"" She waved around some rather important looking documents in his face before ~~throwing~~ depositing them across his desk. ""I ask one of the capital's primary bankers if they would be so nice as to sign their name on these revenue sheets. They were a bit busy, despite my reminder that this was official business, but they insisted that their own assistants could help me in that regard. You know, sign on his behalf while he was on a meeting or something. Fine, I agree. But when I meet these interns... my God. I thought teaching you two socialism was bad enough. But these 'bright minds of tomorrow' were intolerable! I had to spend God knows how long going over the most simple of economic models and calculations for them to believe I wasn't trying to screw over their holdings. And then... *and then* they have the nerve to sign these very important papers with an 'X'. That's it. Not their name. Just an X. I ask them what they were doing and they shrugged, saying they never learned cursive and always signed it because 'that's the way their parents did it'. Mario, I don't always hate working for you. But if we have to lead a nation of idiots and people who can't count to 10, I am going to toss myself off your ceremonial balcony where you tossed your father off almost two years ago. Goddamn it, it sounds to tempting now! You wouldn't even have to do it on the Guilded Balcony! Just toss me off some concrete favela in Libertad or San Felipe. It would be much better than this.""

She rambled on for a few minutes. Mario was content to let her run out like a wind-up toy while Commander Silvia looked on in fascination. 

Once she had finished, ran her hands through her hair, and coughed loudly once, she was a bit more calm when she spoke again. ""Right. Thank you for letting me vent.""

""Are you done?"" Asked Mario.

She rolled her eyes but nodded. ""Yes. I am done. But my point still stands. Mario... we need to do something about the children.""

""Exactly my point!"" Roberto hopped up from his seat and pointed out the window. ""So rarely is the question asked: is our children learning? And I don't think they are, your majesty.""

""Don't know if I would put it that way, but I agree with Commander Silvia."" Marciela nodded once more. ""We need to educate the next generation of citizens before it's too late. While we might enjoy the benefits of an uneducated and complacent population... we are never going to build El Dorado to a center of commerce and innovation at this rate.""

""So."" Mario looked at them. ""I suppose we should get on that. Since our Cabinet is already assembled, I suggest we take a vote on it. All those in favor say 'aye'.""

""Aye.""

""You.""

""Siilvia, maybe I should throw *you* off a roof instead of myself.""

""Boooo. Calm down, Marciela. Learn to laugh a little. Fine. Aye.""

""Very well. The ayes have it. Motion passed. Now, Marciela, if you could kindly place these financial documents back in a neat pile, we can get to discussing how we're going to invest in a fine standard of education. After all, childrens do learn when the standard is high.""

e0dru4,3,2019-11-23,There Is A Void In Me I Don't Know How To Fill,NuclearSteeze,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/e0dru4/there_is_a_void_in_me_i_dont_know_how_to_fill/,"Maybe the best way to start this is a backstory about me (sorry for the long read):

I am a 23 year old guy. I moved to the USA from India when I was 2 years old (so I am a u.s citizen and westernized in every way other than the fact that I can speak Hindi and eat Indian food more often than the average American).

I have always been a loner. I tried to be cool and make friends in elementary school but I would always get teased and bullied. It was worse in middle school. So, in high school, I became quieter. I was still teased, but not nearly as much, because I would just keep to myself, assuming nobody would want to be my friend and that I would just have to deal with it. Well, as a result, this led to me being totally socially awkward and underconfident into college as well. I should also add that this whole time I have been having a porn addiction. I went to a good Engineering college, but I had no social life (like 0 friends) the whole time and an awful GPA (literally just enough to graduate but I failed so many of my major courses. I literally barely made it). Of course, you gotta have a good GPA to get internships and to get a full time position, companies look at your experience (I had no internships other than this research thing I kinda did at the university).

So, when I graduated last May 2019 with a bachelor's, at 23, I had the following:

1) no friends
2) never been on a date or any form of intimacy with anyone 
3) I was broke and lived with my parents because I was unemployed



Obviously, I was thinking about ending it all (my professor said I should speak with the college therapists because he thought I might have depression. Maybe he was right but I never have been one to care about my mental health. I just tell myself to stop being so pitiful and deal with it). I had 0 confidence in myself for a whole 6 months as I made futile attempts searching for a job. I ate so much that I became medically obese.

Anyways, something really good happened for me recently. I got a job. A job that is damn near my dream job. Like it works in the exact industry that I have dreamed of working in since a young boy (but gave up on thinking it was just a fantasy) and it pays well (not 6 figures or anything but still pretty solid). I have been working for about a week now. It's a ton of work (more than 40 hours a week for sure) but I really enjoy it even when i get mentally exhausted. 

But here is the thing, despite having this great job, I still have this void in me. I think it is because I still don't come out of my shell. I still hate myself on some level. My team's director invited me to go out with some of the employees for happy hour and walking around downtown. I told him maybe, but I dont think I am going. I think I am just going to lay in my room being a loner as always. I just assume the worst. I have tried going out with people, but I always just end up being kind of left out because I am afraid of involving myself in anything because I never feel like I am truly welcome. 

And of course, I do want intimacy. I just think I will be one of those few people that will have to die without it (some people just go on without some things) but it makes me sad thinking about it. I do want a girlfriend, but I have never asked a girl out because I am too damn self-conscience (my body, my lack of a exciting personality). But I am a 23 year old virgin who has never kissed or dated so I feel like my ship has sailed since obviously women my age would want a a guy with experience (sure, there is that 0.001% that would be cool with it, but how on earth would I find them and, since there are so few, chances are high we might not even be compatible).

One thing I am working on is getting some hobbies. I will have to work some more to get the funds to do them, but that shouldn't be long. But here is the thing. No man is an island. I really was hoping that this lovely job would completely fill my void, but it hasn't. Because it's the weekend now, and I am back to my self-pity shit. Also the place I live in and work is a crowded downtown area, so I am just a loner in a crowd. I don't know how to build relationships, platonic or romantic, with anyone. I'm just ""cool"" to be around occasionally I guess.

Anyways, I feel like I am rambling now. So basically I want to know how to get out of my shell and stop feeling pathetic."
e0dwk4,1,2019-11-23,Stuck.,tron61,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e0dwk4/stuck/,"Hello, I’ve been in college a semester now and know my depression is back. I have an amazing family and friends and go to a great school and really have never faced any major hardships in life which makes everything so much harder because I have to put on an act for people who care so much about me. Everyone around me is working towards their degrees/ internships and most days I just have no drive for it. Anything. I’ve started to eat less in school and even lost weight, I’m just so scared of what may happen when my problems get bigger in life. The best way I can describe it to someone w/o depression is looking up from a deep hole and just seeing no light or way out (sorry if it’s cliche) If anyone else feels this way or able to give tips on how to have better days it would mean so much.

e0ee9f,22,2019-11-23,Girl Next Door - Conclusion,Kapricorn71,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/e0ee9f/girl_next_door_conclusion/,"A while later, Rihanna pulled up in her mother’s driveway as I was unloading grocery bags from my trunk. She got out and waved. I almost dropped a bag trying to be polite and wave back. She rushed over to help me. I told her I was fine, but she started grabbing bags anyway. “This is too many for you to do alone. Where’s Mr. Jeff?

I knew she wasn’t helping to be nice. “He’s not home,” I said in a tone to dash her hopes.

“He’s strong enough to do these by himself. We’re not, right?” she laughed.

“I would’ve managed, but thanks.” I led her inside and to the kitchen. We set the bags on the counter – the same counter, I remembered, that she saw Jeff and I christen. I was torn between being embarrassed and wanting to chastise her for invading our privacy.

“Are you having a party?” she unpacked some groceries.

“A small one on Friday, for some of my team at work.” I got out of my shoes and blazer.

“What do you do?”

My suspicions were way about what she was after. “I’m an operations supervisor at a bank.”

“Really? My major is finance!” she beamed.

“What do you want to do with it?” I started putting groceries away.

“Own my own consulting firm, specializing in small businesses that can’t afford a big firm or to have someone on staff. I may do some personal finance too, but that wouldn’t be my main focus.”

I was impressed, and surprised! “My major was finance, but I wasn’t as clear about what I wanted to do as you are. It was just something I was good at.”

“I have aunts who run their own businesses. Hearing what they go through with people messing up on their finances gave me the idea. Either nobody takes them serious as a business owner, or they want to charge them out the ass for services. I’ve been helping them out since I’ve been home, with what little I know so far.”

I asked her to sit on a bar stool as I finished putting the groceries away. “What kinds of things have you done?” As she answered, I realized I hadn’t given her credit. She only had two finance classes, but she talked concisely about the concepts – and even asked me some intelligent questions. Over an hour later, we ended up sitting at the table, drinking iced tea – that she refused to let me make – and wandering off the topic of finance. By the time Jeff came home, I had gotten to know Rihanna as a well-spoken, highly-focused young woman. She hugged Jeff after he kissed me, and I didn’t shoot eye-daggers at her. We all talked for a few minutes about, then she hugged me as she got ready to leave.

“Thank you so much,” she kissed my cheek.

I contained my shock, “You’re welcome, Ria.”

“I can’t wait to go to lunch!” she smiled on her way out the door.

“I didn’t initiate that hug,” he threw his hands up.

I laughed, shaking my head, “Whatever. I bet you enjoyed it though.”

“You’re going to lunch?”

“Yeah, I wanted to show her some more options in Finance, and answer some more of her questions. Vivien never went to college, so we talked about our experiences being the firsts in our families to go.”

“How’d all this happen?”

I shrugged, “It just did. She helped me bring bags in, and it went from there.”

“What was that kiss on the cheek about?” Jeff raised an eyebrow.

“I don’t know!” I laughed. “I guess she really appreciated talking to me.”

“Still think she’s after me?”

“Maybe she kissed me out of guilt for hugging you!” I laughed, “Or maybe she is after me.”

Jeff hugged me, “Or maybe she’s just a friendly girl who’s not after either of us.”

“Yeah, right.”

——

Rihanna showed up at my bank in a black business suit. I had to laugh at myself for still being a little worried after our talk that she may not dress appropriately. The heels were a bit too high, and her cleavage was out a little, but it was a nice suit. I had seen worse on so-called professionals. I gave her a tour, and introduced her to some of the people on my team, then we walked to a restaurant. She didn’t flirt with anyone one time, and she did have opportunity to. She definitely had men’s attention, but she stayed focused on our conversation, which was mostly about what I did and how I got into my position.

“How did you meet Mr. Jeff?”

“Wow! There’s a topic change for you,” I laughed.

“You seem to have this great balance. Your professional life is poppin’; your homelife is poppin’. If I’m goona be like you, I need to know how you put home together too,” she popped her fingers.

Speak of the devil, he called at that moment to tell me he was going to be at least an hour late. I asked if everything was okay, then got off the phone to finish up with Rihanna. Time was running out on my lunchtime by that point, so I gave her the short version of how I met Jeff and some of the issues we had to overcome. Back at the office, I gave her some information about the bank’s summer internship program that she could apply for next year. Even if she opened her own business, having experience at a bank would be beneficial. She kissed my cheek again before she left. I went about my day not thinking anymore about her, except when someone interrupted me to ask who she was.

On my way home, I thought about Jeff’s call. He said something had come up, but he didn’t say what – which wasn’t entirely unusual. I know it was wrong, but whenever he would feel the need to tell me he was running late, it would cross my mind that he was with another woman: his secretary, another woman in his building, Vivien, or even Rihanna. Maybe Vivien AND Rihanna? Maybe Rihanna went to his office after leaving mine. Maybe she sat on his desk and opened her legs to let him see that she hadn’t worn panties. Maybe she opened her blouse for him to suck her nipples, and then got on her knees to suck his erection. Maybe she lifted her skirt for him to bend her over the desk. “Maybe I should stop making myself wet with all these maybes,” I laughed.

I wasn’t getting wet at the thought of him with someone. I was remembering that we had done a few of these things in our younger, wilder days. I wonder how surprised he’d be if I showed up for an office-sex session. Since he was running the business, there wasn’t much danger of him being fired, which took some of the thrill out of it, but we still might be caught by someone who works for him. It had been about 10 years since I had been undressed, to some degree, in his office. As I got even more excited at the thought, I increased my speed to get home.

I stopped in the kitchen for a glass of wine, then went upstairs and undressed for a bath. If he was going to be an hour later than his normal time, I had about 2 hours to myself. I finished the glass as the tub filled and I laid out the lingerie I would have on by that time he arrived. I lit a few candles, and relaxed in the warm bubbles. I let images of our sexual highlights play in my head, as I touched myself under the water. I took my time; I rubbed my clit, and teased my nipples; I put my feet on the sides of the tub in order to slide my fingers deeper inside of me.

I remembered when we were dating and Jeff’s car was in the shop for longer than expected, so we were sharing my car. Sometimes I would drop him off at work, and sometimes he would drop me off – depending on who had to be at work first and who might need to drive somewhere during the day. He worked at an offsite facility for a big company. He found a metro park not far from the facility, and suggested we got some Firehouse Subs and eat them out there sometime. On that day I was off work, and kept the car to run errands. I called him around lunchtime and asked if he wanted that outdoor lunch today. He jumped at the offer. I picked him up, but he drove to the park without getting the subs. We passed several shelters and tables as he drove deeper into the park. He pulled up to one that no cars were parked. “You know we don’t have food, right?”

“You brought my food,” he stated, leading me to an empty table.

I immediately knew what he was hinting at, “Stop playing.”

“Playing? You wore that sexy-ass sundress, and you think I’m playing?”

I did put it on with the idea of being eye candy for him. It was black and yellow, and came to my thighs. Sundresses drove him crazy. From the time we started dating, there wasn’t a time that I wore one that he didn’t fuck me in it. I figured this time would be different, since we were eating out, but I was wrong – and I could accept that.

We sat on the bench of a stone table, facing each other. He had his hand on my thigh, while leaning in to kiss me. His kisses always got me wet, that time included. He inched my dress up slowly, building my anticipation. His other hand slid the strap off my shoulder and pulled that side of the top down to rub my nipple. I rarely wore a bra with my sundresses, and that probably added to his reaction to them – lol.

I heard a car drive past the area. I know Jeff heard it too, but he didn’t stop. I watched to see if they parked, but it turned around and kept going. Jeff’s right hand was twirling my nipple, and his left hand had reached my damp pussy. He moved his thumb up and down, and I couldn’t help pressing my tongue into his mouth farther.

He broke the kiss and told me to take them off. I saw a few people walking on nearby trails, but not really close to us. I stood up a little and pulled my wet panties off. He took them from me and licked the crotch while looking at me. “That’s the appetizer.”

“You have to be back in less than 45 minutes, y’know?”

“Then sit down and let me eat my lunch.”

I sat on the table with my feet on the bench on either side of him, and he lifted my dress. He positioned my ass on the edge of the table so he could get his mouth on my pussy. I pulled my dress over his head, thinking if someone came I could just sit up and act normal. But Jeff had an expert tongue, and soon I was leaning back on my elbows twisting my still exposed nipple. I couldn’t keep my eyes open to watch, and by the time I was cumming they were squeezed shut. Having that orgasm out in nature was incredible!

When I opened my eyes, a car had parked by ours, and a couple and two other single people were walking on the path. I quickly pushed his head out, and tried to act normal.

“I ain’t done!”

“You see these people around us?”

He scoffed, “So? I’m eating my lunch!”

I stood up and stepped off the bench, “You crazy.”

He got up and took my hand. We got on the path, passing some of the people I had seen, then went off of it. We went back through some trees, then he pushed me against one. Before I could ask what he was doing, he pulled my hips back and flipped my dress up.

“Jeff, wait, we aren’t that far off the path! What if . . . ”

“You shoulda thought about that before you wore that dress!”

He pushed his hard dick in my pussy, silencing my protests. His strokes were intense, and I gripped the tree to maintain my balance. Again I tried to keep my eyes open, but to no avail. I ended up bending over to push my ass out more. That wasn’t my first outdoor sex, but it was my first daytime outdoor sex – and it felt grrrrreat!

I remembered straightening my dress and going back to the path. The couple I saw before passed us, with big smiles on their faces as they spoke. And, back at the table Jeff ate me on, a man I saw earlier was sitting there, holding a newspaper on his lap as we passed. Soon after we got to my car and pulled away, and park ranger came speeding down to where we were. Jeff accelerated our exit from the park, as I kept a watch behind us. I was scared as hell! When we were clear we laughed hard about the situation on the way back his job – having forgot all about the subs.

The other time I thought about was when I picked him up a little late from his job. I called to tell him I was in the parking lot, and he told me to come in. Everyone was gone from his area of the building, but the building itself was far from empty. I got to his office, and he was sitting in his chair with his back to his desk. When I asked if he was ready to go, he told me to close the door and sit down.

“You’re not ready to go?”

“I said, close the door and sit down,” he added bass to his voice.

I glared at his head, “What’s wrong with you?”

He turned around, “If you want to keep your job, you will do as I say.”

The lightbulb came on in my head. I closed the door and sat down.

“We must be able to count on our employees; to know they are dependable.”

“Yes sir.”

“So why were you late?”

I told him about how I got caught up at work before I left, and how traffic was slow.

He leaned back, “Are you dependable?”

“I’ve not been late before, sir.”

“But we can’t have this start a trend.”

“It won’t.”

“You’ve put a question in my mind as to whether you are company material.”

“I am.”

“Remove your clothing.”

That shocked me. “Jeff?”

He leaned forward, “Excuse me? Are we that familiar now?”

“Um, no. No sir.”

He got a ruler from his desk, “Undress.”

I remembered his area was empty, and continued playing along. I removed my top, then my slacks.

Jeff got up and walked around his desk to me. I felt the ruler on my back and thighs. “I said, everything.”

I broke character again, and laghed a little, “Ok. Jeff.” He whacked my butt with the ruler. A few seconds later, he whacked my butt again. The sting of the second whack kind of flipped a switch in me. I pulled my panties down, noticing a wetspot. Jeff put his hand on my back when I tried to straighten up. I put my hands on his desk to brace myself for his dick.

WHACK – the strike was quick, sharp, and right on the same spot as the last one. I jumped away and yelped. “What the hell?!?!”

“Turn back around like I had you!”

The shock wore off, and I went back to playing along.

WHACK – “What time were you suppose to be here?”

“Five, sir,” I gulped.

WHACK – “And what time did you get here?”

“Five-thirty.”

WHACK – “Five thirty-seven.”

“Five thirty-seven,” I danced on my toes.

WHACK – “I should give you a swat for each minute late, but I’ll cut you a break this time. I’ll give you half that.

“Thank you, sir.” Jeff had given me playful slaps on my ass before, and of course while fucking me doggie style, but this was way different – and my pussy was responding. Each whack sent a jolt to my clit, and I felt a trickle going down my thigh.

“That was five, so you have about 10 more, and you’re going to count them off or I will start over.”

My mind was spinning that Jeff was showing this new side of himself, and I gave a shaky, “Yesss.”

“Spread your feet farther.”

I moved my feet out more and felt my swelling lips separate. I braced myself for the whacks to begin, but felt Jeff fingers slide across my pussy from behind instead. “Ohhhhhhhhhh,” I trembled. Silently and slowly he rubbed. When I looked down, I could see his coated fingertips appear and disappear as they massaged my pussy and teased my clit. He didn’t speed up and he didn’t rub harder, and I was eventually begging for him to make me cum. Being on that edge got to be torture.

He laughed, and asked if I would be late again.

“No!”

He stopped rubbing me, and put his fingers to my mouth. I sucked them without hesitation. He removed them, then I heard his pants open and drop. A moment later, my pussy was welcoming Jeff’s dick. With his first few strokes, he unfastened my bra. I quickly pulled it off my shoulders and let it fall wherever. His hands enveloped my tits and he leaned over to nibble my ear.

I had a fantastic orgasm on his dick at that very moment. He pushed me flat to the desk when it was over. He kept one hand on my neck and smacked my ass with the other as he found a strong steady rhythm. The desk being right at my hips prevented me from going forward with his thrusts, so my pussy took his full force. I had another orgasm that he ploughed thru, then another one with him.

He let go of my neck but stayed inside me until he caught his breath. He took a step back, and turned me to face him when I stood up. “My car is ready,” he kissed me.

“Oh, so this was about you not needing me anymore, huh?”

“More of a ‘Thank you’.”

I wrapped my arms around his neck, “You are very welcome!”

The release in the tub felt exquisite, but it was only a pacifier until Jeff got home.

I dried off as I went into the bedroom for my lotion. I jumped out of my skin when I noticed Rihanna, “OH SHIT!!!” I fumbled to cover myself with my towel, “What the hell are you doing here?!?”

“The door was left open – your garage door. I came inside to make sure everything was okay!” she nervously explained.

“Did you call the police?”

“No.”

That didn’t strike me as a logical response. “What if I were a burglar, then? You came in by yourself, without calling the police?”

“I didn’t think a burglar would be using your bathroom!”

I calmed down enough to process that something else didn’t make sense. “Didn’t you see my car in the garage?”

“Yeah, but-”

“Actually you saw Jeff’s car in the garage. He took my car to get the oil changed this morning.”

“I saw the car, but-”

My anger grew, “Why would you come in, without the police, when you saw his car?”

“I was going to let one of you know it was open!”

“No, not one of us – Jeff! You thought Jeff was in here!”

She shook her head, “No, I didn’t!”

As my nerves settled even more, I noticed she had on a lingerie set of *mine*, “And what the fuck are you doing in my clothes?!?”

“I-I-I really liked what you had on the bed, and just wanted to see what else you had,” she scrambled.

This heifer was going to catch the beatdown of her life! I moved toward her, “First of all, what lingerie I have is none of your damn business! Second, that don’t explain why you put on some other woman’s lingerie!”

“I wanted to see how I’d look.”

“For Jeff?”

“NO!”

“You wanted Jeff to see how you looked in it!”

“I thought it was nice! I’m sorry!”

“Not yet you aren’t!” I got close enough to hit her, “Your fast ass came in here because you thought I was Jeff in there!”

She backed up, “I swear I didn’t!”

“And you put on my shit to show off your body to my husband! I got my fist ready to knock her head clean off, “You and your hot-pants momma have been after Jeff ever since we moved in! And you thought this was your big chance to fuck him, didn’t you?!”

“Not him – YOU!” she cowered with her back pressed against the wall.

I got right to her face, “You have the nerve to try to fuck *my* husband, in *my* bed, in *my* lingerie?!?”

Rihanna partially shielded herself from my impending swing, “I did this for you!”

“What?!?”

“I knew it wasn’t Mr. Jeff who came home. I was there when he called you, remember? I’m dressed like this for you!”

I shook my head to clear the fog that was setting in, “Wait. What?”

She cupped my face in her hands, and took advantage of my paralysis to kiss my lips. “Mr. Jeff is handsome, but you turn me on.” The fear I saw in her moments ago changed to a kind of confidence.

“Rihanna,” I said through my shock.

“You are beautiful to me, and you’ve been on my mind constantly.” She moved her hands from my face to my arms, then back to my ass. “You never seemed to like me, until that day we had tea. I wished I could have kissed you then,” she kissed me again.

“Rihanna.”

“Yes?” she said loosening my towel. It fell to the ground. My protest got caught in my throat. I was mute and immobile, and nude in front of this girl. She brought her hands up and brushed her thumbs across my hard nipples. “I can’t tell you how long I wanted to do this,” she leaned over and kissed them.

My eyes rolled up in my head, and I put my hands on her shoulders to keep my balance. Jeff’s hands and mouth had a power to them, and I love it – I absolutely love feeling that power. However, Rihanna’s hands had an indescribable softness that I’d never felt before. She moved her hands from my breasts to my back, then down over my hips. My head was swimming with conflicting thoughts. I couldn’t even formulate how to ask her to stop or slow down. My mouth was open, but only soft moans were coming out.

“Lay down,” she whispered after sucking my earlobe for a minute.

I was finally able to clear my throat, “Rihanna…”

“Laydown, please.”

“…this is…”

She shushed me, “You need lotion, right?” She guided me back until I was on the bed. She crawled on top of me, kissing her way up from my belly button. I mustered the strength to stop her at my lips, “I’m married; I can’t do this.”

“What are you doing, besides laying there?” she kissed my neck and shoulders.

“I can’t even do that. I’m not lesbian or bisexual.”

“I didn’t ask you to be. Just let me do this,” she kissed my nipple.

“I don’t want you to do that.”

She put her hand between my legs, then showed me how wet her fingers were, “Not only did you part your legs to let me do that just now, but look at what’s down there.”

I hadn’t realized I opened my legs, but I knew she didn’t force them open. As far as the wetness, I thought to explain that I had been thinking a lot about Jeff, but I just stuttered.

“Just let me, please,” she kissed more of my body. “I want to do this,” she moved back up to my neck. “I want to.”

As loud as my mind was screaming for me to reject her, I couldn’t say no. My body’s responses felt incredible! Her kisses were setting off firecrackers inside of me. When I closed my eyes I could see bursts of colors with each one. The heat from her touches were radiating out in waves through me. She had my whole body at a peak.

She shifted so she could hold my face again, and kissed me deep. There was no resistance I could put up. A woman was French kissing me – period. A younger woman at that! She broke the kiss, and moved back to my neck and shoulders, “May I?”

I couldn’t answer.

She back down. With her hands on my hips as she sucked my nipples, “May I?”

I didn’t answer.

Rihanna went down farther, easily pushing my legs open, and moved her face between my thighs, “Pretty please?”

“Ohh, YESSSS!”

She kissed, and she licked, and she sucked, and I damn-near tore a hole in the bed spread. She would bring me to the edge, then pull back, then bring me to the edge again, then pull back, then bring me back to the edge, just to pull back again. I was squirming all over the bed, but she never lost contact with my pussy. I lifted my head once to tell her I couldn’t take it, but I caught the sight of her lightened and highlighted hair between my raised legs. I had never seen a woman’s head between my legs, and it sent a charge through me. I put my head back to the bed, and covered my face as my deep, scream echoed off the walls.

She had been rubbing and squeezing my breasts, but moved her hands to mine. On reflex, I immediately gripped them tight. “Are you ready,” she asked.

“For anything!” I groaned.

She started to do something with her tongue that felt out of this world! She got more and more intense with it, and so did my reaction. My hips were bouncing off the bed and against her mouth as I started cumming. At the height of it, she sat back and slid her middle fingers in my. She moved them rapidly, until I heard and felt this release of liquid.

“What the hell?!?!” I said as my body pulsed and jerked. I tried to close my legs, but I wasn’t in control of them.

“Relax; it’s all good,” Rihanna squeezed my hand.

“What are you doing?!?!?”

“I’m watching the best show on earth!”

She sped her fingers up again, and my body floated until there was another liquid release.

“That’s it, mama,” she hummed.

The orgasms just rolled and rolled through me as she caressed my pussy and clit. My legs were shaking, and I dug my toes into the spread in a pointless attempt to regain some control. After what seemed like an hour, the orgasm trailed off. When the last of it rolled through me, I pulled my hand from hers and rolled to my side.

“What the hell was that,” I asked still out of breath.

“You squirted,” she giggled.

“I don’t squirt!”

“Well, you sure did just now. Made a big mess too!”

I raised my head to see that I had migrated from the side of the bed up to the opposite corner, and that there was a trail of wetness like someone had spilled a drink. “That’s from me?!?”

“All you,” she smiled. “Thank you.”

I laid my head back down, “For what?”

Rihanna laid down facing me, “For letting me live my fantasy. I’ve had a crush on you ever since I saw you and Mr. Jeff in the kitchen.”

I covered my face in embarrassment.

She ran her hand along my side, “The memory of how much you liked what he did, and how satisfied you looked afterward, has never left me. I wanted to give that to you all this time; and now I have. You allowed me to, and I thank you.”

“You can’t be serious.”

Her fingers found my nipple, “I’m totally serious.” She pressed me lay back, and kissed me as her hand went to my pussy.

I kissed her back as she made me cum again, this time with my hand on her as she rubbed.

“Get up; I’ll change your sheets,” she said getting off the bed when I recovered.

Too worn out to argue, I got to my feet – causing an aftershock. I sat back down, and waited until my legs stopped trembling. I got up, and tossed her a set of sheets from the linen closet.

I watched her strip the bed, while still in my lingerie. I went to the bathroom and took a quick shower, being very careful of the pressure I applied to cleaning between my legs. I was still incredibly sensitive down there. Rihanna was gone by the time I came out. I sat on the bed wondering what the hell I had just done, and what I was going to do. Jeff was due home any minute.

e0f1v7,1,2019-11-23,"DAE, deal with the 'Bestfriend' vs the 'Brotherbond' with friends during life and a wedding?",Polojames123,DoesAnybodyElse,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/e0f1v7/dae_deal_with_the_bestfriend_vs_the_brotherbond/," (Apologies for it being long, but I had to clarify it, so you guys could answer with your own experiences, etc.

TL:DR There is always a fight between a Best friend(from home) and a ""Brother bond"" from a best friend you met through trials and tribulations in life, which is more close?.)

So, a friend of mine was dealing with this due to his 'wedding' coming up in a year, and we were discussing his 'podium' and who he'd have up there. It went through with his actual brothers, to his best friends (guys from his town, high school) to his college teammates (football, sports etc...) and then the conversation turned into our thoughts on the ""Brotherbond"" vs the ""Best friend"", and how they interact.

I'd love your guy's thoughts on this, and if we're spot on, on how for him to decide this.

If you want any friendship that is more than a few 'we went out, blah blah' never talk to that person again, scenario.

You have to go through a 'journey' with someone to build a close, brother type bond(not a best friend bond, but a brother bond... Brother bonds are stronger than a 'best friend' bond.

A Best friend Bond- You like the same things, you tell secrets, but you don't tell 'everything' usually they don't see you at your worst, you grew up with each other from elementary, but you really didn't go through 'much' together, but held on due to having to have a person from your 'town' or area etc... The glue that holds it together is mainly ''time and geography'. You met while young (usually in elementary, maybe junior high, sometimes high school), and you both were friends since you happened to live next to each other, same place, etc... But due to that, your best friend you never truly let see you in a 'bad light'. You'll tell them 'last' if you're homeless. They'd be the 'last one' you told before you got evicted, in a last-ditch effort for 'help', and you have to hold up 'appearances' for them.

They usually know your family, brothers, sisters, maybe cousins... They're in your community, and you've always been, 'mates', so everyone expects you to stay that way.. Despite changing, or time, you try to 'hang on' to how it was then, or how it is... since you feel an obligation, or an imposition to do so. Which isn't a bad thing, but do to that... You just kinda 'watch each other' grow up, but don't necessarily 'help each other'. You're friends, but 'rivals' kind of like ""Ken and Ryu"" in Streetfighter 2, or 'Sasuke and Naruto"", etc... You have love for them, but you're competing, or they are with you, even if you don't realize it (a close, best friend, revealed this to me a year or so ago, shocked me, but such is life), there is no malice behind it. But the ""best friend"" bond is conditional. It always is, there are things that you do, they'll 'cut you out' for, that are doing drugs, or anything that is looked down upon in the society, area, cultural neighborhood you grew up in (This is mainly for America, Canada, and UK Europe, I'm referring to).

You care about them, but like your parents, or your 'sister' or your 'cousins' they never will know the 'true you', since you're scared they'd judge you, or blab it out, etc... So, you love them, but the love is more due to needing a reminder of your 'past' of how you grew up, from a sprout into a tree, and many times, you would like to have your 'brother bond' on your wedding podium, but out of 'obligation and guilt' you place your 'best friend' on that podium... during your wedding.

""BrotherBond""-(Not your actual brother(same mom and dad), but a friend that became a 'brother' in life)- You went through some 'ill shit' together, that tested you, and them. But you held on to each other, saw them sweat, cry, go through heck and manage, and you stayed friends. They looked weak in front of you, you didn't judge. There are things that you two do, or say, that no one gets, or understands, but who cares? You and your brother know what's up. You can lose touch, not talk to each other for a while, and you don't think the worst, you don't feel any 'agitation' that the friendship is lost, you just 'worry' about the person, as a brother does.

Your 'Brotherbond' friend, most of your friends hear 'murmurs' of them, you speak about him, he's the 'wild guy' or the 'loyal friend' you talk about, but they're always traveling... Random text here, some jokes in-between you there, and you want them right next to you.. But usually you met them away from your home(when you were in the army, or university, or college sports team, or fraternity, or in another country you were working at, etc..), so it's kind of 'tragic' but you'll never be as it 'was' those few years you spent in Beirut or playing college football, or being in a fraternity... They saw you 'grow' into the man you became, but unlike your 'best friend' they were 'there' physically to see the process, to challenge the ideals, and to make you question the very ethics you were raised with. They were the first friend you had, that you could argue politics, perspectives, races, ideals, and you actually listened. In fact, those engaging conversations made you go, ""Woah, never thought of it that way"", as you did to him...

He's the friend that gets you to do the 'stupid sh\*t' you'd never do in front of your friends from home... Losing a bet, having to streak naked, or having to wear panties at a pub(I played Rugby, this happens), or making you make a fool out of yourself, and you don't care. Since you can feel in the aura, 'that's my mate, that's my bloke, that's my homie"" and you know, there is no malice in his teasing. It's just the fact that he understands you, and makes fun of you, since he 'cares about you' and it feels like a beloved uncle, teasing his nephew... You'll let your uncle take the 'piss' out of yah, since you know,, he's going to be the one to sneak you an extra piece of cake without your mom looking. That's what the ""Brother bond"" feels like.

You have inside jokes, and phrases, and innuendo's that people just don't understand or get, but regardless, you're both gonna adhere to them. Whether it's a sac tap in a bar, or him tackling you into a bush(Think Jackass, or a stupid tradition where he shoots a corkscrew into your balls for New Years, that refers to a stupid bet you made on the RedHawks, if they scored the next goal, while being drunk on a couch together, drinking a handle between yah both, since ""Well, be a man about it, I can drink more than you"", scenario, and this happened over 9 years ago, and he still does it...

On your birthday, everyone else gives you gifts, or well wishes, the ""BrotherBond"" he sends you a picture of a paddle and how many ""swats"" you're getting, as he sends laughing emoji's and ""Dazed and Confused Meme's"" to you, or he taunts you with how many shots, or drinks you're going to drink, regardless of your wife, or other friends being there, and he's making jokes and calling you a 'pussy' in anticipation of him coming to visit for the 'event'.. I mean, you always just laughing to yourself about it. You think in yourself, ""Well, everyone else is giving you cards, money, presents, well thought out, and this guy is talking of humiliating you, going to give you some form of pain, or manhood, crap, or making you drink to enormous amounts, so he can convince you to do something stupid, and you think he's one of the 'best guys in the world, since he remembered"", funny huh?

That's the ""BrotherBond"", he's seen you break down and cry, and blubber about the stupidest things... Never told a soul. You know if you tell him any personal secret, it's like throwing a key down a deep well, in some random drunken cave in Ireland, with Irish builders, so they don't even remember where the lights are, due to being drunk, and no one will find that key, not ever... good as a fossil. So, you tell them everything... About your fears, your goals, your wife, your friends, and he sits there, like Sil to Tony Soprano, as your ""Consigulari"", just meeting out advice, and offense for you, doing what he can to help your win...That's that ""Brother Bond"".

He can get you to do anything stupid, and he can entice you to do something humiliating with ""Two words"", It'll either be the name of your college times, frat, or military unit, Rugby Championship, some random 'basketball game' where you played and beat your rivals, or some drunken night where you both got in a fight, that was the first 'man fight' of your lives, no stop, no principals, no ""stop it"", it was ""if we fall, we might be stomped to death fight"", where you felt the blood your hearts, and felt like Mel Gibson in ""Braveheart"" war paint and all, screaming to the heavens, ""FREEEEDDOOOMMMMMMMMMM!!!!"", that's the BrotherBond.

You then go one, meet your girlfriend(or boyfriend, we're progressive here, haha), and she always 'hears' about this friend, see's the texts, etc... and you hope she likes him, since she thinks that, If I don't like him, he's not going to hang out with him anymore"", but the girlfriend doesn't realize, that if your ""Brotherbond"" doesn't give the green light on her to stay with you, she's the one that is packing her bags... I mean, he's your ""Consigulari"" he's seen you at your worst, he gets your personality, and his opinion is close to akin to your own dad's or grandfathers (men you revere and respect in life) or mentor.... gonna be gone'.

She (the girlfriend) realizes after meeting him, that she's not jealous of him...(his time, etc..) since she learns quick,, that ""Brotherbond"" wants the best for him... won't let him cheat, holds him to standards, and it's just like an actual 'brother', and when has a girlfriend been jealous of a guys family, hanging out with him? She'll roll her eyes, call you guys ""stupid"", but will allow you to continue the friendship undisturbed, since she realizes (a smart girl, that gets it), he's just his 'brother' and they bonded, wayyyyy before he met me.... I'm not gonna come at this, since, if I do, we'll have problems, and the ""Brotherbond"" he's on my side... since we both 'know him the best', is what she'll do... Same as the parents.

The other 'home town friends' and 'best friend', don't get it. They'll see the Brotherbond in action, and wonder, 'Hey, he's talking to him like that? What?"" or ""He's slapping him on the ass at this party? What an asshole."" or ""Why is he letting that guy do that or say that, etc.."" or they'll notice, to their chagrin, they've been friends with you, since age 6-11, all through high school, well into your early 30's, and this 'random guy' they heard about, or saw maybe 'once a year' that came to see you, is closer to you, than they'll ever be.... and it'll dawn on them.. ""Wow... I'm not as good of a friend with Jimmy, as I thought I was"", which isn't their fault.. The best friend will go two ways, either 'embrace it' to make a 'Tri-force' like link, or denounce it to 'one up the brother bond' and they'll beef, off and on, forever... But smart Bestfriends go for ""Tri-force"" and smart ""Brotherbonds"" let the best friend know, that they aren't going to impede on, or trample on their previous friendship, and then they'll try and be friends with the 'best friend too' and create a friendship, outside of the main friend they met through, to keep the peace, and to have more adventures...

That's the brother bond. They may not be next to you on the podium of your wedding, but if you ever needed them, you know, they'd smuggle your fatass to Mexico etc... that's the brother bond... Not an everyday friend, but a for life friend)

If you want those type of bonds, you need to do shit with people, competition, a sport, or a really hard 'business' thing, where you start from scratch, that's the only way that happens... Trust me, making friends that mean something after age 23 is nearly impossible unless you're in a medical school, law school, or start as an intern fresh out of college at some crazy high-end industry.. outside of that, you're SOL.

So which do you have? Which is more important to you?

Which friends in your life encompasses these things?

Why Is it important or not for men to have this?

Who did you have on your own wedding podium?

Have you dealt with these two best or lose friend types?

How did you navigate? Who are they in your life? What happened?"
e0f94a,51,2019-11-23,I feel too self-aware to have an eating disorder,FauxKinkajou,fuckeatingdisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/e0f94a/i_feel_too_selfaware_to_have_an_eating_disorder/,"I don't really know how to start this. I might have an eating disorder.

I remember around the age of 11 I was upstairs at my grandparents house watching my 14 year old brother play games on the computer. At some point while I was watching him, he found an image of a person who I guess at the time was considered the person with the highest ever recorded weight. He sent the picture in an email to my mom with a subject line that was something along the lines of ""don't show this to \[my name\]"". There may have been text in the body of the email, too. But it was clear that it was kind of mocking the fact that I had gained weight when I got into middle school.

Another memory from 6th grade. I was walking down a hallway at school when I noticed that my favorite shirt was starting to get tight on me. At that point, I was probably higher end of the normal BMI range, maybe slightly overweight. But I felt so self-conscious and hated my body. I was incredibly uncomfortable about my weight all throughout middle school. I never took off my clothes in our PE locker room at school. I hated that people saw my body and was scared to take off my clothes. I hated being the fat friend. I don't remember being bullied about my weight by peers, but I felt like I internalized the bullying that I expected to receive. I bullied myself in my head a lot.

At some point I started gaining a lot more weight. I would eat lots of food late at night, especially over the summer when I could stay up late and not really worry about school the next day. I would eat an entire frozen pizza by myself. I was also pretty sedentary. I gained a lot of weight and by the beginning of high school I was morbidly obese. I don't know my height but at the time I was definitely an inch or two shorter than my mom, so I estimate my BMI was around 37-38.

At one point my dad sat me down and gave me a talk about my weight issues. He talked about how he had weight issues growing up but was never as heavy as I was. I don't remember the rest of the conversation but that's stuck with me forever. My dad wasn't mean to me in the conversation, I think he just didn't know how to handle it tactfully.

Things kind of went the same for a few years. At the beginning of my junior year of high school, I was in a class that had a bunch of iPads that we got to use every class. We were supposed to use them for research, note-taking, all that jazz... but I used my iPad time to look at dieting information online, and pictures of people who'd lost a lot of weight. After I saw that stuff, I decided that I was going to start a diet so I could lose weight. 

I decided to do the keto diet but didn't tell anybody that I was starting it. I was able to hide the fact that I was doing it from my family for a few weeks, but then we went out to eat dinner and I couldn't eat the bread on my sandwich and my mom found out that I was dieting. I don't know why I didn't just tell her I was dieting upfront when I started. I guess I felt kind of embarrassed that I even had to diet in the first place..?

So, I was doing the keto diet and lost maybe 20 lbs in the first month. And I don't really know when I did it, but I think at some point I started counting calories. I don't really remember all that well. I lost about 40 lbs in 3 months, and then I stopped dieting. I gained about 10 lbs back over the course of the following Spring semester. I stayed at that weight until the following August. 

My family was on a road trip coming home from another state. We had stopped at a rest stop and I was hungry so I went through the snacks that we had in the car. Everyone else was in the bathroom inside, so I was alone in the car just browsing on my phone and about to eat a cheese stick. I think while we had been driving for the past few hours I had my phone with me and I was reading (don't judge me please) pro ana type stuff on Tumblr and Reddit and other websites. Anyways, I I remember holding the cheese stick in my hand and deciding that I wasn't going to eat it.

So, I started dieting and I told my parents that I was going on the keto diet again. I lost 40 lbs in 3 months again. Both times that I dieted people would compliment me constantly and act completely shocked when they saw me (in a good way). I had been obese for so long and during the second round of dieting, I was finally in the normal BMI range. I didn't get to a super low weight, but one time my mom's friend was saying hi to me and then dead serious she said something like: ""You've lost a lot of weight, you need to stop now."" And that freaked me out a lot because she was so stern when she said it and I'd never heard her like that. I kind of got scared that she thought I had an eating disorder and so I decided to stop dieting so that she and my mom wouldn't be suspicious.

Also I guess I should mention that during the second time I was dieting I was spending a lot of time at night reading weight loss tips on eating disorder blogs. And also reading a lot of informational stuff about eating disorders like on health websites and stuff. I was using eating disorder symptoms to lose weight but I was doing it deliberately so I didn't think that it could be a real eating disorder. Like, rationally I knew that eating disorder = bad. But I was conscious of the fact that I was just using eating disorder stuff as a weight loss tool, so it wasn't a genuine eating disorder.

A few years later I was in college. My brother got diagnosed with cancer and died three months later. A month after that, his girlfriend (who my family was incredibly close with) and my mom decided to start going on runs together. And they were also trying to eat healthier, so I decided to diet again too. I didn't really do it out of a weight concern, I felt like it was more a competitive thing. I wanted to lose the most weight, the fastest, almost like I was showing off. Because I'd gotten a lot of positive feedback in the past and everyone knew that I was really good at weight loss (even though I felt guilty about lying to everyone that it was the keto diet; I kind of followed the keto rules, but I was mostly restricting calories).

So another year passed and I gained about 20 lbs back. When I was about to hit the overweight BMI range I decided to lose weight again. That was near the end of my junior year of college. I tried desperately to lose weight, but whenever I would restrict like I used to, I would always cave in and eat something the next day. I was stuck like that for the entire Spring semester and throughout the summer.

Over the summer I was still living in my college town and doing an internship. There was a restaurant near my house that I was addicted to. It was super, super heavy food that I always felt super guilty eating. I would restrict and restrict until I couldn't stop thinking about anything but that restaurant, so I would go there and get a huge meal, take it back to my house and eat half of it. For most of the summer I would just eat half and then give away the leftover to friends so that I wouldn't eat anymore. I don't remember when I started doing it but I eventually was eating it and then would make myself throw up. I would do that once or twice a week for about 2 months.

In the Fall semester of my senior year I was able to restrict without having to throw up, and lost about 40 lbs over the course of 4 months. I ended up just barely crossing the threshold into being underweight, but I didn't stay there. When I was at my lowest weight it was near the holidays and I was home with my family and my mom seemed to clearly know that I was being weird about my weight, and whenever she'd hug me she'd run her fingers on my shoulder blade, or my ribs, or whatever part of my body and then she'd say ""you're skin and bones"". But I didn't really feel that I was actually skinny because my stomach was still flabby (partly because I have loose skin from when I was heavier). I know that body dysmorphia is a symptom of EDs but I legitimately looked normal. I gained back 30 lbs over the next 6 or 7 months.

And over the past 2.5 months I've kind of been restricting again. I wouldn't eat breakfast most days, and I would sometimes skip lunch, and then I would eat a weird, chaotic dinner (e.g. 5 tortillas, some tomato sauce, and soup, or whatever weird combo of food I had in my pantry). I started because I was trying to lose weight, with the plan to gain it back so that I could weight cycle. I'm a trans girl, and I'd read that weight cycling is good once you're on estrogen to help redistribute body fat. I've also been feeling really negative thoughts about my eating patterns and spending *hours* every day poring over eating disorder recovery stuff online. 

Right now I'm eating normally but I'm torn. On the one hand, my rational brain is thinking: if I read this as somebody else's story, I'd 100% think that they had an eating disorder. But because it's my story, I have some kind of mental blockade. Like, I know how much intentional effort I spent on losing weight, and because of that I feel like this couldn't be a real eating disorder. Because I wanted to lose weight, and I did it deliberately. If I had an eating disorder, I feel like it would somehow be different...or more clear? I am completely lost.

If you read all of this, thank you for listening. I know I should probably go talk to a therapist, but I have a fear that they'll think I'm making this up. What do I do?"

Me (22F) and “Mark” (21M) we have been together for 4 years. Last year I was given the opportunity to do an internship abroad in the field that I'm currently studying for. Apart from being great for my future career opportunities, this was a huge deal for me, a very shy and not at all confident person. I was ecstatic that somebody recognized my talents and decided to pick me among many others. Unluckily, Mark thought otherwise. He never actively tried to convince me to stay, but he would often comment on how we would have been apart for so long, and how I would surely find someone better and forget about him. Although his lack of support hurt me, I was always understanding and reassured him constantly on the fact that I loved him and would never even think about another person. Prior to my departure, I spent every free day with him to show him how much I cared. 

I had moved abroad for just a few weeks. I was just thinking about how I was grateful to have my bf and how much I loved him. Then a girl messaged me on social media saying that Mark had been flirting with her on a dating app.

This probably doesn't even count as cheating for everybody, but I felt like I had been living an illusion. Like my whole world crumbled. I later discovered he flirted with multiple girls on multiple apps.   

Every initial spark of enthusiasm for this new adventure of mine died. In the following months, I could barely take care of myself and leave the house to go to work, and my social interactions were reduced to a minimum. I felt lifeless. However, after a lot of apologies on Mark's part, and months of meditation on my part, I decided to forgive him. I was sure I did the right thing. I took my time to consider the pros and cons, I didn't rush into it. This shitty situation forced us to address some hidden problems we had never resolved, and our overall relationship became much better. My bf Mark is a wonderful, extremely caring person, and I know that he did what he did in a moment of weakness. He objectively used this experience to learn and better himself, and I am 100% sure he loves me to pieces and would never do something like it ever again. 

I did the best I could to forget this whole mess. After I forgave him I never once looked back, and I never talked to him about the ""accident"" again. If some doubts resurfaced, I immediately shut them down.

Nevertheless, I have been feeling miserable. Why? 

I recognize now that even if I did forgive Mark, I never forgot how he made me feel.

It happened in the worst possible moment (I had never lived alone and abroad before, and I had no family or friends to support me), and it completely ruined the whole experience for me, something nobody can give me back.  But even worse, by suppressing my feelings of resentment, I think I also suppressed my love for Mark. In fear of being hurt again, I built a mental wall between us, and slowly began emotionally distancing myself from him.  While in the past I was ready to fight every obstacle that came our way and had this unbreakable faith in us, I find myself tired and emotionless, not willing to fight anymore. His quirks I once found so endearing, now seem annoying. If before I couldn't wait to tell him every little thing that happened to me, I now confide in my friends first.  I feel like I'm faking it.  I went through this process unintentionally and unaware. 
One year later, I am just now recognizing what I have been doing, and I fear that now it's too late and I can't save my relationship. 

To make this whole situation even worse, I developed a huge crush on a friend of mine, ""Jack"", in the past months. It started with me just admiring his personality and aura, to noticing how much chemistry we have between us, to developing some serious feelings for him. I would never tell him that though, and I haven't been leading him on, as I never hide the fact that I have a bf. But I'm almost sure he also reciprocates the feeling. I tried stopping myself, limiting the time I spend with Jack, never seeing him alone. But it's getting worse and worse.  A mutual friend told me she thinks we would make a great couple some days ago, and even if I dismissed it as a joke, I secretly haven't been able to stop thinking about that.  The rare times I see Jack I feel carefree, a cheerfulness I missed very much. I feel like I can breathe again.  

I would never cheat on my partner and don't ever wish to cause him any sort of pain. The mere thought on Mark being in pain because of me makes me tear up and breaks my heart in pieces. I also don't want to be constantly joyless and downhearted. It seems like every move I make I could hurt somebody: Mark, Jack, or me.   


Do you think it is possible to heal my relationship with Mark? Am I a horrible person for having these feelings for Jack? Will I ever be happy?

e0kowb,1,2019-11-23,Job Hunt Depression &amp; Anxiety,purple1437,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e0kowb/job_hunt_depression_anxiety/,"About two years ago I have fallen into a pit of depression which lead to me succumbing to alcoholism and almost flunking college. I put so much effort to get back on my feet; changed schools and was relatively doing well until this last month. For two years, I was engulfed in fake optimism and positivity, that this time I think I might crash for good. I find it hard to sleep at night and constantly wishes a car would hit me.

I am an international student; not only do I not have family support, I can also never relax even after the ordeal of going through college and the sleepless nights I had studying and keeping up my GPA for my scholarship. I have three months to find a job or else I would have to go back to my 3rd world country where my likelihood of having a decent life is very low. I graduate in 15 days and my insurance will run out for me to seek a psychiatrist or therapy. And most of all, I have applied to 30 jobs, I haven't even received a phone call from one of them. Most of these applications asks ""Do you need sponsorship now or in the future?""; every-time my heart sinks, because even though I spent hours perfecting my resume and cover letter to the job, I know it won't make it to the door.

The fact is that the odds are against international students in finding a job in every-way unless you are significantly better than the local talent. This makes me wonder if my whole life has been a failure. If I should've tried harder during highschool to get into an Ivy League. If I should've spent less time having any ounce of fun, and get a perfect GPA.  If I should've gotten an internship instead of visiting my family who I haven't seen in two years. 

All my classmates and friends are either getting offer letters or chill about things because they can just stay there and get a regular job to survive (international students need a full-time job in their fields; eg. I need a programming/IT job). I hate this, but I'm so jealous of them. I'm so dissapointed in myself. I just wanna fade away."

I still don't have any work experience apart from being trained and put to an internship during college (it's a requirement here where I'm from). I graduated from college with a degree in political science 2 years ago and yet I'm struggling to find a job that suits me. I initially wanted a desk job at a local government agency but I fear that I might find myself geared for a lifetime of a bad experience. 

My classmates already landed on the jobs they sought for. Most of them work in the government. Some chose to work in customer services. Since graduation, almost every night I cry in bed, begging the heavens to let me land on a job so I can help and maintain my living expenses. My parents always nag me to find a job... (I try my best to find one,) giving hints that I'm about to be booted out of the house. Maybe there's something wrong with my resume? I never received calls despite passing numerous applications in the past year.  

I ain't picky. It's just that I try to put myself where I'm suitable. Every day without work after college feels like a never-ending nightmare. I feel like I'm gonna grow old relying on my parent's money. They're nearing their retirement age and I still don't have work. I already tried finding jobs throughout the city but I still get rejected. Maybe I really made a bad decision choosing this college course. 

I just hope that I can finally find peace once I get a job. Or.. if I really have no luck, going back to college on a different degree could help..

My brother was his best friend and my brother passed away. He's 10 years older than me and its a platanic friendship, ZERO romantic interest on either side.

Anyways...

I have been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years. It took a while for my parents to warm up to him because he comes from poverty and works as a butcher, while I went to get a degree and am doing an internship. But he busts his butt everyday at work and treats me well, I'm happy, hes happy. My friend, however, has not. Everytime I visit him, keeps questioning me about my boyfriend if Im really ""happy"".

Today my friend got really pissed at me during a group text (very long back story, basically I made a joke that he took the wrong way and said I was being insensitive). After calling me a bitch and chewing me out, he told me that he doesn't understand whats wrong with me and said "" I genuinely hope you consider seeing a therapist and seeking a healthy romantic relationship to aide in your continuing growth and maturity as a young adult."" I apologized to him. But I also told him that this conversation has nothing to do with my bf, so leave him out of it. He then says, ""Yes, I, too, notice how happy the two of you are when the three of us hangout.  You are in denial.""

Yes, my boyfriend and I have problems, EVERY RELATIONSHIP DOES. We both get cranky at each other but we always talk it out. He NEVER abused me verbally/physically/emotionally. We are BOTH HAPPY. My friend always tries to make him look like the bad guy. I thave told him multiple times that I am happy and this is a long term relationship. He refuses to accept it and believes Im in denial. I am sick of hearing his negativity.

Anyone have a perspective to share or even advice?"

Sorry for my broken English, this is not my first language.

One year ago, around this time of the year, I (22F) found out bf (21M) of four years had been using dating apps behind my back.  
It happened at the worst possible time ever, I had just recently moved abroad for an internship and had no family or friends to support me. I had been looking forward to that opportunity abroad since a lot of time, but as I discovered bf cheated, all the excitement died and I  became depressed.
I could barely leave the house for the following months. I immediately asked bf for a break to think things through and not rush into anything. Bf made it up to me in every possible way he could. He was very patient and gave me all the time to process and to decide. After a lot of consideration I decided to give him a second chance. Since then he has matured a lot and proves everyday that he loves me. 
But here comes the problem: I am not happy. I don't look him with the same eyes as before. ‌I recognize now that even if I did forgive bf, I never forgot how he made me feel.

In fear of being hurt again, I built a mental wall between us, and slowly began emotionally distancing myself from him. 
I feel like I'm faking it.

Meanwhile, in the past months I developed a huge crush on a friend of mine.  It started with me just admiring his personality ( He genuinely is a very sweet and interesting person.). Then I began noticing how much chemistry we have between us, and I realize now that I have some serious feelings for him. I've never hidden the fact that I have a bf with him, and he never confessed anything, but I suspect he also reciprocates the feeling. A mutual friend told me she thinks we would make a great couple some days ago, and even if I dismissed it as a joke, I secretly haven't been able to stop thinking about that. The rare times I see him I feel carefree, a cheerfulness I missed very much. I feel like I can breathe again.

Even if I still hold some resentments for how bf made me feel, I would never cheat on my partner and don't ever wish to cause him any sort of pain. The mere thought on bf being in pain because of me breaks my heart in pieces.

But I also don't want to be constantly joyless and downhearted and I don't want to be the martyr, especially since we are all young and still without the responsibility of a family of our own.
So I find myself considering if I should break up and pursue a relationship with friend.

I have an internship this summer and I can provide my offer letter from them so I can easily pay back this loan on time but I just need some money so I can get all my accounts back positive until my financial next semester comes in which I will possibly be able to
pay earlier. Thank you to all who consider helping since I don’t have any history here.


If it helps I do have 2 completed trades over at r/appleswap that I can confirm

She's had a pretty rough history with both family and friends, and found her art to be a big escape. She'd been feeling particularly miserable these last few months as everything she tried drawing came out as kind of a mess. I guided her through the ""Doors to the Mind"" ritual last night, and it was an emotional experience for both of us. Many tears later, she woke up today feeling the best she's felt all year, and spent the whole day drawing.

**Intro**

I'm just letting you know in advance that this is going to be a really, really long post. This was a life changing experience for her, and no part of that is simple. I want to make this post a detailed account of everything that happened last night, at the very least for my own record. I thought that other people, especially those in a similar situation to my girlfriend, might get something out of reading this. So if you're interested, sit back and enjoy.

**Backstory**

This part is just detailing the emotional state of my girlfriend. The DTTM specific stuff is below if you wish to skip this part, but I believe it's important to know where we're coming from in order to understand why this experience was so powerful.

My girlfriend and I went to elementary school together. I didn't know her too well until high school, and we started dating my senior year. Right now, she's on her senior year of college, and I graduated last May and have begun a full time job at one of the best workplaces in the world. We've been together a long time, and we've been through a lot because of it.

On our first date, my girlfriend told me about the stories she was writing. It felt a bit cliche, being a coming-of-age high school drama, but I was interested just because it was such a big part of her life. I read the stories, and they were really nothing special. Cute for sure, but nothing that seemed too impactful or like it was going to find a mass audience ever. Despite this, I saw some serious potential there - a few of her plotlines did a really good job breaking the status quo, and some of the character's arcs were actually very creative, even if they weren't told too well. She agreed with this, telling me that a number of the plotlines were conceptualized as early as 2009, when she was in middle school. Being that we were now both adults, she wanted to re-imagine the bulk of the story with a more mature outlook on it.

We got to work on it, and have been creating, analyzing, evaluating, and re-writing plotlines and character arcs on and off since 2016-2017. One of the biggest changes to the story was that it was now going to be told as a graphic novel - neither of us are particularly great at writing prose, and she'd really been making an effort to improve her cartooning around the same time to make thumbnails for my YouTube channel.

Spring and Summer of 2016 was a very difficult time for her. I was a freshmen in college at the time, and she was a senior in high school, so we were doing long distance. The school year consisted of her slowly drifting apart from her closest friend, a neighbor who she had known since she was a pre-schooler. This change was caused by her slowly realizing that this ""friend"" was honestly a really shitty individual - someone who had been bullying her, manipulating her, and controlling her for as far back as she could remember. When she was finally feeling at her worst, this friend ditched in her a heartbeat, leaving my girlfriend destroyed. On top of that, at the end of the year, she got into a fight with another friend of hers - a girl who was criticizing my girlfriend for wanting to spend time with me after her prom because this friend was jealous about being ""forever alone"". She went off and managed to turn most of their circle against her. Surprisingly, she wasn't all that hurt by this - although she felt bad for a few days, she moved on pretty quickly, citing how most of this group were always really petty and negative.

I was really proud of her, but I think loneliness crept in that summer. The few friends she still had really didn't have a whole lot of free time to see her, and I spent the entire summer bouncing between a summer class a few states away, working a full time kitchen job, and taking on an internship at the company I'm currently employed with. While I was at the internship, she would often text me pictures she'd found in her old sketchbooks - outlined in pen and colored with pencils. She had a massive collection of these old sketches, also dating back to 2009, compiled into about 16 art books (now more than 30) of nearly 100 pages each. A lot of them were cute, and a lot of them had very simple premises of friends hanging out together, featuring characters from the stories she'd drafted. During this same time, she began to send me a number of short stories and scripts she'd written featuring the characters from the same larger stories. These were all texts that she did not share with her groups of friends, or really anyone else before me. These stories were very similar to the bulk of the pictures, being mostly simpler works of the characters doing things in a slice-of-life fashion.

While we were up late one night that summer, she told me more about the origin of her series. She came up with the characters in 6th grade, when her family was staying over at her grandmother's house on the New Jersey Bay shore. She created them in her head out of a desire to be at the shore with friends, since her now-former best friend always had her feeling on-edge in the presence of any adults (kind of a red flag in hindsight) and she didn't feel close enough to her other friends to invite them. She named the initial cast after a few friends she'd made online, and based their appearances and personalities after these internet friends, and that she would imagine herself hanging out in person with these online friends. It kind of hit me here why she felt so passionate about this cast - to her, they were a lot more than some designs and plot threads. They were almost a substitute in her life for friends in her life. After learning this, I helped her track down and find each of her old internet friends, allowing her to briefly catch up with them. One friend in particular she's still in contact with today, three years later (and I should hope so too, since she was the hardest friend to find. It took us 9 months to track her down with nothing more to go off of initially than a first name, a birthday/year, a country, and an empty DeviantArt profile).

Over the next few years of working on re-writing her stories, something else became apparent to me as well. As she grew older, the tone of the stories and the pictures shifted. It became much less about friendship, and much more about suffering. I noticed that a number of the cast began to take on individual traits of my girlfriend. One character in particular served as a manifestation of my girlfriend's sexuality - this character was gay, and openly so, and for that, my girlfriend resented her, and very often drew or wrote about the character suffering and feeling worthless. She was only able to admit to both herself and to me about two years ago that she is bisexual, even with a bit of a preference for women that she repressed for as long as she could, something she plans to keep secret from her family for as long as she lives with them.

Before moving into our DTTM experience, I just want to address some final points here. My girlfriend's parents are some of the least supportive and most counterproductive people I've ever met in regards to her self image. They constantly criticize her for spending time on art, and constantly make her feel weak for her mental state. It was only at the beginning of 2019 that she was even able to convince them that her self-harm and suicidal thoughts were enough of an issue that she needed to see a professional about it, and even now I'm not sure if they really buy it. This is why she keeps things secret from them - something like her sexuality would just result in them laughing at her and not believing her. I'm doing everything I can on my end to help her get by until she finishes school and can move away from them.

Throughout 2019, we had been creating the first presentable draft of the script for the first chapter of her graphic novel and releasing it to test audiences. As part of the marketing plan, I also conceptualized and began to work on a YouTube series to introduce our fanbases to her series. We have several thousand fans between the two of us, and I was really excited to show the world what she created. However, as the time came to begin production, she encountered a very strong mental block. Every time she tried to create a reference picture to publically show off in a video, it just came out as a mess. This did not pertain to pictures she wanted to keep private for the most part, but this was very disheartening to her. Since August, she has been in an emotional spiral of wanting to hurt herself, wanting to give up art, and wondering if she should just give up on living. This last week was especially bad - she was telling me that her art is gone, and that it will never come back, and that her whole life is worthless without it. Therapy wasn't helping her, and she was just getting more and more frustrated about how she didn't understand what was wrong.

**Doors to the Mind**

I had been browsing r/threekings since mid 2015. For the most part, I don't particularly believe in the rituals here, but I enjoy reading about the experiences. I kind of lost interest and seldom thought about this sub since early 2017, but after my girlfriend's last meltdown this past Thursday, I suddenly recalled this sub and DttM out of nowhere. If you believe DttM is supernatural or paranormal or anything, I won't try to change your views, but I personally didn't. However, I *do* believe in psychological tricks, such as hypnosis and lucid dreaming (as someone who often lucid dreams myself). Kind of at a loss for what to do next, I read up on DttM at the office yesterday, and called my girlfriend on my way home and told her about it. We both wanted to get to the bottom of this and understand what was going on, so she agreed to try it. I gave her all the necessary warnings about clocks and mirrors (even if I don't believe there's any inherent danger, I just know from my own dreams and clocks and mirrors tend to be ""off"" or inconsistent in dreams, which can break the illusion and potentially snap her out of the trance).

At around 1:10 AM last night, we decided to begin. My girlfriend put her head on a pillow on my lap, and I began to gently rub my fingers in circles on her temples. At the request of her therapist, my girlfriend had begun doing guided meditations almost a year ago, and she told me that picturing herself by bodies of water often helped her get into a meditative state. She closed her eyes, and I began to describe speak to her, telling her to picture herself by a gentle body of water.

She got into the state pretty quickly. The whole time, she spoke slowly and in a soft whisper. She very rarely told me anything without me prompting her first. As she told me afterwards, the entire time she wasn't aware of the real world - everything she saw in her head felt real to her. She told me that she was sitting in a rowboat, out on the bay by her grandmother's house. She wasn't too far from the shore, and she was floating by a pile of rocks that we've watched the sunset on together (one of her earliest pictures features two of her characters watching a sunset on the same rocks). There were seagulls around, making some soft sounds, and the ocean was gentle. As she put it, she couldn't hear the tides, only the water hitting the boat gently. There were no people around, and the sky was cloudy and a little gray. She said the temperature was comfortable, and it was about 4 in the afternoon. She thought she could hear faint music in the distance. Normally, after the short beach, there is a steep sandy hill that leads to the road, and her grandmother's is a block and a half away from this road, perpendicular to the beach. Here though, she said in place of the houses were hills with pinkish flowers.

After a few minutes of this, I asked her if she was ready to go find the hallway with the doors yet. She told me she wasn't, so I let her wait a little longer before telling her that she should go to the hallway now. She seemed disappointed but said she was ready. She rowed to the shore and got out of the boat. I asked her if the boat was secure, and she said she brought it onto the sand so she could go back to it later. She walked up to the first sandy hill, and she said the flowered hills behind it had turned into the houses and road when I asked her about the hills again. She walked down to her grandmother's house, and opened the door, finding herself at the end of a long hallway.

She described the hallway as reminding her of a hotel - the walls were white, and there was a carpet on the floor. She said it was blue at first, but upon closer inspection she said there were small red squares spread overtop the blue background. I asked her about the doors, and she said there were a lot. When I asked her to describe them, she said they were all the same, wooden with the same chips in them. I told her to walk along until she found one she wanted to open, and after a little bit the door at the far end along one of the walls stuck out to her. This one was slightly different, as it had three numbers on it like a hotel room: ""639"". She said she wanted to go in this one.

I told her to first just observe the door, listen behind it, feel the door and the doorknob. She couldn't hear anything, but when she touched the door, she said it rattled just like her bedroom doorknob did when she wiggled it. She opened it, and looked inside, saying that it looked like how her bedroom used to look. I forget what color she said the walls were, but she walked in and began to look around.

The first thing she noticed was her old bulletin board on the wall, which had been thrown out years ago in real life. I asked her what was on the board, and she said that just like the original, there was a big sketch of a cat posted in the middle, with smaller papers pinned around it. I asked her to describe them. The first one she described featured the main couple from her story, traced over an anime base she found online back in middle school. The next one she described was a print out of an animated woman, one who she now realizes she had a bit of a crush on/sexualized back in middle school. The third one was another cat, but one she had drawn with her older brother. All of these looked exactly how she remembered them and were placed in the correct spots. I asked her was on the other papers pinned here, and she said they were all blank.

Next she moved to another wall in the room, and found her old American Girl dolls in their bed as she had left them. She described each one to me, and said that one of them was upside down in the bed like she usually left her. She then looked at the wall that her door was on, where she'd entered from, and said it looked just like her room did today, unlike the rest of the room. I asked her if her desktop and monitors were there and she said no, so I asked her how it resembled her current room. She said the mirror/jewelry cabinet was there, and that next to it were the big speakers I gave her a few years ago on their small table. Then she looked next to that at her desk and said her computer was there now.

I watched her face the whole time and it had subtly changed. Initially it was happy, but now she looked a little sad. I asked her about the room again and she said it had changed into her current room, exactly as it looked today. I asked her if she wanted to look around it, and she said no, that she wanted to leave now. She left and I reminded her to close the door behind her.

Now she was back in the hallway, and I asked her to describe how it looked. She told me that it looked mostly the same, except that now the carpet was flickering between red and blue. She turned back towards the previous door and said that the numbers now read ""637"", acknowledging that they had changed too. I asked her if she wanted to go to any other doors and she said she wanted to see the door across the hall from this last one. She went up to the door and described it to me, saying it had a chip in the middle and a few stains, identical to her bedroom door from the outside (notably, the door that actually led to her bedroom in this illusion did not look like this). She said it had the same brass handle, and when she put her ear up to the door, she heard faint music again. I asked her about the music and she said it was a trumpet, but very quiet. I had her open the door, and she looked inside.

From the hallway, she said the room was blank - the whole thing was white. She went in, and tried to look around, but she said it was completely empty, just solid white walls. She said she wanted to stay for a little longer before giving up on this room. It's a good thing she did, because shortly after, something happened. Without me even prompting her, she told me that a raven had flown through right through one of the walls, and landed on the ground, staring at a different wall with its back turned towards her.

Now, I'm not one to really believe in some of that dream analysis stuff (I believe that there aren't really any universal symbols in dreams), but I instantly began to worry due to how ravens are traditionally associated with death. I asked her what she wanted to do, and she said she really wanted to know what the raven was staring at. She kept her distance, and kept looking towards the wall. I asked her what she thought about the raven, and she told me she liked it (note that I didn't think too much of this answer yet because she often will playfully say she likes things that she really doesn't have much of an opinion on, it's kind of a long story/in-joke. These kind of things happen when you've been together for 5ish years). She said that as she was looking, the room started to fade in, all gray and outlined. She said she was in the back room of the facility she had just finished interning at, a food/clothing donations distributor. She said it was very faint and hard to see, but the raven had flown through the wall that head a door leading to the warehouse, and it was now staring at a different wall, which I believe she said led to the front room with a few desks. The door she came in from led to a closet in the real world. She told me that the raven looked almost like it was frozen, and that she didn't think it had even noticed her in the room yet.

I asked her if she wanted to approach the raven at all, and she reluctantly said yes (interesting given that she said she liked the raven). As she approached she noticed that the raven wasn't actually looking at the wall, but at three small balls of white light in front of the wall. She said they slowly shifted and turned a pale pink color. I asked her if she still wanted to approach the raven and she said yes again, but as she approached she said one of the only other things I recall her saying without a prompt, that she had spooked the raven and it flew through the wall, this time with the front room on the other side. I could tell both from the tone of her whispers and from the subtle expression on her face that she felt bad for spooking it, and I asked her what she wanted to do. She wasn't sure, and I asked her if she wanted to follow the raven to make sure it was okay. She said yes, and that she really, really wanted to see where it was.

She went into the front room, and she said it was in color now. Looking back, she said the previous room was also in color now, and it was solid, just like in real life. This front room had all the desks, but she said there were no people here either. I asked her where the raven was, and she said it was on the same wall with the door she just walked through, leading to the back room. She approached it, and when I asked her what happened she became a little sad. She said that the raven wasn't a raven anymore, that it had turned into a painting of a raven on the wall when she approached. She said it was a very beautiful painting, of the raven sitting on a tree branch with some white cotton flowers on the end of the branch. I asked why she was said and she said it was because the raven itself wasn't here anymore, that it was gone. But when I asked if the raven was happy as a painting she said it was, that its beak was held high up and that it looked proud. I think this is when I started to figure out what was happening here.

She told me that she could still feel the presence of the raven, but it faded as the frame of the painting faded away and it just became a mural on the wall. When I asked her what she wanted to do next, she told me she wanted to leave right now, and that she couldn't be here any longer. I asked about the raven again and she said it was gone and that she couldn't feel it anymore. She began to walk back to the back room and approached the door to the hallway again, but I asked her to stop a second. I told her to say goodbye to the raven and she did audibly for me to here. I then remembered that she said the raven flew in from the wall that led to the warehouse, and I asked her if she wanted to explore the warehouse (partially because I was just so intrigued by the raven).

Even though her eyes were closed, I could see them starting to tear up. She told me no, that she just wanted to leave right now. I told her she could leave then, and she said that she couldn't open the door. I asked if it was locked, and she said no, the door could still be opened, but she couldn't bring herself to. She said she could feel the room pulling her back in, and that she wasn't able to leave yet. I asked her her what she wanted to do again, and she said she had to find the raven. She went back to the front room, and she said the mural was gone now too, leaving no trace of the raven. I asked her about the room again, and she said this time there were two people in it, a woman at the front desk and someone else standing in the room. I asked her what they were doing and she said they were just frozen in time. She approached the woman at the desk and said the people were still frozen.

She said she thought she could leave now and so she walked back to the back room again, and I saw her face light up. The third and final thing I remember her saying without being prompted first was that the raven was back, and that she saw it standing on the wall by the door to the hallway. She said it was looking at her and she approached it, holding out her hand to it. She said the raven reached out and rubbed the side of its beak on her finger, and that it let her stroke it. She was so happy, and she said the raven was very happy too. I asked her what she thought about the raven and she said that she loved it, and began to softly cry again in the real world. She said the raven loved her too. I didn't want to break her away from the raven now that she'd finally found it again, so I asked her what she wanted to do next and she said the raven wanted to show her something. She said the raven flew through the wall that led to the warehouse, where it had initially come from, and she said that what it wanted to show her was in the warehouse. I asked her what it was, and she just told me that she knew what it was and that was why she wanted to leave before without checking the warehouse.

I asked her if she was ready to walk in, and she said she needed to because the raven had to show it to her. She walked in, and described the warehouse. She said it was filled with shelves and bins with the clothing donations in them. I asked her where the raven was and she said she couldn't see it but she knew it was up on the ceiling, watching her, because it wanted her to look at the table in the middle of the warehouse. I asked her what was on the table, and she told me it was covered in thousands of pieces of paper with a set of markers.

As always, I asked her what she wanted to do next and she said she had to draw something for the raven. She said she knew the raven wanted it. She picked up the brown marker and said she was going to draw.

I gave her a little and asked what she was drawing. She said it was Dakota, the main character in her graphic novel. I asked how it looked and she said she only drew the head so far, and that it wasn't in her current art style, but rather in a previous style she had used from early 2014 to the end of summer 2015. We had both agreed many times in the past that this was probably her weakest art style, and dubbed it the ""square head"" style due to the characters often having a very boxy look to their heads. When I asked her why she drew it like that she said she didn't know, that it had just come out like that, and that she had to draw the face next. Right before she started, she said that the head shape had shifted, now being more reminiscent of an even earlier style, the one she used from late 2011 until early 2014. This was the first art she thought looked presentable, and even though the drawings look like a young teen made them I think a number of them hold up and are still pretty charming. We call this one the ""classic' style because of this.

She drew one eye before she started to tear up again. I asked her what was wrong and she said she couldn't do it, that no matter how much she tried she couldn't even move her arms. I told her to ask the raven for help, and she did. She said the raven didn't speak, but that she felt its answer. She said that she could do it now, and she drew the other eye. I told her to thank the raven, and she did audibly again. I saw her face tearing up again, harder than any of the previous times and I asked her what was happening. She said that she couldn't finish the face, that she couldn't draw the mouth or the nose. I told her to ask the raven for help again, and she said that this time the raven flew down next to her, sitting on the table and looking at the picture. When I asked why, she told me it was because the raven wanted to help her.

With the raven now next to her, she completed the face and began to draw the body. She said the style changed again, this time to the current style she's been using since August 2018. When she was finished, I asked her how it looked. She told me it looked exactly like the drawing she had made a few months ago, the reference for the character that we used in my YouTube series this past September. Neither of us were happy with this picture - I ended up deciding to use it in order to adhere to a schedule, but I regretted it shortly after and we both thought the picture was lackluster. She recently had decided that she wanted to redo the picture so I could make a mini-video showing off the new art, and had tried several times over the last two days to do so. She probably drew more than 12 pictures over the last two days, and even the best one just didn't look right to us. I got really nervous when she said that this picture she had drawn for the raven looked just like the final version we used in the video, and I asked her how she felt, and she said that surprisingly enough, she felt fine. She said that the raven wanted her look away from the picture for a few minutes, and I suggested she explore the rest of the warehouse. She said she began to look around the warehouse at the bins on the shelves, with the raven following her. I suggested that she could open a bin and look at some of the clothes while we waited, and she agreed and went up to a bin.

As soon as she got to the bin, I asked her what it looked like and she told me that the raven was gone. I asked here where it went and she said she didn't know, but that she knew it was time to look back at the picture again. She walked back to the table and said that the picture was gone too. I asked her what she meant, and she said that she knew which paper it was on, that she was holding the paper and could feel it, but the lines on the paper itself were gone because the raven took them. I asked her what she thought about that and she said that she was happy. She said that she knew the picture changed again when she wasn't looking, and that the raven took the picture away because she had drawn it for him. I asked her how she felt and she said she was very happy, knowing the raven had her finished picture. On the way out, I told her to thank the raven again and she did, though not audibly this time. I asked her where the raven was and she said she could see it in her head. She said that the raven was sitting in a nest on a telephone pole, and that he was holding the lines for the picture, just freely in the air. I asked her what they looked like and she said they looked perfect. She said they looked exactly how she wanted them to the whole time, all these months. I asked her how the raven was and she said the raven was very happy because she drew the picture for him, and that she could draw more in the future. I asked her where the raven was and she said that she didn't know where the raven was right now. I asked if the telephone pole was outside the facility and she said no, it wasn't. She said she could see from down at ground level, the raven above her admiring the line art, but that the lines weren't on paper and that she had no idea where this telephone pole was. She said she wanted to thank the raven one more time, and that she loved the raven and it loved her. Then I asked if she was ready to go and she said she was.

She went back to the door and opened it, walking into the hallway and closing it behind her again. I asked her to describe the hallway, and she said it was the same as the other two times, except that this time the carpet was just a solid red color. She closed the door and I asked her if she wanted to see any of the other doors, and she said that she was done, and so I told her to walk back down the hallway to the exit. I asked her where she was again, and she said she was outside her grandmother's house, walking back to the beach. I asked her if she remembered to close the door to the house, and she said she didn't remember, so she walked back and saw it was open and closed it again. She then returned to the beach. I asked her if it was still empty, and she said it was, except for the seagulls like before and the rowboat she left on the sand. I asked what she was doing and she said she was pushing the boat back onto the water and climbing back in. I let her sit for a little while and I asked her about what she could see/hear/feel, and she said it was really peaceful. She said that the sky was bright blue now, and there were no clouds. I asked her what time it was and she said it was noon. I asked if she was in the hallway for a long time and she said that it wasn't the next day, that time had gone back a few hours when she was in the hallway. I asked her if she was ready to wake up and she said she was now. I slowly began to describe the room we were in to her together, and I saw her eyes gently flicker awake. She seemed very fuzzy in the head for a bit, with stiff movements, but she was very, very relax. I gave her a tissue and she wiped away some of the tears, and she was shocked to see that it was 2:15 now. She said it felt like she was only there for maybe 20-30 minutes, and that everything felt real to her.

**Aftermath**

We stayed up until 3:00AM talking about her experience. She said she wasn't aware of the real world anymore, and that she knew right away that she loved the raven. I asked her more about the raven, and she said it was actually kind of deformed at first, like the top half was way too big and misshapen for the bottom half. She said this was only in the first room though, that when she followed it and it turned into a painting it look normal and proud. She also said that when the raven first flew in and she thought it hadn't seen her, she got the impression that it knew her but didn't want to look at her because it was sad, because it felt like she didn't care about it anymore.

As I said before, I don't think anything here was supernatural, but I do believe every word I heard from her. We both believe that the raven was supposed to be her artistic drive, her desire to create, and that it felt unloved because of how frustrated she'd been with her art these last few months. We also wonder if the thing with her bedroom was just supposed to remind her about how she felt happier when she was a kid, how she didn't worry all the time. She also said that she know the raven is always a part of her, even though she'd been neglecting it recently. She told me on the way out last night that she wanted to draw all day today, and I haven't heard her be excited to draw really anything so far this year. She said she wanted to draw herself petting the raven, like when she first touched it before she went to the warehouse, because she knew that was what the raven would want.

I haven't seen the picture yet, but she's told me about the process of drawing it today. We went on a walk a few hours ago (that's actually what inspired me to write this) and she said that she felt really good drawing today, and that she was very proud of her work. She told me that she even wants to get the painting of the raven on the branch commissioned one day. She said she woke up in the best mood she's ever felt, that she didn't spend an hour laying in bed on her phone today, but that she got up and wanted to draw right away. I really haven't seen her this happy in such a long time. I told her that if she ever needs to visit the raven again, I'd be willing to guide her through the DttM again, but I also told her that the raven is a part of her, and that if she ever needs help she can probably find it even without being in a trance like that.

I'm about to go over to her place now to see the art she did today. I haven't felt this confident in her emotional state in a long time, and I'm really looking forwards to seeing the picture.

Thank you very much for reading this if you read the whole thing. I realize that this is very long, and that most people probably aren't going to care about my girlfriend's life or emotional state, but for those of you who did read it, I hope you can understand why this experience was so important to us.

Edit: Thanks to whoever gilded this post! I'm glad to know my story has moved you so much!"
e0rllu,2,2019-11-23,How do I stop feeling anxious about a social situation I don't actually regret?,Unfey,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/e0rllu/how_do_i_stop_feeling_anxious_about_a_social/,"So, I'm an unpaid intern (padding my resume before I get a PhD) and I royally pissed off the company CEO by winning an argument with him, and making him look like an idiot in front of my whole department. He was factually wrong about something and got angrier and angrier as I gently, calmly, and firmly proved that he didn't know what he was talking about. The next day, his daughter (my boss, his kids run all his companies) calls me in to tell me I put ""a black mark"" on this department and that I insulted and disrespected him, and told me to ""NEVER do that again.""

I explained that I didn't mean to be hostile; I was just trying to help him understand facts, and that I simply have a hard time picking up on people's emotions. I offered to apologize.

The truth, though, is that I knew exactly what I was doing. I hate the CEO. He's an idiot and a dick and he's been rude to me every time we've spoken. I loved seeing him seethe with rage as he saw a much younger woman putting him in his place, in front of his employees and his daughter. Everyone saw what a stupid idiot he was in that moment, and I made it all happen. If he wants me to be nice to him and pretend he's smarter than me, he can pay me a salary. 

Anyways, I don't feel guilty about my actions. He's the one who made himself look stupid by acting stupid. I was extremely polite and cool-headed the entire time. I used to be a teacher, so I'm pretty good at maintaining composure. I was actually quite gleeful at his reaction, and my boss's reaction-- she's also been awful to work with. My internship is over next week, so I've really got no skin in the game here.

However, I'm really, really weirdly anxious about the whole thing. These people have no power over me-- I mean what are they gonna do, fire me from volunteering my unpaid labor? Lol. But I've been getting stomach cramps every time I think about the whole thing, every time I remember someone out there is MAD at me. My heart starts to race as I worry about someone being ANGRY with me. I'm having a hard time emotionally dealing with the knowledge that someone DOESN'T LIKE ME, even when I don't like them. Which is so silly! I feel like I did something wrong, when all my logic and ethics tell me that there's literally nothing wrong with explaining the facts. I also don't feel unjustified in my complete loathing of these individuals (won't go into details, but they're both major jerks to everyone).

So, to sum it up, I was right, he was wrong, I was right to tell him, and the worst I'm guilty of is a little bit of petty revenge (and perhaps reveling in it a bit much). But I feel so guilty and anxious about the SOCIAL aspect of this. I can't stand to know that someone out there is upset with me-- even when I purposefully made them upset with me. These feelings of social anxiety are completely ridiculous. Maybe I've got some lingering dread of being disciplined by an authority figure leftover from childhood. I don't know.

So, I know that I SHOULDN'T feel anxious. It doesn't make sense to. I really don't think I need to care about their opinions of me. So how do I cope with this irrational anxieties over.... being disliked by people I dislike?"

44 ABY, Darth Merntal’s flagship the Night Razor

Luke was awoken to the feeling of someone holding his hand and rubbing their thumb, gently across his hand. When he opened his eyes, the breath left his lungs almost as if he had been struck in the chest with a battering ram. He couldn’t believe it. Above him, smiling softly, was his wife. His Late wife. Who had been dead for four years.

“Mara!” He said sitting up a little too fast, which caused his head to spin. “How? What?” He brain stammered out questions so fast that there was no way she could of answered them.

“Is that how you greet your wife, farmboy?”she said, smiling. Moving over to sit beside him. Before he could even stammer anything else out she pulled him in for a kiss.

Luke’s mind melted, it was like he was a teenager getting kissed for the first time. And when he finally regained his wits, he kissed her back. With all the emotions he had felt since her death, the pain, the loneliness, the guilt of not being able to be with her and the fear that he wouldn’t be enough for Ben. That he would of failed his son, without Mara’s help.

Mara feeling the emotions of her husband. Decided to pour her love for him, her happiness to be with him again, how she wasn’t going to die this time. Though she doubted, this had been the will of the Force. She wasn’t going to miss this opportunity, to be a mother and a wife.

Finally pulling away, Mara moved to sit on his lap. “I missed you.”

“I missed you too,” he said baring his head in her hair and breathing in her smell. Oh how he missed that smell. And she intern buried her head in his shoulder. The two just sat there holding each other, not knowing what to say. How to make up for the lost time, those four years had seemed so long to Luke. The hardest parts were the mornings, he had been so use to holding her in his arms every single morning and night, it had taken him three years to get use to the idea. But it still hurt. He thought the pain would never leave him. But this had washed it away. Finally breaking the silence Luke said, “I never want to leave you, I want to stay here with you in my arms forever.

Mara pushed away, “I would of thought you, wanted to get out of here. I also want you to tell me who that girl is. And why Ben had this in his robes.” Mara said as she reached down to one of the pockets and pulled out a small little black box.

“What is it?” Luke asked, all his attention on the box. Pulling back the lid, Mara looked to Luke’s eyes. And was not disappointed to see his reaction. His eyes widened and he poured his shock into the Force, in the box was a ring, an engagement ring. It shined as the light was reflected off the gem. “I had no idea, Ben was planning to do this.” He just managed to say without losing his voice.

“So can you tell me everything that happened, while I was gone.” Mara’s voice was thick with emotions, and Luke noticed that she didn’t say the word dead.

And so he began to tell her of what happened after she died. How Jacen had been Sith all along, how he had tried to turn Ben and make him his own Sith apprentice. How when Ben refused Jacen had tortured him. He continued to tell her about how Jaina had been forced to kill him. He also told her how Jacen had done it to protect his family, which was Tennel Ka and Allana. Then he told her of the events that had taken place over a year ago. Luke told her that it all started when young Jedi started to go mad. How they had no idea what was causing it, and how because of it Chief of State Daala had forced Luke to find out what was happening to them and as well as how to find what made Jacen go dark. He detailed the events of his and Ben’s journey. How they had done their best to recreate Jacen’s journey, learning from many different groups of Force users. Luke now started to tell her about his first encounter with the girl. He told her, that her name was Vestara Khai and how she was Sith. How when he and Ben first met her, how she had been the only Sith to survive an engagement with the Skywalkers, how they had tracked her down and had captured her. Telling Mara how he noticed Ben seemed to have a crush on her, and how it seemed she also had one on him. Eventually he told her how he had been forced to work with a group of Sith called the Lost Tribe to defeat Abeloth. He also told her how the Sith ended up betraying them and how the girl had done so as well. Luke also told her how he thought they should just get rid of her or give her to authorities. But how Ben though that they shouldn’t, that she could still be redeemed. Continuing his retelling of events, he told her how the girl had been forced to kill her father, how she had no choice. How Ben had been their for her, comforting her and staying with her through the night. How the next day she asked Luke to let her become a Jedi. How Luke had missed trusted her but when he felt how sincere she was, he had allowed it. They even began dating. It was all going fine until the raid on Coruscant, after the Sith had taken over the GA. He still didn’t know much about what happened to her after she was separated from Ben. He knew she had run tell the Sith until she was cornered, then she had done whatever she could to survive, she told them of a Jedi queen that existed, how this queen would mean the end of the Sith. She told them that the identity of the queen was Jacen’s daughter Allana, and it just so happened that the door she was cornered was that of the secondary hanger where the Falcon was. Then he told her how the Sith had forced her to attack the Solos. Then he had caught her up on the twos fight with Abeloth. How he also had done a fight with her and won, with the help of a dark man, which turned out to be the man who had captured them. Not yet finished, he told her that the two had become very close. How the girl became his apprentice, how she had given everything she could to make up for her sins, even revealing the location of her home planet. How even after that many of the Jedi disliked her.

A/n that was probably the hardest thing I have ever written. I can understand if it’s incomprehensible, so please don’t be mad. Don’t worry There is still more coming.

After Luke finished the long tail of his and Ben’s adventures. Mara pulled him in closer and said into his ear, her voice husky. “How about I help make things up to you?” Luke’s smile was the only answer she needed and the two began to kiss.

Vestara, awoke in a unfamiliar room. In a unfamiliar bed. She had no idea where she was. Fear started to take control, but Vestara used one of the Jedi meditation techniques, Ben had taught her to. Then she remembered what had happened. Trying to keep the panic for taking over her, she reached out with the Force searching for her master, her boyfriend, her best friend. When she didn’t immediately feel Ben, she let a wave of grief roll over her. But then she reached out again, even deeper then before. Relieved when she felt his presence, and immediately throwing off the covers she step to the door. When she stepped through she was taken aback by the coziness. This probably was the nicest place she had ever stayed in, with a very large living room, almost the size of the Jade Shadow’s hanger. The room was very sparsely decorated, with only rugs and three sofas and one recliner. The sofas seemed to be bran new, with out the faintest hint of an impression. All but one, on the largest sofa, she saw the sleeping from of Ben, sprawled out on the sofa. Not even thinking she moved over, to sit beside him on the couch. When she saw his face, there was a nasty looking bruise on his jaw it made her heartache in sympathy and she wanted to do nothing more than to comfort him. And she did. She lended over him, running her hand through his red hair wanting to comfort him when he woke up. She continued to run her hand through his hair until she heard the quite hiss of a door opening. Turning his head Vestara caught sight of a woman, who looked to be about Master Skywalker’s age, with fiery red hair, a lean build, but still well muscled. She had creamy white skin, similar to Ben’s, she could also see that Ben had a lot of this woman’s features, so naturally she guessed this must be his Mother, Mara Jade. Jade green eyes stared back at her with one eyebrow raised.

“Who are you?” Her voice wasn’t threatening, but it wasn’t friendly either.

“I am Vestara Khai, Ben’s umm,” Vestara, didn’t know what she should say and she was thinking about what she should say. But she didn’t have to.

“Girlfriend.” Her voice still neutral. “I could of guessed, especially with the way you’re looking at him,” her voice a little humorous now.

“I am assuming you are Mara Jade, Ben’s mother?” Vestara asked already knowing the answer.

“Yes, I am.” Now her voice was serious, “how has he been?” This shocked Vestara Because she could see that the older woman’s eyes concerned and worry for her son. All the stories, she had heard Ben and other Jedi, that Mara was calm and hid her emotions well. But this unbidden emotion was not what she expected.

“He, seemed like anyone else when I first met him, I could tell he had feelings for me, and I had feelings for him. But we were still Jedi and Sith at the time. I was told to seduce him to the dark side when my father and a grand lord found out about our feelings.” Vestara decided to pour her heart out into this woman. She knew that the one had never met her that she had a clean slate, with her lovers mother, and she’d be damned if she wasted the opportunity, to earn a least a little respect from the person she loved mother.

Mara for her part listened to the girl’s story. Remembering how she once has been in a similar situation, how when she first met Luke she wanted to kill him, how she thought killing him would of made her life so much better. But no, how wrong she was. Her relationship with Luke started off rocky but eventually drew into a close friendship helping to heal her from the damage her former Master caused, how it had taken her so long to heal but the healing from the damage was completed when he had proposed.

She couldn’t help but think that from what she heard from the girl, that both needed to be healed. Vestara a lot more. Then a thought came into her head, it made her chuckle softly, seeing the curiosity in the girl’s eyes, Mara realized how insensitive that seemed, and quickly went to explain herself.

“Don’t worry, Vestara, I wasn’t laughing at you.” Mara said keeping her voice light, “I was laughing at Ben’s and Luke’s taste in women, both seem to have a thing for women that they have to redeem.” Mara, now seeing the girl smile, couldn’t help but notice that the little scar at the corner of her mouth made her look so joyful.

“Then I guess Ben is like his father than,” her voice was light and filled with amusement.

“Like Father, like Son” Mara said, now laughing. Which made so much noise that she heard, the door behind her open. But before she could look and see her husband step through the door she saw the stirring form of her son and before she could do anything Vestara was already there.

When she saw Ben open his eyes, the smile and his Force presence made her realize how strong their relationship actually was. With the bombardment of their emotions flooding into her head, she had to stop herself from telling them to shield. Because the love she felt from them made her heart warm. Seeing this love and knowing, how much she missed, she made a vow never to miss out again. And that the four of them will get out. But she was interrupted when she heard Ben call out,

“Mom!” And Mara swore her heart was going to jump out of her chest. And immediately felt the wait or his body when he tackled her in a Wookie hug. She returned the embrace.

Burying his head in his mother’s shoulder, like he had done when he was a child. Not holding back the tears he didn’t know he had, he let all go. He told how he missed her.

Mara also let tears fall, Mara did what she could to comfort him. Eventually he stopped crying he pulled back, eyes red rimed. “Ben, I want to talk to you in private.” Looking at Ben and then Vestara, then back to Ben. His only response was a curt nod. Grabbing his had she pulled him away towards the small kitchen at the end of the living room.

“Ben, how are you feeling. About this, about everything, I want know what happened to you.” Her voice was as loving she it ever had been. Now she wasn’t going to let her family die her.

Ben told his mother everything, and she watched him her attention never wavered. Ben felt good to tell her everything.

Mara listened as only a mother could. Her heart pouring out for her son. When he had finally finished Mara pulled him in and held him close. And only let him go when she felt the weight leave him. “So, the Girl, you planning anything special for her.” Before Ben even spoke, she knew what he was going to say.

“No, we are just dating, but I love her.” His voice was matter of fact. And it warmed Mara’s heart.

“I know you do, and I guess that’s why you got this?” She said pulling out a little black box and showing it to him, Ben’s eyes widened and then narrowed.

“You aren’t mad are you?” His voice sounding hurt. “Did you show her?”

“No Ben, I am not mad in fact I am quite happy for you. Why would I show her and ruin true surprise for her.”

“Oh.” He said dumbfounded, and she wondered if these two were making up for her and Luke’s hopeless at love.

“Ben,” She said cupping his face, “you have your father and my blessing. I know she will say yes if you ask her.” Ben smiled at her and took the box from her and quickly stuffed it into a pocket.

Before Mara knew it Ben was out the door, into the living room. When she entered the room behind him she could see Luke and Vestara talking quietly, both of the presence were calm. Which Mara thought was a good thing, compared to what she had heard before. But when Ben finally got to the sofas, she saw Vestara smile. The girl met Ben halfway. She watched as Ben take her hands in his. Looking into her eyes he said,

“Vestara Khai, I want you to know something. You have made me the happiest person in the Galaxy,” Mara couldn’t detect a single bit of nervousness from Ben, only his love for the girl. “I have had feelings for you ever since we met. The more time we spent together the stronger they became, so strong that even after you betrayed me and my Dad multiple times, I didn’t lose them. People always disliked my relationship with with you. Many of them think that this is just hormones, or surface level attraction, but it is some much deeper.” His eyes were watering, “Ves, you gave everything I could ever ask for. Will you,” Ben dropped to one knee and pulled out a little black box and opened it and held it up to her with both hands and asked tears now falling over his smiling face. “Marry me?” His voice now broke with emotions.

Vestara stood there dumbfounded, she knew Ben loved her and loved her deeply, more than she had ever been loved before. But here he was pledging himself to her, showing her all his feelings, through their Force bond and his appearance. Not wanting to keep him waiting she said, “yes Ben, for Force shake yes, I will marry you.” And Vestara held out her left hand Ben quickly slid the ring out it. After that was done Vestara pulled him off his feet and kissed him deeply. Not caring his parents saw, but to her surprise Ben deepened the kiss by wrapping his arms around her midsection, pulling her closer.

e0sogw,46,2019-11-23,[f4M] Your 19 year old trophy wife,realprincesscruises,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/e0sogw/f4m_your_19_year_old_trophy_wife/,"You were the guest speaker at my high school graduation. I was valedictorian. My speech came immediately after yours and we both caught each others' eye. 

How could I NOT be attracted to you? You were charming, distinguished, wealthy, and exuded confidence in a way that no boy my age could possibly come close to. I couldn't take my eyes off of you when you were on stage. And while my long white graduation gown may not have been especially flattering, my knee-length black dress must have caught your attention at the reception afterwards when I was sitting at the table next to yours with my family.

At the reception, when you offered me your congratulations, I couldn't stop myself from blushing. My sister made fun of me and my parents just rolled their eyes, not taking it too seriously. When you pulled me aside, we were all excited thinking maybe you were going to offer me an internship. The reality was FAR better though. You asked me on a date. When I got back to the table with the biggest smile ever on my face, I told my parents that we were going to have a ""meeting"" and maybe it would lead to an internship. They were thrilled about it then. 


However, throughout that summer, you never once asked me to work for you. That's not what you wanted from me. You wanted a cute, doting girlfriend that worshiped the ground you walked on. And the more we saw each other, the more I  became just that. By the end of the summer our relationship was no longer a secret. Halfway into the first semester of college, I, a former valedictorian of my high school, dropped out of college in order to move in with you and plan our wedding. I never pictured myself as a stay-at-home trophy wife and needless to say, my parents were less than thrilled about it. But tolerated it because you DID take good care of me, even though you constantly did little things to remind me of your superiority. You loved me, cared for me, treated me as your prized possession...but a possession nonetheless. 

We got married that January and now by the following summer, you've made me into almost your perfect, submissive wifey. Sure I got out of line sometimes but you knew how to put me in my place and weren't afraid of doing it. We both know that your pleasure, and how I make you look in front of your friends and colleagues, are the most important things in this relationship. You provide for me, would never cheat on me, and I live to make your life happier and more pleasurable in any and every way I can. The perfect relationship.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

So yeah, that's the kind of relationship I want to play out. Hopefully long term. Of course I left multiple things open-ended. Before we jump into anything I would like to know who you are (job/age/etc), what you want me to look like (reference pic would be a bonus), any rules or behaviors you expect from me after 5-6 months into our marriage. I would like to roleplay how parts of our life would be. While there should of course be plenty of sex (which can and should be rough and degrading), I also want to play out situations away from sex. Including but not limited to daily life at home, nights out, traveling, interactions with family and friends/colleagues, whatever else you think could be hot.

I like the idea of you having very high expectations of me, not being afraid to enforce them, and always treating me in ways to let me know that you're above me. Calling me names, belittling me, giving me child-like punishments. You don't take 'no' for an answer from anyone and especially me. 

If you're not up for a long-drawn out roleplay, which I can certainly understand, I'm more than happy talking about these themes and situations. If this is the case, I'd be happy to talk via reddit chat or Discord but please start the conversation via Reddit PM. I hope this interests you and I look forward to talking with you!

EDIT: This is still open!"
e0sxil,3,2019-11-23,Broke up with my (29F) boyfriend (32M) and am full of regret.,disraeli__gears,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e0sxil/broke_up_with_my_29f_boyfriend_32m_and_am_full_of/,"Hey y'all.

Some backstory. I am actually still married but separated and am going through the divorce process. I have not lived with my STBX for about a year and a half.

I met my ex-boyfriend in May at a garage sale. He was going through the records and I commented that he was taking all the good ones and leaving nothing for me. He asked which one I wanted and then gave me a Cream album. As I walked away he asked for my number and that was that.

I was not looking for anything serious. I was newly single after being in a relationship for 7 years. I was upfront about my situation from the beginning but we ignored it and kept seeing each other.

Things started getting serious. I shouldn't have let it happen, but it did.

So I ended it yesterday. I've never really been single and I need to learn how to make myself happy and be by myself.

...but I love being with him. He is unlike anyone I've been with before. I said to myself I never wanted to be married again after my last relationship, but he changed my mind. He is so thoughtful, optimistic, handy, and open-minded. We have never had a disagreement.

Am I being dumb? I really do need to work on myself. I'm in my last year in school and am applying to internships. I also started a new job a few months ago and it's been hard juggling everything (on top of getting divorced and maintaining a healthy relationship with my family). I also have mental health issues and have been off meds and haven't seen anyone in years.

I just want to be better and I wish our timing was better.

I'm sorry if this post is all over the place. I have scatterbrain rn.

Did I do the right thing?

TL;DR Recently separated after 7 years, met someone unexpectedly and ended it after 6 months because things got serious too fast, and I have never really been single."

He’s always been the most sought after of us too, and he grew into a chad. He would curve girls constantly which pissed me off because i couldn’t even get attention and he would ignore it. when we turned 16 he met a stacy and started dating her. The more i got to know her the more i felt burning jealousy. She was everything i wanted but would never have. She is black but honey colored, hazel eyes and smart, funny, likes anime, reading just a good person. They deserve eachother and i hate it. When we turned 18 we all got an apartment. i have lived with them for 4 years now and they have been dating for 6. I am so jealous i long for it. Adding to my jealousy i’ve been out with him when all types of girls throw themselves at him, imagine the black pill seeing all races of stacy go after chad and he complete ignores and tells them he’s not single. Yet i’m perfectly single and they don’t care, is it because i am white and he is black? me and his stacy gf have so much in common, we have sat and talked about things for hours. I feel like if i wasn’t hideous we could be soulmates. He works in the tech field and recently got a position where he will be making 70 and she will be finishing her internship and starting a job in the 60k range, so i knew it was coming. he pulled me aside and showed me a ring, i just felt dread, he’s planning to propose and not renew our lease when it’s up in 6 months so they can get a house. 

Black pill hit me hard: it’s not my personality, i’m a “weirdo” but so is he and she loves him. Can’t even use the money cope cus she’s been with him since she’s been with him. ITS NOT PERSONALITY ITS LOOKS. 
I will NEVER have that wjats the point!

I try to be happy for them but i am burning with jealousy. now i will really be alone. i want to rope."

Currently in college. I am 30 kg overweight. My ideal weight is 64 kg. I am addicted to fast food.

I have tried to lose weight this year and succeeded quite well. I started to go to gym on the 20.02.19 and by the end of May I had already lost 13.4. Kg. It was a huge deal. It just didn't feel like it at the time... I wanted to lose 4 kg a month. And by the end of the year I would be my ideal weight. Things DID NOT GO AS PLANNED.

My gym workout was basically 2 hrs cardio, one hour cycling and 1 hour walking/jogging and 30 minutes of weight lifting. I did this like 5 or 6 days a week. But it was incredibly hard. 

What was worse was the food. My diet was basically morning cereal, lunch was 4 slices of bread and some fish and at night 2 slices of bread and soup.

I love to eat good food. When I am walking somewhere and smell good food, I will buy it. I managed to hold back for a few months. 

The problem was that I had to start an internship for 2 months in June. In a hotel. Food is free there. And everyday there is pasta, macaroni, fried noodles, chicken and mutton curry,etc. 

It was just too much. Part of it was that when I reached 81 kg or so,my weight just WOULDN'T go down! I doubled the hours i put in. I did 4 hrs in the gym for 2 weeks almost. I got to 80.2 kg.

And then I kinda SNAPPED. I was sick of just everything. Sick of watching co workers eat delicious food while I had to eat salad and bread.

Add to that was the college exams and I was stressed. I ended up stress eating. I kind of just let go for a while. 

Fast forward to today, I am back to 95 kg or so. I am starting my diet again this week. I have exams in 10 days but I am just tired of feeling fat.

Its just when I think of just how much I suffered to lose those 13 kg, the nausea,fainting(body wasn't used to diet yet), the muscle pain, the sheer BOREDOM of running,walking,cycling and more running,walking,cycling...I don't feel like I will be able to do it.

e0vfhm,23,2019-11-24,A Guide to Finding a Catfish,-wholesome-bean-,catfish,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfish/comments/e0vfhm/a_guide_to_finding_a_catfish/,"I wrote this to aid someone who’s friend was actively being catfished, however, it can just as easily be used in any situation where you are trying to figure out the identity of a Catfish. 

*I hope this helps someone!* ♡

1. call the number from a phone number he doesn’t know— many people will automatically answer with their real name, or they will say “this is *insert name*” if you start off with “hello, this is *give a fake name* calling.” You may want to use a fake number (ie generated by a website or app) so that he won’t have your number. 
2. look up his number using spydialer— the purpose of this is to access his voicemail. Some number generating apps, such as textplus, will actually tell you in the voicemail that the number is being generated by some sort of internet service. While certainly not definitive, fake numbers are a hallmark of many catfishes. You could also get extremely lucky, and the catfish may accidentally have an a voicemail that reveals their true name. This step also potentially allows you to analyze his voice— ie does he sound like he could be a girl (if this is difficult for you, there are voice pitch “gender” analysis apps and software) Does he sound like where he says he’s from (ex: someone born and raised in south Texas isn’t going to have a posh British accent)
3. look up the number on spydialer, peoplesmart, spokeo, and okcaller. While these sites aren’t perfect, they do have the potential to lead you to the address/name of the catfish or the catfish’s relatives. If the number comes back as a landlines (but your friend has been texting him), this means that this number is being generated by something like textplus or google. Provided it’s his real number, you can identify —via the area code— where his general location is (watch out for spoofed numbers though!). General location is also useful in terms of establishing if he’s a catfish— real people who are serious about relationships don’t tend to lie about something like what state they’re living in. However, it is important to note, he could have a number from a location he previously lived in. 
4. if you find any names or addresses, take to social media to look into the person/people. Sometimes the number is registered to a family member of the catfish, so make sure to comb through the accounts looking for potential family members that could be the catfish (Facebook is very helpful for this)!
5. carefully analyze the photos + information that you do have! Does he have an employer listed? Perhaps something he’s wearing has a logo of a place he may work. If you can find a possible employer find the number, and call them! Ask to speak with whatever this man’s name is, or say that you’re calling to ask about a referral for a past worker. If the employer says that there is no employee working there by that name + there never has been, you know that —at the very least— his name is probably made up. If you know a major life event he claims he just experienced (for example: had a daughter), you can ask if the employer has any employees that recently went through that same experience. Can you perhaps see the name of a store, amusement park, club, etc. he’s at in a photo? Anything that gives context as to his location? Search these places on social media— many people tag the location itself or the actual Instagram run by the club/store/amusement park/etc. You can try hashtags of big events / popular locations too. By doing this, you may be able to find the photos your friend has been sent. If the account has a different name + looks legitimate (friends tagged, lots of followers, locations/schools/etc tagged, etc.) your friend probably met a catfish stealing those photos— the owner of the account may even be willing to FaceTime or Skype to confirm with you (be sure to pay attention: is it the same voice that your friend is talking to?). Another possibility is that you find more social media for the catfish. A big social media related red flag for catfish is when they’re basically only following people they’re sexually interested in— Ie if this dude your friend is talking to is only mutuals with hot girls. 
6. if the catfish has texted your friend photos, he may have forgotten to remove the geotag— check to see, and you may be able to find out his general location or even address (and, of course, with an address you can work backwards to find out who lives there).
7. Another way to get his address is to offer to send something— even if he gives you a PO Box, it’ll still give you the general location (you can than search names in that specific area, which can be helpful). You don’t actually have to send anything— absolutely do not give him your return address. 
8. Check any social media to see if it’s compatible with the Wayback machine— you may be able to find previous posts that reveal his true identity.
9. reverse image search his photos. Google images, and imgops are a good place to start. Other reverse image searches tend to not work as well, but it’s always worth a shot to try using them! You can try fiddling around with key words if nothing comes back on your search. Remember! Just because nothing comes back, doesn’t mean that the photo doesn’t exist in random corners of the internet.
10. Contact his friends on social media! See if they know him in real life! Ask to call them! Ask for information! Etc. Obviously this can easily be faked, and is only occasionally of any use.
11. Look for social media handles that are similar to his— ie, some catfishes will have similar handles on their fake and real profiles. Example: @ChrisBrownxoxo and @*insert real name* xoxo. ALSO, if you have a social media handle/username for one website, make sure to search that same handle on every other social media account.
12. Use Grabify to track his IP address, location, make + model of his device, etc.
13. Use Criminalchecker.Com to run his name, and google “*his name* mugshot.”
14. Just flat out google whatever name the catfish gave you, and see what you find. Be wary if MULTIPLE social media accounts on the same platform pop up with the same name + pictures. Try googling his name and details you know about him— for example: his name + location, occupation, school (and past schools), hobby etc. Make sure to google and search social media for any other names that you find (ie through a phone number search)!! Social media can be very helpful as many catfish will post similar (or the same) things + have similar interests— perhaps the catfish is obsessed with golden retrievers, perhaps they love a particular actor, perhaps they post loads of memes or cute animals photos. If you find a social media account connected to a name you found via a cell phone number search, and that account is posting the same memes + has the same interests... you’ve probably found your catfish. 
15. Look at who’s following the catfish on social media, and commenting on/liking the catfish’s posts— often times the catfish’s real social media account and/or the catfish’s other fake accounts will interact with the profile.
16. Reverse search his email address(s) using sites like spokeo, emailsherlock, pipl, etc.
17. Search his email(s) and phone number(s) on social media. Sometimes catfish have their email(s) or phone number(s) associated with their real account(s)!
18. Consider having your friend call him, tell him she knows he isn’t who he says he is (hopefully, with information to back this up), and that she’s going to stop talking to him if he doesn’t come clean via video chat (or meeting if it seems safe— but pick a densely populated area FAR away from your home, and bring as many friends as possible to plant near by).  Have her say that he owes it to her, and consider having her say that she’s open to maybe continuing the relationship with someone who isn’t in the photo if he comes clean. Hopefully, he is who he says he is— or he at least comes clean. Worst care scenario he disappears, but is that really that bad of a result if he’s a creepy catfish? At this point, if he seems unsafe, consider having your friend change her number— so that he can’t utilize anything to track her. If she’s done things like open links from him, consider having the phone checked for malware such as him being able to watch her through the camera or track her location. Likewise, be mindful of the information that she shared + that he can possibly look at geotags of photos your friend sent him or follow the same steps with these websites to use her number to do things like potentially find ya’ll’s address. I don’t mean to scare you + all of that is the absolute worst case scenario— it’s just good to be prepared!

*video calls where you actively ask questions and they respond are the ONLY form of proof in terms of physical appearance (software exists to make a short video seem like it’s live on your video call— that’s why it’s important to ask somewhat complex questions and have them logically respond, or to ask them to do something like balance a fork on their head [but absolutely do not let them know what you plan to ask prior to the video]). Photos can be photoshopped! Friend’s testimonies can be faked! Third party apps can turn an old photo into what looks like a snapchat that’s just been taken. Some catfish have even been known to contact the person who they’ve stollen photos from, claim to be the person getting catfished, ask for proof (aka whatever you’ve asked for as proof) that they’re the real account, and then send it to the person that they’re catfishing.*

A few Red Flags that won’t help you find a catfish, but might help you identify one:
1. they never call you on the phone (this likely means they’re of a different gender, or that they’re someone you’re close enough to in real life that you would recognize their voice). *Note: many catfish will get someone else to make a phone call (or even phone calls) for them, in order to seem like who they claim to be*
2. they can’t video chat because of money (with WiFi, video chats are free on all sorts of services from Skype to Instagram)
3. they can’t video chat even *once* because they don’t have a camera or their phone is broken. Walmart sells webcams for $7 + it’s just about impossible that they don’t have a friend/family member with a device that they could borrow to video chat with you *once for five minutes.* This is an even bigger red flag if they seem to frequently buy unnecessary items as that means they can afford a webcam. It’s perhaps the biggest red flag if they continue to send you / post on social media “new” photos (ie mirror photos) indicating they have a working camera on an iPhone. Obviously, this red flag becomes bigger and bigger the longer they claim that they can’t video chat for.
4. the photos they send you / post on Instagram seem to be out of chronological order. For example: suddenly, they don’t have a tattoo that they had in the last photo they posted. Other examples include obvious piercings (ie gauges), braces (if they seem to randomly come in and off), hair cut, etc. Also pay attention to these things in regards to their friends/families if they’re frequently posting with other people. If they have a child, make sure that said child’s age isn’t obviously fluctuating between photos.
5. they don’t have a lot of followers from where they claim to live and/or they have very few followers. Also, be mindful of accounts that have loads of random followers or followers with very few posts/no profile pictures/etc. as those are probably followers that the catfish bought. *note: If they have a substantial group of followers from one location, that may indicate that’s where they live and/or help you figure who’s involved (sometimes multiple people pretend to be one catfish, or the catfish’s friends will help cover / help out in some way)*
6. real accounts will usually tag their friends in photos— be mindful of accounts that do not tag friends in photos + do not have any comments from the people supposedly in the photos. If accounts are tagged / interacting, go check them out as some catfish will create fake friend accounts as well. Also, be mindful if the friends the catfish frequently mentions don’t seem to follower their social media account.
7. they only send you photos that they posted on social media.
8. they claim that there’s a fake account of them— but that account is much much bigger + tags friends + posted photos first etc.
9. they supposedly live in the same city, but can never meet.
10. they make plans to meet up with you, but always end up bailing— common excuses include a family member dying, a car crash, getting arrested, something to do with a serious illness (cancer, heart attack, stroke, etc.), getting kidnapped, randomly needing to work or they’ll get fired, etc.
11. they still refuse to meet up even when you offer to travel to them + it wouldn’t cost them anything.
12. they never send videos where they address you directly / say your name / talk about specific stuff you’ve mentioned
13. they claim that a big or real looking social media account belongs to them, but they never dm your or mention you on the account.
14. be mindful of accounts —especially celebrities— that message you despite the fact that you’ve never interacted before, this is especially applicable if you have a private account (is a celebrity really messaging without even being able to see your posts?).
15. they claim to have a serious illness, but their social media shows them doing things that would be physically impossible and/or they show no signs of actually being ill (many illnesses have visible signs) and/or they have no photos in the hospital or getting treatment.
16. they can never call/video chat/visit you/etc for a *long* period of time because of “work”, despite you asking on all sorts of days at all sorts of hours + they can never tell you a time that they’ll be free — it’s unrealistic that someone wouldn’t be able to call you/FaceTime you even once for like a year, because of work.
17. their stories simply do not add up, they mess up details about their own lives, their stories change, etc.
18. they frequently ask for money— especially if they never show you proof that they purchased what they claimed to need money for, or they can’t accept money and you have to send the money to a friend/relative for no logical reason (often, that friend/relative will be the catfish, a friend of the catfish, or a relative of the catfish.)
19. photos don’t correlate with their story, or are kinda screwy— ie they’re wearing an army uniform, but claim to be in the navy + they never send photos of them with their child or pet (even when you request one), but send loads of photos of their child/pet + they can’t FaceTime because of body dysmorphia, but post bikini photos on Instagram nearly every day (this is a common scenario with catfish, but I’m not a doctor so I can’t say if this could be a legitimate scenario in some cases) + they claim to be visiting Japan, but objects in the background of photos they send you are in Chinese + etc.
20. they claim to be a famous rapper or model, but nothing comes up when you google their supposed name. In the case of being a musician, they also never send you any music they’ve made. Musician is a common profession claimed by catfish because it seems cool, and also gives the catfish the excuses of “oh, I can’t video chat/call because I’m in the studio” and “I can’t come visit you because I’m on tour.”
21. you hear stuff in the background of calls that just doesn’t add up with what the catfish claims to be doing.
22. the area code of their phone number doesn’t correlate with where they live, or where they have lived in the past.
23. they randomly make new social media accounts or change phone numbers.
24. They randomly disappear with little to no explanation (sometimes for long periods of time), and often have a new phone number or social media account when they reappear again. 


⚠️‼️Remember just because you’re talking to a real account (even a verified one), doesn’t mean that you’re not taking to a catfish!! ‼️⚠️
•someone else (like a family member or close friend, or a hacker) may be using a real account to talk to you. In the case of celebrities, it may also be an intern or social media manager who you’re talking to. 
•perhaps you left your number in the comments of a celebrities social media page, and a catfish found them and claimed to be the celebrity.
•perhaps you told a friend that you were messaging a celebrity or hot person on social media, and your friend (aka your catfish) decided to pretend to be that person.

*note: a catfish may be physically who they claim to be, but be lying about absolutely everything else— their job, family, medical conditions, wealth, where they live, etc*

➡️Obviously a very real person could do some of these things, so it’s important to look at the whole picture— you’re not necessarily dating a catfish just because your partner doesn’t tag their friends on social media, and doesn’t show you photos of them in the hospital. 

*when telling a friend/family member that you think they’re being catfished, it is ideal to approach them with solid evidence that you can walk them through. Discussing red flags can be helpful as well. If your friend doesn’t believe that she is being catfished, my personal opinion is that you should figure out as much information as possible first and then present it to her— I don’t think you should do an information search with someone who is in denial. However, you should show her all the steps that you took to find said info during the intervention. When searching for a catfish you *always* run into a few deadends— deadends can cause the victim to feel as though they’re not being catfished. It’s best to do some exploring, and then walk your friend through all the proof you’ve found + all the red flags you’ve identified! It’s very important to approach the conversation with empathy, and not get angry/insult their intelligence. It’s also important to emphasize that this is not their fault, and that many people get scammed. Mention that if their significant other has nothing to hide than there’s no harm in looking into the situation + nothing to worry about— this can cause the victim to be more willing to help out with the investigation. If your friend/family member has children, mention that it’s crucial to verify this potential catfish’s identity for the safety of their child/children. Emphasize that she needs to get this catfish out of her life so she can find someone who truly loves her and treats her right! Consider mentioning the fun/enjoyable outings/activities that she could do with a real person! One strategy is to advise your family member/friend to tell their catfish that he/she/they needs to video chat them once for five minutes within the next two weeks— broken camera isn’t an excuse (webcams cost $7 and nearly everyone with a phone has a friend/family member who would let them barrow a device with a camera for a few minutes some time within the span of two weeks). Make sure that your friend/family member asks the other person to do specific things, because software exists to make prerecorded videos look like they’re live-streaming to you.*

e0zhzk,5,2019-11-24,Career advice for undergrad student,mirck,molecularbiology,https://www.reddit.com/r/molecularbiology/comments/e0zhzk/career_advice_for_undergrad_student/,"So here's the context:
I'm an undergrad student in italy, i'm in my third year in biotechnology and my plan was to become a reaserch scientist eventually. This is what I wanted from the start and I'm still pursuing this path.

This is my problem:
Since I really got into molecular biology and had a great professor, I asked him to have me as an intern in his lab, he accepted so I started three months ago now.
While I do like the project and the experiments, I found out I'm way worse than I thought in the lab. I am frequently very frustrated of my mistakes and I'm lucky the postdoc that works there is kinda patient with interns.
The intership is going to be over soon though and while I did get better over time I don't think this is quite enough if I want to do this job once I'm done with my studies. Also I remember in the first year we had some sort of meeting with people in the field of biotechnology, they told us only a few biotechnologists end up becoming researchers despite most students saying that's what they aspire to. 

So what do you think? Should I start thinking about what else I can do with a biotechnology degree that I might like? Should I wait and see how my master's degree internship goes?"

e10ghh,1,2019-11-24,M - Canada - 25,[deleted],Needafriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/e10ghh/m_canada_25/,"Hey there, all! My name is Lezabeilles (I'll give you my real name when we start chatting), and I'm writing from the Great White North (I'm sure that every Canadian says this, so I apologize for being cliché). I'm new to the interesting, yet scary, world of Reddit; I actually joined on specifically for groups like this one. I've not had much luck finding friends in Canada's capital since I moved here (last thing I tried was Bumble BFF - liked the name - ofc, not the experience), so I thought I'd look for friends from near and far. For full disclosure, I'm gay and in a long-term relationship; hopefully, this doesn't diminish my stock too much as it seems to in other corners of the internet, but I'm a big believer in quality over quantity. If you'd prefer not to talk to me for either of those reasons, any correspondence between us probably wouldn't have been very enjoyable anyways #sorrynotsorry. De rien!

So why should you talk to me? Hmm, that's actually a really good question. I can't guarantee that having me as a friend will make you a better person or help you to discover any great mysteries of the universe, but you can bet your bottom dollar that I like to write; you'll never get cheated on messages (if you view that as an entirely good thing, please accept a Fast Pass to the beginning of the line). As a person, an INFJ person (*a real INFJ - I took the test in an internship prep class for the first time when I didn't even know what the hell all those letters meant*), I am pretty hopelessly introverted (and it's a fate that I'm resigned to and have made peace with), but if you put a pen in my hand or sit me behind a keyboard, I'll ""talk"" forever. While I'm open to voice or in-person too, I'm like a car heater: takes me a little while to warm up. I also have a wide variety of interests, such as writing, travelling, history, Disney-related stuff (saw Frozen II yesterday), reading, baseball (how 'bout them Astros?), linguistics, and taking long walks along the river. I'm hoping to get a Switch Lite in the next month, so what I plan to play with it will be TBD (any suggestions are welcome!), but I am for a fact going to get me some Pokémon (it's the driving force behind why I want the Switch Lite in the first place). My partner and I have a regular ole Switch too, but he hogs it with his Paladin addiction, and it just won't be a good situation having only one switch when I have to spend limitless hours hatching eggs. Mais, je digress. Je peux write en mauvais français si tu would aimes ça. Fair warning though, I will be starting with a French tutor next week, so if you want to experience the extent of my cruddy French, it's a limited time offer (hopefully).

I guess I'll leave it off there for now. I kind of hate writing and talking about myself, especially in the context of having to ""sell myself"" (if you were a fly on the wall during one of my job interviews, you'd probably question whether or not I'm fluent in English). I'm not very picky when it comes to people as long as you're kindly, have a personality, and preferably don't have Bubonic plague. I'll even wave the need for a CV and referees! Call it a Black Friday deal. I figured I'd just make this initial post so that it'll forever exist in this group's annals, but I'll also look through other posts on here too. I'm okay with most forms of communication. I just have to cross the line at carrier pigeons; I just don't think it's sensible. Also, my grandfather had a pigeon coop and raced them (actually) when I was little, and they always kinda freaked me out a bit. The smell was pretty awful too. Maybe that's when I first starting developing my sensitive nose. Okay, I feel like I'm rambling out this point, so I'll leave you off with a choice of questions to answer in your first DM to me:

(1) What was your most convincing paranormal experience?; (2) What's your secret super power?; (3) Of ones that you own or otherwise, what's your favourite undergarment design?; (4) Which city should I visit next? Really... Convince me... I'm trying to figure it out myself xD"

I finished a stressful internship this past Friday. I was relieved until I walked home into my apartment and saw the absolute mess I’ve lived in these past few months. I’ve been feeling so stressed throughout this internship that I became even worse at housekeeping than I was before. The thought of cleaning makes my whole body tense up and makes me vomit. I also get headaches when I think about the prospect of cleaning or picking things up. But I think my anxiety is even worse because I see the mess every day, so it’s a lose-lose situation.

I don’t really know how to fix this problem and I feel like I’m suffocating under the mountain of stuff I need to do. I’m going to move in with some friends this summer and I can’t be this messy when I’m living with them because it’s not fair to them, so I need to get this figured out ASAP, which only makes me more stressed out.

e11sx3,4,2019-11-24,Dealing with bad beliefs,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/e11sx3/dealing_with_bad_beliefs/,"I went and had breakfast with my dad after picking him up from the hospital, and I'm about to graduate in a month. It's coming out of my own pocket and my own volition, because what I'm about to relate about the workforce applied to my situation with university as well (in short, my entire life I was told how useless college was, and I've never gotten any kind of admiration from my father from university, but I pushed through that).

Anyways, the conversation first starts with his views of politics and the United States as a whole. He hates Trump (I'm a democrat as well, but that's beside the point), he hates all politicians, even when Obama was president he had hatred towards politics that he espouses every second of the day. There's a sleight of hand here, though, because he believes that society as a whole is incorrigible and therefore the only happiness that exists is in your own mind. I call this ""bullshit buddhism""  (edit: I should add this because a lot of drug users here, and my father, claim they are 'buddhists' and they all share this nihilistic outlook. It has nothing to do with the religion from E/ SE Asia lol-- it's the fallback of being white and nihilistic in America) because first you have to accept that the world is fake and evil, which is a paralyzing belief, then the next step is that the only reason that you're unhappy is because of your thoughts. I'm sure this sounds correct to many people, but actually it's not: try convincing yourself that you can be happy under a bridge, and if you think you can, then stop wasting your time on Reddit and go live under one. Bullshit Buddhism, aka nihilism, is a sales pitch, and the next part is that it's your problem is not that you're unfulfilled with where you are in life, but that you should be fulfilled doing exactly what the Bullshit Buddhist wants.

How does this apply to me graduating? Well, before I can even leave school, I got several offers from ad agencies. They all want a low-paying internship, but one of these is a cream-of-the-crop agency, I joked with my mom it's not quite the Goldman Sachs of advertising but maybe the Citibank. I only tell my mother, because I know how my father will react. But while we're at the restaurant, he starts ranting. He hates corporations; they, like everything else, are top-down evil. After college, I'm naive if I believe that I'm not going to get completely vaporized by the evil system of the working world. The Bullshit Buddhist pitch, that the world is dead matter and only evil human beings attain power, begins, and when I got home my chest was strained with anxiety.

I called this girl who is kind of my girlfriend and she actually talked to her dad for me, who also grew up poor (though I don't know if he got as much pushback from college) and he said that I had to take the job. The entire time though I can't shake the fear of all the details about how terrible it is to work in a corporation and how they're going to try and pick my pocket. I'm aware that the corporate world, especially at the top, has psychopathic tendencies, but to me life is always between a rock and a hard place and to be honest, there's greater joys in having a job that tailors to your skills, pays well (after the internship) and offers security. See, the Bullshit Buddhist sleight of hand in this scenario, I should add, is that I actually don't need to work in the world. I need to move back home and take care of him.

And this was how I grew up, and the more you take care of him the more drugs he starts using, and he gets quite violent, because deep down I actually hate taking care of people who can't take care of themselves. But the Bullshit Buddhism says, ""Actually, the problem isn't that you're taking care of someone who is making himself sick, it's that you care."" I see the corporate world as a way to get away from Bullshit Buddhism, but my head is constantly plugged with these ideas of how evil the rest of the world is, and they control me, they tighten my chest, they place a fear in my heart that I'm going to end up in an even worse place.

How do you deal with this? I'm sure many of you grew up in households where the rest of the world was presented as broken and evil, and that the only security is 1) accepting your miserable situation and 2) serving the person who is making you miserable and 3) embodying the knowledge that the world is fake, terrible, and destroyed beyond repair. How do you move forward? How do you brush it off?

It's very hard to deal with. It's like he replays the voice in my head that says I'm not good enough and the world is broken.  I also work with a lot of alcoholics and they also plug these fear-inducing stories about how terrible success is."
e11wrf,3662,2019-11-24,Most people complaining about lack of skins Ornn/Rek'Sai wouldn't actually purchase a skin for them,iHahahaha,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/e11wrf/most_people_complaining_about_lack_of_skins/,"## Riot August commented  ""Champions like Taliyah are SO UNPOPULAR that people won't even play them when they're the best champs in the game."". Stop commenting anything to do with strength of champ is relevant, it isn't and an actual Rioter has verified what I've been saying

Generally, when people complain about lack of skins for champs it's someone complaining about the following champs. Obviously there are random ones mixed in like Xerath but these seem to be the main three. Their pickrates are (source u.gg , combined all ranks all regions):

Taliyah - (doesn't even have a midlane pickrate but for jungle) is at 1%

Ornn - 3.6%

Rek'Sai - 2%

**This means their combined pick rate is 6.6%**. The classic champion people complain about getting skins is **Kai'Sa. Her pickrate is 18.7%.** Riot's skin team is not infinite. Their resources are limited. If Riot theoretically assigned a team to make a skin for each of those 3 champions, the **combined sales** of those **three skins would be a third** of if they made a Kai'sa skin. Essentially, **9 times as many resources would have to be used to match a single Kai'Sa skin.**

&amp;#x200B;

However, the majority of players are in Silver and so the majority of skin sales would come from Silver players. In Silver:

Taliyah - I shit you not, Taliyah doesn't even exist in Silver. Her playrate is too small to be registered, both in mid and jngl

Ornn - 3.2%

Rek'Sai - 1.3%

**This is a combined 4.6%**, even lower than when combining all elos. **Kai'Sa has a pickrate in Silver of 15.7%**, so again about a third if they made a skin for each champion. It just isn't economical to put the resources and money into any one of those champs. I personally play alot of Rek'Sai and I like her base model more than any of the skins for her. Ornn has one of the best 1350 skins there is in Thunderlord (in my opinion) and Taliyah has just way too small of a pickrate for it to be economically the correct decision. I don't know why people make so many posts so angry about these champions not getting skins when for one chances are they wouldn't actually buy the skin themselves, and two when Riot at the end of the day has to make money.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit - shoutout to the guy who commented: ""*****most people complaining about Hitler probably weren't Jews either, yet we don't blame them for hypocrisy*****.""**

**Edit, some people are struggling so I'll clear some things up:**

* ""Riot might not make as much profit this year"" - League is a free game. Riot has an insane amount of costs within the company on running Worlds, maintaining the game, paying staff etc. Their money does not go directly into profit, they rely on skins to keep the game afloat.  Alot of people have literally no idea how business works. Stop commenting ""it wouldn't hurt to make a Rek'Sai skin"". This is the concept of opportunity cost. They have investments to make and costs to cover (seeing as they're releasing like 8 games this year), obviously, they will put resources into gaining **15 times more money** when making skins, that's the nature of opportunity cost\*\*. If someone asked you to mow a lawn and said you can mow one of two identical lawns, exact same workload, but one would earn you £1 and the other £15, which lawn would you mow?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

* **Making skins take around 5-6 months, it's not something they can just do one afternoon**. It's a resource commitment. Just because an intern did some art for an Ornn skin means nothing. She didn't do voice overs, the model, splash art, particle effects, sound effects etc

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Those champs are overnerfed and unpopular while Kai'Sa is OP"" - **Lee Sin has a massive 28% playrate** on patch 9.23. Lucian, who was pretty shit in 9.23 had a 18.7% playrate. **When Taliyah was in her most broken state ever she never went above a 10% playrate, even in high elo**. This argument is not relevant. These champs are just not enjoyed by much of the playerbase even when Taliyah was the most broken Jungler in the game."

e12900,3,2019-11-24,How early to study for the CPA?,Ineedananswernoww,CPA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPA/comments/e12900/how_early_to_study_for_the_cpa/,"Hello everyone, I’m currently a second semester junior at the University of Utah. I’m set to graduate in Fall 2020 with my Bachelor’s (I’m doing a B4 internship during the summer)and also doing - a masters from Fall 2021-Spring 2022, and was wondering when I should start studying for the CPA. 

I’m also wondering whether EY will pay for my study materials if I successfully complete my internship during the summer. I’m also doing a busy season internship in 2021, before starting the Masters. 

As an additional question, I’m currently looking for Masters programs, would you recommend one that prepares for the CPA or one that has additional learning in accounting apart from what’s learned in the CPA? The U of U’s MAcc program is top 25 in the country but they don’t prepare you for the exam from what I’ve heard

Thank you in advance!!"

e143zi,5,2019-11-24,Questions from an undergrad student working to apply to vet school spring 2020,kapakapawong,veterinarians,https://www.reddit.com/r/veterinarians/comments/e143zi/questions_from_an_undergrad_student_working_to/,"A bit about me: 

I work, have a small family of two dogs and a partner, no kids. I have a year of pre-med club leadership, I now oversee 5 clubs and am president of the ACS Student Affiliate program on campus. I have personally won awards from the ACS and my college for my participation and what we were able to accomplish. I have two semesters of undergrad research experience, community outreach, STEM mentoring for kids, etc. I also was fortunate enough to land an internship at my local AZA zoo over the summer. 
I have a 3.4 GPA overall, and about 65 hours with a veterinarian (animal shelter clinic). I am aware that this will put me at a disadvantage, as my fellow applicants will likely have a higher GPA and more animal experience. I am actively working to find an internship or shadowing position at a local hospital. 

That all being said:

 I have a few questions if anyone would be kind and willing to answer:

What was your experience like getting through the application/interview process? 

Did you have to go through more than one cycle? If so, what did you do to make yourself more competitive? 

As you went through vet school, what was something you wish you had known prior to the process?

Did you do a residency/internship? Why or why not?
— chatting with an AZA zoo vet, her process from graduating vet school to being hired as a full time zoo veterinarian (at this facility) took 6 years and many moves around the country. I’m curious as to what other experiences are like. 

Anyone specifically in cardiology? 
— I’m extremely interested. My last dog had Dilated Cardiomyopathy which inspired an incredible fascination with the heart. We were given 2 weeks - 3 months, but we were lucky enough to get just shy of a year. Losing him was devastating, but lit a fire under me that I have not experienced before. 

Anyone work with wildlife? What is your experience like? SSPs? 

I’m hoping to be interesting enough on paper to *perhaps* get an interview, but I’m not expecting a first cycle acceptance — watching family go through medical school cycles has prepared me for this reality. 

Thank you in advance for any feedback. I truly appreciate your time :)"

First of all my name is  Dave and I'm 19 years old. I'm  dutch, so live in the netherlands. I live here: [https://imgur.com/a/sRVHsV0](https://imgur.com/a/sRVHsV0)  So pretty up north. I love the outside here since we have great  forrests and stuff, tho the rain often is a bit of a dramatic problem XD. Since its either dry as heck, or it storms.

On the same map you can find where I study! I study game development  in Amsterdam. So I am planning on becomming a game developer later or  atleast something to do with ICT. Atm I'm doing my internship at an  company called Silverfit, dont think you know it, Its a company helping  elderly and people with muscle illnesses or brain injuries revalidate  through video games. Soo I do like it here, Alo I'm in my last year here  atm, but I am planning on studying further :P

Aside from the school stuff I do, I have other hobby's I do in my  spare time.    
1. I game. I guess it kinda makes sence if you think about it since im a  a gamedeveloper. Its usualy on my PC or PS4. and more often then not  with friends or stody based games, for instance atm playing through life  is strange, Danganronpa v3 and code vein. But I also play stuff like  league of legends, Call of duty(only zombies because its really fun with  friends) and my most played game probably being OSU!. its a rythm game.   

2. I used to do sports a lot more but i still do them to an extend i can  handle. A few months back the docter diagnosed that I have a super  weak/fragile skin. This has multiple negatives, My skin has a burning  itch when it gets warm/I work out. I Also have a higher chance on skin  cancer :/ dont have it tho so nothing to worry about yet. But when I do  sports, It's usualy Hiking, Soccer, Running or just power training. Used  to do gymnastics but quit 3 years ago orso.  

3. I love reading good books, I dont read too much since i'm quite picky  about what I read. If I dont like it after like a quarter I sometimes  just quit the book, and other times read it through in 1-2 days. But  usualy I like reading fantasy.

Extra facts about me:  

1. For looks I'm taller then you hehe, I'm 6'4 ft tall or 194 cm. I have  medium length dark brown hair and brown eyes.  

2. I used to drink, not anymore tho unless at an party with friends but I  still keep it at 1-2 max.  

3. I dont smoke or Do drugs.  

4.  I love helping/caring for people.  

5. I have a past with depression. havent had it in 1.5 years already but  still thought you should know.  

6. I'm really caring and cuddly from person in general and give my all  in a relationship. Sometimes a bit too much but I hope you can correct  me if that occurs(dont think it will but might)

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm looking for:

1. A caring person, that will put in efford into talking and stuff like that. In the past I have been ghosted or just people not talking even though they said they where talkative.
2. As I said before I'm cuddly so pls dont mind it? XD
3. I dont mind LDR but living in europe is the easiest. Though if I like you even if you're from USA it can still work.
4. I really dont have high standards on looks orso, no matter would love to see you! I mostly care on whats on the inside of you.
5. AS said in 1, I would like you to be talkative, so maybe if I dont send a  good morning message, that its from the other side as well:P
6. and most importantly, I'm looking for something serious and longterm.

Thats about it for me, I have multiple platforms where i can be contacted on. So just send me whats best for you.

I hope to talk to one of you soon!!!"
e163pa,2,2019-11-24,Alone in this country,MrWinterManchuria,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/e163pa/alone_in_this_country/,"Hi i am a student studying in America, I am originally from China. I have been in this country  enrolled in from high school to college, right now I am 4th year in a not too well known college, I do not have many close friends and I found it hard to integrate into communities, maybe because my reclusive nature and  lack of social skills and many more reasons.I feel really lonely all the time since I don’t have many friends with common interests, my friends don’t understand me, and it’s ok because I don’t really want many of them to. I have been by myself in this country for almost a decade, and I have little to none of ambitions to chase my dreams, goals. Compare to my peers from China or high school “friends” they went into good colleges , found internships and achieved great things. And my visa is only one year left, I still don’t know what to do with my life :( 

I also never dated someone, despite many girls showing interests in me, but I just don’t know how to act on it, because My stupid ass just feel Like I am not good enough for them or I get the wrong message or I cannot get into their circle or I don’t know how to make friend with her first.  And when I see a pretty girl I feel inferior to her although I want to talk to her, but I don’t want to be embarrassed by her cold shoulder or to be backfired by my lack of social skills and poor choice of words or some shit 

I feel like people are not interested into befriending others anymore and be more open with others anymore,the people are very different from the people born couple years earlier than me(1996). Maybe nothing changed but I don’t know since I am the expert on this matter. 

I feel like a loser in life for all the money my mom spent on me, and all the recourses I had in life to end up in this perdicament, no girl friends, lack of self esteem, no social network, and just plain failure.

Anyway I just want to share my story because I don’t have anywhere else to say this.

Thanks for reading 

if your situation is similar to mine maybe we can talk about it more!"

I will be a senior this coming spring and I feel like I am a little behind on getting accounting experience. I have had a summer internship - it was out of town. I am looking for something more local. I have looked at indeed and there are not many. I have applied to like 3 and have not heard back. I am also looking for a spring or fall internship because I need one during the school year to graduate. Would it be okay to email or reach out to local firms and ask if they have any opportunities? I don't want to cold call but I do not know what else I can do. Any advice will be greatly appreciated."
e168xh,83,2019-11-24,I just explain a bug as a feature and got a compliment from my BOSS 😂!,CNASIR,iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/e168xh/i_just_explain_a_bug_as_a_feature_and_got_a/,"So, I am making an app that has all the different departments of a hospital and information about them. it is my first job as a software developer (intern) and I am the only one who codes in swift and has experience with developing IOS apps. I am using the built-in core data for persistence. I fetched a list of the departments from core data using NSFetchRequestController and I am using UITableViewController to display. I have a bug when the user tries to delete the last department, the NSFetchRC gets out of sync with the UITableView and the app crashes.

I googled a solution to the problem and came across the NSFetchedRequesrControllerDelegate. I have tried to use it but no success. I can't ask for help, I am the only one who has any experience with IOS. I don't have much time so, I just added an UIAlertController saying (You can't delete all the departments, you must have at least one to use the app), and gave a choice either to reload deleted data from had coded list (initial list) or add their own extra department.

I told my boss that the feature prevents users from deleting everything in the app and using it for another purpose and got a compliment for thinking outside the box."

e17e2j,3,2019-11-24,I’m having a really hard time meeting new people.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e17e2j/im_having_a_really_hard_time_meeting_new_people/,"Ever since my breakup with my girlfriend a couple of years ago heading into college, I haven’t had any luck with dating. I’ve met a few girls in school that have been really sweet, but none of them have worked out. I got together with one girl to study, and found out she had a boyfriend a few days later. I asked another girl out on a date and got no response. I met somebody a few months ago through my internship (she was a customer/client of ours), and we hit it off REALLY well. It was the first time I felt like I actually connected with somebody since I first met my ex-girlfriend. Obviously I didn’t tell her that, but I did ask her if she’s want to get together some time. She was from another country, and I figured it would be a great opportunity to show her around the area. She had agreed to hang out, but plans fell through multiple times, so I figured I would try to be more upfront and ask her out on a date instead. Well, once I asked, she was nowhere to be found. I haven’t gotten a response for weeks. I’m pretty bummed because I thought we really hit it off. She’s insanely cute and such a sweetheart, but it just didn’t pan out the way I pictured in my head. I think I get my hopes up too often. Sadly, now I’m back to missing my ex-girlfriend from two years ago a lot after having not thought about our relationship for almost a month while I was talking to this other girl. It’s really frustrating. I’m on Tinder and Bumble and try to meet girls on there, but the conversations get kind of stale pretty quickly and end up dissipating. I probably need to take a hard look at myself, and figure out what I’m doing wrong for starters, but I’ve been working on that since my breakup. Any advice on what to do as far as meeting people and eventually getting a date?"

I accepted a job as a pharmacy intern with the big 3 letter company, and they threw me in (as I suspected). I did ok at pick up and production but drop off freaks me OUT. I know absolutely nothing. 

When we get swamped with customers, I am THE WORST to have at drop off. I usually run to man the pick up line and leave the pharmacist to do all the work. I know I’m being useless and I feel absolutely terrible but she works way faster than I do.

To add fire to the flame, my pharmacist manager is having me counsel patients even after I’ve told her I’m a P1 and we haven’t taken didactics yet!!! I only know the bare minimum from what I’ve learned from school and work. I’m worried because I’m dealing with peoples lives. 

Do you have any advice or words of wisdom? I’m afraid one of these days they’re going to realize I have absolutely no idea what is going on and fire me. Or worse, I’ll give someone the wrong advice on medication they’re taking and screw them over.."

e19srk,49,2019-11-24,October 2019 Honeymoon - Trip Report Part 1,alexxrosee,JapanTravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/e19srk/october_2019_honeymoon_trip_report_part_1/,"**Background:** This was a delayed honeymoon for my husband and I (23M &amp; 23F from U.S.). We got married back in June but decided to wait until I finished my internship to go on our honeymoon. We have been saving up to go to Japan for a couple years now anyway, so we decided that if we were going to do a big trip for our honeymoon, we wanted to go somewhere we've always wanted to go. We are very into anime and video games, so definitely wanted to do a lot of pop culture things, while also enjoying a lot of the food and other culture that Japan had to offer.

**Spendings:** Total for the 2 of us, we spent \~$7,000 for 2 weeks. Disclaimer - our flight tickets (\~$1,660) were a wedding gift, so we did not pay for those. We also splurged for a more expensive room at a luxury ryokan (\~$740), were double booked a couple nights at hotels for various reasons, and did not budget out anything for shopping and just bought what we wanted (spending \~$1,160 in the end). I very much think depending on what your goals are in Japan, you could do the trip for much much cheaper.

Overall, taking out the ryokan night, we spent an average of $100/night for us 2 for lodging, using hotels and Air BnB. For food, we on average spent \~$50/day for us both, which included 3 meals and usually multiple snacks/drinks. I'm happy to share more money details if anyone has specific questions, but thought food and lodging details may help as a guide for anyone planning/trying to start saving.

**Overall Notes:** I'm not the first to say this, but Japan was truly an incredible place. The services and people were all so helpful and friendly. I'll discuss some specific instances during my trip report, but overall I'd say just be open to everything there is and everyone you'll meet. We knew very minimal Japanese going into this trip (excuse me, thank you, greetings) and I felt like we got by just fine. People would either stumble around in English to help you, or they would just point and you'll figure out what they're trying to get you to do.

We chose to use pocket wifi, which worked out so well. We had plenty of high-speed access for our entire trip for both of us, and we usually only needed to charge it about once mid-day. Google Maps was the other lifesaver of the trip. For anywhere we needed to get, we just put it into google maps and it told us exactly where to go, what trains to get on at what platform, and what exits to take to get to your location fastest.

We used Pasmo cards to get around on the trains as opposed to buying tickets, and I would highly recommend this. It made it so easy to just hop on and off wherever we were going that day instead of having to plan out what tickets we needed to buy.

Last note, we did not plan out what restaurants we wanted to eat at. Rather, we made a ""food bucket list"" of some chain restaurants or just general types of food we wanted to eat, and would just go for whatever was nearby or that we were feeling that day. This led to us trying some really awesome restaurants and I would recommend this method if you don't have particular places in mind already.

**Day 0 - October 6th-7th (Sunday/Monday)**

We flew out of Chicago in the late afternoon on the 6th. We flew with ANA (although we booked our tickets through United) and chose a direct flight (13 hours there). We had a window row of 3 seats just to us 2, so we were able to spread out well, which made for a more comfortable flight. We also got 2 meals on the flight - 1 about an hour after takeoff and the other about 2 hours before landing. The meals were really good and a nice variety of things to try. We had eaten pretty close to getting on the plane though, so we weren't as hungry for our first meal (something we kept in mind for the flight back). Nothing too eventful happened on the flight. I tried to not sleep much so that when we landed (\~8:30 pm), I would hopefully be able to sleep once we got to our AirBnB.

We landed on time, and getting through customs was very easy. I was pretty nervous about this part, but they really didn't do much besides just look our cards over. We then grabbed our luggage and made our way into the airport. We needed to pick up our pocket wifi, buy IC cards (ended up doing Pasmo because that’s what was available), take money out of the ATM, and buy limo bus tickets to get to the train station. We were able to navigate our way to the places to do all this. The limo bus was great for transporting luggage and getting us close to our AirBnB. Our host had actually given us directions on exactly how to get to the station to meet her, which was great. We took the limo bus to Shinjuku station, and got on a train to go a couple stops over to Hatagaya. Our host met us at this station and walked us over to the Air BnB. By the time we got to the AirBnB we were so tired of dragging our luggage around that we just showered quickly and went to bed.

**Day 1 - October 8th (Tuesday)**

**Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden:** We decided to walk here from our AirBnB (\~45 minutes) to take in the city. May have been a bit too far, as it hit me specifically later in the day. But definitely recommend walking around and taking in the sites when it is within reason. This garden was very cheap to get into and was very beautiful. The scenery was just beautiful, and they had a particularly beautiful rose garden near the back. It was fun to see the school kids running around and playing too.

**Shogi Hall:** This was a special stop for my husband, as it’s a key location in his favorite anime (March Comes in like a Lion). It was neat to see from the outside, and they even had a cardboard standee of the main character just inside (we did not go inside to look around however; unsure if we could). Not something you need to see, but if this intrigues you, it was not too out of the way to get to.

At this point I was feeling very sick and so we headed back to our AirBnB (which unfortunately involved more walking than I could really handle at this point). I believe I got sick due to having to take a double dose of medicine because of the time change, so I don’t expect this to happen to everyone. But our original plan for this day included a lot more than what we ended up doing, so I’d recommend taking the first day easy - don’t plan too much and plan time to rest and let your body adjust to everything (we needed this since we were on an opposite schedule coming from the U.S.). At this point I was also so sick that I couldn’t eat, but there was a small grocery store by our AirBnB that my husband got me some plain bread and grapes from. These were really great and helped me feel better.

**Yoyogi Park:** After some rest and a nap, we headed back out and walked to Yoyogi park. The park was really pretty and a nice place to just stroll around or rest. I believe I’ve read that it’s usually a bit busier/livelier on the weekends, so that may be a better time to go.

**Ichiran Ramen:** We went to Ichiran for dinner, and got in early enough that it was not too busy yet. This was our first real meal of the trip. I don’t think I can give it a full review since I was still feeling sick, however the experience was enjoyable and it was a nice introduction to Japanese food and the style of ordering (paying and getting a ticket from a vending machine and taking that to the counter). I’d say it’s worth a try, but also think a lot of the smaller ramen shops we went to were better.

After dinner we wandered around the area a bit. We ran into the Samsung store, which I had seen had this one cool exhibit, so we went through the different floors trying out their different things. The one I had seen wasn’t open, but we got to try out some other cool experiences, and this even led to a couple video souvenirs. We also came across Takeshita street and walked down, however we were planning to come back to Harajuku the next day, so we did not do too much here this night.

**Day 2 - October 9th (Wednesday)**

Starting off this day with a brief story to show the kindness of the Japanese (and also how much we loved our AirBnB host and highly recommend staying with her if her properties align with your needs). My husband was showering in the morning and forgot to take his wedding ring off. It accidentally slipped off and went down the drain. It took him a moment to realize what happened and to turn the water off, so when he got done I really thought it was long gone. We messaged our host to see what could be done, and she said she was contacting someone and for us to just go out and enjoy our day. Later in the day, we get a message from our host that they were able to get the ring out and there was no extra charge for the service (which we would have happily paid because this was a fiasco of our causing). We couldn’t believe that it was found and that we weren’t being charged for anything. We were so thankful for this kindness and could not believe the service we got. Truly incredible.

**Meiji-jingu shrine:** Started the day off at Meiji-jingu shrine. The area around the shrine was very beautiful, I would love to go back in the future and walk around this area more. The actual shrine, having gone to many more later in our trip, was not as exciting as others I saw, but still a great place to go. There was a lot of room to walk around and see things, so it didn’t feel too horribly crowded.

**Harajuku:** After this we made our way to Harajuku. Our first stop was the Totti Candy Factory. I had seen this place (and its giant cotton candy) in a video years before I knew I was going to Japan, and I had wanted to get it ever since. It was incredible to watch them make it and to take photos with it, but honestly the taste was not great (it seemed very artificial to me). Thankfully I was able to finish it with the help of my husband, but I don’t think I could’ve ate it all by myself. They did have some smaller, 3-color cotton candies that I think would be just as good to photograph with but not be as overwhelming to actually eat. We did some other shopping in this area, they had a lot of really cute stores. We stuck to the main street (Takeshita) and didn’t go down many other areas. Another thing I would like to do in the future. There were also quite a few foreigners trying to pass out stuff to people, thankfully was able to avoid them, but this was the only instance where I felt uneasy during the entire trip really.

**Shibuya Crossing/Hachiko statue:** Made our way down to this area next. Nothing too special about this, just some easy, popular sites to see. I really wanted to get a cool video of the crossing from a higher level in a building, but did not get the chance. I’d imagine it’d be cool to watch from above. Actually walking in it didn’t feel special really compared to the busy-ness of other crosswalks in popular areas.

**Genki Sushi: We h**ad lunch at Genki sushi, which is a conveyor belt sushi restaurant where you order off a pad and the plates come out to you specifically from a conveyor line. It was nice to be able to pick what you want and get it quickly as opposed to waiting for things to come around. I was still not feeling well this day (it took my body a few days to adjust to eating at opposite times to my usual time zone), but this was nice because I could just get a few things and not have to worry about wasting a lot of food. It did get busy after we left, so you need to time it right if you don’t want to wait.

**Shibuya 109/Other shopping:** Shibuya 109 was an interesting shopping area. It was neat that the inside area was pretty small on each floor, but there were so many floors to it. They had purikura and lots of fun sweets shops on the bottom floor, with the rest of the floors having clothing/accessory stores primarily geared towards women. It was fun to look around, although I felt like I was boring my husband a bit. I found a lot of the stuff to be kind of pricey, so we didn’t stick around too long. After we left, we went to a large Uniqlo nearby to look for things, and then went to the Mega Don Quijote. That store was massive, you could definitely spend quite a bit of time there just looking through all of the different products and getting souvenirs/other fun things. We eventually had to hurry through as I wanted to rest a little bit before our dinner plans.

**Monhan Sabaka (Monster Hunter Bar):** This was a surprise dinner I planned for my husband, who loves the Monster Hunter games. I made a reservation about a week to week and a half ahead of time and had no problems figuring out how to do that (their online reservation system was in English). This place was really neat, as it had a lot of decor reminiscent of the game and even a set up where you could play with others there. The food and drinks were good, but as with any themed restaurant, they were a bit pricey for what they were. As someone who does not play the games, I can’t say it delighted me as much, but it is a cool place to go if you are a fan.

e1bjuc,3,2019-11-25,My body image issues are preventing me from going to interviews and I don't know what to do.,tongale08,BodyImage,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyImage/comments/e1bjuc/my_body_image_issues_are_preventing_me_from_going/,"So to start off hi! I'm new to reddit and I would always go on to find answers to question and finally decided to make an account! 

So this is me looking for answers to resolve my body image issues and spill my soul in a mature and safe environment. So let me start from the beginning. In high school I was a competitive swimmer, and ran for my high schools track and cross country team. I was in pretty good shape, in the sense that I never really thought about my body. I loved going shopping had an amazing wardrobe and loved to dress up and was really into fashion. My first semester in college I swam for my college's swim club for a while, but quit because I realized I didn't have to do it. For about 9 years I did 5 am practices and I think I mainly did it because it was a lifestyle. But when I quit in college I ate EVERYTHING. I only had 2 dining swipes a day and would usually  stay  in the dining hall for HOURS just studying and eating. I would sit for hours and eat eat eat study study study.

Around sophmore year I started noticing the weight gain. I couldn't fit into old jeans or shirts and started dressing in basketball pants and sweaters more often. Eventually it was ALL I WORE. Friends would comment on how I would wear shorts in the winter and hoodies in the summer. By junior year I literally had none of my old clothes because they didn't fit. Everyone started commenting on how I looked ""healthier"" because of the weight gain. I believed them because I was pretty skinny to begin with. 

For my part time job all I had to wear was basketball and a plain t-shirt, and one of my internships was through the computer and the other had a very informal atmoshpere where all I had to wear was, you guessed it, basketball shorts and a plain shirt. I didn't really have to wear proper dress clothes until college graduation. I remember going to the store to buy a formal outfit and everything looked really bad on me. I thought now big deal, just wear dress pants, a t-shirt and my robe over my shirt to cover up the fact that I didn't wear a dress shirt. So I did that. Graduation was great, but this experience was the first time I had a negative experience with my body and clothes. 

I decided to take a couple months to unwind before stepping to the real world and kept my college parttime job. After a while I decided to get into the game. I polished my cover letter and resume and applied to jobs. I got five interviews the first week I applied! I was ECSTATIC. I got ready to spend some big bucks on a big boy outfit. I got some cltohes I thought would look nice and to the dressing rooms I headed only to find out I looked fat. I looked in the mirror and was absolutely disgusted. I didn't go to any of the interviews because I looked fat. I weighted myself and found out I gained 60 pounds. 

Right now, I'm too scared to apply to jobs because I'm afraid of how I look. I am the first to go to college and the pressure to be successful along with my poor body image is making me depressed. How do I get past this? How do I make myself feel better? I feel worthless and empty."
e1boia,8,2019-11-25,WIBTA for asking for money my stepdad promised me?,PunkinPancakes,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e1boia/wibta_for_asking_for_money_my_stepdad_promised_me/,"I'll try to keep this short.
I'm 16, and I don't have a job. I love animals, and I have an unpaid internship at our local wildlife center this summer. My only real source of income is chores and petsitting.

My stepdad approached my mom at the time about one of his dogs, who had recently been bred to give birth I about 2 weeks at the time to have them stay here. I BEGGED my mom to let them stay here, and she was very excited as well. I was able to be there for the birth, and as gross as it is, life is just amazing. My mom had warned me that taking care of the puppies was going to be MY responsibility, and I did take it seriously! I took them out every day I could, fed, cleaned, washed, for about 5 weeks. 

I was talking to my stepdad when somehow how hard I was working came up. He mentioned some kind of monetary compensation, to which I refused (honestly, I would have liked the money even then, but I'm ridiculously polite even when it's detrimental. Sorry hh I'm not trying to be inflated or cocky) But he insisted, so I agreed.

2 weeks later, 7 weeks total, the puppies leave. I'm heartbroken, but I know they're going to good homes. (gosh those little Wigglers were adorable.)
My stepdad has been by multiple times since they've left... Probably at least 3-5 times. While I'm there. He gave my mom 500 last weekend when we visited my brother as well. It's been 3 weeks.

I'm getting a rather big Christmas present with help of my dad, and I still have about 150 dollars to pay him. Id think 7 weeks of pay should cover it..

WIBTA if I ask for my money, considering the fact that I had refused it at first? I'm also concerned that, since we had no agreed upon price, he may lower what he originally intended to pay because I asked? But fuck man, I need the money...

Edit: he's paying me 200 lol"
e1crfp,3,2019-11-25,AITA for asking my boyfriend to hang out with me over his friend?,blueskittless,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e1crfp/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_hang_out_with_me/,"Me and my boyfriend (Ben) have been together for a year and half. I am 27F he is 32M. 

We live about 40 minutes from each other. I am in medical school so I can’t move closer to him and he loves where he lives and doesn’t want to move. As a part of school, I also intern at a hospital. Ben has a consulting job and works from home pretty much 8 am to 3 pm every day.  He doesn’t like to drive and I work long hours (usually until 8-11 pm depending on my coursework) during the week so we only see each other on weekends when I drive over and spend the weekend with him.

Recently, a friend of his re-entered his life and they have been working together on a music album. This isn’t meant to be a career, just a lifelong dream to produce a music album. I completely understand and support his dream, but his friend is only available on weekends and so it’s cut into our time together. For the past month, he’s cancelled on seeing me every weekend (so I haven’t seen him for a month). I told him I’d like time with him and it’s important to me to spend time together. He told me to come over during the week but I just can’t because of school/work. I asked if he can come see me during the week instead and stay over and work from here. He said he can’t do that because he doesn’t like to work away from his house and the traffic coming here is bad. So I asked him to cancel on his friend last weekend and see me instead. We had a big fight and he said he doesn’t want to lose me and will tell his friend that he needs to make more time for me on weekends so they’ll have to work something else out. 

This weekend he canceled on me again and I said enough is enough and we had another fight. He says I’m not supporting him but honestly I don’t want to have a bf I never see! I’d understand if it was for work or if it was every once in a while but every weekend is too much, when that’s the only time we see each other. He talked to his therapist who also told him I am being unsupportive. I’m not asking him to never see his friend but every weekend is too much if that’s the only time we can see each other. AITA?"

I never even heard about anything since normally I see his social media stuff whenever he travels but this time he never posted stuff which is why I didn't know any thing, my girlfriend also didn't tell me anything about him visiting until after I found out through another friend who mentioned it to me and even then my gf says he only stayed for a night because he didn't have any place to stay and his airbnb screwed him over and it wasnt planned or anything. 

Both him and my gf are saying literally nothing happened and they just happened to meet up because he was there to visit family

I want to believe them but it was really weird how I didn't know any of it like my gf never mentions things to me and I remember I even facetimed her during the night they mentioned my friend was over, she never said anything and my friend didn't say anything about any of it even after

Am I being too paranoid because they are both telling me I'm overthinking things which I try not to make it seem like a big deal in front of them but it just keeps me thinking

What do you guys think?

I’ve been lurking through this subreddit lately so I think this is the best place to write this.  This might be long. 

I’ve been going through an emotional stress lately due to my (now ex) bf breaking up with me more than a month ago. I’m absolutely devastated by this due to the fact that I thought this man was of high value to me by these following reasons:

1. He would always drive 8 hours + 4 hours plane ride just to see me for one day (and will repeat the process to go home and work). He did this once a month, this was the best he could do because before we used to live in different countries and his job doesn’t allow him to really take long leaves. I literally never made an effort to visit him. He always did it. 

2. My birthday present from him was an all expense paid trip to an island in an amazing private resort. He’s not rich so he shelled out all his savings for this.

3. He dated and pursued me with the purpose of marrying me.  During our first month together, he invited my mother to a dinner. 

Last September, he got an internship here for 6 months but due to stress he got more distant until it lead him to telling me that he feels like he loves me less now but assured me i’m not at fault. During this time he also told me he can’t lose me in his life as he still deeply “cares” for me. So we kept in contact. 

Now the shit part is that he still treats me like his gf. He takes me out on dates and is still..very affectionate physically (random cuddles, kisses on the forehead, kisses on the cheek). I know I’m at fault for still keeping in contact and it just made my moving on process a LOT HARDER. It confused me so much. Last week I asked him if he wants to get back together with me and he literally cannot answer me.

I’m so confused with my current situation and what to do at this point. Any advice, comments, suggestions are greatly appreciated. Please slap my face with the harsh truth too because I’m having the “love is blind” moment here. Thank you so much."

When choosing an MBA field, it’s always good for you if your interests are consistent with your career choices. If you choose an area only for charisma or a salary associated with it, it may not be able to sustain your long-term interests, and you may feel tired after working for a few years.

So take some time to think; use your internship as a test platform to check your comfort before you try.

e1gkgz,6,2019-11-25,"How to prevent myself(F24) falling for his (M29) lies, and forgetting about his cheating?",throwaway1234331,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/e1gkgz/how_to_prevent_myselff24_falling_for_his_m29_lies/,"Hi. I posted here a month or two ago saying how I was ready to leave the relationship I was in, but I didn't have the strength to go through with it.

TLDR; bf of four years has cheated through out our relationship, I finally broke free. How to prevent myself from longing for the happy memories and forgetting the cheating? 

Long story short, we were together for four years. Multiple occasions of me catching him cheating, but taking him back every single time. After some LDR this year, I realised this autumn I didn't want to stay in the relationship and I was having a hard time trying to end things. Mostly because he's been so encouraging and practically begging me to move back to his home town after my internship is over. I actually believed he had changed, and I turned down a job offer at my current job to prepare to move in January. 

On Saturday, I was contacted by a very strong woman who carefully explained to me that my boyfriend had cheated on me for two months with two different women. She was very upset to bring me the news but thought I deserved to know. I called my boyfriend and he confirmed it, and then I was done. Finally. He took the decision for me, and he decided this relationship wasn't worth working for. 

I have no intention of taking him back, regardless of how much hell ask and beg. He's already started begging. 
My problem is I catch myself thinking of all the nice things we had, and what a lovely life I have turned down. I KNOW its no reason to think that way, he'll continue to cheat anyway. 

Do you have any advice on how to prevent yourself from thinking about all the nice times? Because it's making me forget all the bad times and the cheating. And it's making me feel sick. 


Thank you for your time."

I am super scared because I got the conditional offer to intern at a US embassy abroad this spring and passed my security clearance (learned this over the phone) but I have yet to receive an email stating I passed the clearance or stating my start date. I’m getting a little worried. Can I still be declined the internship? What should I do?"
e1hloq,1,2019-11-25,My ex’s crazy parents,rebekahmiller00,u_rebekahmiller00,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_rebekahmiller00/comments/e1hloq/my_exs_crazy_parents/,"So this is actually about my ex’s (we will call him Z) crazy parents, not mine, but it involved me.

Z (20M) and I (18F) at the time, started dating in October 2018. He had an internship doing mechatronics and was there during the time I was at school. He still lives with his parents and all that Jazz. His family was super nice. He has a younger sister (we will call her A) and she’s 15.

I started noticing shortly after we started dating that he had zero freedom. He had a curfew, who has a curfew at 20 years old?? They have a farm too so he had a lot of responsibility with that. If they weren’t gonna be home they expected him to feed the horses/cows. God forbid he forget.

His parents made every decision for him. He couldn’t make any on his own, I think part of it was that he got anxiety or something trying to make a decision on his own. He was worried he couldn’t make the right decision for himself, so his parents were feeding off of this control they got. On weekends he had to be home by 2 in the morning and if he was late his dad laid into him. Every now and then he was tardy to work, once again his dad laid into him. He was grounded one week bc he was late to work. Oh and if they thought he wasn’t enough during the week they’d MAKE him stay home. And usually I wasn’t allowed to come over bc they wanted “family time”

BUT

A is in theater at her high school so she doesn’t get home until 9p or later some night &amp; then has to do homework before bed, and On the weekends she isn’t home. AND THEY DONT MAKE HER STAY HOME. She’s 15 years old. A has a boyfriend (we will call him B). B was over one night while I was there and the rule was I was allowed over until 11/midnight, but B had to leave at 9/10. Well their mom told A it was time to take B home and she said “That’s not fair. B has to leave, but Z can have Bekah over late.” After that I had to leave when B left.

Z and I also weren’t allowed to have his futon as a bed, it had to stay as couch bc they didn’t want us laying down and the door had to stay open. (Are we in middle school or something??)

Flash Forward to June of 2019. I had brought up to Z that maybe we should get our own place together. I was sharing a room with my 17yo brother and I needed to move out. And Z wanted to get out of his parent’s control. I thought this was the perfect way. My mom was helping us look for something (was even going to co-sign on a lease so we had better chances of getting approved for an apartment), but we obviously couldn’t tell Z’s parents until we got the apartment or else they would try to stop it from happening. I also wanted to add that we had talked about this together and he sounded 100% on board. He even wanted to go to a furniture store and look at some stuff. I hadn’t yet told my dad bc I was scared of what he would say and I wanted to be 100% on my decision before I stirred any waters. So I decided one night it was time to tell him. I called him and told him Z and I’s plans. He proceeded to tell me I’m going to ruin my future, I’ll get pregnant, drop out of college, &amp; ruin my life. Needless to say I was distraught. But was still confident in my decision.

About a week after that, I’m at the mall with my dad &amp; 2 of my friends. My dad gets a phone call and I see it’s Z’s dad. I start panicking bc I had a feeling his dad somehow found out. Especially with how my dad was responding. He gets off the phone and tells me they wanted to go out to eat the next day with all the parents to talk about this decision Z and I made. But I had a strong feeling “talking” meant convincing us not to go through with it. Meanwhile, Z’s mom texts me and asks if I’m free to join them for dinner the following night. I asked if my mom was invited, she says of course but that she didn’t have my mom’s number and that if I gave it to her she would personally invite her herself. Well she ended up basically telling my mom she didn’t like that she was “going behind their backs” so my mom was pissed at me for giving his mom her number. Oh and to top it all off they wouldn’t reschedule this dinner thing any other day of the week and my mom was busy (and they knew she was too). I told Z I didn’t want to go unless they made it on a day my mom could come. He told me he’d talk to them about it. And I never heard anything else so I assumed we weren’t doing the dinner.

Next day, Z &amp; I were gonna hang out. I’m on my way to his house when he calls me and says too meet them at a Five Guys that was a town or two over from his house. I get anxious when plans change that last minute so I was already freaking out. Then I asked if I could just ride with them (like I always would) and he says “we think it would be better to drive separate.” We, meaning that probably wasn’t his idea. So I’m freaking out bc I didn’t know we were still doing this and I don’t like confrontation. Like at all. I get there, order myself something (that I don’t eat). I didn’t talk pretty much the whole time. They start telling us the same stuff my dad told me when he called me, trying to scare us into not doing it. And they said if we decide to go through with it they need to see an outline of some kind of plan bc they don’t think we can do this. My dad was also there, and Z’s dad brought up an incident from about a month prior when Z accidentally left a hickey on my neck. His dad ripped into us both when it happened. But he told my dad and said he can rip into Z if he’d like. My dad chooses not to say anything to Z, but looks me in the eyes and says, “Having a hickey on your neck makes you look like a slut.” That was all I needed to hear before I burst into tears. My dad immediately gets defensive and mad &amp; says, “I’m not calling you one, I’m saying it makes you look like that.”

And then his mom has the audacity to pretend to feel sorry for me and comes over and hugs me and says “we aren’t trying to make you feel bad.” BUT YOU ARE. After that whole fiasco Z decided he didn’t wanna hang out bc he thought it wouldn’t be better to take a couple days to mull over things. But he only said it bc his parents were literally right there telling us we needed a couple days to mull over things, but that it was his decision. Yeah, ok.

The next weekend we got a hotel, stayed all weekend and did some hiking. (His moms suggestion, she even tried to help us find one) They also knew that he wouldn’t be back until Monday night. We had decided to go see Spiderman Far From Home on Monday night. I kid you not, as the previews are starting his mom calls him. She says, “are you home?” Uhh no?? “When will you be home?” Later tonight? “If you get home before us will you feed the horses?” Sure.

He didnt get home before them. He got home the same time as them. And they were pissed that he didn’t feed the horses.

The following weekend, we’re hanging out with our friends (L and T). Z told us that his parents had gotten pissed at him, yet again. Apparently they thought he was spending too much time with me and that he was making my family a priority over his. Which was not true. Bc the previous week he told me we couldn’t hang out bc he wanted to spend time with his family. They also told him they feel like he’s “emotionally not apart of the family” bc they can’t rely on him anymore. What??

Next day, I’m hanging out with T, we went to get chili and go shopping at the mall. Z calls me before we get into the chili place. He says he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. I ask why. It took him 10 minutes to give me an answer, when he finally did he said it was bc I’m sad all the time and he feels like he’s wasting time trying to make me happy. Which is a load of bs. Bc that day his parents wanted to talk to him about our relationship. I even had his friend L ask him about it and he told him the same thing he told me. But I don’t think that was the whole story. Z had also told me that he felt manipulated into making the decision about the apartment which wasn’t true! It was as much his decision as it was mine. I still don’t know this for sure, but I definitely have strong suspicions that his parents manipulated him into thinking I wasn’t good for him bc he made his own decisions when he was with me and they don’t like that."
e1hlox,1,2019-11-25,Feeling hopeless,AnxiousMillenial,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/e1hlox/feeling_hopeless/,"I'm 22 years old, and I graduated from a top 20 school this spring, but haven't found a job yet. I moved home after college and have been here for nearly five months, and am miserable as ever. I have good internship experience, decent grades, and have applied to over four hundred jobs, but it seems like as soon as I get close to getting the job of my dreams, things don't work out. I've made it to the final round of interviews multiple times, but somehow never get the job, and my requests for feedback go unheard from the hiring manager. 

However, that's not why I'm here. I have this huge weight on my chest that has been growing in the last five months, and I don't know what I can do to get rid of it. I have struggled with mental health issues before and would love to seek therapy, but I do not have health insurance, and cannot afford it. My parents will not let me seek therapy while I live under their roof because it is taboo where I live, and they do not believe in their benefits. I can't turn to them for help either, and another cause of my anxiety is that because of this, I have begun to resent them. When I try talking to my mother about my anxiety, or try to explain that some days, I have trouble even getting out of bed, she calls me a drama queen who is seeking attention. My dad is an absentee father, who cares more about his work than about me. I recently got a callback from a job I really want, and when I told my dad about it, he passed a snide remark along the lines of, ""Yeah, if you manage to get it."" I'm doing my best and I hate being financially dependent on my parents, but I really have no one to talk to, and I don't want to burden any of my friends with my troubles. I've turned into this sad version of myself to the point where I don't even recognize myself, and it feels unnatural to even laugh. I've been writing for a magazine to keep myself busy, and have tried to work on some personal essays, but seriously lack inspiration due to my situation. What can I do to make myself feel better? If you've read all of this so far, thank you for reading."
e1hs7q,10,2019-11-25,No sister is back at it again with the usual bullshit,KittieOwl,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/e1hs7q/no_sister_is_back_at_it_again_with_the_usual/,"So i was there form the very start. Mom is eating before going to the dentist and the my sister comes in. ”Have you bought the salmon?” She asks. My mom says no because we have fished 10 big salmons so why but. She loses her fucking mind. She starts her bitchfest and becomes angry because she wants store bought fillet with the bullshit excuse ”ThE fiSHed FrOM tHe LakE CouLD Be PoISoNEd”. From a lake in sweden, that is specifically for fishing and you have to pau to fish in. She screams to my mom that she will pick every single bone for her as if she is owed that. So mom asks why she can’t do it herself. “YOU NEVER TAUGHT ME ANYTHING” first off, i have never seen mom fillet fish. As far as i know. It’s only me and her boyfriend that know how, AND i would do it for her if she just asked nicely. She also screamed about why we don’t move to the countryside and slaughter our own animals because we sometimes fish. Even though fishing one at a time is better than the store bought that catch multiple in a big net. 

This bitch just jumps from subject to subject and then goes on that she is going to be alone on christmas and new years and she don’t want to live there blah blah blah. No one care about her because she is a vegetarian and that last Christmas she got no food. Except that she did. Vegetarian sausages, meatballs, christmas ham and casserole. Essentially what we got. It’s just that we didn’t add breadcrumbs because we forgot. She could just have helped in the kitchen but she probably think she’s too good for that. She mentions that we don’t want her here. Well yeah, you’re an asshole. 

She complain that i get so much, that i get money from social services because i have diagnosis and she doesn’t... which i’m not getting. What she was thinking about is 100$ for 
a month you get when doing an internship. And you wanna know something real fun? She claimed she was diagnosed with ptsd. Which we mostly believed to be a lie that is now confirmed. And something even more juicy? She got a brand new iPhone 11 yesterday. And i know she is going to stir shit up at christmas cause she won’t get more present and i will get some for under 100$. The budget that she would have too if she didn’t get a new iphone. She is probably going to be even more pissed that i’m not buying her anything but is getting mom and her boyfriend something nice. I was going to get her something  but you can read about that in the next recent post. Also, a man that i have known for 1.5 years and can’t completely communicate with has done more for me than my 21 year old sister. I don’t even expect something back from her. Just that she is kinder

For no reason. She then demand an apology from mom. She only said that she haves apologized to sister for 6 years which is obviously because mom is not the one at all that should apologize. My mom asks for what and she doesn’t answer so mom just says sorry to be left alone. She becomes mad that it is insincere but whatever. Screams that she wants a job, it must be nice that mom is getting her pay (because she works relentlessly and deserves it) and that all she has on her mind is that she wants to die. I honestly don’t care about that at all. Have dealt with suicidal thoughts myself and would care so much more about a stranger passing saying such. But i almost want to tell her whatever then

She goes to her room to listen and sig to some music like a fucking edgelord which she usually does while mom puts on clothes for the dentist. Then, after just a few minutes, this woman comes out. Goes to mom, and says this:
“i’m sorry for how i acted, that i raised my voice” a blind person can see the insincerity, someone deaf could hear the ulterior motive. Mom doesn’t accept. “Is there anything i can do for you, clean something?” Mom say no, the she shows her colors “SO THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO FOR MONEY?!” i honestly chuckled, so it was good they were in the hall so she didn’t hear and stirred up shit even more. In one hour that she met mom on salary day she started
 
Somewhere in the middle of this fiasco, sister asked why mom always have to provoke her and  that she didn’t want to train anymore. Mom said that it is sister who is provoking her and sister told mom that she doesn’t know what that word means and to not use it. 

Final note: she’s 21 doesn’t do anything at home and even horde dirty dishes until mold grows and becomes angry when other clean at 10am"

Very interested in playing one of these prompts or something similar but i would like it to be fast paced...they are just always so much fun! I'm okay with having different endings and feel free to combine themes and ideas. Let me know which one interests you. Happy to do any variations of these!

1) Bondage App/CNC - You never were the most sexual girl but that didn't stop you from day dreaming about what you would want. Browsing free porn websites you would always end up migrating to the bondage/BDSM pages. It was more than just a curiosity, you really did want to know what it would be like to be controlled and taken at your masters will. One day you stumbled upon a website that promised to set you up with local masters for every experience level. You entered all your information and stared at the computer, taking a few deep breaths before gathering the courage to hit enter. The next few days you were full of anxiety, checking the site compulsively until you finally got a reply. In this there will definitely be bondage, bdsm, humiliation, public play, cum, lots of toys, anal, maybe incest and much more!

2) Kidnapped and in the Dungeon - A very simple kidnapping and taking you to my dungeon. You will be tied, fucked, stretched, cummed in/on and much more. There will definitely be toys, anal, some gadgets and machines. I have very few limits!

3) Doggy by pool - You have been wanting to lay out by a pool all spring to get rid of your tan lines. Well as luck might have it, your neighbor asked you to dog sit for him and he has a pool! What you don't realize is that buster is quite fond of human women. It starts off innocently enough, him sniffing your crotch. It gets weird when you are tanning in the buff and he licks your crotch and it culminates in you know what! You will be knotted and full of dog cum! That's when I come home unexpectedly. In my backyard i find you, stuck to my dog in the most inconvenient way. I am definitely going to need to take advantage of this situation. Clearly k9, but also anal and gangbang. There will be lots of cum!

4) Torture - Set in middle ages, you are a farm girl accused of a certain crime. You will be brought to the town square and publicly made to confess your crimes. First you will be humiliated by stripping in front of the crowd, then you will be sexually tortured in front of them. It this village, the towns people get to participate. Finally after you are stretched out, you will die by being slowly impaled on a stake as a warning to the rest of the criminals.

5) Aliens - We had been looking for a suitable human host for a long time. The last few didn't work out so well but you looked perfect. Your hip to waist ratio was perfect and your other scans came back clean. The head of our research group identified you as a possible candidate on the last trip back. We will need to test your body's limits before you are used as a surrogate, and if you don't pan out...there are always more where that came from. In this you will be fucked by aliens, huge/impossible insertions and growing along shape shifting. You are so pumped full of cum your body changes shape. I love distention so there will be lots of that!

6) Breeding Barn - You didn't realize what was meant by the add in the paper. When you read it you thought you were going to be helping at the animal shelter, a sort of internship. What you didn't realize was that it was an experimental program designed to genetically modify OUR species. You can be forced/sold to go there by someone, kidnapped, or just go there willingly thinking it's an internship. You will be bred by many humans and animals, filled to the brim with cum and huge cocks of various shapes. You will be milked and tagged and if you don't produce the desired results, we have no problem selling you into slavery or just getting rid of you. OR you could be working on family or a friends farm and see something happening. When you realize what's going on you start to ask questions. That's how you end up getting bred by a horse...or more."
e1ifvh,3,2019-11-25,Getting a UI/UX internship,nycbeardo,UXDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/e1ifvh/getting_a_uiux_internship/,"I have a question for anyone who can answer it. I'm a Multimedia Computing major with a concentration in Cognitive Science, and in my senior year of college. want to know how can I land the internship or role as a UI Designer that will help me get my foot through the door? 

So far I have rebuilt by portfolio highlighting my coding and interaction design skills, going to Meetups (which can be awkward), and applying to multiple roles. I've gotten a few hits but nothing worthwhile or promising. 

What can I do to boost my chances of applying and landing a role as a UI Designer that will help me get my foot through the door?

Is freelancing also an option even with lack of professional experience?"
e1imkh,1,2019-11-25,I'm lost,whoelse-ifnotme,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/e1imkh/im_lost/,"Throwaway because I can't let friends or family know I'm insecure about this certain topic.

I'm 19, i'm working as a full-time developer. I'm earning about $700 USD between my main-job and some freelance stuff. At 18, I had a ""pause"" before entering uni so that i could know what to do with my life where I moved out to where my ""dream"" university was and found a development job that accepted students and I've been programming since 9 so i felt pretty confident and got in. They accepted me and told me it would take about 6 months before they could put me in actual projects because i would have to get to a decent level. In a bit more than a month i was already on the ""field"" gaining minimum wage and learning a LOT. I worked for about 3\~ months full time and then went to part-time because I got into my ""dream""  university.

I took it nice and steady, balancing a work and study life, but university was not what i expected. I was bored out of my mind and felt like I was making 0 progress towards becoming a better ""me"", but i was having so much fun and learning so much on my job. After the end of that semester I planned on quitting, so i talked with my closest friends, family, girlfriend and even some teachers and my own boss (who I admired a lot). Long story short, I quit and began my journey as a developer. After about six months I ended up having a bit of a crisis because my job was making me do 12\~ hour shifts and working weekends because ""well, you're not even a student, it's normal your hours don't keep up"", but then i learned that everyone in the office was getting treated like that and I didn't know what to do. I couldn't quit because my family stopped supporting me after I quit school and living almost by myself I couldn't afford not having an income so I stayed there.

After about 3 or so more months putting up with this, my friends at work (who are about 7\~ years older than me) made me realize that i do have potential and those extra hours aren't because I'm ""not enough"", but rather because I'm cheaper than a ""normal"" developer's hour. When I saw it that way, I talked with my boss and he told me that i worked wonders but my contract said I wouldn't be payed extra hours and they couldn't give me a raise until after a year (which was about to happen). I lost all respect towards my boss that moment, they just saw me as a tool (and a really cheap one at that). 

I started sending  CVs everywhere i could and some of my friends were referring me to companies they knew. I even got a friend to recommend me to Google for an internship but I wouldn't be able to go because I wasn't studying anything IT related (nothing at all, really). Eventually i got in touch with a small business that was offering me about 400\~ a month working 6 hour shifts. This was after being one year old in my current job.

I asked at my job and they told me that the most they can do is 400 for 8 hours but they can't assure I won't be going extra hours or weekends when necessary. So i went with the smaller business. On my freetime I started doing freelance and now I'm earning 400\~ from my main job and about 300\~ from freelancing. I'm learning a lot and having a lot of fun (both at my new job and my freelance), but most of my family looks down on me, even though I'm making a bit more than most of them, the usual comeback is ""imagine if you actually had any studies"". It makes me feel like I'm not enough, like I'm wasting my time doing something I love instead of something I ""should"". Some family members really support me and are proud of me, most of my friends are also amazed and even at work when they learn I'm 19 the jaws drop. But everytime I'm asked what I study I can't help but say ""something online, so i can have time to work and such"", because i feel it's way easier and most people won't change their perception towards me if they don't know.

TL;DR - I'm a developer that dropped out of school, I'm making about $700 USD monthly and having the time of my life. But most of my family looks down to me for not being studying and I feel ashamed of being working instead of studying even though I'm doing pretty well. I feel lost, I don't think I'd go back to studying just to make the voices stop, but I wouldn't lie if I said I haven't thought about it before."
e1iub6,1,2019-11-25,Best female friend jealous of girlfriend ?,ThrowRAfarfaraway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e1iub6/best_female_friend_jealous_of_girlfriend/,"English isn't my native language, sorry in advance for any weird sentence.

I think that my best friend \[23F\] and I \[24M\] are mad at each other.

We've known each other for 2 years. She's the girlfriend of one of my best male friend.

While her boyfriend was studying abroad, we became really close and I was there for her when she was feeling lonely and insecure, often sleeping at her place (on the sofa) because she couldn't stand nights alone in her appartment.

Last year I went throught a painful breakup, and she was there for me, she's always been there comforting me and helping me through the tough time.

At the start of 2019, she went for a 6 month internship abroad.

While she wasn't there I met new people, got new friends and most importantly met my current girlfriend.

Now here's the deal, when she came back I immediately invited her to my place to have a nice evenning and chat face to face about what happenend in the last 6 months (we stayed close and in touch using messages and calling each other)

When I started to tell her how happy I am and all the plans I have with my girlfriend, I felt like I was annoying her.

This was a real bummer for me, I was disapointed, so I moved on and talked less about my gf to her.

Then, some weeks later, during a night out with friends, she broke down in front me, saying that she felt abandonned and stuff like that.

It is true that I have less free time recently, and I have to split it between family, friends and hobbies, but I still see her.

Later in the night, she apologizes for breaking down like that and told me that she was just feeling a little lost.

Fast forward 2 weeks ago, I invite her to have a drink, just the 2 of us, to catch up on recent events. At the beginning it's all fun and laughters, but after a while (and 2 drinks) she broke down again, this time crying, saying that she feels I'm not there for her, that she feels left out. I was feeling so bad, so I reassured her, telling her that I was still there for her, and that she needed to talk to me about how she felt, instead of keeping everything to herself. I can't read her mind.

After this episode, at the next night out with friends, she completely ignored me, barely aknowledging my presence. At this point I was pissed, we exchanged some messages, where she explained the same stuff again, but this time I was a little bit harsh maybe, I told her that I wanted to be there for her, but that she was making it really difficult for me to be her friend.

Since this, we're just mostly ignoring each other and she said to her bf that she was really hurt.  
She said it's hard for her to handle this new situation, and I really don't want to go to her and apologize for just wanting to spend time with my girlfriend.

To me, she's just jealous because my center of attention is now my gf and not her anymore. My gf is backing me up on the whole situation.

I was thinking about asking her to meet up so we can explain face to face maybe, but this whole situation is really annoying me at this point.

I have the tendency to always think I'm in the wrong and I'm a people-pleaser, so I don't really know.  
Am I in the wrong here ?"
e1j2bm,11,2019-11-25,Re-starting my life,zackychaos13,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/e1j2bm/restarting_my_life/,"In the beginning of this year I finally accepted that I didn't believe in God. It was a long time coming. I grew up in a nominally Christian environment, realized I was gay at age 12, had a ""conversion experience"" at 16, decided to go into Bible college and do conversion therapy from 19-23, graduated as agnostic, tried god again a year later and went back into the closet, did another pastoral internship at 25 for 4 months, got another job, came out to my family, and attended an affirming church from 26 to 28. That whole time I was trying so hard to either be what I thought god wanted me to be or be myself and keep my faith. I always had doubts, but I ignored them until they were too loud to ignore. Now I'm out of Christianity and working to figure out who I am without it. 

I feel like I have to re-learn so much, including who I am outside of god and being gay. I'm going back to school to get a degree in something I enjoy that would get me a job. I am also trying to create a better support network and create more friendships, but it's hard. It's like I'm restarting my life.

Does anyone feel the same?"

In the progression towards equality for all genders, I think this cliche has run its course. 

I started this job early this year, and my coworker, who we'll call ""N"" has been here for a few years but has worked different positions due to an intern rotational program. She started her role around the same time I did. N was nice at first and made it seem like she wanted us to be an inseparable team rather than individuals that are responsible for different tasks within the same team. She wanted to be seen as an equal, which I'm on board with. A few weeks later she noticed that I get more of the technical work because they align with my background and interests. N gets more of the metrics and logistics work because that's what she did before and she didn't have much interest in the technical work. She has a lot more visibility with other teams because she shows up to meetings and talks to people about what needs to be done. I have no qualms with this because I'll do my work and she'll do hers. 

Then she started making comments about my body and asking things like ""where do you shop? Because if *you* can find clothes then I definitely can."" Wtf? First off, our body types are totally different. Second, couldn't she just have said ""cute top! Where'd you get it?"" Then she says things like ""girls like us can't wear pencil skirts, I think you're really brave for doing so"" ???? Everyone has some issue with their bodies but it's their business only, so don't comment even if you think you're doing it in solidarity. I could have pointed out that I wear a medium in tops whereas she volunteered the information that she wears an XL, which there's nothing wrong with! But it bugs me that I thought I made good progress with my health and weight just to be compared to someone to make them feel better. 

N has made tons of comments like ""how come you can get away with resting bitch face and I can't?"". I worked at another engineering company before this for a couple years so I know that even if you're smiling and being nice, as a woman, people will not take you as seriously. It's unfortunate, but I keep it professional and keep my personal life to a minimum. She's the type to laugh at every joke, flip her hair, bat her eyes and think she's God's gift to men. 

Today I must have really intimidated her. I walked into a meeting where someone was presenting information relevant to my work, N was there as well. I listened to the presentation, took notes, and walked out at the end. That was it! She messages me a paragraph basically saying ""it's great that you want to come to this meeting, but our lead said this is my responsibility, so I'm going to be taking over from here, thanks.""

I'm frustrated that I can't just be someone on her team rather than someone she competes with at everything. I try to be cordial and only talk to her when necessary and wear headphones to not encourage conversation, but even then she gets upset and says ""Oh I see, you're wearing headphones so that means 'don't bother Srirachaspice'.""

Girl, I was called into a meeting. Chill.

Thanks for reading my rant if you've gotten this far."

It was probably triggered by anxiety which I’ve had since I was 6 years old. I mostly had IBS-D, until I started taking an SNRI-antidepressant in 2017(for anxiety and depression), which led to my IBS improving massively. In August this year I had to quit that drug because of side effects that affected my heart and blood pressure. 

Since August it’s been okay, some bad days and increased number of visits to the toilet, but generally manageable. 

However, three weeks ago I started a four-week long internship as a part of my education, and it’s been a lot of stress. After about a week on this internship, my stomach breaks down, and it has been terrible since then. I’ve had diarrhoea four times before I leave home in the mornings, and then my stomach is cramping all day. I can’t eat breakfast cause I’m nauseous and all of this gives me incredibly strong anxiety attacks.

Now I would like tips and help, how can I handle my IBS when it’s this bad and caused my anxiety and stress? How do I get it to calm down? 

Please help, I cry every morning because it gives me so much stress."
e1kux8,73,2019-11-25,The OW got the life with my ex I almost had. And I feel very sorry for her,SleepySquirtle,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/e1kux8/the_ow_got_the_life_with_my_ex_i_almost_had_and_i/,"Throwaway because my ex knows my main account. My ex cheated on me a few weeks before he was supposed to move in with me, with his intern. She knew all about me and according to him pursued my ex and had very strong feelings for him. She was in a similar grad program as me so a lot of my friends knew her, and she was very much disliked across the board. Mean to say, but she’s also terrifying looking. My ex cheated, lied to me when I found out, then let the charade go one for a bit until I confronted him and he confessed. From then on he was adamant about loving me and getting back together, and trash talked the OW. I found out those were lies and he was juggling us. He became even more psychologically abusive. He told me that who I was, and everything I’d accomplished, made him resentful and insecure so he cheated. He said cheating was natural and happened in nature. He mocked me, gaslit me, laughed in my face, and blamed me. He ended up getting engaged to her 3 months later and they got married on the day he cheated, on purpose. He is a sociopathic monster who has used and abused people all his life, and I spent all of our relationship being his maid and mom. According to the OW, they are not the bad guys and I should go back to therapy and get off my high horse

Now I recently found out some info about what they’ve been up to. He got his dream job (he has low standards so it’s not even an impressive job) and they moved to a very rural and remote part of our state for it. She couldn’t find a job in our field for half a year, and eventually took a position teaching at the local high school. A preface: this truly has nothing to do with the profession of teaching. It is incredibly difficult, not paid well enough, and I know I could not do it. I respect it immensely and want to make it clear regarding the point I’m making. 

When I found out she finally took a job as a teacher at a subpar high school, I just felt sad for her. I did partially recognize the karma in it, but I was mostly sad. From what I knew about her and what I was told, she was very focused on getting a certain career. She went and got her masters in a specialized field so she could get an outdoorsy, nature related job. She was that girl who refused to have an inside/office job. I know she didn’t want to teach because she didn’t get her degree or certification in it. So how the heck did she go from a masters and wanting an outdoors environmental job to unemployed and then stuck inside a high school?

Then I realized she got the life that I almost had with my ex. I am extremely independent and career driven, and my ex is so manipulative that when I was with him I was convinced that my career really didn’t matter as much and I was willing to concede and sacrifice it so that my ex could get what he wanted. It was never an equal partnership, striving for both our goal careers. As I said before, my accomplishments made my ex resentful and insecure and I was his maid and mom. So he disliked that I had my MS and a great career ahead of me while he didn’t. I was ready and willing to basically give up my career for him because he conditioned me into thinking that was the right and expected thing to do. It was always about him succeeding. He never wanted what was best for both of us, it was what was best for him. I could just do random job A B or C so he could do what he wanted. He made me so subservient it’s embarrassing. He said he wanted someone who would take care of him because it’s what he deserved and expected. Me having my own career hopes and goals didn’t factor into that well enough. 

So it just made me sad knowing that, completely disregarding the fact that being a teacher is great in general, she gave up her own career goals and ambition purely to please him and put him above her. To follow him to a remote place that has virtually no opportunities just because he got what he wanted and that’s game over, she can deal. An unequal partnership. That someone who was motivated enough in our field to get a Masters degree abandoned it for him. That she had to move into a different field she didn’t want and didn’t put all that time and money and effort into because he takes priority. That now she has to spend even more money and time getting certified and qualified to teach in our state. That he could’ve opted to move closer to one of the nearby cities so she’d have a better chance of finding a job she wanted, but no. That she probably felt like I did when I was with him, and was convinced that her needs and hopes and goals just weren’t as important and valid as his. 

Maybe it’s just me, but when it comes to the job search, my SO and I are in it together to grow our careers. Because we’re equal partners. 

I hope I communicated how I felt adequately enough"

He has clinical depression and has medications for it. That never bothered me.

Well, now it’s starting to. He gets paranoid when I don’t always reach out (I would if I could but I can’t always). He constantly keeps asking me “do you love me”. Sometimes In a joking manner, other time in a “your response to my question is serious”. I hate that he’s always asking me even though I do say “I love you” a lot. I just can’t always call him 5x a day and tell him how much I love him. 
He stays in bed all day, sleeps for hours at a time or struggles to get at least 5 hours.

He over thinks/ analyzes everything you do or say. So I have to be cautious about my actions around him. Like anyone, if I ask if he’s okay or “would you like to talk about what’s making you sad” 
he hits me with “oh I’m just tired” or “no. I’m FINE!”

He wants my undivided attention, but I have college to finish, a child to take of and being a researcher assistant. I do see him every Friday-Sunday evening. But I can’t on weekdays. He knew that from day one. I graduate in a few months so I’ll have more free time. 

I hardly know anything about depression. I need help and advice about dating someone who has depression. It’s taking a toll on me. Is he playing game or is this what it’s like dating an individual with depression....
I don’t like him making me feel like I’m a neglectful girlfriend because I can’t always see him"

I am a (co)author of several papers and used to be a huge metabolism/ immunity/ systems biology nerd. Played basketball in college. Generally had my shit together and felt like a person, doing person things, dreaming of a great career, but there was always an underlying streak of anxiety, like I'm building a stack of cards on an uneven table. I always felt behind on things, even when in reality I wasn't. And then a year ago, when I started my internship, all hell broke loose. My fiancee of 7 years left me, my sister got diagnosed with schizophrenia after a long period of unmedicated psychosis which included an involuntary hospitalisation after a knife attack on myself, and I felt like a rug got pulled from under my feet. Lost all interest and made a series of bad mistakes with patients which crushed my self confidence and sent me into a deep depression. They've been very patient with me ever since but instead of improving I keep regressing, slacking and just making a fool of myself. Not only have I stopped studying (I can't fathom the idea of it) but I forgot most of what I've ever learned, I can't even recall most basic practice guidelines that used to be second nature to me. I've developed bad social anxiety and now I'm pretty much a dumpster fire- unable to hold a basic conversation, unable to do simple procedures, unable to care for patients properly, unable to stick to deadlines with side projects, unable to keep a semblance of functioning. My hands are shaking, I avoid eye contact, I am genuinely terrified of some nurses (it sounds outrageous because it is), my vocabulary shrank to grade school level. I was the talk of the town for a while before nurses started outright mocking me and eventually stopped talking to me outside of basic, neccessary exchanges. People approach me with caution and I've seen an attending do the 'crazy' gesture when referring to me. This spilled over into my private life, I've been growing more and more ashamed of myself for quite a while and now I've just given up on living. I'm just floating around, chain smoke 2 packs a day and spend the rest of my day in bed. Remaining friends went from worried to disappointed. Suicidal thoughts come and go. I'm on several psych meds (tianeptine, olanzapine, bromazepam) and in therapy but it isn't helping. My psychiatrist reassures me it isn't a prodrome of schizophrenia, just bad depression/ anxiety/ burn- out/ perhaps a complex personality disorder that manifested itself later in life. I am awaiting a brain MRI just in case it isn't some nasty organic process, but I am highly doubtful. Has anyone ever been through something like this, and how do you recover? How do you build yourself up again? I already work out (albeit rarely) and I'm physically in shape so check that off the list."

Im a CS student and am hitting internship search season once again and was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction to find some opportunities in the intersection of education and tech. Open to technical roles, nontechnical roles that arent just grabbing coffee for people, and research. 

My background is that I am in my last 3 semesters studying CS. I took 5 years off because I got kicked out of school for a semester. I was depressed and hated the path my career was heading. This conclusion came after landing a cushy internship doing fingerprint matching for a company(they went public the summer I interned and I worked directly under the CTO and founder and met with them multiple multiple times a week). So I have some competence, but I left tech about 3 years ago and worked in the nonprofit world, particularly with underpriviledged students and discovered how much I value education as a tool to help people.

Im back in school at age 27 and am expected to graduate Dec 2020 from a top CS program(I wont say where but the 4 other interns on my team during my last internship were from Bowdoin, UToronto, Yale and Duke). Looking for some advice and any leads anyone has. I will be applying to all the big EdTech firms and Google(rejected last time at host matching because of my 1.8 gpa at the time. Expecting at least a 3.0, probably closer to 3.5 my first semester back after 5 years off and not touching anything technical in 3 years) but if anyone has other suggestions, much appreciated.

I was able to get an internship at a local CNC shop during college the summer before last. I’m not an engineer but I studied CAD software and worked with the programmer as well as running machines. 

The company seemed to like me and offered me a job after graduation before my internship was even half over. I got along with the other employees, although they are all sort of tough guy men, and I was looking forward to coming back. 

However, at the end of the summer, my dad lost his job. This wasn’t a new thing for him, he’s gotten fired from numerous places because he just skips work too much. It’s taken a huge toll on my family, living with his frequent unemployment.

Well he said he would look for a new job, and what’s the first place he looks? The place I’m interning with! He didn’t even TELL me he was going to apply there, I just see him show up one day and go in to talk to the bosses. They at least asked me if I thought he’d be a good fit, I sort of avoided the question, I wasn’t sure what to say. They did hire him though, just before I went back to school, and I was terrified he’d mess things up for me there.

He has. To his credit, he’s at least putting some effort into being there reliably and doing a good job. BUT it’s totally demoted me from being a part of the team to just being his daughter in everyone’s eyes. People at work know all kinds of embarrassing details about my life now and every time they talk to me it’s in the context of my dad 

Ex: “uh oh! Your dad is letting you drive today?” 
(I live with my parents and we carpool, since we are going to the same place, I hate it though)

Not only do I have to feel like I’m just here on “take your kid to work day” every day now, but I have no time away from my parents, no separate life for myself. I feel so belittled, and like he has sabotaged my first chance at being an adult. Am I the asshole?"

About a month and a half ago we... accidentally started hooking up. That turned into dating, which no one knows we're doing except our closest friends. I've been having a wonderful time. We missed each other. We are still in love. It's like nothing changed... going to movies, out to dinner, cooking together, goofing around, making each other laugh, venting, having real talks about our most private, vulnerable, thoughts. I've never felt this way about someone before. We connect on every level.

He's asked twice if I'm ready to get back together and I've said no, I want more time. I decided I wasn't going to get back together with him unless I thought we would get married. (We had been talking about it before we broke up and I didn't want to enter back into that serious of a relationship with marriage not being on the table.)

Last night I realized I'm ready. He's leaving town to go visit family, but when he comes back, I'm telling him I want to get back together officially.

... Or so I thought.

Today I was in a cafe working on some stuff for my internship and a girl approached me. She was a regular at the coffee shop I used to work at. I know her name and we're instagram mutuals but that's all. She started by apologizing if it was weird, but said she had DMed me a few days ago on Instagram about someone we both followed who was unsafe and wanted to make sure I saw it. She saw we followed each other when she went to block him.

I hadn't. I opened it up. She had sent me a long message explaining that she had a really bad experience with @(myexboyfriend) after meeting him on Tinder (during the time we were apart) and wanted to make sure I stayed away. She had no idea he was my ex... or how we knew each other. After reading the message I approached her in person and asked if we could get coffee sometime to talk about it. We're meeting up sometime this week. She doesn't want to do it in public because apparently what happened was really graphic. She was visibly on the verge of tears when she told me.

I could puke. The only reason I haven't is that I haven't been able to eat.

I don't know what to do. I feel so sick and confused, my brain feels like static, I can't hold a train of thought. I can't get out of bed. don't even know if I can stop loving him even if she tells me what I'm so afraid to hear. I'm worried that I'm not as good of a person as I think I am, I'm worried that I judged his character so wrong, for so long, and I don't know how to make this situation okay again.

I can't just reach out to him and give him a chance to explain. He might confront her and I want her to feel comfortable talking to me since it must have taken a lot of courage to come up to me. I just have to sit here and stew on it until I have sureity. My brain hurts.

And the thing is... some part of me know he could have done something terrible. The first time we had sex I was too drunk. I was 18 and a first semester freshman in college, he was 22, sober, and a senior. For a while it messed with me. But I had wanted to do it, sober, so its not like he had forced me. It wasn't assault. It wasn't illegal or so condemnable that I didn't feel right dating him for three years afterwards. But it wasn't the right thing for him to have done.

There's no way to make this okay. I feel like I'm losing the man I wanted to be with forever, again. I feel so sick.

He's my best friend too. I can't just cut him off. What the fuck am I supposed to do lol"

They have million dollar houses and hundred-thousand dollar cars lining their driveway - in a city where most people's houses are 200K and drive a base-model Ford Escape.

&amp;#x200B;

What do these people likely do? Is it inheritance? How did they likely grow their wealth?

I walk through Crate&amp;Barrel and love the furniture - but know that in the near future, I can only appreciate it for its aesthetic beauty without looking forward to realistic attainment.

I make just a hair over 50K a year in entry-level IT and cannot afford to accept an internship due to logistics surrounding rent. What are my options to build wealth at a place like this besides the obvious 401K and Roth IRA?"
e1nl2b,6,2019-11-25,Not really sure “who” I am right now,cryptolalias,DID,https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/e1nl2b/not_really_sure_who_i_am_right_now/,"I think I just wanna vent this in a place where others could relate since none of my friends have any idea what DID is like..

This summer I had an internship, it was great and I loved it- I am an artist so our internship was in that area though we weren’t making art due to my position. Building up to the end of the job I was almost exploding with hype over being able to draw once I had free time back, like I had sooo much pent up inspiration from the great environment I was in and had to let it out the moment I left my job. Well, I finished my job and in the first two months (August, September) I just... couldn’t figure out what to do. I mean, I *want* to draw but I... couldn’t? 

The moment I got my free time I found myself totally drained and unable to do what I was thinking. I drew a bit but no ideas are coming to my brain.. all things I was thinking of in detail vanish when I really try to sit down and do it. It’s like the ideas weren’t strong enough/didn’t have enough substance or that it wasn’t as interesting as I realized and had no interest in creating it once I sat down... and now my days feel full of procrastination- I can’t create easily and if I think I can I put it off over the idea it’ll feel empty and uninspired to do. And with being generally isolated (currently stuck at home w dad and brother, can’t drive, friends all busy) I assumed getting out would help- I took every chance I had like going to work w my dad, going to the store, eating out, etc. but now that’s kinda just become a way to avoid drawing/creating all together because of my struggles. 

Well how is this actually about my DID? In these past weeks Of trying to figure this out I guess I feel like, looking back at when this started, that I don’t feel like who I was before this? Not that I am a new alter of something. I am the current host, H, I think? But all around this empty period of months I have had fleeting feelings of the past all around me, dissociating for days, and my head doesn’t actually “feel” empty it feels very foggy and busy. I feel like there are bits of different selfs all pressing against me as I try to function. I think there are tons of triggered fragments collecting in the front of my head when normally they are behind layers and layers of empty space. I know I am polyfragmented but haven’t had a moment this bad, usually I have full on parts forming but I guess this present being Pretty Decent hasn’t brought reasons to form *new* parts and we’re just triggering up old ones. 

I am in a tough spot where I guess life is good, I have stuff going for me. But overall my mental health hasn’t changed and these horrible disabling episodes come and ruin me for months. I don’t know what to do, even if I know more about than I did a year ago. I feel so awful because I cannot do the one thing I want to do, I can’t force myself to do it. I can’t conjure up ideas, not even for or existing projects and it sucks because I *want* to. But I can’t. And throwing in a dissociative identity crisis, while it explains my possible inability to draw right, doesn’t help any further with figuring it out. 

Idk, maybe I’ll just be stuck for a few months and have to deal with it."

A little backstory: 

I’ve always been a person who is VERY decisive, and knows what they want, and finds a way to make it happen. Take college for instance - I pretty much loathed the experience entirely, so I did my research and found a way to get out as fast as possible. 

I knew I wanted my independence once I was done with my degree, and didn’t want to live at home, so I worked 4 internships over the course of my time in college, so that I would have enough experience to be “worth” something to an employer. 

When I was 23, I had saved enough and I bought my own townhome, had a fantastic first-time “big girl” job, and things were looking great. That’s when I decided to try dating again(last bf was horrible to me, so I just stopped dating after we broke up and focused on school). 

Story time: 

I met my SO right before my 24th birthday, he had just got out of the military at that time. we’ve sort of initially bonded over the fact that the last four years had sucked for both of us (his more than mine for obvious reasons) 

So now I’ve just turned 26, we’ve been dating 3 years, he’s also a homeowner now, and I’m ready to move in together and settle down. Weve been to every holiday event with each other’s families, tackled home diy projects, and traveled together and we genuinely enjoy being with each other and want to see the other succeed. 

But for some reason, when friends and family ask about marriage, he always just brushes it off. I’m ready to take the next step and he doesn’t seem to be with me on that, and my type A personality is struggling to accept that in a traditional sense, this is out of my control. Lately I’ve felt really excited about getting married, so much so that I’ve pretty much got the whole thing planned on Pinterest 🙄 

Any tips on what I can do to slow my roll, and stop obsessing? 

why do I care so much when I’m standing just fine on my own, and technically don’t need him for monetary support or anything of that nature? 
 
I just feel like he’s my best friend, my rock, and I don’t want to do life with anyone else.  It doesn’t help that I’m getting tired of going back and fourth between houses, and fielding the “marriage” questions, being the bridesmaid, etc."

This is a long post but I wanted to be completely transparent so you can better decide if this is the team and project for you before reaching out. Thank you for your time and patience in advance!  
 

**The Spiel:**  
Iconic Games is currently looking to hire a highly talented programmer to take over as programmer for our latest project, The Untold Legacy. The game is being developed in Unity / C# and is utilizing Octave 3D as our level editor, spine 2D for animation (it’s a skeletal animation program) and Wwise for audio integration. The Untold Legacy may appear to be a 2D title but makes use of a fixed top down camera perspective, some shaders and a 3D textured environment to achieve realistic platforming and depth while still appearing to be classic 2D styled game. This creates a very unique experience when interacting with the environment, enemies and various obstacles placed throughout the game. We currently have around 85% of the core engine done for the game and at this point it’s just a matter of adding content, mechanics, polishing features &amp; repairing bugs. We have a very solid base and are excited to find someone to bring this game to market. 

**About The Untold Legacy:**  
The Untold Legacy is a Zelda-Inspired, story driven, non-linear, open-world, action-adventure game. Although it is inspired by Zelda it is most notably inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask. This is most apparent in the way we have structured the games world immersing side quests as well as the charming and at times creepy/strange atmosphere. Most people would assume this is a fantasy/medieval style game but that is the farthest thing from the truth. Although the game does have fantasy and medieval elements we also include many other elements such as sci-fi and horror which we believe will be a welcomed addition to a game of this type. I don’t want to get to heavy into the details of the story and various gameplay elements as the game is still in development but these are questions I am happy to answer with a potential new team member after signing an NDA.

**About Myself:**  
My name is Matt and I am 30 years old, I live in Oklahoma, I am married with 3 children, 2 boys and one girl. Although I absolutely love spending time with my family game development and being creative is my absolute passion. I have been developing games for around 18 years, yes I started early, and during that period I have released/sold somewhere around 100 titles. These projects have all mostly been released to the casual market (web, mobile). However my goal has always been to develop games that would recreate the magic I felt as a child playing Link to the Past for the SNES. This has intern made me want to make a console game for as a long as I remember. Although this is my passion it is also my job. I am fully committed to this endeavor and take it seriously. My family relies on me so although I find this fun I also am aware that this is a business as well. 

**The Team:**  
Iconic Games currently consists of 5 members. I handle the game art, animation, design and story. I have two other members who handle the music, another who handles the sound effects and audio implementation via Wwise and finally a promotional/cinematic artist. Currently we are searching for a programmer to join the team and fill the void of the previous one. 

**What’s currently going on?**   
I actually just returned last week from Dreamhack Atlanta where we showcased The Untold Legacy for the very first time publically. This was my very first event ever but it was such a profound experience. When I was first invited I never anticipated the actual size and scope of the event and just assumed it would be a fairly modest convention where we might get a handful of people to check out our game. Needless to say I was completely wrong and my expectations were blown away. The event was packed with thousands upon thousands of attendees at the Atlanta World Congress Center over the course of 3 days and luckily we had a prime location to showcase our game. 

After working so long isolated from the world we finally were in front of people and I personally was blown away by the impressions of those who took the time to check out what we had been working on and the comments of those who would see our game as they passed by. It was overwhelmingly positive as people genuinely were impressed by the graphical style and gameplay. The game had its obvious flaws. We expected this as we were still fairly early and hadn’t implemented much of the visual polish and features we would have liked, but we were collecting similar feedback from everyone so we knew what we should be changing and improving upon going forward. 

**So things are going well. Why bring on a new coder?**  
 So Dreamhack came to a close and shortly after I received the unfortunate news that our programmer was going to be leaving the project due to health and personal reasons. He had known this was coming for a couple of months and understandably didn’t know when the best time to break the news was. It was definitely a blow to morale within the team but we all have our head held high and are motivated more than ever to push forward while wishing our departed team member the best of luck. So with no other choices available here we are with you wonderful people searching for a talented fresh face to join our team on this epic adventure. 

**So what are we looking for?**  
 \- A highly skilled programmer with experience in c# and Unity who can think outside of the box. This game is a unique beast and we need a programming guru to take us to the finish line.  

\- Experience using shaders! No need to be an expert but we need someone who knows there way around them so we can deliver the polish needed to take this game to a new level. 

\- Experience with lighting. Something we have yet to add but still had big plans to do so. 

\- An eye for polish and gameplay that feels enjoyable. This is something that just cannot be taught. We are looking for someone who makes games that feel and look nice. If you’re the type of guy who has this quality then you won’t need more of an explanation than that because you already know what I mean. 

**-** Someone who will be more than a mindless coding drone and have an opinion outside of their craft. Although I appreciate the hard work it takes to code we are really looking for someone who is interested in the other creative aspects of the game. Although we don’t expect you to do anything outside of your job title we are looking for someone who will be happy to share their opinion in regards to artistic, design and story choices. Overall someone who is interested in those other aspects will be more interested in the project as opposed to someone who would rather hunker down and focus on the numbers while disregarding everything else. 

\- Experience seeing projects from conception to completion. This is a serious project and whoever is chosen for the job will be expected to see the project through to the end. (and potentially beyond with future collaborative opportunities, fingers crossed!) When contacting me please include previous work as well as any wips you find compelling. I am a developer as well so I understand that some of the best work we have done is what we may have created for fun or content the public hasn’t seen. I would be happy to sign NDA’s if needed.

\- Someone who has completed projects in Unity/C# and is highly experienced with the platform. 

\- Experience working with other programmers and/or completing others projects. You will be taking over where another programmer has left off so it is important that you would have experience looking at others work and be able to understand and adapt it further. You would need to quickly figure out the code base and systems currently in place while being able to implement new features, mechanics and systems of your own.

\- Although not 100% necessary it would be nice if you have some experience developing adventure or rpg’s prior to this. If so please share!

\- Someone who is friendly and sociable. Let’s be real! We will likely be working together for at least a year or longer so it’s best that you are a sociable person that is friendly and easy to talk to. It is important that the team continue to have a good camaraderie and we enjoy talking with each other.

\- Someone who has a love for Zelda games or at the least an appreciation for the adventure game genre. This is a Zelda-inspired adventure game so it would be great if you share that love to help see the quality and style we are going for. 

**-** Enjoys medieval, fantasy, horror, sci-fi and all around weird ideas in media/games. Although this game will most noticeably be compared to Zelda at its surface, there are many strange, unique and wonderful ideas not typical of the genre that will be showcased.  So if you enjoy these genres and like some mind bending sci-fi and in depth story then this may be the type of project for you.  


Are you still there? I apologize for the long post. I thank you for your patience and look forward to hearing from those of you who are interested in the project. This is a paid position and I will be happy to discuss and negotiate terms with those of you interested in private. To summarize we are just a small but dedicated team of developers working together to achieve our goals. In the end we are looking for someone smart, experienced, friendly and reliable to join us on this epic adventure.   


If your interested please reach out to me at [untoldlegacygame@gmail.com](mailto:untoldlegacygame@gmail.com)  
Admittedly I do not frequent this site much and it’s much easier for me to see your message and reply via email."

e1qm2a,11,2019-11-25,Exhausted and stressed ... needing support,mary-death,BipolarSOs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/e1qm2a/exhausted_and_stressed_needing_support/,"My partner has been in a manic/psychotic episode for almost three months now. It's been really, really hard, but I'm proud of myself for hanging in there, and proud of myself for doing all I can to support him and myself through this. This past week has been so stressful though, and I'm really starting to feel the impact of it all. I'm tired, anxious, and stressed. I thought I was coping well and doing what I needed to do to take care of myself, but the past week it feels like everything is just too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week his sister's boyfriend was in a car accident and passed away. My aunt was diagnosed with Stage 3 ovarian cancer a couple of months ago and found out last week that it's now Stage 4 as it's spread to her bowel. My other aunt has a blood cancer and is experiencing complications. My mum is struggling with the knowledge that her two sisters might soon pass away. My partner's teenage brother (who lives with us) appears to have worsening mental health issues - potentially BPD traits, and his substance use and rapid (reactive) mood changes are becoming a concern. Half the week I'm doing 1.5hr round trips for an unpaid internship as part of my current degree. I started a new job 1 month ago that takes up the other half of my week, working with homeless young people, which is often very heavy work. Where I live there are severe bushfires at the moment - there are so many people who have lost their homes, and some who have lost their lives. In my area we are experiencing a severe and ongoing drought too - people are struggling and there are water restrictions. Everything just feels so unbelievably heavy, on both an individual and corporate level.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner is known to the local mental health team. I've been keeping in contact with them, and they've seen him several times, however he's resisting treatment. He's too lucid to be hospitalised, although his condition is certainly worsening and he will likely end up in hospital at some point. It just feels like I'm waiting around for things to get worse, not better. Over the past week he's started to talk about giving up work and study, because he feels that his 'ideas' are more important. He believes that he holds the key to 'unlocking reality' and taking away everyone's suffering - basically having the ability to change reality to anything he wants and therefore be able to save the world. He believes that he can manipulate the lottery results so that he can win, and so therefore won't have to worry about money. He's having increasing hallucinations where light and colour do strange and impossible things. He's using substances daily - cannabis and ayahuasca. His libido is extremely high, and frankly exhausting to keep up with.

&amp;#x200B;

At the start of the episode I was really diligent about taking care of myself and taking breaks when I needed to. Now I'm finding that, as things worsen, I'm increasingly worried about leaving him alone too much and so I put off doing the things that I want to do. He was keeping things to himself a lot in the first part of the episode, which made it hard to know where things were at... now he's telling me all about his ideas. It's helpful as it's easier to know how much his mental state is deteriorating and therefore know when to get help... but it's also exhausting having to listen so much, and respond in a way that doesn't upset him. I can't disagree because he becomes so upset, but I also can't agree because I don't want to feed his delusions. I try to ask questions, and to respond to the feelings he's expressing rather than the content of his delusions... but it's really hard work sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just looking to share with people who can relate, and to have a space to talk about how hard it is. I know that he'll eventually get treatment, but I fear how much he'll lose if things go on like this for too much longer. I know that he'll recover, but I know it will be a long road, and that he may not accept a diagnosis or ongoing treatment, and we might just end up back here again next year. There are so many unknowns, and I know there's just no way of predicting what will happen... but it's hard not knowing. It's painful to see the person I love in such a state of torment, and to see all the opportunities he had just wash away while he's busy chasing a mirage."
e1sjwo,21,2019-11-25,From Deep Learning to Real Computer Vision,good_rice,computervision,https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/e1sjwo/from_deep_learning_to_real_computer_vision/,"For background, I’m a Math and CS undergrad major with experience in ML and software development (two internships), and solid enough knowledge of fundamental ML algorithms and deep learning. I’ve read through, directly used, or reimplemented / modified most of the deep CV architectures (SSD and Faster / Mask R-CNN, DeepLab / FCN, various classifiers) in PyTorch and TensorFlow. 

Only recently and through my internships, I’ve learned to use OpenCV for their basic algorithms (E.G. MOG background subtraction) and morphology for post or pre-processing. Despite this, I’m a total noob when it comes to CV. 

I’m a bit intimidated and unsure of where to start. To be honest, deep learning and ML seems much simpler; after a few courses, it’s just learning changes in architecture or new algorithms with very little hardcore math required (deep learning is especially hand-wavy). CV on the other hand seems to require a lot of optimization, linear systems (FT / convolution), signal processing, and more. 

Is anyone aware of a wholistic course which might cover more fundamentally sound or “real” CV, that would give me a better sense of what math I should learn in more depth? Sorry if this has been asked before!"
e1t6sh,1,2019-11-26,[College] Start of DB?,Modification,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/e1t6sh/college_start_of_db/,"This might be a lengthy post, sorry in advance.

To give some context, my girlfriend and I are both college students. We met and hit it off immediately though it did take a while to warm up to actual sex due to her bad experience with her ex essentially coercing her. We used to have sex regularly at least 3 times a week and she used to love giving/being pleasured. Fast forward about a year later, we haven't had sex in about a month. I voiced my concerns about it and she said it's because she's stressed/tired/not in the mood from school and her internship search, or that it could be the birth control she started recently, which I understand as valid. However, I can't get over it - my last relationship ended due to no small part in the lack of sex. After another night her saying that she's tired, I texted her my concerns and expressed my frustration and we decided to talk it over and to my dismay/surprise, she discussed breaking up due to incompatibility. After some talking, we decided we should try to work on this together but I cannot help but now feel insecure and uncertain that she's going to leave me at any moment since she's the one who brought it up seemingly out of nowhere. We have had our fair share of fights in recent months due to an unrelated matter that has definitely strained the relationship a bit. 

I have done some self-reflection to my capacity and I think it may be due to my moderate weight gain (but she says she doesn't mind it) and general complacency towards the relationship (no excuses here). I am actively trying to get myself back in shape and make myself attractive by rediscovering my hobbies and not being as needy. She has also noted that she feels pressured to have sex, which I don't mean to do. However I can't shake off the feeling of her withdrawing from me slowly as I gradually become impatient with the lack of sex, as it is something I find important in sharing intimacy and love. She says it is not because of anything about me, but that is hard to believe. I also fear that talking more about it will push her away in a sort of vicious cycle. I have become a bit meek as well, not wanting to get rejected as it hurts not being wanted physically, especially dealing with this kind of situation again. She does cuddle and kiss me, but the spark is just not there anymore and the relationship feels somewhat more distant and she is not as affectionate as she used to be. I worry that she doesn't find me attractive anymore. I do love her and cherish the relationship which is why I am trying, but with no specific action I can take (besides waiting indefinitely), the future seems dim.

I'm not sure what I should do - I could wait it out and just focus my attention on other matters, or has the relationship become too damaged to fix? I really want this to work out and try my best to get it back to where it was. Perhaps I am being immature. Thank you for reading."

I am an 18 year old UI designer without a degree, but I've studied on Coursera.org. I started working in this field earlier in 2018 when I had my first internship at [software company](http://youxel.com/) in Cairo, Egypt. About 6 months later I found a full-time position at a [digital design agency](http://www.tremoloo.com/), also in Cairo where I worked with them for about 6 months. I came to the Bay Area this year, I started an internship with [We Vote](https://wevote.us).

I've interned with them until June, and now I work with them as a freelancer. Since June, I've been applying and looking for a full time job. I've had 7 interviews so far, but no any positive signs. Here's my [portfolio](https://elgamal.myportfolio.com) for reference.

I’m [m21] in a relationship with girl [f20] with depression. It’s pretty toxic sometimes. She gets upset when I want to go hang out with my friends or family or anyone that’s not her. She says, “I should be the only one you want to be with.” 

She knows this is a problem. It ruined her last relationship and ultimately drove her ex away and it devastated her. The other day she get upset over the fact that I wanted to go hang out with my cousin that I was visiting. My gf was studying the night but she wanted me to be with her while she studied. After she got upset she said she wants to break up and that she isn’t ready for a relationship. I don’t think she is. 

But the fact that she acknowledges that it’s a problem is a good step. She told me, “I don’t want to be upset when you want to see your friends or family...but it doesn’t change the fact that I am.” 

We’ve been through a lot in our short relationship. I met her New Years of this year and started dating five months after. She moved in with me for the summer because I got corporate housing for my internship. She developed depression earlier this year and it took a lot of convincing and support for her to finally get help and get medication. 

I love her so much, but I know she’s toxic for me and she has a lot to figure out about herself...but I can’t leave her. I support her in everything. I’m there for her mental breakdowns and am there to give her her meds everyday. I know it sounds like I have a savior complex, but it’s more complicated than that. I’ve been with her through the whole journey, and I am afraid of what would happen if she doesn’t have that support system any longer. Her friends and family don’t know, so it’s just been me for the past few months. I don’t know what to do... any thoughts?

TLDR: in a toxic relationship with someone with depression so it’s not safe to leave"

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

e1y53c,36,2019-11-26,NSFW: I (18F) can't separate romantic feelings from sexual ones when trying to bring hookups into an otherwise monogamous relationship with my BF (17M) + how to deal with a kink that I'm just not into?,ThrowRA294065,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e1y53c/nsfw_i_18f_cant_separate_romantic_feelings_from/,"So, this one is sort of long-winded, I'm not too good with keeping things concise.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I are doing long distance, coming up on our 2nd anniversary soon after Christmas, both of which I'm spending with him. We met online a few months before trying the whole LDR thing, and have since spent about a month in-person together in total over the course of these past 2 years. I'm really not looking for ridicule on the whole long-distance relationship thing or the ""meeting online"" thing, so if that's gonna be a hangup for you, just move on.

 We're each other's first partners, first kiss, first everything. Our communication has always been something I've been incredibly proud of, as we've always spoken about insecurities, worries, mental health, etc. Even though we're both fairly young, we've been really open about our sexualities and interests (it's all legal where we are, age of consent is 16). This is where I'll warn again that it gets a bit NSFW.

We both have a sort of thing for sharing. He has a big kink for the hotwife lifestyle, which is where a guy will share his partner around, or where she'll go around with other guys for hookups and stuff. This is super hot for me as well, though my anxiety often gets in the way of this sort of thing actually happening. I love the dirty talk that comes out of thinking about these situations, and I enjoy flirting with other people. I've hooked up with some guys through sexting and stuff, but whenever it gets to that point or whenever a guy shows some sort of interest in me irl, I almost always feel a bit sick about it. It took me a while to get comfortable with physical stuff with my partner when we finally met in-person, so it's not out of the norm for me. Part of this is also because I seem to fall for guys fairly out of my league, so the guys that do make moves aren't really people I'm into, no matter how much I try. They usually just give me a sort of creepy vibe, which I can't tell if that's just my shitty luck, or if my anxiety is fogging up my judgment when I see people giving me a chance (like the thought that, ""well they like me, so there must be something wrong with them"").

Recently, I've been extremely busy with work for my internship and haven't been able to talk to him nearly as much as I normally would. My busy period has just ended, so this should be going back to normal, but in that time, I've felt a lot more distanced from him. He's normal; it's not him, it's me. 

Now that we've gotten more into talking about this particular kink of me hooking up with others, I've allowed myself to think of others in a sexual way, whereas before I wouldn't out of respect for the relationship with him. The problem is, now that I've started letting myself have fantasies about other people, that I've started having trouble disconnecting the sexual thoughts with the romantic. Weirdly, even though this kink is super hot for me, I think I am largely a very monogamous person. I also feel like I may be slightly demisexual? So I sort of need to feel that romantic relationship and build that trust before I get fully into the sexual side of things. So I've started having romantic thoughts about other people, and that is where my line is absolutely drawn.

This is where it starts to feel like cheating. I haven't acted on these feelings at all, but it feels like I'm no longer as fully committed to my partner as I was. He's recently really gotten into another kink that is a bit unattractive to me? I'm not one to kinkshame, and I'm participating and talking through all the situations that I know get him really going, and I'm fine with that, but it really does nothing for me. And I'm starting to think that this combination of seeing other people romantically and having this thing that I find a bit unattractive come up more is making me fall out of the relationship.

I also feel like, especially as we're approaching two years, that I may just miss that beginning romance of a new relationship. We're still very lovey-dovey, very vomit-worthy, I promise. But there's obviously a very different feeling to a new crush, butterflies in the stomach whenever you see them sort of thing. I'm crushing on these other people who I want to feel that with, but like... I want that to be him, and not someone else. I don't know if that makes any sense.

I'll also mention that we haven't seen each other in person in about 6 months, so it could be a bit of that getting to me as well. Our chemistry irl is great, so seeing him next month will make me feel better, but I can't tell if it'll fix the situation.

I still love him very much, and I definitely don't want this to end. I know I'm young and dumb, and that this is the first time I'm experiencing this, but I really do see this guy as my future husband, and he's told me he feels the same way. We try very hard to keep ourselves grounded and to have a mature relationship, so I don't say any of that lightly.

I just want to know if anyone has ever been through a similar situation before and has any insight before I go about bringing this up with him. I definitely want to have this conversation with him, but at the moment I feel very lost, so I'd like to wrap my head around the situation more before going to him about it if I can.

Has anyone here had any issues like this when it comes to bringing in a polyamorous element to an otherwise monogamous relationship? How have you guys gone about compromising when one partner has a strong kink that the other isn't into at all? How do you deal with the longing for a fresh relationship when you're in a very committed one that you don't want to end?

Thanks for your patience in reading, everyone!

EDIT: I just want to highlight that he's never forced me into doing something he knows I'm not comfortable with. I have a nasty habit of not speaking up when something upsets me, so he doesn't know that this is a hangup I'm feeling.

I have a couple mental health issues that make it difficult to sort of put myself first, I guess. He's been very supportive and has in no way made it difficult for me to approach him about things. I'm not scared to talk to him about this stuff because I'm worried about how he'll react, I'm just nervous because I don't know how I properly feel at the moment"
e1yoh4,738,2019-11-26,What you're seeing in terms of media bias now is exactly why we protested unpaid internships and the like for journalism and arts jobs,360Saturn,unitedkingdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/e1yoh4/what_youre_seeing_in_terms_of_media_bias_now_is/,"Because *this is what happens* when an industry as powerful as the television and newspaper media has carte blanche to exclusively hire those few people who can afford to self-fund for six month plus 'unpaid internships' - essentially full-time volunteering - based in London.

Firstly, that restricts off the bat who can possibly afford to do them - something which is now mandatory to get your foot in the door.

Secondly, that leaves all the power with the employer over the staff who rise up to paid roles through this system - challenge the editorial writ, and you can be immediately dismissed and replaced by someone else currently doing the same work as you for free, who'll snap at the bit for your job and the chance to earm a wage for their efforts.

Yes, we get it, before anyone starts, STEM jobs serve society and are decently well-paid, yadda yadda yadda - of course its great for people to get into those. But countering arguments against unpaid internships in other fields that way is a bit of an ""I'm alright Jack"", that avoids engaging with the systemic discrimination at play.

Working-class, and even middle-class voices are being removed from reporting, by hook and crook. Reporting is how we learn about the world. Right now, its a very small subset of our population that even have the opportunity to contribute to the narrative; to frame a starting point of what they'll then represent as the truth.

We should all be protesting this. And in the meantime, we should keep this in mind when reading, and when thinking ""but how can all the journalists be crooked, or be wrong?""

They might not be, but they only need one top level editor to control who is or is not hired, in order to control by back channels what they will or won't speak on and/or publish. Jobs can be lost all too easily in 2019 - and we'd never hear about it if it suits those at the top of the chain who control the narrative."

Ideally looking for someone to play a dominant female but could be persuaded if you want to play a submissive female. I’m also open to dom males but the role would have to be something I really like. If you have ideas in mind then feel free to suggest them but I’ll list a few below I enjoy:

Celebrity roleplay- variety of options here but would ideally be you playing the domme celeb. My personal favourite is to play your personal assistant but again I’m open.

Someone I know- again a few options but the premise is you play someone from my personal life and we have an encounter and build from there.

WWE roleplay- you play one or several of the women from the WWE and I, a new intern am inexperienced and easy to boss around.

Superhero/villain- mainly into the girls from batman but happy for marvel characters to. The idea is either you save me and I owe you or you capture me and have your way with me.

Teacher/student- basic but you play the teacher and I play the student 

MHA- you play one of the girls from my hero academia, open minded with ideas for this

If you have your own suggestions please feel free to pitch them but if you like one of mine then let me know.

Message me your asl and what your interested in, bonus for anyone that will play more than one character."

I have to go home soon for Thanksgiving break, and I keep having panic attacks about it mainly because of my parents. Recently, my mom has been making ridiculous lies about myself and my boyfriend. When we were going through a rough patch in our relationship about a month ago, she had told me that we needed to break up since he could put a needle through a condom and impregnate me to make me stay. We have since gotten back together but she still makes claims of him not being trustworthy and that things like that can still happen. This is not the first time she has made lies about me though when she accused me of being a lesbian when she found out that I friended a classmate who happens to be one on Facebook for working on a class project. 

Additionally, my parents restrict me when I go home about once a month for the week or for holidays such as Thanksgiving. They do not let me call friends (they will start butting into the conversations and end them), read ebooks (since they think my head will explode because of it), or walk outside of the house alone even if it with my dog to get her some exercise. I thus feel trapped at home and don't like going back, although my parents will start guilt tripping me to make me stay. I usually will stay in my room and watching YouTube videos until I can leave again. They will make me constantly do favors for them at school which they will never ask of my brother.

I have tried in the past to get help via therapy and counselors about this issue. I mostly went in my teenage years and was constantly told by my parents to lie during sessions and would be scolded if I came out crying. Recently, I've opened up about it to more people asking for possible escape routes but I can find no place to stay (I asked my bf if I could have a spare set of keys to his apartment but he refused after 1+ years of dating).

Should I seek help? What should I do? I will be graduating in December and will be starting a full time role in August and have been trying to look for internships in other states to move out, but Im open to any and all suggestions. Thank you!"
e200yz,253,2019-11-26,My boyfriend won’t help himself and I’m getting tired of helping him,alwaystheshoulder,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e200yz/my_boyfriend_wont_help_himself_and_im_getting/,"My boyfriend (23) and I (22f) have been dating for 3 years. We met in college and just recently graduated in June. 

He got a degree in engineering. While in school he had a couple internships for various companies and quickly realized that he hated engineering. But he was so close to finishing and didn’t want to have to be in school for 6 years so he just got his degree and tacked on a minor so he could possibly explore that field later. 

After graduation we moved states so I could go to med school. We essentially moved from his home (where our alma Mater is) to my home (where my graduate school is). This made the transition for me pretty easy but pretty difficult for him. 

He started looking for jobs once we moved and essentially landed his dream job as an engineer for a company that he idolized since being a child. I was worried about him getting a job as an engineer because he already tried it and realized he hated it. But since it was literally his dream he decided to try it out, his mindset was maybe he’ll fall in love with it, or he’ll hate it and finally decide engineering isn’t for him and start a new career path. 

He’s been working there 4 months. He absolutely hates it. His anxiety is off the charts. He comes home in tears. His OCD is unmanageable. He has crazy mood swings. He leaves for work in tears. He calls me practically everyday at lunch in tears and panicking. I do my best to talk him down but there’s only so much I can do. I tell him to make an appointment with a therapist but he’s petrified they’re going  to “just prescribe pills.” He doesn’t want to be medicated (I have nothing against it and really think it would benefit him but he’s VERY against it). I tell him therapy is much more than that. But He doesn’t think he’s going to be able to open up to a “stranger” (therapist). Or he’s going to over exaggerate things and they’re just going to prescribe pills. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. He’s not the same person. I told him to quit the job. But he feels like he’s letting everyone down. I tell him it doesn’t matter what other people think. The job has great pay, and we wouldn’t be able to afford living here if it weren’t for this job. I say we can downsize. He says quitting isn’t an option. 

He needs therapy. I cannot be his therapist anymore.  It’s affecting our relationship. I’m becoming emotionally exhausted. I have so much work in med school but I’m constantly trying to help him. I’m having a very hard time convincing him to go, or do anything to help himself. I shouldn’t have to beg him to go to therapy. It’s his own mental health. But I understand anxiety and depression and how crippling it is. I can’t just watch as he has panic attacks everyday. Where do I go from here? Continue pushing therapy? Are there other options? Has anyone had a similar situation? 

TLDR. boyfriend hates his job and is having severe anxiety &amp; OCD. I’ve essentially been his therapist for the past 4 months. I can’t do it much longer."

https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf

There's a bit less to it (At least on 'social security') compared to the [Labour Manifesto](https://www.reddit.com/r/DWPhelp/comments/dzjbv7/labour_manifesto_page_72_is_where_social_security/)

But:

&gt; We as Conservatives believe that
everyone who can work, should
work – and that it should always
pay them to do so. But we also
believe that those who truly can’t
work must be given the help they
need. That is why **we will continue
the roll-out of Universal Credit**,
which combines multiple benefits
into one while building a clearer
pathway from welfare into work. We
have already acted to increase work
allowances, a move worth £630
to working families with children,
and those with disabilities, and
we will do more to make sure that
Universal Credit works for the most
vulnerable. We will also end the
benefit freeze, while making sure it
pays to work more hours.


&gt; At the same time, we will make
sure those who cheat the system
by committing benefit fraud are
punished. There is no excuse for
exploiting others who have worked
hard and paid in.

&gt; To help those looking after family
members, especially women, we
will support the main carer in any
household receiving the Universal
Credit payment. And we will continue
our efforts through the tax and
benefits system to reduce poverty,
including child poverty. Children
should grow up in an environment
with no limits to their potential –
which is one of the reasons we are
making it a priority to put more
money in the pockets of low-paid
workers and maintaining our
commitment to free school meals.

&gt; We will also extend the entitlement
to leave for unpaid carers, the
majority of whom are women, to
one week.


&gt; As part of our efforts to empower
and support disabled people,we
will reduce the number of
reassessments a disabled person
must go through when a significant
change in condition is unlikely –
because you should not have to
provide repeated proof of your
disability in order to receive support.


&gt; We will publish a National Strategy
for Disabled People before the
end of 2020. This will look at ways
to improve the benefits system,
opportunities and access for
disabled people in terms of housing,
education, transport and jobs. It will
include our existing commitments to
increase SEND funding and support
pupils, students and adults to get
careers advice, internships, and
transition into work. We will reduce
the disability employment gap.



And on page 16 of the manifesto:

&gt; On entering Government in 2010,
the Conservatives acted decisively
to protect the UK’s pensioners. The
‘triple lock’ we introduced has meant
that those who have worked hard and
put in for decades can be confident
that the state will be there to support
them when they need it. **We will
keep the triple lock, the winter fuel
payment, the older person’s bus
pass and other pensioner benefits**,
ensuring that older people have the
security and dignity they deserve.
**We recognise the value of free TV
licences for over-75s and believe
they should be funded *by the BBC*. **


&gt; A number of workers,
disproportionately women, who
earn between £10,000 and £12,500
have been missing out on pension
benefits because of a loophole
affecting people with net pay
pension schemes. **We will conduct

e20ftc,14,2019-11-26,The story of why I ditched the EF I’ve known for six years,TheLordOfRats,entitledfriends,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledfriends/comments/e20ftc/the_story_of_why_i_ditched_the_ef_ive_known_for/,"	Hello everyone! After having read so much entitled friends stories I just couldn’t resist sharing my own experience with this species. It might be a bit long and also it might contain some mistakes as English is not my first language. Let’s dive into the wonderful story of the entitled friend who is also an amazing choosing beggar. 
	So I met this girl, let’s call her Cherry, when she was in first year of middle school (I am two years older than her). She had always been entitled but at the time I thought it was like an early teenage crisis, because let’s be honest her parents are real jerks. But she grew up and she got worse and worse with time. I’ve been friends with her for six years, and she put up so much entitlement that I could write a novel about it. Exemple before we dive into the real meat of the story: when my aunt died, she asked if we could talk because she was upset at her dad. I explained to her that my aunt had just passed away and that I was not feeling well, that I needed the week to myself to attend the funeral and everything. She said ok, and never asked me how I was feeling. The next day she texted me again to ask if now I could hear her complain about her dad. 
	So, the big story happened during my first year of college. It was the end of the year and exams were close, so I spent my free days studying. She texted me to say that her boyfriend dumped her, so I called her to see if she was okay. She spent the following two hours complaining and crying and just being upset because her life was so sh***y and all. When I finally managed to make her understand that I still needed to study she asked me to call her again the next day, which I foolishly agreed to. It went like this for FOUR WEEKS. Every week-end I had to call her (or else she would drown me under messages) to hear her complain about every aspect of her life. 
	It just so happen that she had to do an internship in a restaurant in the town my dad lives in. She was supposed to sleep at her bf’s house (he also lived in this town) but since they broke up, she had nowhere else to sleep. Since it was after my exams, and since I had already decided that I was gonna live with my father during summer to find a job, I told her that maybe she could spend the week of her internship at my dad’s. It took a bit of arguing with him to accept but in the end it was settled that Cherry would spend the week with me in my father’s flat. 
	Between this and the beginning of her internship, she and her boyfriend got back together, so she could go to his house. However, she wanted to see me, her ‘best frieeeeeeeeennnnnnd’. I already thought it was a bad idea, and I really regretted what I did. 
	Now the fun begins. First of all she came without pajamas, toothbrush or toothpaste, so I had to provide everything for her. She explained that ‘she knew she didn’t have to take all of that because she trusts me with providing it’. Lovely. The two first days, she would leave the bathroom a f***** mess. She left the pajamas in the sink, the towel rolled on the floor, left her makeup everywhere on the counter. She stopped when I told her that I was not here to clean up after her mess (but mind you, she did the same in the kitchen, and it was either me or my father who had to clean up everything behind her). 
	At the beginning of the week, Cherry decided that she wanted to go to the swimming pool. But, of course, she didn’t have money for it, so I payed everything. It’s her boyfriend who refund me later with his own money. 
	During this awful week, there was the carnival like right under my window. I could hear the music and everything and watch it from afar, but I didn’t go because there was no point going alone. I had found a job that was starting two or three weeks later, so I spend my days playing video games (good life). After her day, Cherry would go to the carnival and buy candy for herself. She never shared it with me, obviously. It pissed me off but I don’t eat a lot of candy anyway so I just brushed it off. 
	It worsened on the fourth day. I tend to wake up very early, so I just stayed in bed while she was sleeping (we were both sleeping in my room). When she woke up, I asked if she had slept well. She just immediately started to complain about her father, her boyfriend, her internship and all. I REALLY didn’t want to hear her BS first thing in the morning so I went in the kitchen to make breakfats for the both of us. When I came back to my room, she was on her phone so I just opened the window to let light and fresh air in. She just said ‘’Well you know how to piss off people first thing in the morning don’t you’’. I was raging at this point so I said nothing and went to eat. The rest of the day I was feeling really bad, I felt trapped in a nightmare and I couldn’t talk about it with my dad since he came home later than Cherry. I’m so grateful for my best friend whom I texted everyday to vent to him and ask him advice on how to handle this spoiled brat. He is the best! When Cherry came home this day, she saw I was in a bad mood and said ‘You don’t have the right to be in a bad mood, you’re doing nothing of your day’. Well first of all I’m living with you, b***. 
	A mutual friend came to visit us one afternoon so we all went to the carnival. Cherry said multiple times that she didn’t have money so I bought a drink for me and for her. I didn’t like the taste of my drink, so I gave it to Cherry hoping that she would trade it for her own. Nope. She drank both. When I told her that she was supposed to share, she answered with an amazing ‘well you should have asked’. It’s not like I paid for these, eh. 
	At the end of the week, when my father and I confronted her about the mess she had made in the flat (never cleaning up her mess and all) she answered with a ‘well of course, after my internship I’m tired and I don’t want to clean’. Because, of course. My father was REALLY mad but he said nothing. When she left (AT LAST), we both agreed that she was banned from the house, and I also decided to cut my friendship with her. 
	But would you believe it’s not the end. Three days later, I was minding my own business playing my favourite video game, when she called me. I ignored her, she kept calling for like five minutes. Then she spammed me with texts, then on messenger, then tried to call me on messenger too. At this point I just want to tell her to go f*** a rabbid dog, but I text her back saying a lie like I’m outside with friends and in the middle of something so she has to make it quick. 
	She straight up asks me to pay her and her bf’s bus trip to a nearby town, round trip. Of course I refuse, and then she calls me a fake friend and starts to ignore me. 
	After that, with the help of my mom to stay as calm as possible, I wrote her a very long message explaining that I was done with her, and why (mostly because it was a one-sided friendship, and that she never ever did anything to help me when I was in time of need). She just answered with a ‘wtf is wrong with you’.
	It’s been two years and I never answered. 

TL;DR: entitled friend stays at my dad’s house for a week, makes it a mess, thinks I’m her servant, makes me pay for everything, and then tells me I’m a bad friend because I didn’t give her money. 	

Thank you for reading! She did so much things like that during our six years of ‘friendship’, let me know if you want me to share them! Now we just joke about it with my best friend, he said that if he ever meet her in person he’ll slap her in the face 😂"

Quick question, how does someone find a job with Rust? I'm a university student in my fourth year of Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science and I'd love to find an internship for the summer working with Rust! 

I've also tweeted asking this [here](https://twitter.com/danologue/status/1199368148862095362) if you wanna join the conversation."

I'm an only child to a single parent and it is really really heavy on me. I have always had a strong bond with my mother. It has always been just her and I. She is a waitress and has worked full time all of my life to support me, which meant I stayed home alone all night from the age of 10. I was very depressed and suicidal throughout highschool. My grades suffered and I barely graduated but pushed myself only to make my mom proud.

I decided to go to a local community college and move out with my boyfriend. I worked extremely hard in the first few years of college. Working full time, going school full time and paying bills was a lot, but I still found that the hardest thing was feeling as if I abandoned my mom because she seemed extremely lonely. My mom started to struggle financially, and I was helping her with $600+ for months at a time. 

5 years later into college, I got a full-ride scholarship and an amazing internship that helps me pay my bills but my mom is still struggling and in between jobs. I want to help her and continue to offer financial support out of my savings but also starting to resent the situation because she doesn't seem like she is trying to hold down a job. She has no one to help her (our family is extremely small) and I feel like I need to take care of her at 23 years old when I have a lot of other responsibilities.

My question is: Am I just being selfish that I am starting to resent my situation with my mom? I would bleed my savings dry before letting her get evicted but I also feel super discouraged that I'm in this situation and feel like I have to work way harder than need be because my mom doesn't lower her standards when looking for a restaurant job at 54 years old. Has anyone else struggled with feeling like they need to provide for their parent (s) and almost parent their parent? Any advice on how to handle financial responsibilities as a broke college student trying to make enough for own rent and help out parents at the same time? Do I owe this to her because she raised me single-handedly all my life? I'm just feeling really down about my situation and trying to remain positive but any advice would help....."

Everything started happily enough at first. My wife and my twin sister Sam went out Friday night – they’d done it multiple times in the past and I was glad they got along so well – and I’d spent some time with coworkers. Most of them got drunk and I played designated driver. I’ve just never been a huge drinker; the loss of control unnerved me the first time I got seriously wasted and I never went back.

Around 11 that night my phone chimed with a text from my wife. She said she was tired and had a little too much drink, so she planned on crashing at Sam’s little apartment on the other side of town. I replied as quickly as I could, explained that I was glad she was being safe and that I loved her.

The next morning I got a shock with my wife walked in around 10 with my twin sister in toe. She’d driven her car to Sam’s so I figured she’d just drive herself home. With Sam here, one of us would have to give her a ride back to her place. It wasn’t a big deal, but it just felt unnecessary.

They came in the front door. They whispered to each other and neither smiled when I walked into the foyer. I gave my wife a kiss on the lips and my sister a kiss on the cheek; both smiled then, but the expressions didn’t reach their eyes. “Can we sit and talk for a minute?” my wife asked.

We sat around the kitchen table together. My wife and Sam shared a look before she began speaking. “Hun,” she started, “this isn’t going to be easy to tell you…but, uhm, last night I didn’t just crash at Sam’s place. I mean we *were* at Sam’s place but – damn it, this is hard. The thing is, well, Sam and I, we…we didn’t just sleep.”

I tried to follow to where she was clearly leading me, but I had trouble making sense of things. “So what?” I asked. “You played board games or did your nails or talked Chomsky. What are you trying to get at?”

“Babe, Sam and I, well, the thing is…we had sex last night.”

I jumped to my feet so quickly the chair tipped over behind me. “What the fuck?!” I cried. “With who?!”

They glanced back at each other. For the life of me, it looked like they hadn’t expected that question. Sam spoke for the first time, but she didn’t meet my eyes. “With each other, bro.”

The look of shock on my face must have been comical. Sam having sex with a woman didn’t shock me; I’d known my twin was a lesbian since July Fourth when we were thirteen and she came out to me under the cover of fireworks. My wife? *With* Sam? That was a shock.

“Look, there’s more,” my wife said.

“Oh, OK,” I replied. “I suppose now you’re going to tell me Sam is suddenly bi and wants a boyfriend?” I asked, laughing at how ridiculous the notion was.

Neither woman smiled.

“The thing is…” my wife continued, struggling for the words. “…Sam and I have…fallen in love. I’m sorry. I’m going to file for divorce tomorrow.”

I was in shock. I looked back and forth between them while waiting for a punch line that never came. The anger flashed red at the edges of my vision. “Are you fucking kidding me?!” I shouted.

My wife kept talking. Her voice shook a little as she spoke. “I’ve always felt a little out of sorts, even growing up. I couldn’t put a finger on it until I started spending a lot of time with Sam. At some point I just…I realized she’s who I’m meant to be with.”

“We didn’t mean for it to happen, Dean,” Sam interjected. “We were just spending time together as friends and it happened.”

“Well that just makes me feel SO much better!” I snapped. “I can cling to the fact that my wife and sister didn’t *mean* to be betray me! It just HAPPENED!”

“Dean, I know this is upsetting…” my sister started.

“Do you, Sam?!” I shouted, interrupting her. “Do you know this is upsetting? You know this…how? From the last time I stole someone from you?” I asked. “Oh – right! I never have!” I continued. “Fuck you, Sam. Get the fuck out of my house and never speak to me again. I don’t have a twin any longer. Take your slut with you.”

I didn’t realize I’d thrown the coffee mug until it shattered into a million pieces against the kitchen wall. Ceramic shards and drops of coffee flew everywhere.

“Dean, please, we need to talk this out. You’ll see this is…” Sam began again.

“Was I in any way not fucking clear when I said to get the fuck out of my house?”

“Don’t do this,” my wife begged. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

“Get. Out. Now.”

***

I met my wife in college at the end of our junior year. She was curvaceous and lively, with straight hair that hung to the middle of her back. I’d seen her on campus before but we’d never shared classes nor run into one another in social situations. I recognized her face as being someone I’d seen before, but that was it.

That changed at the end of our junior year. We shared an internship program that required a lot of group work. From there our romance blossomed and we married shortly after graduation.

We’d been married for three years and together for dive when my twin sister Sam came back to town. She’d gone out of state for college on a crew scholarship, wanting to make her own identity after eighteen years as one half of “Dean and Sam.”

(Yes, we heard all the jokes. We even went as the characters for Halloween one year. Please don’t make more of them.)

She spent the first three years after graduation working her tail off and moving up her company. She rarely took time off and only came back home twice. She didn’t even make it to my wedding because she was in France on business at the time and couldn’t get away.

Sam and I were inseparable growing up. Obviously not identical twins, we were alike in nearly every other conceivable way. We were rarely apart for any length of time same gender-specific activities and could usually finish one another’s thoughts and sentences without much effort. Sam’s departure for college was rough on the two of us, but at the time I remember thinking it gave us some much needed individual identity: “Dean” and “Sam,” rather than “Dean and Sam.”

With her promotion back to our hometown, I felt complete again. My wife and I often did double dates with Sam and her girlfriends. Her orientation wasn’t a factor. We both figured it was one more way we were alike – we both liked girls.

None of those relationships ever lasted a long time. I felt bad for her; my sister was a loving and kind person, and she deserved to have someone in her life that saw that. She spent a lot of time with my wife and I, or with our parents. We were change-of-life babies, but our parents never let us know it. They were the most involved out of anyone in any of our activities and supported Sam when she came out. In a lot of ways, we had a Norman Rockwell childhood.

As time went on Sam and my wife started going out more on their own; without me, to clarify. We all thought that I was scaring off any prospective dates that might have been interested in Sam because a man being there gave the subconscious notion that both Sam and my wife were straight. At some point these “girl nights” had become an opportunity to go on dates without me any the wiser.

I was dumb and naïve, but why would I have worried? My wife was with my twin sister, my best friend since the womb. She’d never let anything untoward happen.

As it turned out, she did have my back – long enough to stab me in it.

***

In the silence that echoed after the coffee cup explosion, my wife and Sam finally left. I was absolutely livid. My twin sister stealing my wife? My world turned into a fucking Lifetime move overnight. I wanted to destroy everything in the house but I couldn’t manage it. Instead I went for a walk, right out the front door. I didn’t think about the fact that I’d left my phone on the kitchen counter where it had been charging.

If I had, I probably would have left it anyway.

I paid no attention to where I walked. I’d been gone nearly four hours by the time I got back to the house. I slid my key into the lock only to find it already open. My father was at the kitchen table when I walked in. The coffee and mug had been cleaned up.

“There you are,” he said. Dad was a large man gone to seed – he was healthy but overweight with age, with a shock of grey-white hair and robin’s egg blue eyes that neither of his children had inherited. “We’ve been worried sick. You didn’t answer your phone and when I got here there wasn’t anyone home. The front door wasn’t even locked.”

“Why so worried, Pop?” I asked.

As if I didn’t know.

“Look, Dean,” Dad continued, “we know what’s going on. Sam and…they came over right after they left here. They told us everything. We tried calling to make sure you were OK and nobody could reach you. Your mother made me drive over. Let me report in.” He pulled out his phone and called Mom. Her picture popped up on the screen. “Yeah, he’s here now,” he said. “I don’t know. We haven’t talked about it. I’ll be home when I can.”

Dad hung up and stuck the phone in his pocket. “Your mother thought you would ‘do something foolish,’” he said, making air quotes with his fingers, “so she sent me over. How are you doing son?”

I stared at him. “I’m fucking peachy, Dad. How are you?”

He sighed. “I’m not going to pretend I know how you feel. This was obviously a shock. I hope you’ve had time to calm down so we can all talk about this.”

“All who?” I asked. It took me a minute to realize my voice was ice cold.

“You, your Mother and I,” Dad replied. “Sam and-”

“Not only ‘no,’ but *fuck* no,” I interrupted. “I don’t have a sister and have no desire to speak to my soon-to-be ex wife. She wants out? Fuck her, she’s out. Just have her lawyer send me the paperwork and promise to never speak to me again and I’m gold.”

Dad ran a hand through his hair. “I know you’re upset. I know you don’t mean that about your sister…”

“I completely mean it, Dad. You’re in a tough spot and I recognize that,” I added, “but don’t put yourself in the middle of this.”

“C’mon son,” he pressed. “Besides your mother and I, Sam is the only family you have. You don’t seriously intend to turn your back on her for the rest of your life, do you?”

“That’s absolutely what I intend on doing,” I answered. “If that’s a problem for her perhaps she should have thought about losing her brother before she decided to steal my wife.” Dad bristled at the language I used. “I’m done with her, Dad. I’m done with the both of them.”

Dad sighed and stood up. “All right, son. I know how you get when you feel cornered.” He gave me a handshake and a hug. “At least I know you’re safe. Maybe we can…readdress all this when you’ve had more time to calm down.”

“That’s not needed, Dad,” I said as I walked him to the door. “Tell Mom I love her. My decision stands.”

When he left I locked the door and finally checked my phone. The texts went from “give us a call so we can talk” to “please let us know you’re alive” to “I thought we were closer than this” from Sam. I shut the thing off and walked upstairs. When I stepped into the shower, I finally let myself cry.

Dad hung up and stuck the phone in his pocket. “Your mother thought you would ‘do something foolish,’” he said, making air quotes with his fingers, “so she sent me over. How are you doing son?”

I stared at him. “I’m fucking peachy, Dad. How are you?”

He sighed. “I’m not going to pretend I know how you feel. This was obviously a shock. I hope you’ve had time to calm down so we can all talk about this.”

“All who?” I asked. It took me a minute to realize my voice was ice cold.

“You, your Mother and I,” Dad replied. “Sam and-”

“Not only ‘no,’ but *fuck* no,” I interrupted. “I don’t have a sister and have no desire to speak to my soon-to-be ex wife. She wants out? Fuck her, she’s out. Just have her lawyer send me the paperwork and promise to never speak to me again and I’m gold.”

Dad ran a hand through his hair. “I know you’re upset. I know you don’t mean that about your sister…”

“I completely mean it, Dad. You’re in a tough spot and I recognize that,” I added, “but don’t put yourself in the middle of this.”

“C’mon son,” he pressed. “Besides your mother and I, Sam is the only family you have. You don’t seriously intend to turn your back on her for the rest of your life, do you?”

“That’s absolutely what I intend on doing,” I answered. “If that’s a problem for her perhaps she should have thought about losing her brother before she decided to steal my wife.” Dad bristled at the language I used. “I’m done with her, Dad. I’m done with the both of them.”

Dad sighed and stood up. “All right, son. I know how you get when you feel cornered.” He gave me a handshake and a hug. “At least I know you’re safe. Maybe we can…readdress all this when you’ve had more time to calm down.”

“That’s not needed, Dad,” I said as I walked him to the door. “Tell Mom I love her. My decision stands.”

When he left I locked the door and finally checked my phone. The texts went from “give us a call so we can talk” to “please let us know you’re alive” to “I thought we were closer than this” from Sam. I shut the thing off and walked upstairs. When I stepped into the shower, I finally let myself cry.

***

Everything started happily enough at first. My wife and my twin sister Sam went out Friday night – they’d done it multiple times in the past and I was glad they got along so well – and I’d spent some time with coworkers. Most of them got drunk and I played designated driver. I’ve just never been a huge drinker; the loss of control unnerved me the first time I got seriously wasted and I never went back.

Around 11 that night my phone chimed with a text from my wife. She said she was tired and had a little too much drink, so she planned on crashing at Sam’s little apartment on the other side of town. I replied as quickly as I could, explained that I was glad she was being safe and that I loved her.

The next morning I got a shock with my wife walked in around 10 with my twin sister in toe. She’d driven her car to Sam’s so I figured she’d just drive herself home. With Sam here, one of us would have to give her a ride back to her place. It wasn’t a big deal, but it just felt unnecessary.

They came in the front door. They whispered to each other and neither smiled when I walked into the foyer. I gave my wife a kiss on the lips and my sister a kiss on the cheek; both smiled then, but the expressions didn’t reach their eyes. “Can we sit and talk for a minute?” my wife asked.

We sat around the kitchen table together. My wife and Sam shared a look before she began speaking. “Hun,” she started, “this isn’t going to be easy to tell you…but, uhm, last night I didn’t just crash at Sam’s place. I mean we *were* at Sam’s place but – damn it, this is hard. The thing is, well, Sam and I, we…we didn’t just sleep.”

I tried to follow to where she was clearly leading me, but I had trouble making sense of things. “So what?” I asked. “You played board games or did your nails or talked Chomsky. What are you trying to get at?”

“Babe, Sam and I, well, the thing is…we had sex last night.”

I jumped to my feet so quickly the chair tipped over behind me. “What the fuck?!” I cried. “With who?!”

They glanced back at each other. For the life of me, it looked like they hadn’t expected that question. Sam spoke for the first time, but she didn’t meet my eyes. “With each other, bro.”

The look of shock on my face must have been comical. Sam having sex with a woman didn’t shock me; I’d known my twin was a lesbian since July Fourth when we were thirteen and she came out to me under the cover of fireworks. My wife? *With* Sam? That was a shock.

“Look, there’s more,” my wife said.

“Oh, OK,” I replied. “I suppose now you’re going to tell me Sam is suddenly bi and wants a boyfriend?” I asked, laughing at how ridiculous the notion was.

Neither woman smiled.

“The thing is…” my wife continued, struggling for the words. “…Sam and I have…fallen in love. I’m sorry. I’m going to file for divorce tomorrow.”

I was in shock. I looked back and forth between them while waiting for a punch line that never came. The anger flashed red at the edges of my vision. “Are you fucking kidding me?!” I shouted.

My wife kept talking. Her voice shook a little as she spoke. “I’ve always felt a little out of sorts, even growing up. I couldn’t put a finger on it until I started spending a lot of time with Sam. At some point I just…I realized she’s who I’m meant to be with.”

“We didn’t mean for it to happen, Dean,” Sam interjected. “We were just spending time together as friends and it happened.”

“Well that just makes me feel SO much better!” I snapped. “I can cling to the fact that my wife and sister didn’t *mean* to be betray me! It just HAPPENED!”

“Dean, I know this is upsetting…” my sister started.

“Do you, Sam?!” I shouted, interrupting her. “Do you know this is upsetting? You know this…how? From the last time I stole someone from you?” I asked. “Oh – right! I never have!” I continued. “Fuck you, Sam. Get the fuck out of my house and never speak to me again. I don’t have a twin any longer. Take your slut with you.”

I didn’t realize I’d thrown the coffee mug until it shattered into a million pieces against the kitchen wall. Ceramic shards and drops of coffee flew everywhere.

“Dean, please, we need to talk this out. You’ll see this is…” Sam began again.

“Was I in any way not fucking clear when I said to get the fuck out of my house?”

“Don’t do this,” my wife begged. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

“Get. Out. Now.”

***

I met my wife in college at the end of our junior year. She was curvaceous and lively, with straight hair that hung to the middle of her back. I’d seen her on campus before but we’d never shared classes nor run into one another in social situations. I recognized her face as being someone I’d seen before, but that was it.

That changed at the end of our junior year. We shared an internship program that required a lot of group work. From there our romance blossomed and we married shortly after graduation.

We’d been married for three years and together for dive when my twin sister Sam came back to town. She’d gone out of state for college on a crew scholarship, wanting to make her own identity after eighteen years as one half of “Dean and Sam.”

(Yes, we heard all the jokes. We even went as the characters for Halloween one year. Please don’t make more of them.)

She spent the first three years after graduation working her tail off and moving up her company. She rarely took time off and only came back home twice. She didn’t even make it to my wedding because she was in France on business at the time and couldn’t get away.

Sam and I were inseparable growing up. Obviously not identical twins, we were alike in nearly every other conceivable way. We were rarely apart for any length of time same gender-specific activities and could usually finish one another’s thoughts and sentences without much effort. Sam’s departure for college was rough on the two of us, but at the time I remember thinking it gave us some much needed individual identity: “Dean” and “Sam,” rather than “Dean and Sam.”

With her promotion back to our hometown, I felt complete again. My wife and I often did double dates with Sam and her girlfriends. Her orientation wasn’t a factor. We both figured it was one more way we were alike – we both liked girls.

None of those relationships ever lasted a long time. I felt bad for her; my sister was a loving and kind person, and she deserved to have someone in her life that saw that. She spent a lot of time with my wife and I, or with our parents. We were change-of-life babies, but our parents never let us know it. They were the most involved out of anyone in any of our activities and supported Sam when she came out. In a lot of ways, we had a Norman Rockwell childhood.

As time went on Sam and my wife started going out more on their own; without me, to clarify. We all thought that I was scaring off any prospective dates that might have been interested in Sam because a man being there gave the subconscious notion that both Sam and my wife were straight. At some point these “girl nights” had become an opportunity to go on dates without me any the wiser.

I was dumb and naïve, but why would I have worried? My wife was with my twin sister, my best friend since the womb. She’d never let anything untoward happen.

As it turned out, she did have my back – long enough to stab me in it.

***

In the silence that echoed after the coffee cup explosion, my wife and Sam finally left. I was absolutely livid. My twin sister stealing my wife? My world turned into a fucking Lifetime move overnight. I wanted to destroy everything in the house but I couldn’t manage it. Instead I went for a walk, right out the front door. I didn’t think about the fact that I’d left my phone on the kitchen counter where it had been charging.

If I had, I probably would have left it anyway.

I paid no attention to where I walked. I’d been gone nearly four hours by the time I got back to the house. I slid my key into the lock only to find it already open. My father was at the kitchen table when I walked in. The coffee and mug had been cleaned up.

“There you are,” he said. Dad was a large man gone to seed – he was healthy but overweight with age, with a shock of grey-white hair and robin’s egg blue eyes that neither of his children had inherited. “We’ve been worried sick. You didn’t answer your phone and when I got here there wasn’t anyone home. The front door wasn’t even locked.”

“Why so worried, Pop?” I asked.

As if I didn’t know.

“Look, Dean,” Dad continued, “we know what’s going on. Sam and…they came over right after they left here. They told us everything. We tried calling to make sure you were OK and nobody could reach you. Your mother made me drive over. Let me report in.” He pulled out his phone and called Mom. Her picture popped up on the screen. “Yeah, he’s here now,” he said. “I don’t know. We haven’t talked about it. I’ll be home when I can.”

And i have been thinking of moving onto mATX board for the following reason.

I am a huge fan of VR and i plan on getting the valve index headset , that mean i will

1) need to upgrade my graphic card, im currently looking at 2070 super or more powerful

1.2:) that also mean my 450w psu isn't going to hold

2) I plan on also making the headset wireless , which will probably take a PCIE slot for network card if we go by how the vive currently does it

3) I currently use a single nvme ssd for storage.  While node 202 can fit 2.5 it was too troublesome to do it.However, I would like more storage in the future as well

With these being said, I am looking for advice, as well as suggestion on motherboard/case/psu for my next SFF build

e22n7z,3,2019-11-26,My girlfriend [21] relies almost exclusively on me [M21] to take care of her,ThrowRAasdfasd,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e22n7z/my_girlfriend_21_relies_almost_exclusively_on_me/,"Some background: 
I've been with my girlfriend for 7+ years, and have been her main source of emotional support since we started dating. She has been depressed (among other things) throughout our entire time together, and is regularly suicidal. She has a therapist and takes medication but they mostly just help with her other problems. 

I just graduated from college and am living with my parents for a few months, saving up enough money to move out (to a place closer to my girlfriend and workplace).

The problem:
Since my girlfriend is in college, her parents rented her a studio apartment. This is her first few months ever living alone -- I have lived alone for internships etc several times. Every time I visit, the place is trashed (open food containers all over, sink filled with last week's dishes, hard to walk around without stepping on things, etc), but I understand that being depressed can make it hard to motivate yourself so I do a lot of cleaning up. I also meal prep for her because if I don't cook, she will not eat any food for the whole week. The result of this is that most of my time spent with her is cleaning / cooking, which she recognizes and blames herself for (making her feel even worse). 

This would be less of an issue if I lived nearby, but I currently live an hour away, so we only see each other on weekends and maybe one or two days during the work week. 

I feel pretty trapped in the current situation -- I don't have the time to do the things I want to do anymore, but if I don't help her out, I feel like she will just waste away. It is also physically and emotionally draining to cook and clean and then talk to her about how worthless she feels.

I would really appreciate any advice, especially from people who have dealt with depression themselves or with their partners. I want to find a middle ground where I can be healthy myself and still support my girlfriend."

We met and fell in love; our homes were not ideal and sometimes abusive. We worked together to leave these places and committed to being partners in what I always knew was a codependent relationship. 

I can't say I hate her for what she did, but I am incredibly hurt and angry. I cried harder than I ever have in my life, on the floor, begging her not to hurt me again after a week from the day I discovered a month long affair with a predatory man who said he would screw her when she was underage and would leave marks all over her and have unprotected sex. We are too poor to leave one another so I have to find another job a state away to live with my parents and must wait approximately one year before I can continue college. I have family here but can't live with them...

The man was married and 12 years older than her; a supervisor at her internship. Silly her, she saved their exchanges including ID badge photos and info on his family. I contacted him with a pic of his ID and asked how the wife was.

He begs me.

I went in person to inform the wife, which I did not feel good doing. 

My ex was projecting an image of me onto this man who was essentially an ugly, older version of me who was leading a double life with a burner/ work cell phone. The parallels were surreal and the entire time he was coercing her with praise, asking if she ever had a father etc. She didn't of course, and I suppose perhaps she wanted something exciting with someone who had a child and acted as if they loved them.

I told him never to step foot near my house, and that if he threatened my life it would be over for him. If he attempted to hurt me there was extensive evidence and witnesses to his actions. He never made it as far as my doorstep according to my evidence. I told her if he pressed for info to tell the police given the context.

She kissed him about 5 times in his office before committing to oral sex in her car. I can't trust her anymore and must leave but am forced to cohabit with her. She has shown remorse but I know it is tied to guilt. She claims to care for me as a person, which is believable outside of this circumstance. I can't say I would never speak to her again, but not romantically given our history.

Finals week is coming up. I have all A's but haven't studied because of the fixation and deep grief. I have barely been eating or drinking. 

I have to reset my educational pursuit and wait a year before I can afford in state tuition as a new resident of Florida. I am considering taking online classes in Georgia, so that my relocation isn't a total stick up my ass with regard to my goals.

My self concept has been fragmented even more. She tells me it wasn't me, and I know the sex wasn't an issue, but I can't help but feel inadequate as a man.

She eventually built an emotional attachment as I could tell from the texts, and that hurts more than sexual favors.

Thanks guys."

I was looking for a new card to replace it, but then realized I no longer have an income as I am a law student. Will this adversely affect me in applying for a new card? I think the Wells Fargo Propel would work well for me, given that most of my spending is on restaurants, bars, and travel.

* What's the purpose of your next card? Travel &amp; Cash back
* Do you have any cards you've been looking at? Wells Fargo Propel
* Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card? Prefer general spending

e28fa9,3,2019-11-26,25 M4A (You Playing F) In Search of the Elusive Long-Term Detailed Story,WritingWizard124,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/e28fa9/25_m4a_you_playing_f_in_search_of_the_elusive/,"Good evening!

So tonight, I've decided to take my time and craft a request thread that more adequately states what kinds of things I am looking for in a roleplay.  I've been roleplaying for approximately 15 years now on various chat rooms and forums, though only about 6 or so have involved smut of any kind.  I love writing, and as such, I'm really looking to find a writing partner that will intrigue me, entertain me, inspire my writing, and create an altogether fun story with me.  And I hope that in return, I will do all of these things and more for you in our stories.

Granted, we all know that a lot of roleplay involves smut, and I absolutely enjoy that as well.  But smut without a story is just a bad porn film, and that's certainly not what I'm looking for.  I need story.  I need plot and world building.  Smut is important and fun and all that good stuff, but why are our characters suddenly sleeping together.  I don't believe a good story has a character simply look at the other and decide to sleep with them.  Something has to stir within both characters, and that something is what I try to explore thoroughly in all my writings.

Now, before I get into the ideas that I have, I would first like to say that I am absolutely open to your ideas as well.  This isn't a one-sided thing, and it never will be with me.  It's important that I enjoy myself, but it's also important to me that you enjoy writing with me as well.  And if you find yourself not enjoying an aspect of a roleplay, I never will be offended if you let me know what you're not enjoying about the story, and we can work to curve things toward another direction if need be.  And certainly, I'll be open with you as a partner as well if things aren't really being enjoyed on my end also.  With that being said, I will -never- ghost a roleplay.  There comes a time in any roleplay where it isn't quite as fun anymore, or burnout happens.  I get it.  But I'd feel guilty as hell if I ever just quit a RP without an explanation, and I'll give you that courtesy.  I just ask that you give me the same.

Now, as you can see in the tag, I'm open to roleplaying with men and women.  But the one requirement I will have is that you MUST play the female role.  I consider myself a fairly flexible writer, but I'm terrible at writing female characters, and I definitely want the person I'm roleplaying with to play the female role.  I am a straight male, but I don't mind if you are a male behind the screen.  All that matters to me is that your character is female.

Now for the fun part:

**Limits/Kinks:**



I will eventually put a more detailed F-list on here, but limits-wise, I am not into non-con, gore, bathroom stuff.  The extremes essentially.  I won't say that I'm vanilla per se, but I do tend to enjoy more usual modern slice of life themes.  I love playful teasing, things happening in water (pools, hot tubs, showers, etc.), small things that on their own don't mean much, but add up toward much more.  Teasing, brushing up against one another, accidental nudity, those kind of things.  Beyond that, if something makes sense in the general flow of the RP, you'll usually find that I'm up for it, but if ever in doubt, just ask.



**RP Ideas:**



Again, not an all-inclusive list, and you're more than welcome to offer your own ideas, but here's some ideas I've compiled of late.  I'll continue to add to this list as I discover new ideas that I enjoy.



**Celebrities** - 

I LOVE roleplaying within the celebrity genre.  Probably one of my favorite things to do.  I generally am looking for the female character to be the celebrity in this, though I suppose for the right writing partner, that could be flexible as well.  Currently, I have scenes involving celebrity incest (Dad/daughter, brother/sister, mom/son) and celebrity fan encounters (this one currently takes place at a convention locally to my character).  But feel absolutely free to suggest your own celebrity ideas as well.  I would love to try something new in this genre.  In the latter scene, I'm willing to play an older or a younger fan, and willing to play any ages allowable by site rules.

Some celebrities I enjoy playing opposite of include, but are not limited to (In no particular order): Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lawrence, Kaley Cuoco, Lauren Cohan, Christina Hendricks, Demi Lovato, and sometimes Taylor Swift depending on the role.  Absolutely feel free to suggest some of your favorites as well!


**Teacher/student or coach/athlete** - 

I really enjoy the power dynamic between the two here, but this isn't your cliche ""You're failing a test, so do things for the teacher to get your grades up"" kind of trope.  That's too easy.  That doesn't cause me to think or be interested in any way.  For these two ideas, I am willing to play either the older or younger role, and again, the younger character, I'm fine with that character being anything allowed within site rules.  

My basic idea for both involve a pairing of two individuals who actually get along great.  Perhaps the teacher or the coach has been their teacher or coach for some time, allowing for a better relationship/bond between the two than most of the people their age.  Nothing unprofessional has happened between them at the time the RP starts, but through time, a very inappropriate relationship begins to build between the pair.  I do tend to love writing scenes involving disallowed relationships, which brings me to:


**Incest** - 

Disallowed relationships really thrill me.  Relationships that society looks down on.  And of course, this is the case with incest.  No, not something I'm into in real life, but writing it has always been enjoyable to me for whatever reason.  For these, I've got scenes involving dad/daughter, brother/sister, or mom/son.  Open to other suggestions as always.


**Boss/employee** - For this, I think the easiest way is to post the scene idea that I have:

*I am a manager at a major marketing firm in New York. Basically what we do is try to get various companies to pay us to run their entire advertising campaign for them. It's a big money business, but someone has to do it, and all the stress and burden falls on our shoulders - they just 'show us the money.'

Unfortunately, that does mean a lot of trips away from home; away from family. But I have a loving wife, and she has been very understanding.

A very big automobile company based in California is my next client, and this one deal could pay for all of our operations for the next year and beyond. And so, being the best representative at the company, I'm the one tasked with flying out that way and convincing them to sign with us.

One problem, my assistant. She's tasked to go with me, but she can't do her job properly. She mixes up phone calls, she messes up the calendar. All of the tasks she is assigned to, she can't do. So I fire her, just a day before I would need someone to come with me to help me stay organized.

I try to see if I can borrow other managers' assistants, but they were all booked as well. So it's recommended that I give you a chance, a young intern in our firm. They say you work hard, and on such short notice, I didn't have much of a choice.

So I agree, calling you into my office to talk to you about the opportunity.*



**TV Show/Movies** - 

Of course, I also enjoy writing within television and movie universes as well.  I find this is the hardest category to find a match, as it does require both people to have some kind of a clue about the film or show itself.  With that being said, I've written scenes within shows like The Big Bang Theory, Girl Meets World, Gotham, Game of Thrones, Marvel Cinematic, and the like.  Always open for those, and this list will expand as well.  Also open to your ideas as well.




As stated, this list and this post will be ever evolving.  At the end of the day, I'm looking for ideas.  Compelling stories.  World-building.  If my ideas aren't something you enjoy, don't hesitate to send me some of your ideas.  I might not like them, but who knows, your idea might intrigue me.  As long as they don't break my limits posted above, I might be open-minded toward them.



Please note that I am ALWAYS looking for capable partners.  So if you see this post, whether I'm online or not, feel free to hit me up.  I will respond as soon as humanly possible.  Let's quench each other's literary thirst!"

I’m on a co-op (internship) this semester as an IT business analyst. It was during this internship where i was given a project to help a senior management team design a mobile app for a hackathon and I really loved doing it. I found out from a friend that this was a field called UX and did more research and realized that this is something I want to put my energy and passion into it. I’m concern about my limited time in university and not being able to get a job afterwards. After this co-op i will be in school from Jan 2020 to Dec 2020. 

So far I created a plan to get started on my portfolio throughout my last year. Next semester Im taking a UX course call information design.  Im pursing both a business and math degree minoring in comouter science and psychology. I’m worried that with my full course load and extracurriculars for all my semesters, I wont be able to find time to complete my portfolio properly. As well I have been thinking about maybe taking a semester off to get some experience but I dont feel that I will be able to complete a portfolio in time to apply for an internship in the summer.

Any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated!!"

A year ago, I started to deal with sharp pain during sex. It came about after having really rough sex with my bf after he had been on an internship for a few months, so we thought maybe he hurt me. Things did not get better, but I stopped talking about it and did only certain positions where it didn't hurt as much. 

After six months (?!?!) of dealing with it I went and saw a gyno where a fibroid was found as well as Adenomyosis. The causes of my pain!

I've been on medicine for 4 months and I can't believe I waited as long as I did. I no longer have achy pain just from sitting, I can get a little crazy in bed again, and my emotions are also evened out thanks to hormones, haha. 

On top of that, I found out my mom had a tennis ball sized fibroid removed recently during her hysterectomy as well as.... they discovered she has Adenomyosis! I wish I had been more confident in trusting my symptoms and not putting off going to the doctor sooner. Because I thought what I was experiencing was a form of normality."

I didn’t take physics, because all computer science courses didn’t require it. 

I can’t get into engineering now, because I haven’t done the physics externals. My rank score after exams should be around  250. (280 in the best case scenario. I would have had 6 extra E credit from computer science but i short handed my python variable names and i was limited to achieved because of that.) So I should be able to get into computer science and (math  or commerce. Not sure about that one either). 

From what I’ve read here, the computer science lectures are bad and software engineering requires internship, which gives you experience. Would it be better to go for alternative pathway for engineering or go with computer science. I want the one that gives me better chances do find a good job.

Are there any disadvantages to doing an alternative pathway? Like, would that lower the chances of me getting in Software Engineering the following year.

Man, I wish i knew I would’ve needed physics last year... anyone got a time machine or something?"

I don't really care for higher-level hard science and math courses. However, are the opportunities for a BA in CS comparable to the opportunities for a BS?

I've been having issues for over a year, but was diagnosed just November 2nd. 
A little over a year ago, I was having numbness predominantly in my left foot and I went to my podiatrist. He said it wasn't diabetic neuropathy because it was not an even symptom on my left and right sides. 
Didn't pursue it much further.  
Then the numbness started spreading. Once it got up to my groin area, I went to the E.R. in my local town. This was October of 2018. The intern made a snide comment about it being diabetic neuropathy and I was wasting his time being in the E.R.
The actual Dr. that came in started to press on my spine and when he got to my lower spine, it hurt like hell. He suggested an MRI. The technicians came to measure me to see if I would fit in the MRI. They said I would and they would come back in a few minutes to take me down. That was 10:45 at night. At 7 a.m. I went to the nurses station, paid my deductible and left. I was frustrated and ticked off. No one had ever come to let me know what was going on about the MRI.
I continued to decline, including several days between bowel movements and incontinence issues at work. 
I finally got in to my Dr. in Feb. to talk to him about what was going on.
He prescribed me some neurontin for the numbness and suggested I do physical therapy.  
In July, I took my family on a vacation  and while there, my knee went out on me climbing some stairs. I got a cane at a pharmacy and used the cane and my daughters shoulder for the rest of the vacation. 
The walking never got better and I continued to have trouble. 
I went to an orthopedic Dr. in August and she recommended I see a neurologist. 
From Sept 1st, I really started to decline in my walking and balance. I started to fall at work. I went back to my Dr. and he pulled me from work until my neurology appt. 
I then fell at home about three times. The last one was about 3 a.m Halloween morning. We decided to go to the hospital the next day. 
My neurology appt still wasn't for three weeks,  but we knew I couldn't wait that long. 
So after 6 MRI's and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) in the hospital, they determined I had MS. 
I spent a week in the hospital and about two weeks in a rehab facility. 
I am home now and have been approved for Ocrevus infusions, but no idea when they will start.
I am doing home health care rehab right now and trying to figure out what things I need in the house. Such as, where do I need bars installed, and how can I get that done.
What other items do I need? 
Can I get any financial assistance for these things?
No one has told me if the infusions will help to reverse my symptoms or simply stop the advancement?
At this point, my right hand and arm have degraded very rapidly in the last 10 days. I am having trouble grabbing and feeling things in my hand.
I'm pretty lost right now and not sure where exactly to start. 
Part of my frustration is that I had been doing so much better with my other health issues.  I started keto at the end of August and dropped 50 lbs. I was down a total of 80 lbs from a year ago.  My A1C was down to 6.1 and I had stopped almost all insulin injections and was getting by mostly with pills for my diabetes.  
Now, I don't even know.  
I can't walk without a walker.  I am cathing myself multiple times a day if I am not voiding well on my own.  All of this is really piling up."

I’m a 21 year old junior in college. I just got off a breakup with my girlfriend, which was heartbreaking for more reasons than one. I’m here to talk about my experience with my mental health, and how I let it ruin a relationship I wish every person in the world could have. I want readers to learn from my mistakes, know how important your mental health is, and what can happen if you don’t care for it, and for those who relate to know everything will be okay.    

**My Depression and Anxiety**

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety early in my second year of college, when I was 20 years old. I’ve always been worried about what other people think, and what I need to do to feel accepted. I’ve always had different interests, ideas, humor, and outlooks than most people when I was growing up, and never stayed true to them. Throw that in along with the stresses of college, my head came to blow by my second year. I spent a lot of time not being true to myself and what makes me happy, and it caught up with me. I’d wake up most days wishing those days would end. Nothing I could do would make me happy, and everything felt like a drag. I sought out help with school counseling, and counseling at home. Things slowly got better, and I felt like I was getting a better grasp on my life. Then I met someone who would change my life forever, for good and for bad. 

**The Love**

I met my now ex-girlfriend at a party the weekend before Thanksgiving in 2018. It was the first time I talked to someone where I wasn’t afraid to be myself. She understood me from front to back, laughed and cared about everything I had to say, and looked at me a way people dream of being looked at. Her eyes radiated every amazing feeling a person could have about someone. And for the first time, I related to her a way I’ve never related to another person. While it took us a while to begin dating, we spent a lot of time together, and bonded naturally and effortlessly. By early spring we were both ready to begin a relationship we already felt like we were in. we both truly fell in love with each other pretty fast, and it was the first time I came to truly understand and care about someone the way I cared about her. It was the most intimate I’ve ever been with another person. We grew closer it felt by the second, and were able to share everything about each other without any fear that it would change how we felt, and it was an amazing feeling.  It was both our first relationship, so it was new and exciting as it was scary, but the fear didn’t get in the way of what we had, at least not in the beginning. 

When we started dating, I put my mental health in the back seat. The way I felt about our relationship made it easy to feel like your mental health didn’t need to be worked on. The honeymoon phase of a relationship seems to have no issues. We go to the same school, so we see each other everyday. We spend time with our friends, then meet up when we could. We’d designate some night for romantic endeavors, and some nights for ourselves. We never questioned each other or cared, we were just happy to be together and loved each other.  

I learned fast, it isn't always going to be smooth, and the honeymoon phase doesn’t last forever. People’s romantic histories come up, which is always uncomfortable because no one ever wants to imagine their other half ever even liking another person. Go to a small college and those other people are right down the street. Timing conflicts occur, fear of losing occurs, jelacy occurs, and many more natural feelings that come and go after the honeymoon phase wears off. All of it normal, and needs to be handled the right way. Your always entitled to your feelings, and always allowed to ask questions in a relationship, and never let anyone tell you otherwise. The thing I learned most is how important trust is in a relationship, but it doesn’t have to be there in full force from the start, it takes time. Your still just two people who were strangers a year ago. But handling how you build your trust is a much more fragile task, and can ruin a relationship before you know it. And your mental health and trust come hand and hand even if you don’t see it. 

I put my mental health aside during my relationship figuring it wouldn’t be a factor due to how I felt because of my relationship. Depression and anxiety never goes away, and if you don’t treat it, it only gets worse. 

**What My Anxiety Led To**

Me and my girlfriend were apart for the first time this past summer. I was home and she was working an internship that she shared with old romantic, which I let get to my head. We spent as much time as we can together, and while it wasn’t always easy at times, we grew even closer because of it, and experienced life together in a new way even I couldn’t even have dreamt of. But the warning signs were there that I was losing the control on my mental health. Jealousy started to creep in, some disagreements turned into unnecessary arguments, and my fear of losing her became stronger, though we were getting stronger in terms of a couple. I always trusted her, but my anxiety would creep in at unnecessary times, which sometimes would lead her to question my trust in her, which is never a good feeling. But as summer past and we got back to school, everything was amazing, and we were back in the place we fell in love. Then I lost control of myself again, and this time it came out on the person I swore to never hurt. 

After she texted an ex-partner, I flipped out, cursed her out, anger, frustration, hurt, and all different emotions came pouring out of me of strait jealousy and anger. There were times in the past where I didn’t always understand her past relationships and her motives to keep contact, which is okay. It’s always okay to ask questions, and be confused sometimes. But I moved pasted them in time, but not in my head. I always trusted her she’d never do anything bad, but I never wanted to lose her, and my anxiety made feeling more than it ever should. It was the first time I deeply hurt her. She was scared, confused, in pain, wondering what happened to the person she shared all the unconditional love with. He just disappeared. And that night I did. 

I realized I lost the control I had on myself. Thankfully she didn’t want to break up with me, regardless of how hurt she was. That was a decision she made, and I was more than grateful for. But I swore I’d never do something like that again. But when you struggle with mental health, the only swearing you can do is act on what caused what happened. And I didn’t. I should’ve taken a step away, realizing stepping away doesn’t mean it’s over, but have the strength to take a few days or weeks to work on why that happened and work on the emotions. She loved me unconditionally, and she would’ve been there when I came back. 

Instead we moved forward with happiness and love. But underneath that love and happiness was fear and confusion. Small disagreements turned to arguments, due to her fear of how I’d handle it, and rightfully so. I focused solely on not losing her, and it made me overreact to small things, even though they weren’t quite to the level of the big blowup. I tried fixing my mental health too quick, and too much for her. Never work on yourself for anyone else, only for yourself, because that’s the only way you get better.  Don’t listen to what other people want from you, because that won’t help either. My never ending fear and anxiety of losing her led me to make a mistake that cost us our relationship. I lied to her for the first time over frustration in a situation that wasn’t a huge deal. I lied twice about in a span of 2 days to try and get her back, and didn’t even care about my own integrity. At that point all trust was lost. 

**Anxiety and Fear**

Even after that I still tried to prove that the mistakes I made were not who I was, and I was letting the worst parts of me take over, and that it wouldn’t happen anymore, and that I was getting help. I was going to therapy, and taking the correct steps to get past the state I was in. I was doing small things each day that made me happy and feel fulfilled. But I couldn’t prove that to her. I needed to do it for myself, and trust that if I did that, the future would work out the way I wanted it to. I didn’t get help for just myself, I tried to do it for her too, and it was fatal for our relationship. 

We don’t communicate anymore. I am blocked on everything the internet has to offer. I am dead to a person who loved me. There is no worse feeling in the world. 

**Everything Is Okay**

Since the day I was removed from her life, I finally changed my outlook, and my approach on how to handle these situations. I want people to hear my story, and get the help you need, for yourself. I’ve been happier about all the things about me since that day, because I finally realized what it was like to focus on me, because that's all I could focus on at that point. 

I want people reading this to trust that focusing on yourself is extremely important, and trust it will work in a relationship. Mental health issues should never be a reason to lose out on a relationship. I’ll never be able to get back the special person and love I had in my life. I don’t want that to happen to anyone if you can control it. Mental health isn’t a joke, and it will affect your life. Don’t let it take something that you hold near and dear to your heart. Love is part of a fulfilled life. You don’t have to have it, but if it’s real, it complements your life perfectly. I know what that feels like. But I know what the rest feels like too, and I never want anyone to experience what I did. 

And for those who may already be in my position, it’s not too late, it’s not over, the world hasn’t ended. There is help out there, there is a path to get you out of where you are. I’ve found it, and it’s the best thing I’ve done for myself. Don’t look to the future of your relationship, because right now it is over, and you can only control what you do. The future hasn’t happened yet, and you can’t predict the future. You’ll get past the hurt, sadness, and guilt. You’ll be able to live a happy life you always wanted. The right person will come into your life one day, and learn from your past to make that person happy, without the baggage. And the future is unpredictable, and maybe what you once had with that special person won’t be gone forever, but don’t go forward forcing that to happen. Always put yourself first, and don’t end up where I did, there’s no worse feeling. But never give up on yourself, you are a good person, and you will be okay."

Long story short: an intern invited me to lunch with other interns. There are 6 people going(including me); 2 girls and 4 guys. 

I’ve seen everyone there, but I never really hung out with them or anything: just the casual hi whenever I see them sort of thing.

Whenever I say hi to the guys, we usually have a small chit chat and go about our ways; however, when it comes to the girls, the moment they look at me they always look away or don’t acknowledge my existence whenever I see them.  In those situation I just ignore them as well and go about my day.

The problem is this: one of the guys invited me for lunch, and the girl are coming along as well. I really don’t want to meet them or be near their presence, because I just don’t like them at this point.

Do you think it’s reasonable for me to decline the offer, or just say fuck it and go for it?

**Golden Palace**

The original story of El Dorado was an allegory for the allure of wealth and the greed of man. When the conquistadors came over, many of them spent their lifetime looking for this alleged city of gold, and got nothing in return. The fact that you don't know their names is a testament to their failures and serves as a lesson to the rest of us. 

But that's beside the point. Apparently these ignorant natives had so much gold, they could afford to get shoved into large lakes wearing nothing but gold. The Spanish, wise as they were, thought the natives were stupid for wasting gold like this and promptly began 'educating' the natives on the true value of gold. Today, all that gold is either lost underneath a massive body of water that was once Spain or... underneath a massive body of water that was once where the natives jumped into so many years ago. So much for that enterprise.

But the El Dorado of today, build on the ruins of such imperialistic and chaotic desires, really seems to have overlooked the irony of the situation.

Sure, gold is still valuable and important. It's called the Golden Kingdom after all. But now comes a new chapter in the nation's history due to a new source of wealthy and power: fuel. Specifically ethanol. The wonders of ethanol were already appreciated by the locals, ever since Secretary Luis Soto reinvented ethanol refinement and sold his copyrights before joining the government. And there were already stable ethanol trade deals with the Boliviaran government just next door.

But that amount was *nothing* compared to the offer Gold Standard Energy got from the Caribbean Commonwealth. There wasn't any warning or fanfare on the matter. There wasn't even any contact between both nations taking place before the Commonwealth casually informed the largest privately owned fuel producer of El Dorado that they were buying the *entire* stock of ethanol based gas available. The ease of the request from the Commonwealth was so stupefying and out of the blue that the CEO, Marco Fuentes, had to reread the message again and again before downing a whole bottle of tequila to stop shaking. 

The fuel, much like the gold the natives had so many years ago, wasn't really *doing* anything with their lucrative cash-cow. But *unlike* the ancient natives, the people of El Dorado genuinely did have a notable surplus and wouldn't have to send the Commonwealth across a goose-chase through the mountains. 

Naturally, news spread to the Capital and King Mario III wanted to know every detail about the deal as soon as possible. And within a few days, it was decided that this would be the perfect time to formally introduce themselves to their newfound business partner. And it was also an excuse to *finally* entertain foreign guests since the socialist neighbors didn't seem to keen on being treated lavishly. 

Suddenly, the Cabinet found themselves as impromptu party planners in hopes of impressing the Caribbean Commonwealth's envoys to the nation. This would mark the first ever diplomatic visit of a foreign national into the lands of El Dorado, so first impressions were definitely important. Graciela took up arts and crafts (AKA bossing around interns with her 'color scheme vision'), Silvia insisted on making his family's 'party punch' recipe, Luis invited some older women from his hometown to make corn based desserts, and even Father Pedro was (calmly, of course) going around making sure everything was tidy and clean from the floors to the uniforms. ~~Miss Dolly was oh so slightly annoyed she wasn't invited, but it was promised that she'd be the first person they'd call if they needed... entertainment. This was a diplomatic visit after all.~~

Observing the whole thing was King Mario and Marco Fuentes who were definitely buzzed with excitement at the whole situation. 

And finally, the day came. The silverware was polished. The menu was selected. The old but still working gramophones played what was once called 'classical' music in the Grand Hall. Streamers of gold and purple and white were hung through out the walls leading to the Grand Hall itself. The Guards were in the neatest uniform's they'd ever worn, steam-pressed and crisp. Everything was ready.

A few days prior, the Caribbean Commonwealth received a neatly written letter of the event. 

""... to discuss the current deal, which has piqued the interest of the Crown, and to discuss any future relations that will hopefully exist between these two aspiring nations in the eyes of the world.""

The whole capital city seemed to hold its breath as the first envoys ever stepped foot into the city and made their way to the Golden Palace."

I did not stalk them, but I was obsessed with this person. He was the only person to ghost me. I am average, or larger than average attractiveness, and so I was not used to being rejected. 

He and I were social media friends, and I soon after learned he had a girlfriend. I don’t know if he was dating her the entire time, or if it just happened soon after he ghosted me, but I could not stand the idea that she was good enough and I was not. 

She and I were so similar, it was wild, but in every way, she was a little bit better. We have the same university degree, but she had a better internship. She and I have similar hair and body types, but she is a bit thinner, and a bit prettier. She is also cooler. She was worthy of him and I wasn’t.

And I watched them on social media for nearly three years. I didn’t want to see them. I was embarrassed and horrified that I would run into them and that they would be mean to me. I even moved away, got a new boyfriend, and a new job. 

They eventually broke up And that guys now ex girlfriend reached out to me on social media, and called me obsessed. And I was horrified. I was bad, but I was not like this mean, evil person who wanted bad things. I just wanted to follow their story, and see what it was that made me not good enough.  In an odd way, I was rooting for her, and I hope she got all the happiness she wanted even though she was mean to me. I would hope she want to win over him because he was bad to me. 

And even though I have a good boyfriend, I worry that I cannot feel his love be good enough because I am too focused on being rejected. I tell myself that I have survived things way worse than this, and that I am stronger than this, but I also keep wondering when will I feel love, even if I have love. He is everything I could ask for, I just don’t think I will ever feel good enough."

(5-20 yrs from now)",eisfina,AskProgrammers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgrammers/comments/e2buvs/as_a_cs_student_what_should_i_think_aboutfocus/,"My shallow vision of the future, even though it doesn't work like this goes:

1. Get CS degree w/ good grades, some projects done, an internship
2. Get job at a preferably high paid position as software engineer in a company I like. Maybe IT if not software engineering
3. Do ""well"" at work. move up to senior software engineer one day
4. Pay off students loans and become financial well off (I got a lot of debt, especially from past non-CS pursuits)
5. Boom. Done. Happily ever after.

This is not reality, even though I live like it is. I heard programming is life long learning. I also feel like I need a better vision than this, because thinking like that will just lead to mediocrity in my prediction 

What should I learn and focus on? I'm also aware things in the industry are going to constantly change as well."

e2eyti,1,2019-11-27,"I (23M) reconnected with a girl I used to date (22F). I started having feelings for her again, then found out she was seeing somebody else and I do not know how to proceed.",anonymousshadie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e2eyti/i_23m_reconnected_with_a_girl_i_used_to_date_22f/,"I (23M)  am studying abroad, and the girl (22F) I used to date (we are the same nationality) is following the same study, one year below me, lets call her Julia. We started dating mid-November 2018.

A little background about me:

I grew up in a toxic family environment and have a scar from an accident in my intimate zone. I never dated anyone before, I had few hook-ups when I was drunk at parties but that was about it. It is not that I did not have a chance before, but I was too focused on my cons and didn't believe I deserve a person next to me. However, I decided to give myself a chance about a year ago and went on a date with Julia. We have been friends before. I was facing a study delay, mostly due to working 80 hrs/m beside my studies to support myself, too much weed and hanging out with people that do not study.

Some background about her:

A year younger. It has been 1 month since she broke up with her ex-boyfriend, who she was in a relationship for 4 years. He cheated on her, managed to convince her to get back with him afterwards, and cheated again after few months. He moved to another country few months before they broke up officially (mid-October). She still had feelings for him. Her parents also divorced earlier that year and she had a lot on her mind.

Everything was going well when we started dating. I would say it was one of the times I have been the happiest in my life. Though her moods were constantly changing, I was trying to make her happy in any way I could, but that was not really sustainable. Two weeks into dating we had a talk and I told her my desire is to be in a relationship with her, but she explained to me that she was a mess at the moment and did not want to hurt me. Rookie me, I insisted that I understand and I would like to continue seeing each other, and she could decide later on. I was busy with work and school but I used to spend as much time with her as I could manage. The truth is that it was all falling apart, and she was the main thing I focused on.

I did not share with her much, because I thought she had enough problems on her own and I did not want to add up to that. That was a mistake which I believe prevented us from connecting on a deeper level. We were seeing each other for a month before the Christmas break came, and we would both go to our hometowns for 2 weeks. We did not have sexual intercourse during that month, at the beginning I was too nervous to go for it, when we got closer to each other, she had some health problems and we did not get there eventually. Our relationship we progressively developing that month, but when we went home it kind of started going bad. The worst thing of all is, that I was already falling in love with her at that point.

Two days after going home, Julia told me she had a call with her ex-boyfriend and he had told her that they would see each other in their hometown and that he knew how he makes her feel. I replied that this is all happening because she allows it, while she told me that ""a person could not control his hearth"" and that she still had feeling for him and did not know how she would react. I told her I am getting angry about those texts and left the chat. She said she knew I would get angry and is why she did not want to tell me about it in the first place, few hours later I had an apology message.

Fast forward during the Christmas break, we kept chatting, but every time I was out drinking I used to text her stupid stuff, mainly because I knew she did not feel the same way about me. I even had a nightmare of her cheating on me. It was making me feel not good enough. A day before coming back to our university town I texted her that those ""open relationships"" are not doing well for me and I needed to know whether she wants to be with me or not. She told me that she needed a friend to live with her during the month of January, and if our relationship developed that would have been great, if it did not then it has been the wrong time. Stupid me agreed to that, but it was not the same anymore.

January was the last month we would spend together, because she was going abroad for semester exchange and I was moving to the capital for (1hr train ride) of the country we study for an internship. Deep down I knew it was not the time, but I did not want to lose her. I neglected myself and did not speak up when there were red flags popping. I had put her on a pedestal, which I realize made her lose interest in me. But she was incredibly beautiful, she was writing poetry, she had a childish perception of the world which was kind of cute, and materialistic stuff did not interest her. Holding her in my arms was making me feel incredibly happy. There were times she was letting her barriers fall down and we had amazing moments, but those moments had also made me go on when red flags appeared.

In January we both had important exams. My head was the biggest mess it has ever been. I could not focus to study and had to idea how my relationship with Julia is going to proceed. In January we were having just 2 weeks together before she left for her semester exchange. The time for sexual intercourse came, but I was not able to perform, my head was a jungle and I was not sharing that with her. I was trying to hide my scar and did not share any of that with her. I think I needed that justification that she wants to be with me to share my story with her.

I ended up passing only part of my exams and having a study delay. Me and Julia had proper intercourse in the last days before she left, but she already told me that maybe we were better off staying friends for the future. The problems is that we kept chatting for 1 month afterwards, the same way as before, as if she was my girl, or at least in my head. However, one day she texted me that she was watching a movie with a ""friend"" and he tried to kiss her, but she did not feel the same way and turned him down. She had let him sleep in her room though, because it ""was too late already"".

I ended up getting very angry, and I told her I did not continue our relationship with friendly intentions and that she had hurt me. She replied that she started feeling me way more as a friend during that time but she did not do anything with this ""guy"" and it had all been in my head. I think I knew that if not this time, it would happen eventually and that is why I stopped talking to her.

Fast forward, September this year she came back to our university town, while I was living in the capital (1hr train ride). Late September I went to a party to the university town with some friends and I saw her there. We talked shortly like nothing happened and that was it. The problem is that the feelings I had for her popped up again. I tried to stop it but I couldn't. We started talking again, and one weekend (beginning of October this year) I came to visit her to study for the weekend because we had a mutual exam to pass. However, that day when I asked if it was okay for me to stay for the night she told me that she was seeing somebody from a very short time and ""did not want to make him feel bad"". I was shocked, she was flirting with me on the chat for the past two weeks and suddenly tells me that? At the moment when I was about to tell her I want her again in my life. Later that night I had a talk with her, telling her some parts of my story and why everything happened in a certain way. She told me that she had feelings for her ex even after we stopped talking and that there was nothing I could have done back then. She needed somebody to make her feel wanted again and that has been me. Julia further said she did not believe her current affair would result in something and she had not been ready to give her full self to somebody yet.

Even after that conversation I could not stop thinking about her. The issue is that after spending a day together I realized she did not love her ex anymore. I could see it. And she was way better. I felt that regret of not being able to experience that part of her. A month later, beginning of November, I sent her a letter. A letter saying everything about me, even my deepest secrets and telling her that I need to block her and stop talking to her because I cannot get over her and wish her luck. After that she told me she was crying and needed few days to reply to me. During those days I realized I sent the letter to tell her I felt and feel about her, and see if that would change something. Blocking her was not my real desire.

We had a talk where she told me her affair did not result in anything, and that we met to teach each other something, that I will meet the person I deserve etc. That she wanted us to stay friends and wished I told her my story earlier, but her life had been very busy right now and she did not want a relationship. That she could not give me what I want. I ended up blocking and unblocking her after few days, because it did not really help with stopping my thoughts.

The problem is I can not stop thinking about her. The truth is that I do not want to believe our story is over. I do not know what to do. I keep telling myself that if I had set my ego aside and talked with her directly after she came back in September, she would not have started seeing this new guy and it would have been different. Deep down in myself I know it would have been. I might be blindsided, but I know how much she enjoyed my company and our closest moments prevent me from believing she had absolutely nothing for me.

I need to resolve that situation because it prevents me from living my life fully. I am surrounded by a lot of girls and neither seem to interest me as much as her. I put way too much weight on Julia's opinion about me. I am not getting over her. I was thinking about meeting her and asking for one final talk to tell me face-to-face that I had been a platonic part of her life and that I should really move on. She kind of told me that when we talked on the phone but it did not make me believe it.

**I need advice guys. Give me your unbiased opinion, if necessary be harsh, tell me that I a f\*\*\*ing 23-year old that came late to the game and suffers way too long from his first love. Even after everything, I still want her in my life badly. She had now showed me multiple times I am not her person, but somehow I still refuse to believe it. Why do I need her approval that much? It is really crushing my confidence even since she left for her semester exchange. I am turning into one of those guys that date a girl for 2 months and then are obsessed about her for years. I do not want to be that guy. Somehow I still think she did not fully realize the type of person I am.**

**This turned out longer than I expected. Thank you in advance to everyone that puts the time to read through. I will appreciate every opinion, don't go easy on me.**"

I was supposed to have a phone interview with this company regarding an IT Internship Monday morning. The recruiter wanted to schedule said interview for last Friday, but I had told him that I wouldn't be available because I had another interview that day (I didn't tell him about the other interview. I just told him that I won't be available that day). I scheduled for this interview for right when my 8am class ends (my class ends at 9:20am and the interview was supposed to happen at 10am). I had just gotten home from class and am waiting for the phone interview to start. 10 am comes around and the recruiter doesn't call me. I figured hey, most recruiters are usually busy hence why they show up to interviews a few minutes late. 15 minutes pass by and I still haven't received a call. I emailed the recruiter politely asking him if he's still available.  So I woke up the next morning only to find out he waited until 10:00pm to respond. He replied to my email while I was asleep. He apologized for missing the interview, but he didn't tell me why he missed it. I would understand if he missed the interview due to personal reasons, but he could have at least told me that he wouldn't be available. I responded to him that I decided to withdraw my application. Him no showing without an explanation gave me a bad impression of the company. Do interviewers/hiring managers/recruiters realize that being late to/no showing an interview AND leaving potential candidates in the dark when they try to reach out is detrimental to the company's brand?"
e2fv85,8,2019-11-27,HELP: I landed a senior-level position I'm not qualified for.,Trucein,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/e2fv85/help_i_landed_a_seniorlevel_position_im_not/,"Hey there, some background info on myself:

I've got 5 years in the industry. 1 as an intern and 4 as an FTE.
During my tenure I've gotten some good experience. I've been quick to learn and pick up on things. I like to think I know what I'm doing for the most part. I have my CCNA, I've been to a CCNP bootcamp (haven't taken the test because I knew Cisco was doing a refresh soon and didn't want to bother doing a deep-dive on legacy tech like frame-relay). Most of my current job duties are designing networks for company integrations and acquisitions for a reasonably large company (40k employees).

I recently interviewed for a senior level position because I want to start doing more high-level design work to challenge myself. Lo and behold I was extended an offer, but I feel unqualified. I'm extremely resourceful, but with the tenure and the nature of my current job, I just haven't been exposed to a lot of tech in networking. (I only have rudimentary knowledge in firewalls and higher-level design topics).

I'm pretty resourceful and generally figure things out and I like to think that I do my job well, but I function best when I have someone smarter than me to bounce thoughts off of, and I would be ""The Guy"" at this new position, albeit a much smaller environment, but still global.  This position would be a 44% raise from my current salary. A life-style altering amount of money. 

My current company offered my a pretty laughable increase to entice me into staying (not even a quarter of the increase the other company is offering). The only thing really holding me there is the love for my team-members and the stability of the company. 

I don't really know what to do. I'm young and I've made the mistake of thinking the grass is greener on the other side before, but it's going to take another 5-10 years to make what this company is offering me where I'm at now and I'm getting jaded with my current job duties. Any insight or advice would be great."

It’s just a job for me. I honestly just fell into it because of some family members who are civil engineers who were willing to hire me. I just can’t take the advice of CE’s who work long hours and weekends because they’re passionate about it and I really can’t relate.

I think I’m good at it and I like that it has so many different aspects that you’re not really bored, but overall I’m not interested in working &gt;40 hours a week. Everybody seems to warn me against going to “sell out” and work for the government.

I’m genuinely not happy at my current job (mostly culture reasons, but I also don’t love the pressure of consulting). I’m easily stressed out and I don’t want work to be my whole life. At the same time, I don’t want to be trapped in government life in the future if I lack the technical skills to go back into consulting. Can I get some input from other CEs who aren’t passionate about the work, or input from CEs that have worked in government for awhile?"

I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask the following question, but I hope someone can help me out.

I need to calculate the osmotic pressure in our system. The formula we use right now doesn't seem to comply with our expactations (Example: Seawater with a conductivity of 50 mS/cm has a osmotic pressure around 25 Bar, but our calculation gives us a pressure of 5 Bar).

I have read multiple papers on osmotic pressure calculations using the electrical conductivity, but most of them use a conversionfactor that isn't given in the paper or the reffered article. The calculation that fitted the best, showed a decrease is osmotic pressure with increasing conductivity, while osmotic pressure should increase with increasing conductivity.

Does anyone know a paper that shows a calculation of osmotic pressure from electrical conductivity?

If it helps, our conductivity sensors are corrected for temperature. If there are any questions or if my question isn't clear, please ask and maybe we can figure this out together. Thanks in advance!"

e2lqr6,2,2019-11-27,Family Dilemma,Sufficient-Seaweed,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e2lqr6/family_dilemma/,"Bit of a long story, but I feel like the history is important.  I'm in my 30s living in the US for reference.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growing up**

We were a middle income family, she was a stay at home mom and stepdad was in the picture for most of our lives. We went to vacations every summer, we always had meals on the table and we were never lacking.

My mom was always quite challenging growing up.  There was no abuse, but she was generally a very negative a cynical person most of the time.  Always very anxious and quick to anger/yelling.  Despite having 4 kids, she was constantly complaining and yelling at us for very minor things.   A few examples:

* We had a family desktop computer, and at least once a week she'd go off on one of us about how she wished she'd had her own computer if one of us would install something (not a virus, some sort of silly kid's game or something)
* When we started getting to driving age, she'd regularly complain and yell at us about how she just wished had her own car if one of us needed to use it for our job.  She eventually did get a stick shift car, knowing nobody else in the family knew how to drive it, and never offering to teach out
* We grew up an hour outside of Philly, and went to visit a college down there as I was about to graduate.  This was pre-GPS/smart phones, so we had printed directions out on Map Quest (this was pre google maps too!).  At some point, we got lost, and she spent the next 20 minutes berating me and telling me ""THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO FUCKING DO THIS, I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN!!"", as if I had orchestrated the entire thing

It was also a challenge to have her take any interest in my interests.  For example, my last 2 years of high school I played tennis on the school team.  My stepdad worked full time 9-5 type hours, so him attending any games after school wasn't expected - but she was a stay at home mom, she never even attempted to make it to a single game of mind.

As far as Stepdad's go, mine was great.  We had a fairly good relationship growing up, and actually became closer once I was of a legal drinking age, since we both had an affinity for craft beers.

**College (2005-2009)**

 I ended up going to school in Philly, and ended up living off campus.  Like many others, I took out student loans to cover tuition/living expenses/food, etc.  My mom/stepdad did end up cosigning the loans.  

One of the biggest challenges with my no longer living at home was my Mom's perception that anytime I wasn't contacting her frequently enough, I must be pissed off at her, and she'd react accordingly.

* My Mom continued to be quick to anger in situations.  The most memorable example was when I first moved down to college, I asked if I could keep a car down there for first week or two in case I needed to go buy things for my apartment (it was nowhere near any sort of Walmart/Target).  I used it to go to class as well, and being new to a big city, I ended up parking in a place I wasn't allowed before classes and came back to my car being towed.  I called my Mom letting her know what had happened, and I was instantly berated with ""I KNEW YOU WEREN'T MATURE ENOUGH FOR THIS!! YOU'RE SO IRRESPONSIBLE, THIS IS WHY I DIDNT WANT YOU TO HAVE THE CAR DOWN THERE!!"".  I then called my Stepdad, who replied with ""That sucks, do you need any help from us?"" To which I replied nope, I had arranged a ride and I'd pay the towing fee entirely myself. 
* I would go home every few months/for holidays, and every time I went I'd get a guilt trip comment about how I should really come visit more, questioning why I don't come visit more often
* The loan amounts were paid out in bulk every year to my Mom's account.  Every single month, I'd need to reach out to her in order to get a transfer from her account to mine so I could pay rent.  Keep in mind, these loans are all in my name and are my responsibility, she just happened to receive the disbursement.  If I'd gone more than a few days without talking to her and then I'd reach to get (my) money to pay rent, I'd get berated and a snide response about how I ""need to be thankful/appreciative"".  In my mind, she loved having this money hanging over me and the ability to control me and make sure I was being a good little child and contacting her regularly
* At no point during my 4 years down at school did either my Mom or Stepdad make any attempt to come visit me, even though it was \~1 hour train ride and quite convenient.  If the topic ever came up, they would question why I couldn't just come home to visit them
* I was able to secure an internship in Connecticut (\~2.5 hours away from our home).  I moved up there knowing absolutely nobody/having no relatives.  At no point during my time in Connecticut did either my Mom/Stepdad make any attempt to visit me

**Post-College (2010 - now)**

I was able to secure a job at the company in Connecticut, and moved up there in early 2010 to work full-time.  We would keep in touch once a month or so.  Our relationship was amicable, but never particularly close.  I'd go home for Christmas/Thanksgiving primarily, but very few other times.  Again, each time I went home I'd get a guilt trip about how they wished I'd come visit them more.

My stepdad's sister loves to host Thanksgiving, and we went there every year.  It's always a great time since numerous aunts/uncles/cousins/grandparents travel in from the East Coast.  And everyone has quite a few drinks and a lot of fun.

&amp;#x200B;

* **2013**
   * Having lived in Connecticut for 3 years now (again, having no relatives in the area), I finally confronted her about her lack of visit.  Keep in mind, I'm a 2.5 hour drive away, so not unnecessarily far in my view.  The turning point for me was that my younger sibling had moved to Spain permanently, and within a few months of her moving they had planned a week long trip to go visit them.
      * The response I got to my questioning about why I had never received a visit in either Connecticut or my college years in Philly was:  ""We spent our vacation in Spain. Did you want me to visit you in Philly? I don't recall being invited. I gave you rides anytime you needed one, I do remember that part."".  Further blame was placed on me for not making more of an effort to visit them at home.  
      * After additional back and forth, they suggested I meet them in NYC (1 hour away from where I live) because they were going to be there visiting another family member and then we'd be able to meet up.  I promptly declined their offer, thinking it was unfair for me to continue being the one going out of my way
* **2014 - Where the main drama starts**
   * Towards the later part of 2014 (September/October), I offered to host my sibling (still in high school) at my place for a weekend.  My sibling came up, we had a blast.  My mom then sent me a $100 gift card out of nowhere shortly after.  I felt extremely uncomfortable about this, as it again made me feel like I was being ""rewarded"" for my ""good behavior"" of hanging out with my own sibling. I sent her a note asking why I was being sent the money, her response was along the lines of ""we take the other kids out for meals/buy them things randomly, this is our way of showing we love you too"" type thing.  I appreciated the sentiment, but I politely let her know that I wouldn't be using the gift card
   *  A few days before Christmas, I get an email from my Mom.  The gift card company had sent her a reminder note that I hadn't accepted/viewed the $100 gift card she'd sent me in October.  She forwarded me the reminder email, and all the email said was ""Hope you enjoy....Merry Christmas.""  I was extremely confused by the note, so texted my Stepdad asking what was going on.  His immediate response was ""I'm not getting in the middle of it"".  Apparently, she was pissed off because it had been like 2 weeks without hearing from me.
   * She then reached out in early January, telling me she wished we could have a better relationship and that she would like to hear from me more often.
      * At this point, I was done.  I responded that I needed some space from her, how little I appreciated her passive/aggressive ""merry christmas"" email for something they had gifted me back in October, and that I needed her to go speak to a professional.  My other siblings had very similar issues with my Mom, so this behavior was not isolated to just me.  I let her know that until she went to speak to someone about how she reacts/handles situations and those reactions were putting too big of a strain on both my and my sibling's relationship with her.  I did not ask for any sort of proof of visiting someone, or recap of what she learned, etc.  That's none of my business, but I felt compelled to make her put in the effort towards fixing our relationship.
* **2015**
   * To my knowledge, we had no communication at any point during 2015 since my note in January 2014
   * Throughout the 2015, I would keep in touch with my Stepdad once a month or so - we maintained a good and healthy relationship through the phone calls.
   * However, at some point during 2015, he reached out to me telling me that until I fixed things with my Mother, he would not be able to continue having a relationship (our \~monthly calls) with me.  I was pretty devastated by this, as we've always had a better relationship than even my Mom and I had.  I can understand supporting one's spouse, but to me, this came off him blackmailing me/forcing me to fix things with my Mom, which I refused to do.
* **2016**
   * She reached out via email  in the summer of 2016.  She let me know she had spoken to her GP/PCP recently about her anxiety, and her GP prescribed her an anti-anxiety medication.  Her note said ""  It has made a huge difference in my perception of situations and especially in how I handle any stress. After being on it for awhile I realize that I have had anxiety probably all my life. The thing is, when it has been your whole life you see that as normal. I had no idea that my anxiety has been at the root of so many social and work problems I have had over the years, but I think that anyone you want to ask in our family can see the difference. I am sorry for any impacts my issues have had on you. I don't know how to change that now except to try again. ""
   * I responded back saying I was happy that she was doing better, but until she was willing to talk to a therapist about things, I still needed to keep my distance
   * A few months later, she emailed me again letting me know she had started seeing a therapist and was going to continue working with her.  I responded back that I was willing to not hold a grudge, and we had some amicable emails catching up on life.
   * They came up to visit once briefly, we went out for lunch, hung out shortly at my apartment, and then they went home - it was a fine little afternoon.  However, my sibling made a comment shortly after that my Mom had commented to my sibling that Sufficient-Seaweed just wanted a free meal, which surprised me quite a bit.
* **2017**
   * The free meal comment continued to gnaw at me, so the email communication slowed down quite a bit.  She eventually reached out to my questioning what had happened, since she thought things were slowly improving
   * A few months into 2017, I offered to take my youngest sibling (who was about to graduate High School) on a trip somewhere - Europe, CA, whatever they wanted.  I received the following note:
      * Sibling has been telling me about your offer to take him on a trip, and I think it would be a wonderful thing for both of you. I hope that before that happens, you can spend some time with me and Stepdad. It would make both of us more comfortable. I honestly thought that we were making some progress as you said you didn't hold grudges and I'm not quite sure what happened, but I am sure you would take good care of sibling. Also, sibling's graduation is in May, we hope to see you""
   * At this point, all my lingering anger/frustration at  how I had been treated the last 6-7 years by both Mom and Stepdad finally bubbled over on me, and I sent a very angrily toned email back to them, essentially saying:
      * I have zero interest in spending time with you two to make you more comfortable, and to make sure sibling knows that's the reason the trip doesn't happen if that's a requirement
      * My recent reflections on how I've been treated the past 6-7 years have made me realize just how shittily I've been treated, and I then proceeded to list out every single thing I've listed above.  The flashes of anger/wanting her own things as a mother, the refusal to offer up a visit to an all alone college student/new hire because ""I didn't know you wanted me to come visit"", the Stepdad who cut me off to blackmail me into talking to my Mom
   * I did not receive a response from my Mom or Stepdad on this note. We had a quick casual hug at the graduation, but didn't chat at all really.
* **2018**
   * We had no communication at all in 2018, minus one of my siblings getting married.  
   * My mom approached me later on in the evening and asked if we could chat, I told her I'd had far too much to drink and maybe we could chat tomorrow morning.  I ended up waking up pretty early the morning after the wedding and leaving without talking to them.
   * However, the night before the wedding, we had a fun little gathering of everyone and lots of drinking.  Since the 2014 blowup, I had been skipping Thanksgiving at my Aunt's - the one I mentioned early on and how much fun it was.  To avoid drama with my Mom/Stepdad during a fun day, I skipped Thanksgiving with them and went to other relative's houses.  My aunts (my Stepdad's sisters) tracked me down and asked why the hell I no longer came to Thanksgiving.  I was floored that they had no idea the actual reason, they'd been thinking for 3-4 years that I was pissed at them and that's why I was refusing to come.  It was totally the opposite, they're among my favorite family members, they're a total blast.  I gave them a quick summary of everything above, and they actually agreed with me, and agreed that my Stepdad has been an asshat about how he had approached it.  They told me basically ""fuck them, come to Thanskgiving and just don't interact with them"".
   * I was planning on going in November 2018, but ultimately chickened out and didn't go

That now brings us to 2019, a day before Thanksgiving.  I'm planning on going to my Aunt's tomorrow, but I still don't know how to handle the interactions with them.  Here's my thoughts:

* I want Thanksgiving to be a fun day, I don't want to get pulled aside and have to bring up all my issues with them.  I'm in my 30s now, so I have no problem telling them no if they try to corner me and want to chat
* A big part of me wants to reconcile, but another big part of me wonders at what point does ""but they're family"" no longer matter?  In my mind, I was treated like shit by both of them for many years.  She finally went and got help, but it took her so long that it doesn't feel like she did it for me.  Acknowledging she was sick (from the high anxiety standpoint), I struggle with how a parent could have a child that begs them to go spend an hour or two talking to a professional and refuses to do it for so long. 
* From my point of view, she wants thinks to just instantly be better because she agreed to do what I asked.  I still struggle with how long it took her to do those things
* My Stepdad is a whole other issue - we never had any personal issues until he decided to blackmail (from my perspective) me out of our fairly health relationship just to try to force me to talk to my Mom

&amp;#x200B;

Open to any and all viewpoints, sorry for the long winded post!  Happy Thanksgiving!"

Tonight my BF (30M) had to do some volunteer work at his university to get some last credits to be able to start his graduation process (fucking finally, I might add, as he's in his 11th year of a 4 year degree). I had already had a trying day with my internship and a tiring workout, and thought to do something extra in the household while he was gone to surprise him so I deep-cleaned the kitchen which is usually something we do together. 

When he came home, however, he immediately complained about my swimming bag I forgot about still laying in the hallway, and when I told him I'd cleaned the kitchen he didn't even want to look at it and stayed mad. I'm so tired of trying to go above and beyond to do nice things, yet still getting yelled at for something small. Currently sat crying in the bedroom as it's too much."

I have to wake up my brother every damn day because of school, he always sleeps a lot, he is on his phone till 1 am and needs me to wake up at next morning at 7am, my parents have to go work earlier and that's why I have to do it. I always say to my parents that I dont want to wake him up bcs he should learn how to sleep earlier and how to use an alarm clock but it's still my fault in their eyes if he comes late to school and he has to go to an internship soon, I just dont want to wake him up so he learns that there will be a day when I will not be there.

The second problem is that I always have to open the fucking door for him bcs he always forgets his keys  at home, I just let him be outside for 5 - 10 min so he learns that he should take his damn keys next time, I mean I understand if he forgets them sometimes and I can open the door for him but he rings 3 -5 time per 3 hour and that's annoying for me man..

e2o7cq,3,2019-11-27,AITA for essentially denying my former manager a position at my new company?,tea_dart,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e2o7cq/aita_for_essentially_denying_my_former_manager_a/,"For some background, I'm in the field of data analytics - in particular data science and it hasn't been the easiest road getting to where I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now 25 and have been working at a large analytics consultancy company, a pretty well known one that is quite up there. I've been here for just over two years and I have recently been promoted from junior to intermediate - which means I am now more responsible for some of the managerial tasks and such, like taking care of interns.

This is where it gets juicy. When I was still an undergraduate about 3 years ago, I was interning at a start up firm that had about 70 employees. This was my first internship and I had no idea what I was doing. I'll admit, I wasn't the best intern but I always tried, worked overtime and looked to make friends with my colleagues. Long story short, I was underperforming and the manager wasn't giving me any guidance - I personally felt that he was slightly incompetent since he had barely any technical skills aside from basic SQL, coming from the world of corporate management.

The manager randomly took me into a room one day and told me that I was underperforming and he was going to let me go. He said I was underperforming and compared me with the other intern who was already on her third internship at this point. I asked how I could have done better - even offering to work until the end of my contract for free but he told me to ""slip out, nobody will notice"". I was pretty pissed and sad at myself but I felt like I deserved some more guidance during the internship - after all it was my first ever corporate experience.

So back to the current time, my current manager who is an amazing mentor passed me some CV's of the candidates he was interviewing for an interim management position which would be working closely with our team for a one year project. There were only about 5 that he had trimmed down to and one of them was the manager from my first internship. It would have been extremely awkward to have him working with my team directly and I immediately felt my stomach drop. My manager asked what I thought about the candidates and immediately pointed out that we needed someone very technical and that I have had a bad experience with my ex-manager.

&amp;#x200B;

The new interim manager comes in today, and it was my ex-manager.... so AITA?"

e2q42p,164,2019-11-27,I have 425k in student loan debt...cautionary tale? Just need to say it out loud to the world?,whathappenedwow,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/e2q42p/i_have_425k_in_student_loan_debtcautionary_tale/,"TLDR: don't be as stupid as me by putting off real life and live off student loans for 10 years.

First off I have to say I don't know if I have a real purpose for posting my story. I don't know if I need advice, words of encouragement, or a dose of reality check. If anything take it as a cautionary tale of what NOT to do with student loans. This is a secondary account I just made so as not to be personally identified. 
So as the title states I have accumulated 425k in student loans over the course of about 10 years. I don't think this is close to what I actually borrowed but compounding interest has ballooned it significantly. These are all federal loans thankfully so I have some options and safety net with that but that's also what made me feel a false sense of safety in continuing to borrow.

 I have a bachelor's and 2 masters degrees. One in clinical psychology which I took 7 years to complete. Every year I lived off the loans mostly, doing side jobs here and there for extra money. I was living with depression and anxiety and a general sense of hopelessness and apathy about the purpose of life. 

Every year there seemed to be something going on that made me feel like I couldn't go any faster with my degree or take on a real paying job. My aunt and grandmother both got cancer and died and I was caregiving for several years. Then my best friend got cancer and spent a lot of time by her side too. Of course these seem like excuses because in reality I could have done more than just be depressed and anxious about everyone dying. I didn't feel like I had the energy emotionally or physically. I made the final push after my grandmother died and finished my internship and degree. So I do have that to fall back on if I want to make a go of it as a therapist but it's been 2 years since I graduated and I don't feel the motivation or confidence yet to become a therapist. That will take 2 more years of internship and low/non paying jobs to accomplish.  

Money did not feel ""real"" to me and I felt this debt would not effect my quality of life. My plan is/was just make the minimum payments until they forgive either with PSLF if I can accomplish that or after 25 years. 

The things that really worry me now is that I feel like I have basically set myself up to live in poverty for the next 25 years in order to keep my payments manageable. Maybe that is delusional and I should actually be trying to make a lot of money. I just personally feel like I don't have what it takes to have a successful career like that. I wouldn't mind working for the post office or a non profit and just living a frugal little life.  

The other thing that worries me is what will happen in 25 years when worse case scenario these loans are forgiven and I receive a huge tax bill. I would hopefully be insolvent or have saved up enough to pay it or make a payment plan. I worry that my parents home and other inheritances will be in jeopardy because of this. I basically told my mom we should see about leaving the house to only my sister to avoid any large assets being in my name at that time. These are things I did not think about when I started this debt.

I was utterly naive that this would grow so large and that there would be reprecussions down the road. Even when I was at 100k after my first masters that number seemed so huge to me that it didn't seem like it would matter to take more loans at that point. I was extremely short sighted and foolish and uneducated about money and debt. I dont think interest and compounding interest even occured to me. 

So here's another shame that I want to put out too. Due to some situations with my life after graduating and that I had basically become accustomed to not working a living on student loans...I enrolled in yet another masters degree. So I am now living off those loans but that will end soon after this semester I will stop all loans and schooling. I have to get on with my life and live in the real world and make a real living. In a weird way I feel like I am addicted to loans. I've just been going on this hamster wheel of accumulating debt and being in school forbearance and never paying on it...not a dime. 

This is why I would tell people to be very careful about using loans for living expenses and especially if they have any kind of mental illness or problems that would make them become dependent on them. 

If anyone is curious I did this by taking one class a quarter every year for 7 years at a private grad school so I always made sure I had a big refund check. It was never enough actually though, I would always be broke right before the next check was coming... but I always knew it was coming so I never worried or tried to get a job. I did work...just not gainfully in a way that would fully pay for my bills and life in general.

So I'm sure this story sounds really irresponsible and crazy and I'm not expecting sympathy. If anything maybe this story will make you look at your loans and say thank God I wasn't as stupid as this girl. 

I am thankful for my health and my family/friends and everything I have. I'm even thankful for my degree and all I learned from it and that I have that to fall back on. Educationally I have what it takes to make a career. But emotionally and physically (I have some health issues as well) I feel like a loser. But at least I look good on paper. 

Happy Thanksgiving everyone. Thanks for listening if you did I appreciate this space here to let this all out."

#**Semblance**
**Searing Sunlight** - Full Round (8 AP)
*Iset’s goal in life is to protect, be it others or herself. Channeling her family’s hereditary sunlight semblance through her body, Iset takes on a burning golden glow, most prominent in her eyes, as a circle of light spreads over the ground at her feet. This circle of light provides a healing warmth to her allies, but will viciously burn anyone who steps into it uninvited.*

*Effect:* Iset creates a searing sunlight symbol with a radius of [Presence/2]. Allies within this circle are healed for [Semblance/2] HP and enemies take an attack of [Semblance+Expression] defended by Defense. If someone stays within the circle, this effect happens again for [Resolve/2] turns.
#**Physical Description**

Iset stands a 5’10, 6’1 if you count the piercing-riddled cat ears. Her ears, like her bob cut hair, are a sleek jet black that shines in the sun, streaked with mottled patches of grey. These grey patches and their black spots are a mark of her Faunus heritage, specifically the Mau cats of her mother’s side of the family. The same spots run in a pattern down her spine and the back of her legs, as well as around her wrists. The Bombay in her shines through in the most striking feature of her appearance: her bright, golden eyes that gleam like the sun itself. With their cat-like shape and intense color, they stand out easily against her soft features, especially when highlighted by the heavy, heavy eyeliner that Iset so prefers. 

Iset’s arms are strong and toned, showing her years of combat training. Her long legs, the source of her height, are similarly fit. Her overall silhouette is rather pear-shaped, with a small waist and wide hips. Due to her skittish and defensive nature, she has a habit of curling up into her giant, hooded sweater, making her appear a tad smaller than she really is. 

Iset’s usual outfit starts out with a simple, black t-shirt bearing her symbol: a golden throne sliced into three pieces by claw marks. The fitted shirt stops just below her ribcage and would be midriff-baring, if not for her high-waisted skirts and the bandages wrapped around her waist. She’ll occasionally swap this shirt out with one of the same colors that reads “Don’t Fuck With Me” on the front and “I Will Cry” on the back, a gag gift from some old friends. Her black skirt reaches her ankles. Midway down her calves, the solid fabric is interrupted up by a strip of sheer material that separates the skirt into three parts. Around her waist and hips, she wears several medium-sized gold chains that overlap each other. Often, several vials of liquid will be clipped to these chains, along with a pair of small fire dust rods. She accents her outfit with several pieces of gold jewelry, some inlaid with alabaster. Her shoes are heavy, black, steel-toed combat boots with gold laces that reach well up her calves, though they’re often covered by her skirt. The thick, clear soles are infused with fire dust, making them glow red hot when her aura is channeled through them. The final piece of her outfit is her oversized sweater, a knitted bundle of black that practically drowns her. It reaches to her knees and the sleeves drop well past her hands. The hood that flattens her ears will easily cover her face if she isn’t careful. This ball of fuzz is accented with thick, white stripes around the bottom of the garment. 

No matter what she’s wearing, a couple of Iset’s accessories remain the same. Numerous golden rings of varying size adorn her ears, along with a few gold studs, and a pair of simple white, crystal earrings that are the only source of symmetry in her jewelry. Also, she’s rarely seen without her pitch-black lipstick. Most unfortunately, her most eternally present accessory is a gaudy, fuzzy scarf in black, “gold”, white, and neon blue.

#**Weapon Description**
Hearth and Home is an ornate, gold teapot larger than Iset’s own head. The massive, round body of the pot is carved with three parallel rows of pictures, each seeming to tell a short story. One common element between all three is the presence of cats. Along with the carvings, an interlocking pattern of alabaster triangles circles the upper body of the pot. The teapot has a thick, sturdy, square handle with a black grip that protects the user’s hand from burns. In the back of the pot are two holes into which she inserts the fire dust rods that power the teapot. The weapon has three forms: one melee and two ranged. 

Hearth: Hearth is the melee form of the weapon and is merely the teapot itself in its base form. Its primary advantage is its sheer weight, but the burning metal surface certainly adds some hurt to the equation. 

Home: H&amp;H splits open into several pieces, all of which shift and turn to reform into a three-foot-long sniper rifle. The gun is a strange one, looking to be made up of pieces from a chemistry set. Several transparent tubes and bulbs make up the bulk of the weapon and the boiling liquid can be seen running through them. The front piece of the weapon is made up of straight, slender tubes of gold that extended into the barrel. The grip of the gun is the same gold and alabaster that adorn the teapot’s base form. The rifle sprays a high-pressure stream of liquid, working in a manner similar to a water jet. 

Hellfire: Hellfire is flamethrower-like weapon that sprays boiling hot tea and steam. Its form is similar to Home, but shorter and stockier. In this form, several pieces fold upwards to reinforce the handle and turning the lid controls of the flow of liquid. Infused with fire dust from the same rods that power the teapot, the resulting ""tea"" is even more damaging than scalding liquid typically is. 

#**Backstory**
Born in Vacuo, Iset never knew her parents, only the older sister she was left with after their death. Barely 21, still mourning her parents, and a career-devoted workaholic, Sekhmet was hardly equipped to care for a child. Insecure in her own caretaking abilities, she often left Iset with nurses and nannies. The little time she spent with Iset was in a large, plush chair, with a book in hand. Iset seemed to love few things more than cuddling up to Sekhmet and listening to her read, whether the choice of reading for the night was an age-appropriate picture book or the reports from the prosthetics lab where Sekhmet worked. 

From the time she was old enough to walk, Iset stumbled headfirst into trouble. Whether it was her own curiosity or simple misfortune, she was prone to being pummeled by her environment. While every adult in her life warned her not to climb the many shelves in Sehkmet’s house, they couldn’t do much about the items’ tendency to suddenly topple over onto her. Attempts at accident prevention were made with child gates, but Iset had a remarkable tendency not to intentionally thwart them, but fall through them with such force as to break the plastic. Fearful for Iset’s safety, Sekhmet taught her how to unlock her aura at a remarkably early age. 

Iset’s early years at school proved troublesome. Accidents seemed to follow her, involving everything from spilled paint to large insects finding their way into the classroom. Her clumsiness and nosiness earned her frustration from many students and teachers alike. Her apologies and attempts to be helpful staved off any lingering bitterness, but she was often quarantined into a “safety zone” where her messes could be contained. 
Iset became a rather solitary child. Her primary hobby was wandering the schoolyard or the hiking paths behind her house for interesting things to add to her “collection”. Interesting things to Iset ranged from shiny candy wrappers to dead bugs to bones spit out by owls. Despite the disgust shown by others, Sekhmet did nothing to discourage Iset’s hobby. Rather, she encouraged the girl’s curiosity and fed it with illustrated books about all manner of scientific subjects.

As Iset grew older, she met harsher reactions to her clumsiness and natural affinity toward misfortune, quickly earning the nickname “Bad Luck Charm.” Despite her best attempts at making friends, she was ostracized by most other kids. Some simply made excuses and subtly avoided her. Others were harsher, spitting insults at her and shoving her out of the way if she approached them. While a few kids showed her kindness, it was mostly out of pity. At times, it was because she was seen more like a cuddly stuffed toy than a person. 
Iset suffered through much affectionate tugging at her ears and mussing up her hair before latching onto Atropos Ward, a boy her age who lived nearby. They initially bonded over their mutual suffering at the hands of the school bullies and frustration with their sibling relationships. Having someone who enjoyed her presence, rather than merely tolerating it, without treating her as a soft toy, was enough to make Iset happy. 
Although Iset finally had a friend, her strange hobbies continued. Her room became littered with the skeletons of various animals, many put together, halfway put together, or collected into jars. Preserved jars full of dubious biological contents began to line her shelves. This did her no favors in making friends at school, but Iset was plenty happy with her one. 

Having few other companions, Iset doted on Atropos. She’d often present him with homemade lunches or an odd gift from her “collection.” When she took up knitting to occupy her time at home, Atropos received the first of her projects: a hideous, black and neon green scarf two times too long for him. 

With Iset growing older, Sekhmet felt more comfortable leaving her at home alone. While Iset had little trouble taking care of herself, the loneliness was more than the young girl could handle. She spent more time immersed in her hobbies, growing perhaps a tad obsessive, and more time with Atropos, often trailing at his side with a book and a bug jar. At night, she curled up with her old picture books, reading the rhymes to herself over and over to stave off the nightmares the eerily quiet nights brought. 

In high school, Iset was hit with the worst bullying she’d experienced. This time, her withdrawn and docile nature made her the target, rather than her clumsy tendencies. Isolation escalated to cruel pranks. Her glasses were stolen at least once a week. Her books were snatched from her hands and tossed in games of keep-away. The incident she recalled most vividly was biting into a sandwich she’d left unattended for only a few minutes. She felt a crunch that shouldn’t have been there, tasted something foul, and suddenly noticed her bug jar was empty. 

Iset was never one to let the bullies have the satisfaction of seeing her cry, but hidden away in the quiet, lonely spots in the school, she bawled like a small child. It was in the empty school theater that she was found by Alizarin, Mauveine, and Taffy. Alizaron and Taffy quickly took Iset under their wings and became surrogate big sisters to the girl. Mauveine, a feisty girl the same age as Iset, made fast friends with her. 
With her newfound friends, Iset found school far more enjoyable. Alizaron, known as Lizzy to her friends, helped Iset with schoolwork and was a fountain of advice. Her warnings and suggestions kept Iset out of much trouble, and her stern glare and formidable height kept most troublemakers out of Iset’s path. Lizzy became responsible for Iset’s darker fashion choices, as she enjoyed dressing the girl up in her own outfits and doing her makeup. 

Mauveine, despite being a quiet, 5’3 girl in gloomy colors and coke bottle glasses, was the feistiest of the three and was all too ready to fight anyone who dared lay a hand on Iset.  While Iset appreciated the protection, she seemed to find herself in the midst of chaos anyway from Mauvie starting fights with other students. Being the one to talk down those Mauvie provoked, or Mauvie herself, Iset learned to settle disagreements quickly. Speaking up for the both of them in a calm and clear manner forced her out of her shell and further developed her lacking people skills. 

Of all three, Taffy was the girl Iset was closest too. A bundle of shocking candy colors in a gaggle of goth girls, Taffy stood out easily. In fact, Taffy stood out wherever she went. Loud, colorful, and confident, she saw life as a performance and the world as her stage. With an eye for aesthetics and a disdain for the words “impossible” and “impractical”, Taffy took the school by storm, and she often took Iset along with her. Swept up into Taffy’s impromptu performances and dragged along from social group to social group, Iset learned to deal with sudden attention from several people. The last of her shyness crumbled and Iset had no issues putting on a show of silliness and song for a willing audience. 

It was Taffy that introduced Iset to various music scenes. Iset accompanied Taffy to everything from rock concerts to opera to pop idol performances. Iset’s favorite came to be the energetic, aggressive sound from distorted electric guitars and crashing drums. Having discovered her own preferences, Iset found herself going to more concerts on her own. Ever the social butterfly, Iset didn’t take long to make friends with those she saw again and again at the same shows. With her bright eyes, jewelry, and distinctive markings, she wasn't hard to recognize. Striking up conversation before and after shows became a past time of hers. Where mosh pits happened, she stayed out of them herself; however, she quickly became known as the person to go to after, with bandages and balm for the mildly injured, water for the overheated, and a handful of candy for those simply tired and in need of a snack. She was never too difficult to find in the crowd. If her height and clothes didn't catch eyes, her excitable and welcoming demeanor would. At small shows put on by newly formed bands, Iset befriended the band members with her enthusiastic support and chasing off rude hecklers and creepy-stalker-fans-in-the-making alike.  
It was at one of these concerts that she formally met Antaeus Ward. She’d previously met him at Atropos’s home, but the two rarely found time to speak. Having never said much more than “Hello” to each other, the two were practically strangers… until Iset ended up a little too close to a mosh pit. Ever prone to accidents, Iset had been knocked into the pit by a nearby mosher. Knocked to the ground and scared out of her wits, she was nearly trampled before a pair of strong hands pulled her up and away from the crowd. Having found some source of familiarity and safety, she stuck close to him for the rest of the night. 

The infatuation she developed after that meeting became obvious from the enthusiasm with which she checked her text messages and the soft giggles that followed. Having connected over similar tastes in music and Iset’s awful, awful puns, the pair had bonded quickly. While her friends encouraged her with the occasional mild teasing, Atropos was bitter and disapproving. Iset assumed he felt neglected and tried to spend more time with him. Despite her efforts, Atropos grew grumpier and clingier. 

His jealousy finally reached a boiling point a few weeks into Iset’s courtship with Antaeus. It wasn’t uncommon for Iset to ask Atropos to spar with or train her. His family was renowned for their swordsmanship and he’d been training since he could walk. Iset, far less interested in continuing the family’s tradition of Huntress training, simply wanted to be able to defend herself from school bullies and unwanted flirtations. 
Her visit to the Ward household has been like many others, with one small yet major difference: a small kiss for Antaeus before running off to train with Atropos. Their session started out like any other. Atropos summoned his sword against Iset’s sickle. What Atropos lacked in strength, he made up for in dexterity. What Iset lacked in any sort of physical coordination whatsoever, she made up for with raw strength and force of will. However, with his superior training, Atropos was usually the victor. 

Eventually, Iset found herself knocked to the floor with her aura shield broken.  That fight had been far rougher than usual. Atropos had seemed more aggressive with his attacks, barely leaving her time to breathe. He also usually stopped long before breaking her aura. She chalked it up to tougher training. He’d told her she was improving, after all. Though tired and sore, she was overall fine. As she pulled herself, she’d expected some advice, some help with her fighting stance, an affectionate pat on the head, all the usual things that followed their training sessions. 

Instead, as she stood, she was met with a blow to the back from the hilt of Atropos sword. More confused than hurt, she still had no time to react as a foot came down on her spine, pinning her in place. She managed to wiggle free, only to roll away from a swipe from a sword. Shaking like a leaf, she scrambled to a sitting position and scooted back. She’d never been more confused and afraid than when Atropos stalked toward her, sword in hand, calling her a liar, a traitor, an ungrateful brat, and a number of far more unsavory things. 
She didn’t want to fight back. This was her best friend, her source of comfort for years. However, another strike of the sword forced her hand. The charcoal blade met the steel sickle with a loud clang. As the pair drove their weapons against each other’s, Iset looked into Atropos eyes and saw a strange fire there. Never in their years of friendship had he looked at her like that, with such pure, unbridled hate. As she shrunk away from his glare, a slice at her hand made her yelp and drop her weapon. She scrambled after it, but firm hand squeezing around her neck stopped her. 

Panic overtook her in that moment. She couldn’t move. She couldn’t breathe. She couldn’t think. She shut her eyes tight as tears squeezed from the corners. Then, she felt her whole body burn. A flash of golden light surrounded her, spreading out into a small circle. The grip on her neck release as Atropos stumbled back with a cry of pain. 

Iset had no time to revel in the joy of unlocking her semblance. She simply jumped to her feet and ran, abandoning her weapon behind her. 

Though she wouldn’t explain why, Iset refused to go back to the Wards’ home, finding any excuse she could to stay away. Socially, she withdrew, spending most of her hours at home with her science projects, her knitting, and a pot of tea. She never told Sekhmet how her semblance came to be, only tried to stop the reflexive flinch that came whenever the woman brought it up. Sekhmet was beyond proud that her little sister had “harnessed the hereditary sunlight.” Iset wanted to forget it. That proved impossible with the way she lit up with a hot, golden glow every time her temper flared. 
The few people Iset stayed in contact with were Antaeus and Mauvie. Iset’s newfound fear of people did little to fight off her constant loneliness. With Lizzy and Taffy away at their new schools, Mauvie was one of the last people close enough for Iset to trust. 

Aside from her withdrawal, another change was seen in Iset. A few weeks after the incident, Iset suddenly showed a markedly greater interest in combat. She claimed she wanted to embrace her lineage. After all, her mother and grandmother and several generations before them had been fighting Grimm and evil humans alike for ages. They honed their semblances, a burning, golden light, into their primary weapon to defend the innocent. Why shouldn’t she do the same? Ever the encouraging sister, Sekhmet found Iset the best combat teachers in Vacuo and provided her with pamphlets from several Huntsman academies. 

Deep down, past the stories she told, Iset had one goal. She never wanted to be overpowered again. 
Despite Iset’s feigned interest in Huntsmanship, her interest in her sister’s work was obvious. Biology had always been a favorite subject of hers. Putting things back together had been one of her hobbies for years. Among her friends, she’d been nicknamed “The Medic”, being the one to always have a first aid kit on hand. (A precaution to her own tendency toward constant injury.) It was only a matter of time before she followed the other family business: developing experimental prosthetics. 

Sekhmet was all too happy to take her little sister under her wing. With plenty of at home teaching and an internship on the horizon, Iset eventually cast aside her claims of heading for combat school. Iset had her path all planned out from there, until a particularly horrible day in the woods. 

She blamed her horrible luck, her sulking, her fear, they’d all drawn the Grimm that lurked in those areas. Perhaps if she’d paid more attention to the news, she’d have known about the recent infestation. She’d have anticipated the numbers. They wouldn’t have been surrounded by more than they could count. She’d have decided not to go. They wouldn’t have argued about her. The Grimm wouldn’t have come. They wouldn’t have overtaken him. They wouldn’t have followed her. 

Her memories of that day were always blurry, but a few things stood out. A flash of flame. Blood splattered across the grass. A few last stubborn Grimm closing in. A flash of golden light and a feeling of warmth. Shaky fingers on a scroll. A long ride back to the city. Or had it been very short? She couldn’t recall. She did recall trembling in Sehkmet’s arms as the woman repeated one reassurance. 

*He’ll live, Icey. He’ll live.*

Live Antaeus did, at the cost of both legs and his hope of attending Beacon. There was nothing she could say or do to comfort or encourage him. All her words were meaningless, all her doting useless. It was then that Iset made a decision. Standing on the sidelines had gotten her nowhere. All of her shrinking back in the face of fear had only made things worse. The Grimm were still out there, terrorizing innocent people. They’d crushed Antaeus’s dreams. They needed to pay. 

Iset’s beloved teapot was re-purposed into a weapon with three forms. The first was no different from its usual form, aside from a hotter temperature from the fire dust conduits installed within. The second was an elegant if oddly built rifle, capable of firing jets of boiling liquid. The third could only be described as a flamethrower full of chamomile-scented death. With her weapon ready and her application in the mail, she told Antaeus of her plans. Combat school, for vengeance. Vale, to keep away from Atropos. 

Of course, he decided to go with her. No way was she “going and getting herself killed” he’d said. Hardly eager to be at a new school alone, Iset offered little protest. In a way, this was better. Two Huntsmen meant twice as many dead Grimm, and she quite liked the sound of that. 


#**Personality**

Iset is an optimistically cheerful pessimist. She always assumes things will go wrong for her, likely in the worst way possible, but has resolved not to let it bother her. Once she sets her mind to something, she is determined to complete her goal, no matter what. The issue is setting her mind to something to begin with. Whether from her constant fatigue or her low self-confidence, Iset often loses interest in her projects before she really starts them. Once she does become truly invested in something, her enthusiasm shines brightly through. 

Iset is extremely skittish and always wary of strangers. In general, she has trouble trusting people and remains on guard even after befriending someone. She’s prone to flinching and skittering away at loud noises and dislikes being touched without warning. Strangely, Iset doesn’t let her trust issues stop her from trying to make friends. Friendly and sociable, she’s happy to share a conversation and a cup of tea with anyone kind enough to accept. She’ll even permit hugs, so long as she is the one initiating them. 

Most notably, Iset is fiercely loyal and will not stand to see her loved ones harmed. Although she tends to leave them to fight their own battles, fearing she’ll get in the way more than anything else, she is quick to seek vengeance if those battles end with her loved ones severely hurt.

#**Notes**
- **Farsighted**: Unfortunate genetics and years of eye strain have cursed Iset to rely on her (in no way) trusty pair of spectacles. Without them, her field of vision, close up, becomes a mess of blurred shapes distinguished mainly by color. Although the glasses are held in place by a thin gold chain, they are prone to being lost either due to either them or the chain itself breaking. Without her glasses, Iset becomes distressed and fidgety and has trouble focusing until they’re back in her possession. 
Without her glasses, Iset suffers from the effects of Bad Sight 2, but on top of that, she cannot make Called Shots on targets within 10 yards, takes a -1 to defense, and takes a -1 to both her Wits and Composure. Her glasses are lost or destroyed on a called shot head, but can also be lost through a successful Slight of Hand roll made against her or per ST discretion. Her glasses are broken beyond immediate repair if damage from a called shot head exceeds her Aura score. If her glasses are lost, she must spend a Major Action to recover them. If her glasses are broken, they cannot be recovered for the rest of the fight."

I currently have a 3.4cgpa and a 3.1sgpa. If this last year goes well, I will graduate with a 3.5 cgpa and a (3.2-3.3) sgpa. I had a rough start freshman/sophomore year due to health issues, but I have an upwards trend (3.6-3.9) for the last two years. My ECs are okay and I haven't taken the MCAT yet. 

My PI has offered me a research internship starting after I graduate. The lab studies autoimmune diseases and is working to start collaborating with the University hospital. I am genuinely interested in continuing at the lab, but worry that it might not be as favorable as working as an EMT or CNA. 

Besides strengthening ECs and studying for the MCAT, would doing a DIY post-bac during my gap year help my application? I have not failed any classes, but rather got a fair share of Cs and BCs.  Would an SMP be better?"

I’m a bit nervous though, any advice?",Glowfish9,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/e2rhqp/help_ive_never_had_a_dog_before_and_am/,"So as the title says, i’ve never had a dog before. Honestly, I never really interacted with dogs before college since my little sister is scared of them.

But for the past year, i’ve been volunteering at the shelter and i realized that i really really love dogs! I would love to have a constant friend, love to take care of them and spend time with them. It seems like so much fun :) and as much as i love working with the shelter dogs, i just want one to call my own! 

But, i’m a junior in college and i don’t know what the future holds.. grad school? a 9-5 job? a summer internship where i can’t have a dog for 2 months? who knows. I keep telling myself that i’ll wait to settle down to get a dog but I’m starting to think there will never be a “right time” to get a dog. Lots of people have dogs in college and I would love to have one too. I’m home a lot, i can afford a dog, and my living situation allows it. 

I’m nervous about making a 15+ year commitment at this stage in my life.. does anyone have any advice? Or can anyone tell me more about the ups and downs about owning a dog? Thanks!"
e2sca7,21,2019-11-27,A Gratitude post for Neville's teaching and this community,Rank1Pleb,NevilleGoddard,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/e2sca7/a_gratitude_post_for_nevilles_teaching_and_this/,"First of all, I'm so glad I found this community. It genuinely makes me happy whenever I see someone successfully manifest their desires, or awaken to some profound insight. I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while and thought I'd share some of my own thoughts and experiences.    


I was a weird, imaginative and spiritual kid. As early as I could remember I had this absolute faith in some kind of supernatural force that can be tapped into by the will and conviction of man. I seriously had this 'occult' curiosity (especially around the ages of 8-12) and vividly remember performing prayers in the rain on the playground and drawing shapes in the dirt believing I could conjure magic lol. I spent alot of time imagining and I loved it. But when the teenage years rolled around, this curiosity was driven out by a societal pressure to 'conform' and be a normal kid. During these years I lost that 'spark' and imagination. I was persistently depressed for a LONG time, and even suicidal.   


Fast forward to the ages of 17 and 18, I discovered the world of self-development when I was under heavy pressure to succeed in getting into a good University. A number of my role models and teachers at the time (teachers as in authors, youtubers, and philosophers, not academic teachers)  alluded to this idea of 'belief creates reality.' I 're'-adopted this idea, and practiced gratitude and imagination. Within less than a year of manifestation work I had gotten accepted into my dream school when I previously thought I had ZERO chance, met the perfect group of friends, hired for very purposeful and fulfilling freshman internship, and met the girl of my dreams. I had it all, everything I had ever wanted at the time, life was truly perfect. I flipped my life around from seriously depressed and suicidal to having everything I dream of and being the best version of myself. However, it was so perfect in fact, that I had stopped practicing what got me there in the first place - gratitude and imagination.   


As you may have guessed, my life reached my first peak there, and began falling from there on out. My relationship ended a year after, and my university career took a downturn. I had lost interest in my major and began changing my path to a different field of study, starting from ground zero. I was confused and wondering where I had gone wrong.   


After a few months of self-reflection, I started to remember this story (thanks to the journal entries that I wrote back then - journaling is so important!). Around that time I stumbled upon Neville (thanks to Wayne Dyer), and found myself resonating with just about everything he's said. He captures everything I ever believed in as a kid, and I sincerely believe that there is an aspect of unconscious that him and I share (like he says, we are ALL God). I began practicing imagination and gratitude again, as well as praying to my God embodying self. Since then my life has been on a steady incline once again, and I am happier, more grateful, and more confident than ever. This time I've since manifested a whole bunch of small wins here and there. For example, earlier today I was reading Neville's biography (posted on the sidebar) out of curiosity, and just felt this immense gratitude for everything that I currently have; that this moment is perfect and exactly what is supposed to be. A few moments later I get a text from a SP that I didn't expect would message me at all, albeit I was very happy.   


Since restarting my imagination and gratitude practice, I am under complete conviction that my life is in for a positive transformation greater than anything I've ever experienced. This time however, I will not forget what brought me there - imagination and gratitude (love).   


I hope that you guys can take something from my story. TL'DR; *Don't lose your spark, no matter if you're in a 'low' point in your life, or riding the highs.* Don't forget to *always* remain grateful, and stay imaginative.   


I'm blessed to have discovered this community and am excited to be on the same journey with each of you. Cheers."
e2tv8z,1,2019-11-28,AITA for spilling a private talk?,[deleted],AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e2tv8z/aita_for_spilling_a_private_talk/,"Okay I don't really know how else to phrase the title than in the way I've written it. So basically this happened today, my friends were talking about some classmates and their work ethics so naturally I got curious and I asked them whom it's about. They told me that they wouldn't be telling me anything anymore since the last time they told me something it got out and made the situation worse.

What had happened the last time went somewhat like this. My friends and this person whom we'll just call Rash did their internship together. Rash is rather particular about a lot of things and has a bad opinion on almost everything but we get along pretty well or at least I thought we did. During the internship Rash found a lot of problems with the rest of the group (my friends) i.e in the way they cooked meals, in the sleeping arrangements (she told my friend to stop coughing too much a night wtf) and even things they couldn't control like which departments they were assigned to and supervisors assigned to. She also tried to stir up drama within the people working at the company (this lady worker had a crush on a dude who wasn't interested in her but was kinda shy and she kept flirting with him making the lady really pissed at the whole group etc). Rash also tried to pick a fight with both my friends in the group and made faces while talking to them and bitched about them to another group mate who remained neutral the whole while.

After the internship, my friends mentioned what had happened at the internship and all was fine. But one day Rash approached me a kept asking me what have they told me about the internship (since my friends and I live together) and told me her version of the events, which basically was a coverup of the things they told i.e. the meals were too spicy and not cooked to her liking, my friends coughing didn't allow her to sleep, they were favored by the supervisor, she did the lady-guy flirting for fun and it wasn't really flirting bla bla. She told me most of the things unprompted without me saying much at some points I did sort of defend my friends saying that that's not how they are and they probably did the real version and you'd misunderstood it. I thought that was it and things were fine. Also this happened a whole 3+ months ago.

And now I just got to know that she had been telling neutral friend &amp; others that my friends were bitching to everyone about her (they didn't). She also told it clearly that sally_curlz told me this happened so they've been lying to everyone including this gang we're loosely related to. She also holds a huge grudge against them for something that wasn't even done.

My friends say that they know that what I did wasn't with a malicious intent but state that I'm TA for spilling. I don't understand how Rash could've pretended all is fine and then went back around me and lied so blatantly.

AITA?"
e2udhy,187,2019-11-28,Gang rimmed by five horny tops in Dallas,UTAustinBiBottom,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/e2udhy/gang_rimmed_by_five_horny_tops_in_dallas/,"**‘So where are you going tonight?’**

Alisha quizzed me over breakfast tacos at FoodHeads. She could tell I was distracted. I was daydreaming about that night’s [planned gang rimming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/dzd0mr/invitation_to_being_gang_rimmed_this_weekendim/) at Jake’s house in Dallas. I couldn’t exactly explain it to her that having my hole eaten the prior weekend at Brian’s house produced a seismic sexual jolt through my body, and that I craved more. ‘I’m getting together with a few buddies I met through my family; you don’t know them.’ At least that was truthful. I kissed her and started planning for the drive up.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**‘Come with me, sexy’,** Jake grabbed my hand, gently leading me from the backyard where I’d been talking and laughing with the guys. They were funnier and sexier than Jake originally let on. Mostly, they were really nice. Joe described his sex life on the road during away games with his college team. Bill seemed curious how I’d chosen civil engineering as a major, and Mateo offered to get me connected with good internship opportunities during spring break and the summer. Alan was flirty and touchy, heavy on eye contact and touching my arm and back. They were all hungry, without saying it. So was I.

‘**I’m so glad you drove up. The guys really wanted to meet you. They’re really, really into you, Ben’,** Jake said in a low voice, pulling off my shirt in his master bedroom. Jake ran his hands over my smooth chest and unbuckled my jeans. ‘Did you prepare yourself as I asked?’, he teasingly quizzed, sitting me on the bed, pulling off my shoes and socks, then pulling off my jeans, and then my Armani briefs. ‘**Oh fuck, I missed that sweet ass of yours**’, he teased. ‘What about the guys?’ I asked. ‘**Oh, they’ll be up in a bit’, Jake said playfully. ‘But I get first dibs**’, as he pushed me back on the bed, pushing my legs up and apart. ‘That beautiful asshole, making me hungry.  So pretty’. Jake licked underneath my balls, his beard tickling. Then lower, circling my hole teasingly. And then his wet tongue found its mark. Contact. He jolted. And so did I.

I found my way to consciousness after a minute of bliss, and Bill stood in the doorway, watching me, naked my legs spread and Jake’s mouth darting back and forth against my hole. Pulling off his polo shirt, Bill stood next to Jake as he unzipped his pants, ‘Show me’, Bill said to Jake, and Jake removed his mouth from my ass. ‘S**weet holy Jesus**’, Bill gasped, ‘**hot college freshman asshole**’. Jake’s tongue returned to its resting spot inside me as Bill undressed, smiling at me. ‘You’re so hot, buddy’, Bill said, kneeling next to Jake. Bill kissed my legs and then took Jake’s place at my hole, moaning softly as he worked his tongue inside me. Jake pulled back and looked at me with a wet face. ‘**So fucking tasty. Like honey**.’

The other guys came up one at a time, letting the others enjoy eating my hole for a while before taking their turn. At one point, I opened my eyes and Alan stood in front of me by the bed. At 6’9’, he was physically imposing. A strong body, though not ripped, ruggedly handsome, a sexy beard, and the biggest feet I’d seen on a man. ‘What size shoe do you wear?’ I teased him. ‘Fourteen’ he shot back, sliding his tongue back and forth from his mouth. Joe lapping at my hole already had me aroused, though Alan was hot, even without the ecstasy of warm tongue inside me.

I wasn’t as nervous as I thought I’d be. I liked these guys and they were into me. They had such different approaches to eating my hole. Mateo loved to tease around the ring of my hole before diving in. Joe lapped at it like a Tootsie Roll, panting. Alan hiked my legs and locked his mouth around my hole, staring up at me, locking on my gaze as his tongue began to fuck me, as he growled and raised his eyebrows at me as he pushed deeper. Jake was a master at draining his saliva inside me. I wasn’t sure how much I could take, but I wanted to find out.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**‘Just close your eyes and focus on your hole’,** Jake whispered, lying next to me, as the guys kissed my waist and my legs and my feet and tongues competed to get deeper inside me. I lost track of which tongue was buried inside me, but it didn’t matter. It all felt so awesome, I couldn’t believe it. ‘**I told you last week, the center of your sexual pleasure is in your hole. Just focus on the pleasure. Feel how much pleasure your hole brings you. It’s so hot. Your asshole has the guys so hot, too, Ben. Hear their pleasure. Feel it**.’ I could feel the warmth of their mouths, feel the dripping of saliva from my hole onto the sheets, feel my hole more relaxed and open for them.

**‘You comfortable with all this?’,** Jake asked. It felt amazing, but I didn’t know what I meant, that I enjoyed it so much, especially dating a girl. ‘**Don’t worry about that, Ben. It doesn’t need labels yet. Just experience it for what it is**.’ He paused, as if choosing his words carefully. ‘**Feel the power you have, making the guys so hot when eating you. You’re a hot college dude with an amazing asshole. They know it. They love it. But your ultimate power as a young hot dude is using your asshole and body to make a man cum. It’s the ultimate bond. You would be amazing at it.  Have you thought about it?**’, Jake asked. I had thought about it, a lot. I told Jake I’m not sure I’d be any good at it.  And I didn’t want to explain all of it to my friends. ‘**You can try it, Ben. It’s safe and private here. These are good guys, patient. And they haven’t cum for a week, since I emailed them. Want to try?**’

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

‘**Up on your knees’,** Jake coached me, moving behind me to bury his tongue in my hole again.  I looked around at five guys, naked, rock hard, mentally aroused, and wet faces and beards. I came to terms with my power. Joe climbed on the bed, kissing my back and moving to the headboard. He kissed my forehead, then kissed me on the mouth. I could taste the wetness of my hole on his tongue. His hand stroked both sides of my jaw, holding it in place. His cock poked against my shoulder blades, and then along my neck. And then the giant head of his cock raised up to my lips, resting there between my lips, waiting. I opened my mouth and Joe pushed his cock inside. I hadn’t sucked a guy since my cousin Brian, but Joe’s cock was beautiful and his hands rested on my ears, to anchor me as he thrust against my throat.

I could hear Mateo behind me, jacking off as Jake hoovered at my hole, Mateo’s breath quickening. Jake pulled back and Mateo shot his load directly against my hole, his thick warm cum oozing along my crack, and pushing it around with his cock. Jake collected the cum with his fingers and pushed it inside my wet hole. ‘**He’s ready**’, Jake said to someone and then a reply I couldn’t hear. Alan climbed behind me, his strong hands grasping my waist and pulling me closer to him and pressing his cock against my hole.

**‘You sure?’** Alan said softly.  I wanted to say 20 things, but could say only two words: ‘**Do it**’. Alan pushed inside me slowly, kissing my back and holding my waist to pull me on his cock. It felt uncomfortable, though I was too wet to be in pain. ‘**Sexy little dude’**, Alan said, kissing my back again. He was fully inside me, pulled back, and then all the way in again. It actually felt great. Joe’s breath began to quicken and he thrust into my mouth one last time, holding my head as he shot his load against the back of my throat. I’d swallowed cum before, though Joe’s load was huge. ‘**Holy fuck**’, Joe groaned, draining himself in my throat and pulling out slowly. Alan began to fuck deeper, growling and panting as I tightened my hole and his fucking gained momentum. Alan growled and gasped, and I felt him cum in my ass, without asking. He kept fucking, and then collapsed on top of me, knocking me on my stomach.

Jake was right, I found my power, making Joe cum down my throat and milking Alan until he came in my ass. I knew that some people put labels on this, and I didn’t care. Those people were 200 miles away and I was with five sexy top men, making them cum.  I found myself on my knees again with Bill sliding his cock in my mouth. Jake entered me and began to fuck me. And on it went, until I collapsed on the bed.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I finally woke in Jake’s guest bedroom, stumbling into the shower to clean up for the drive home. I got out of the shower and heard Jake talking downstairs. I sat on the bed in a towel, calculating driving times to be back in time for my Calc study group and lunch with Alisha and our friends. ‘**Aha, so you are up**’, Jake startled me, standing in the doorway in a bathrobe. Alan stood next to him, in those sexy size 14 bare feet and a bathrobe. I guess Alan also spent the night. They sat on the bed next to me, making small talk and checking that I wasn’t freaking. ‘**You were amazing last night, Ben**’, Jake said, running his hands along my back. ‘**You** ***are*** **amazing, Ben’**, Alan retorted, kissing my neck. ‘**How’s your hole?**’ Jake teased, tugging at my towel. ‘**Let’s see**’, Alan joined in, pulling off the towel. I laid back for them, spread my legs and showed them my hole, still wet and tingling. ‘**Fucking beautiful asshole**’, Alan growled, bending down to eat me again. Soon enough, the three of us were naked on the bed, both of them hard and hungry and taking turns lapping at my hole.

I mentioned that I needed to be back in Austin by 2:00, but they were too engrossed. Alan leaned me back on the bed, pushing my legs apart and pushing his cock inside me. His mouth was on mine, and we kissed passionately as Alan raised my ankles over his shoulders. His giant frame pinned me underneath him. He kissed and nuzzled my neck and I began to milk him until he growled, squirting hard in my ass. I could tell he came a lot as it spread inside me. Alan pulled out and collapsed beside me as Jake took his place inside me. Jake was an amazing kisser. Bottoming for both of them in the morning was more passionate, more connected. The visual of my legs on their shoulders drove home that I felt surprisingly at ease bottoming for them. The sensation of their warm cum spraying inside me drove home just how intensely my hole could bring pleasure to these sexy men.  Jake came hard inside me. I looked at the clock, and I’d never make it back to Austin in time.  They both wanted to keep fucking, and my legs found their way back onto their shoulders, and I was where I wanted to be that sunny Sunday.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It was mid-afternoon before I drained them and we fully recovered. Jake and Alan both kissed me and made sure I’d be okay. It hit me that I didn’t know guys in Austin who were into this, and yet I craved more. **‘Why don’t you come stay here during winter break?**’ Jake asked. ‘**Hang out with us. Alan will drive up, and we’ll introduce you to some other cool guys. You’ll get as much tongue, cock, and hot cum in that beautiful asshole as you can handle, all safe and private. Nobody will know.**’ I drove off, the sensation of their cum slowly leaking from me as I drove down 35, reminding me of my own power and pleasure, craving still more."
e2uuj6,2,2019-11-28,F4A - White Wannabe Cuckquean,sexydppgirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/e2uuj6/f4a_white_wannabe_cuckquean/,"Title basically covers it, haha.

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully.

""Sweety, I'm so sorry,"" she said with a very sympathetic look ""I know I was supposed to take care of you tonight, but Liz just called while you were in the shower and she really needs a friend right now. I'm gonna grab a few drinks with her.""

""Ugh..."" I sigh, ""OK. OK. But, I've been saving it up all for you this week and I'm about to explode!""

""Well, since I'm the one bailing, I'll let you use the on-call tonight"" she replied.

""Who is it tonight?"" I asked as my mood quickly started to change for the better...

OK. So for this RP, I want you to play two women - my wife and the on-call girl who I get to use a few times a year when my wife gives me permission. The on-call girl is always someone we know, and my wife set them all up.

My wife is a very organized woman. So basically, she put together a calendar and gets every day scheduled about two or three months in advance. All of them know the deal - if you're on call, you MIGHT get a call from me and if you do, you're supposed to come by and give me head, no questions asked, until I explode.

So, for tonight, I want you to respond to my question about who it is with one of the following and I want to play the night out with you, my on-call woman:

Amanda: My wife's super-slutty friend.

Jill: Her mom was a huge slut when I was in college and I used to fuck her. My wife's firm just hired Jill and told me about her...about how slutty and sexy she was. I asked to see a pic and I immediately recognized her. Long-story short, she was just as slutty, maybe even more, than her mom. So when my wife asked her about me, she jumped at it...and she knows her mom's history with me, but she doesn't care at all.

Brittany: Another co-worker of my wife's - actually an intern. She just turned 21 and is a big-titted, blonde slut. She's been 21 for three months and still never paid for her own drink.

Lizzy: One night when I was allowed to use the on call, the woman who was on had to bail. My wife made me a Tinder account to find a replacement...Lizzy was it. And she was good. My wife liked her, so she stayed in the mix.

Gillian: Has a GREAT rack and an almost unmatched enthusiasm for sucking cock. She's a friend of my ex-girlfriend that my wife has met a few times cause she hangs out at some of the same places we do and we always say hi. My wife quickly recruited her when she saw how slutty she was dressed.

Bridgette: Married woman about two doors down. She is a super MILF with a great body and her hubby is away a lot. She'd never get permission from hubby to do this so she'd rather hope not to get caught and ask for forgiveness if she does.

Ashley: A thick, sexy, super slutty former co-worker and hookup of mine who happens to still live nearby.

Your Idea: Tell me/show me another character you want to play.

A Porn Star: Through my wife's firm, she represents many in the entertainment industry, including the adult industry. Her clients that I'm into are: Dayna Vendetta, Angela White, Abbey Brooks, Audrey Bitoni, Vicky Vette, Dylan Ryder, Leslie Zen, Tory Lane, and Jenna Haze. You can pick any one (or more).

So if you're still with me, get in touch, and tell me who you want to play. I can show you what I envision any of these potential characters look like, but am also open to suggestions you have! I can also give you more background on the type of character I want my wife to play too, but you can probably already gather that she's sexy, confident, and always looking out for me.

With the right partner, I think this can be a lot of fun, so get in touch soon and light up that orange envelope!"
e2vyjs,6,2019-11-28,It’s all my fault,SkarletHart,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/e2vyjs/its_all_my_fault/,"My fiancé of four years just broke up with me because he doesn’t have feelings anymore.

We have both had a really bad year. I had a really bad regression this year in emotional health which caused me to be a toxic partner.  I relied on my fiancé financially while expecting him to take care of me and my bullshit.  The pressure and loneliness that this caused him sort of “broke him” and caused him to drift away from me as a partner. 

I did finally get my shit together, but not soon enough as financially there was damage and emotionally the power exchange between us was damaged. My brother was also living with us to help him out and this caused additional stresses. 

Back in August my fiancé tried to break it off and I basically pleaded a case for everything that was well.. us! I respected his feelings and I really do want his happiness, but I felt like maybe he wasn’t giving us a fighting chance to bounce back.

He decided that he would try and see what happened and today he told me that he knew that he was not happy. He said there was happiness here and there but overall he was not happy. There are lots of additional reasons why but that’s not the point.  During our trying period, I seriously reinvested my energy and feelings into him and got even more invested while he was slowly stepping away. 

Reddit, I know I fucked up. I was so depressed I was borderline suicidal and using the internet to constantly escape from any real life stresses and dumping it all on him. I had just finished my schooling and had to start my internship which felt daunting because I didn’t get paid for it. I was a giant asshole who took advantage of the most wonderful man and pushed him to far.

I am reeling in so many emotions, I can’t stop crying and it fucking hurts. Everything I’ve been working towards and nurturing for four years just melted away in front of my eyes, and I can’t do anything to change it.

How the fuck do I tell my family? I’ve been the fuck up dating shitty guys my whole teenager hood  and not impressing my parents and finally I get a guy  as an adult that my family loves and is just a great person. How do I deal with this for Thanksgiving and Christmas? How the hell am I supposed to go to my parents house and look outside and see where he proposed to me?? :,( 

I’m so ashamed and mad at myself for being such a toxic shit and for struggling! Why me, depression? I can’t justify to loved ones how bad I feel because they don’t see you, only I do! 
I feel like this is all my fault (even though objectively it takes two to tango). My mental illness and bad coping basically broke the man I love and ruined my relationship.

He said he really tried to get over it but he just can’t. It’s been over six months. It’s all my fault, how am I going to live with this?

I don’t know what to do. I’ve never been an adult on my own. I’m so fucking sad, I feel like I’m in a waking nightmare.  I hate me right now.  I’ve had a lot of relationships in the past and I’m always moving on from “happy times”. This relationship was really the first healthy relationship I ever had, and I feel like I’m the toxic poison that just ruins everything good that I touch. 

Why can’t I just wake up and everything be ok? I can’t even stop crying I am so lost and scared."

I'm not sure how to describe it but as an anxious introvert, I'm trying really hard to network so that I can expand my mindset, fill my life with more positive people (my mind used to fill with 90% of negative thoughts), and find internship opportunities ever since I transferred from CC.

 I'm more comfortable with numbers, not so good with writing (English isn't my first) but I'm still trying to improve it everyday. I'm willing to listen and work in teams. I love to help people, animals, environment and give back whatever I can. 

I don't think I'm passionate about accounting enough to sit for CPA exam (probably CMA), but I also want to learn SQL, Tableau to make myself standout since my communication skills aren't that great. I asked some friends for advice and they suggested accounting intelligence. 

How can I approach this?"

I'm a working-student (without even Bachelor yet) on SAP SD internship in a very big company. It's been only 3 months since I've started this job and it looks like I will stay for longer. Because of that, I have started thinking more about the future of mine as an SAP consultant.

When I look at my experienced co-workers (I'm the only such ""kid"" in the entire office) I mostly see stress and a looooot of work - sometimes even no time to visit a toilet. More of that, many of them quite often work at home till night, because of the many tasks they have. Even I spend most of my free time (including weekends) learning and catching up.

Is it how working as an SAP consultant mostly looks like? The work that absorbs you?

How does it look like in other SAP connected positions? Is it the same for ABAP or SAPUI5 Developer?

Do you personally think that you are living that way?

And finally, do you really enjoy working with SAP?

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I completely understand that it must be hard for beginners - I've been learning programming for some time and I know how much effort you have to put in. But at the same time, I am looking at my colleagues in Programming in Java/Testing in the same company and they are happy with their free time for studying and other things in life."
e2z5yu,2,2019-11-28,My situations feels hopeless,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/e2z5yu/my_situations_feels_hopeless/,"I've always thought that my husband is one of a kind. He gave me everything I wanted, not only material things, but also attention, the feeling of being loved and cherished and most of all: hope that everything gets better.

I gave up my life for him. I know it was dumb, but I was just so happy to have someone around me, that I truly loved. 

I moved to another city, leaving my family and friends a 7h drive behind. I only knew my partner and his family. And I was okay with that, because he had a job, while I just finished high school.

I've worked alot of different jobs in my life, working has never been a problem for me. When I started working in this new city, I was pressured alot in my job. It was bad enough that I had to quit after only 7 months. (I worked fulltime and got paid like someone who only works 8h/week since it was not a REAL job, but rather a paid ""internship"")

Soon after I was diagnosed with physical health problems. I tried to find new work, something to do. In a small town you barely have a chance to get a good job or anything if you're not from there. I had alot of different job interviews, even scoring the best in the tests and having really good qualifications didn't make them choose me. I was devastated and depressed. 

""You didn't try hard enough!"" - ""You can't expect people to hire you, if you only look for the best jobs to take!"" - ""Don't be so picky, maybe then you will get a job""

That was what I heard from my partner, but it was okay. I silently cried myself to sleep and took his harsh words.

I tried to apply for around 60 different jobs in and out of the town. I got declined every single time. They never really told me why, but I guess it was because I don't have the personality that they wanted in a worker.

Then I decided to make my bachelor's degree. It started off fine, my partner was very supportive of me and didn't want me to contribute financially, since he had a really good paying job.

Depression got me hard. I could barely function.

I was ready to get therapy, but I declined help for at least 10 months. I just gave up.

Drowning in depression, physical pain due to my health issues every day and a broken will made my life hell. I was thinking about suicide every single day. My partner was only supportive when I did something. He couldn't get that I wasn unable to move sometimes, not only mentally, but physically.

We fought alot. I was just so sad, that he didn't understand my pain, that he saw me being literally dead inside and still insisted, that I was just acting.

Basically we fought, he hurt me, I was trying to leave, he bought me everything I wanted and I was trapped again.

I never noticed, that he was actually emotional abusive towards me. 

Years passed and I was still fighting my depression. I was talking myself into this relationship, trying to convince myself, that he was a perfect husband and that I had to be thankful and happy. 

He wasn't.

He never was.

I have a baby with him now. Our son is 3 months old. I have no job, didn't even get my bachelor's degree and I am turning 29 soon. My parents are old and about to retire. 

I have no backup plan (suicide) anymore, since I have a baby that NEEDS me. 

I can't go and live somewhere else and start over.

I have nowhere to go. 

I have to stay with my husband, smiling so he won't be in a bad mood. I have to take care of him and my baby and there is no way out of this.

I gave my whole life to a man, because I didn't know better, and he can do whatever he wants with me now."

e30ldo,1,2019-11-28,M4F Landlady and Her Husband,BlackBerryCumBucha,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/e30ldo/m4f_landlady_and_her_husband/,"When I still in university and got my first intern, I needed a place to stay in North London and advertised for a house share. I had sixteen replies, but the house nearest to my work belonged to a married couple who thought it would be good to have help paying the bills. As they had plenty of space, they had looked for a lodger and within 2 weeks of my placing the ad, I'd moved in.

Pat and John were in their late 30s or early 40s, John was medium height and slim, and was very quiet. Pat was 5' 3"", busty, with a bit of a tummy and big bottom and thighs. She had curly brown hair (dyed, I suspected). In height and build she was very much like my mother and I suppose this helped put me at ease living in this new place.

I'd been living there for about 2 weeks, when one day while Pat and John were out and I was using the loo, I noticed the lid had been left off their laundry basket. I did my own washing and had therefore never had occasion to lift the lid, but today it was off. My eyes were drawn like magnets to a pair of Pat's knickers lying on the top of the dirty laundry. They were black, cotton and quite large, and I couldn't stop myself picking them up. My mind was transported back to when I was younger and still living with my parents. I would sometimes take my mum's knickers from the laundry basket and smell their heady aroma while masturbating. Sometimes I would come in the gusset before cleaning them up and replacing them in the basket.

On this occasion however, I put them back and returned to my bedroom, but couldn't get Pat's knickers out of my mind. I returned to the basket and lifted them again. Underneath was a pair of tan coloured nylons stockings and I picked these up also. I went to my room, undressed and put the knickers up to my face. The smell was wonderful, and it made me think of all the times I'd wanked my cock into mum's pants at home. I wrapped the stockings round my cock, wanked it up and down, and before too long I was squirting my sticky blobs into the gusset of Pat's knickers. As I did so, I repeated Pat's name and called her some dirty names to heighten the intensity of my cum. ""You dirty girl Pat, you're making me cum in your pants, dirty bitch...""

When I'd finished, I cleaned the sperm out with tissue and replaced the stockings and knickers in the basket. They were still very wet, but I figured she wouldn't notice before washing them.

Over the next few weeks, every time Pat and John went out I was straight up to the bathroom to see what was in the laundry. Usually, I was rewarded with a pair of worn knickers and stockings, or sometimes knickers and tan-coloured tights all rolled up together. I would always take them to my room and masturbate. I loved to smell the aroma of Pat's slit on the material, and before long I graduated to putting my tongue in them and tasting it. I always finished by squirting my filth into the gusset while saying dirty words. I'd also started to take her knickers at night after Pat had gone to bed, putting them back straight afterwards.

One day things changed completely. Pat and John had been out for the evening when they got back it was obvious Pat had been drinking quite heavily. When john went upstairs to bed she told him she'd be up shortly, and stayed in the lounge half sitting, half laying on the sofa. When she heard John close the bedroom door, she got up to follow him, and said ""goodnight you naughty boy, I'll leave you a present in the usual place."" My heart nearly stopped and I spluttered that I didn't know what she was talking about. She just smiled her drunken smile, leaned over me and said ""don't be shy, I know what you get up to. It's OK it can be our little secret!"" With that she staggered out of the room and went upstairs.

My heart was pounding, and I was scared. How much did she know, and what would she do? If she'd been angry, surely she would have confronted me before. I didn't go into the laundry basket that night and vowed never to do so again.

The next morning, Pat came downstairs later than usual wearing only her nightie. She sat at the breakfast table, and as soon as John left the room she said ""I'm sorry if I disgraced myself last night, I was very drunk. Please don't take it the wrong way"". I told her it was OK, but I had no idea what she was talking about. She gave me a funny look, put her hand on top of mine in a reassuring gesture, and said ""now please don't deny it."""

I’m about to get married and graduate with a bachelors degree within the next month. I started my first job (besides a previous paid internship) about a year ago and I went from 2nd shift to nights about 6 months ago. At first I was fine, even enjoyed the night shift. 

As time passed, I’ve become increasingly more and more depressed. I’m also under a lot of stress with trying to get things together for my (small) wedding and graduating. There are currently no open positions for me to move to at my company and it’s not really somewhere I envision myself being for much longer. I’m supposed to meet with my manager and HR possibly sometime next week to discuss options. I don’t feel they will be able to do much. I was told I could only have an accommodation if my schooling interferes with my work schedule, but apparently my mental and physical health isn’t a qualifying factor to have any modification. I understand the business needs workers at certain times and I cannot receive special treatment. 

The experience I have gained here is valuable for my career, but I feel it’s more of a stepping stone.  I have roughly 2 weeks until I have some time off and I’m squeezing in a small honeymoon during that time. I have been debating on just putting in my two weeks and figuring things out after the holidays. It’s severely affecting my mental health and I debate on just quitting every day I walk in the door. It doesn’t have anything to do with my coworkers, they’re great, but the job tasks don’t keep me interested and the hours are killing me. 

I planned on waiting it out until I had another job lined up. I have enough money saved to float me for the next few months if needed. I just don’t know how much longer I can do this. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What did you end up doing?"

I'm considering replacing the ""Sincerely"" with a japanese word/expression, just to demonstrate that ""I'm trying."" Would 「敬具」 be appropriate here, or would it be too weird without the corresponding opening 「拝啓」? Is there another word that would fit better?

If that doesn't work well, then I'm also considering replacing my english ""I look forward to hearing from you"" with 「お返事お待ちしております」. However, I fear that may be ""trying too hard"" given that it should be obvious that I simply copy-pasted it from the internet.

For full context, this is a cover letter for a tech internship in Japan. Japanese is not necessarily expected, but in the job posting they do mention ""Basic communication in Japanese desirable."""

I had started dating him shortly after a previous breakup so it’s been around 2.5 years since I was last single.

He really wanted to stay friends with me but I’ve already decided to do NC and I miss him so much. We live near each other and I still pass by him a lot and see him laughing with friends and it hurts. It hurts even more because he wasn’t even sad about breaking up with me... I can’t even understand why I miss him when he insulted me and treated me badly half the time. I’ve tried to surround myself with friends and other people, but nothing feels fulfilling and I still come home each day feeling empty and lonely.

I want to be with someone who I can give my heart to and laugh with again, but I know I need to step back and change myself before trying to hop into relationships.

I hear a lot about people picking up new hobbies or working on themselves after breakups, but I’m a student and I have to study for finals, write my final papers, and I don’t know where to find the time to change. Next semester won’t start until late January and I don’t know what to do until then... Winter break will be even lonelier since all my friends are traveling and I didn’t have the funds to join them so I’ll be at home writing internship applications.

Am I just stuck until winter break or next semester? What can I even do during the break? Would going to the gym everyday or exercising even help fill the empty feelings?"

He mentioned it's important to keep every copy of the draft in the process. His brother is a techie guy. He's trying to create a word processor that saves every edit and version of the doc. So, when you press save, in the background it will save legalcase\_COPY45.doc and also save to a cloud. He was telling me that way, a few days later you may of realized that the previous draft was better and can just revert to that document. Potentially, it can save every edit permanently in the doc.

I was curious, doesn't Google Docs do this to an extent? I would also assume lawyers would be responsible in saving their draft copies (but I guess saving to a cloud may be a benefit in case their computer breaks). 

I guess I'm wondering, do lawyers ever run into problems where they realized a previous draft their team made was actually a more correct one than they have now? (but have since deleted it).

Let me know what you guys thought of this season

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!All I have to say is that Gen X slayed this season. It is awesome how they managed to use their knowledge of life and pull out the win. The final three absolutely killed it. They basically stayed in power the entire game. The millennials absolutely sucked butt. It was kind of embarrassing for them. Cameron, Beckett, and James are probably going to be the only three of their tribe that will be remembered for something. Overall, I would say this was a good season, but not as good as past seasons. Still good though.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Possible All-Stars: &gt;!Dominic, Barbra, Lyra Silver, Cameron, Thomas, Bo, Beckett, James!&lt;

Possible Second Chances: &gt;!Barbra, Lyra Silver, Cameron, Thomas, Beth, Bo, Bobby, Becktt, James, Alex!&lt;

I was wondering if there is any place that provides summer internships for students.
e354g3,21,2019-11-28,I don’t want to grow up,boot-doot,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/e354g3/i_dont_want_to_grow_up/,"I know that this is something that a lot of people say, but it’s a feeling I have so powerfully that it’s actually made me rather depressed. 

I’m 19 and I’m transferring from a 4 year university to a community college because I’ve been so miserable. I have literally no friends, hate my classes, and literally don’t know what I want to do with my life anymore. I used to want to do film, but because I’ve been so depressed, I’ve lost all real creativity and ambition. I also have had a really unpleasant internship experience that has made me realize how harsh the industry is. 

I regret not appreciating high school more, even though I wasn’t actually all that happy there either. But at least I wasn’t having to worry about a job and money and my future as much as I am now. 

I feel like I’m wasting my youth. I’m not having fun, I’m not partying or drinking. I don’t even have a boyfriend, or even guys interested in me lol. It seems like all the girls around me are these really beautiful people who are having fun and making the most of their youth, and I’m instead stuck in my dorm room being miserable. 

It just sucks because everyone always says how these are supposed to be the best years of your life, but I’m miserable. I don’t know what I’m going to do. Everything is so uncertain and unstable. I don’t know what to do with my life. 

I don’t know if I should stick with an internship that I hate, because if I quit it that means this will have been the third job I quit within less than 3 months. I don’t know if I should stick with film, or try to find something else. I’m worried that I’m going to ruin my own future. That I’m never going to find love. That I’m going to live a miserable life. That I’m always going to be lonely and dissatisfied.

What was life like for you when you were 19? Did you like adulthood, or has it all just sucked? Do you miss being a teenager?"

6 months ago, I came into contact with an old friend who I always had a thing for. He did as well but timing was never right (past relationships). We’ve been friends for 5-6 years, we never knew we each had feelings until we reconnected this summer. 

These past 6 months, we have explored our feelings and have completely immersed ourselves into each other. Unfortunately, we don’t live in the same state but I have been there three times to visit and he came come down once. I’m in my last year of grad school and currently in internship, we have made plans to close the gap once I graduate in 9 months. I had bought a planned ticket to go next month. The reason why I’ve been there more than he has visited me is because he has his own apartment so we have privacy. Because of my unpaid internship, I moved back in with my parents. 

We have held off making things official but we are exclusive. Communication has been key to making this work and we both have stated what we have wanted in a relationship and in life. We’ve both confirmed that we wanted to settle down with each other and build a life together in his city. I had bought a plane ticket to see him next month before the holidays, for a whole week, the longest trip yet. 

A few days ago, he stated that the distance was too much for him and he wanted his space. He mentioned that if I lived there, we would’ve already started our life together but the distance hurts him too much. He hates going back to an empty apartment after taking me to the airport and stated that he rather not have me come to visit him, even though the ticket is bought. He was surprised when I declared my feelings about him during this conversation, even though I have always been open about them. He seemed surprised I cared about him so much. He also mentioned that he feels lost and does not know what to do with his life. He stated that this time of the year is the worst for him and he feels super low and he just can’t deal with more sadness by missing me. 

He’s the one for me. I have completely fallen for him and was ready to move my life for him. I know he feels the same way about me. I feel upset and heartbroken about this decision and I know I should give him his space. I wished him a happy thanksgiving but I told myself I would not bother him anymore. He sent me the money I spent for the ticket even though I told him not to. 

I don’t want to give up on him. I want to show him that I truly care about him. He’s hard working, sweet, caring and a true family man. He has showered me with love and true respect unlike anyone I have dated. The way he looks at me in person and over FaceTime makes me feel incredibly lucky to have found him again. 

Would it be out of this world to surprise him next month on my original travel date? I want to show him how real my feelings are for him. If we lived in the same city, I would wanted to speak about this in person. Plus, he stated that if we did live in the same city, we would be together. Original travel date is 3 weeks away so he will have his space. I will rent a hotel room incase things don’t go well. I’m pulling a page out of all the hopeless romantic movies and flying to show him he’s the one for me. I will fight for this relationship. I will show him that I’ll always be here for him. 

Should I go surprise him?

TL;DR - We were in a long distance “relationship”. We have completely fallen for each other. He stated the distance was too much for him. He still has strong feelings for me. However, this time of the year is rough for him. Should I still go see him on our planned visit?"

e37eoo,154,2019-11-28,I wore a fake moustache to my first job for a week because I was scared I was going to be looked down upon for looking younger.,Darth_Haidar,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/e37eoo/i_wore_a_fake_moustache_to_my_first_job_for_a/,"I had and still have a baby face and when I got my first job as a digital marketing intern for a summer, I had a lot of thoughts racing through my mind. 

One of these thoughts were “Am I able to get respect from my co workers without them seeing me as some kid?”. I met the people I was working with before I was supposed to start as an introductory and the vibe I got was although friendly, also a bit condescending. I started the job 4 months later because that’s when summer started and funnily enough ,everyone that I met except for the boss, was no longer there, it was a whole new staff. I bought a fake stick on moustache that suited me quite well and it helped my paranoia and self confidence because I no longer worried if they were looking down on me.

I wore it every day for a week and then one day, I decided to leave it home and walked in. Every co worker said “Oh you shaved your moustache wow” and I just played along instead of admitting it was a fake because I was self conscious. One woman who was quite close to my age said I looked more youthful without it and then it hit me. Truly professional people won’t care about how young someone is as long as they are a good worker and a good person and luckily for me the whole office was like that so at the end of the day there was no point of pretending.

So that’s my confession that I wore a fake moustache to my first job to look older in an attempt to get respect."

2 years ago I met this amazing woman on Tinder. We clicked so perfectly together and we fell in love with eacother faster than we could blink. It was love at first sight, the kind you only hear about in movies. Our families clicked well together aswell, and so did our friends. It felt like we were the dream couple.

From the moment we got together, there was a ticking time bomb. She had just accepted an internship that would take her to the capital, an hour by plane from where we lived. She was going to move there, work there and live there full time, only going home if she worked extra hours to cover her absence, or by using her 5 weeks of paid vacation. And all this would last 2 and a half years.

We met 3 months before she was set to move and when the time came, we decided to battle through it. Our love for eachother was so strong on both sides that we thought the long distance wouldn’t break us. 
We were wrong.

2 weeks ago we broke up. But it didn’t really feel like a breakup... we still care for eachother.. and we still think we’re right for eachother.. but it’s hard to stay in love when the distance is so great and the time spent so short. We decided it was best to be by ourselves for now, untill she comes back home next summer. Figure out or own lives.

Not gonna lie, it’s hard. It’s so damn hard. Loving someone but knowing being together just isn’t working out. It’s the most pain I’ve ever felt. But I carry hope knowing that maybe someday, things will be better. You never know what the future has in store for both of us however. Maybe she meets someone else. Maybe I do. Who knows? All I know is that if it’s meant to be, it’ll be. 

Sometimes I’m scared, but that’s easy. Being brave, that’s the hard thing to be. Whenever I feel bad about the breakup, I think: «It hurts just as much not being together now, than it would if we were together». 
Long distance sucks.. and we held on for almost 2 years, but the pain of not being together lasts longer than the pain of breaking up. And time will tell wether we will miss each other, or wether we will move on to find new love in life.

I hope we end of back together. At the time of me writing this, I still love her and would take her back in a heartbeat, but life moves on. We both have to find our way to cope and move on. Not “move on” from the relationship per say,  but keep moving forward. I find distracting myself to be very efficient and it helps take my mind off her. 

So that’s my story. I know many people have similar stories, and I would love to hear them! If you find your breakup to be similar to mine, be positive. Love always prevails. It hurts today, and it will hurt tomorrow, but the hurt tells you that what you had was real! Don’t let it swallow you, let it empower you. And most importantly, don’t taint the good memories you have of your relationship. Cherish them, for they tell you of a time when you had the world, and it’s a remainder of what is yet to come for you again. Love to all ❤️


TL;DR: “If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they’re yours; If they don’t they never were”.
It’s scary, it’s sad and it’s rough to let someone you love go, but don’t be afraid. Life always finds a way.  If it’s meant to be, it’ll be."

e37n9o,3,2019-11-28,‘99 Miata bit the dust. Would an early Z4 make for a suitable replacement?,PapaPopov,BMW,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/e37n9o/99_miata_bit_the_dust_would_an_early_z4_make_for/,"My Miata is officially totaled, and I need something to replace it ASAP. I’m a college kid that will be working a full-time internship next semester with a ~1 hour commute. Budget is ideally ~8k, but willing to go up to 10k.

In my eyes the Z4 seams like a great replacement for the Miata, even if it sacrifices a bit of handling. My commute over the summer was 45min, and it was bearable but I’d like something a bit nicer but still in the same vein as a Miata. My main concern is maintenance/reliability, but I can do the work myself and I figured a (relatively) low mileage NA engine wouldn’t be too bad to maintain assuming that I treat it right.

Found an ‘03 2.5i 5MT w/ 77k and a great spec for 7k,

And also an ‘04 3.0i 6MT w/ 74k for 7.5k, but I’m not a huge fan of wheels so I’d probably end up replacing them.

I was leaning towards the 2.5 for the lower prices and (theoretically) better fuel economy, but the lack of a 6 speed makes a highway commute sound pretty rough after commuting in a 5-speed Miata.

If anyone could weigh in on buying, daily-ing, and maintaining one of these cars it would be greatly appreciated!"
e37y6g,1,2019-11-28,Feel like I'm being pulled in two directions and need some guidance from seasoned people,knf1997,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/e37y6g/feel_like_im_being_pulled_in_two_directions_and/,"So as the title of this post says, I kind of feel like I'm being called strongly to two separate things as of the place I'm in right now with life.

I've done some traveling in Asia and really had a blast. Visited Thailand and China somewhat extensively and gained a deep appreciation for other cultures and ways of life that helped to break me out of a bad mindset. I definitely feel the pull to keep traveling more extensively and do things that take me to areas of the world I've never been. Ed Pratt on Youtube is definitely a massive inspiration for me and I'd love to live that kind of life.

On the other hand, I've just got a lot going on with my career at the moment. I'm in my last year of college and I've recently started a demanding, yet promising, internship in a law firm. If I continue down this path and work this job for the next 2 years or so, I'll be in a really good place financially by the time I'm 24-25 (currently 21 going on 22 soon). However, committing to this path means that I won't have any chances to travel while I build up my resume and work. Additionally, a year long gap in my resume would look really crappy. 

I feel like I should see the world while I'm younger and go to the places I want to go, but I can't deny the importance of building a good career. It would be really foolish to just throw my current job prospects in the trash can to go run around in Asia and Africa, but I also feel like I'm ignoring a really important part of myself and life by not pursuing my desire to indulge in travel. Is there a good way to find balance between these two callings? Just want some input from a guy/woman who's been here before."

With my ADHD and anxiety, I'm hypersensitive to what other people around me are feeling so not having any kind of reassurance from my partner or insight into his life has been frustrating, to say the least. Basically, I was looking at his Instagram page three days ago and discovered comments from an ex that were posted two weeks ago. After I brought it up to him, he told me that he broke up with her a day before he met me. The advantage of having ADHD is that you're more resilient than most and small setbacks don't really bother you, but the downside is that once something does affect you, it hits you HARD. He insisted that I wasn't a rebound, but I still screenshotted her comments before he deleted them from his page (which he probably wouldn't have done had I not brought it up) and I look at them at least a couple times a day and feel horribly about myself. His profile is also flooded with comments (about 30-100 per post) from his friends, most of whom are insanely attractive girls with clear skin, perfect bodies, and just everything I really wish I had. Of course I've been spending most of my time these past few days looking at their pictures and wishing I could be the kind of person he or anyone else was actually excited to be with. It freaking sucks. He's made some attempt at calming me down by telling me that he thinks I'm funny and smart, which actually just makes me feel worse because it sounds like I'm more of a ""personality"" type than a ""looks"" type. I know this whole thing is silly and trivial but I just can't shut my mind off from it.

I've never been insecure about my looks before (mostly just my internalizing issues and fluctuating self-esteem for the past few years) but this whole thing has taken my depression to a new low. I used to think I was decently pretty, and now I feel extremely deflated by the mere thought of the people involved in my partner's life. I don't feel good enough for him or anyone at all, which I know is insane because I'm 18, in two national organizations for human factors psychology, a former intern at a social enterprise accelerator and coordinator at a coworking space, 4.0 student, and I'll be a junior at the end of this semester. And I'll be graduating debt-free, I care so much about research and being successful in my career and I know I have a ton of opportunities going for me and that it's dumb to obsess over people that are my polar opposites, but for some reason I can't stop myself from continuing into this downward spiral. I guess my main problem is that I KNOW I have value but I just don't FEEL like I do. Does that make sense? Does anyone else feel stuck in that kind of mindset sometimes? 

To be honest, I have no idea what to do about my plummeting self-image. I haven't felt truly happy in years and it feels like there's been a huge weight on my chest for so long. If I ever experience happiness with friends or family, it's always fleeting. This whole relationship situation, culminated with just having a lot of ""friends"" violate my boundaries recently (and me cutting them off afterwards), has made it virtually impossible for me to accept a compliment without feeling like there's some kind of ulterior motive behind it. I'm afraid to open up to this about anyone (especially my partner) because it feels like I'm the problem and there's no solution. What's more, I tried talking to a male ""friend"" about it last night and he tried to be supportive, but then he sent me a bunch of messages today confessing his affection for me. At this point, I feel too exhausted to even address that because things like that have happened so many times with so many people and I'm done with it. I'm already seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist so I'm already getting help for my mood, I just wish I could give up my academic success and emotional maturity and whatever the heck else I have to be gorgeous, carefree, desirable, and self-assured. I tried taking the first step a few hours ago by deleting Instagram off of my phone but that hasn't made much of a difference in my mood levels or thought patterns. I don't have the slightest clue as to how to pick myself up from this so any feedback or personal experience would be much appreciated. Thank you all so much."

I'm gonna start this post off with a statement: I did not take Grade 12 physics. I got chemistry coming up next semester, but I have not done physics since last year. 

Anyway, here are my questions:

* Can I minor or double major an engineering program? I know that a B.Eng has a lot of required credits, but is there a compressed engineering minor program for any of the streams?

* In hindsight I regret not taking Grade 12 physics, because computer engineering as a subject actually looks really interesting but as of now I have no shot at it. Is it possible/does it happen that CS or software eng students transfer to computer engineering?

* Is it true that software engineering has very few / no electives?

* I applied for CS with coop. Would it be possible for me to opt out of the coop program later on if for some reason in the future I don't want to/cannot do the internship?

Thanks!"

e3af88,9,2019-11-29,Are There Problems with The Breaths and Can We Fix Them?,Dccrulez,KimetsuNoYaiba,https://www.reddit.com/r/KimetsuNoYaiba/comments/e3af88/are_there_problems_with_the_breaths_and_can_we/,"Looking at the way Breath's are shown in the series I feel that their foundation is a little weak and is lost at times. Looking at some of the forms displayed, specifically by Kyojouro and Kagaiku, I can't help but feel that some instances are wholly fantastical and lack any real grounding. Furthermore the entire concept of breaths being derived from others feels weak and confusing, how could the breath of beast be derived from anything? How could everything be derived from a breath no one knows? It feels like there were some foundations developed by the author but not fully implemented or maintained. Because of this I'd like to suggest some ways to rewrite and reinforce these Breath's to create a more comprehensive understanding.

Firstly, the Breaths are compilations of themed forms that evoke images of fantastical occurrences, this is the basis of the idea. So our first two focuses should be: Why are there themes and why do they evoke this imagery? Looking at actual martial arts, every form is designed to a scenario, every action has purpose and have some utility. The way one moves their body and their blade have both offensive and defensive reasoning. If we look at some of the most established forms then the logic in them become clear. Lightning 1 establishes the idea of the Lightning breath: By focusing muscle output one can generate incredibly high speed strikes that evoke the image of a lightning strike. This is designed to be a one and done strike to quickly down a dangerous opponent and it's imagery can be explained through a variety of things including the polarization of the air through friction produced static electricity. Then we have water forms like 6, which is shown to be superior in water by actually lending itself to the motions of water, and 10 which functions much like a river, building strength and eroding obstacles through persistence. These two forms best express the theme of Breath of Water: moving like water which in turn allows one to better manipulate water, and the visualization can be expressed as the water vapor collecting on the blade from the intense speed of the swings. These forms easily establish their concepts and give us our baselines to base all breaths on. Lightning breaths should focus on incredibly fast direct movements while Water breaths should focus on movement and control, but we don't see this consistently applied. If we wanted to really bring breaths in line, some forms would have to be adjusted or reinterpreted. As for how other breaths would work, we merely have to consider how these aspects would be expressed with other elements.  Many breaths should also have some degree of difference in the nature of their weapon to better suit the breath.

Looking at Stone, it is a style not fit for the sword, appropriate to Gyomei's use of a mace. Stone should use mostly blunt force attacks that resemble the movements of stone and likewise express the power needed to move stone. This is rather well represented from what we see.

Looking at Flames, the blade should probably be wider to catch more air and have a degree of match like coating on the dull side to spark against the air with the speed of the strike, creating small amounts of flame that could ignite when the pressure waves focus concentrated pockets of air. The movements should be powerful both to evoke the power of fire but also to move large pockets of air,  a primary method of how would could control the flow of flames. Examples of movements could be a swirling strike that creates and ignites a ball of oxygen around an opponent, the movements involved would essentially be a parry counter where the igniting strike is a powerful downward strike that would likely cause a pillar of flame. Other forms could be one that strikes up against the ground to create a burn like as well a blunt side swipe designed to push away the air and push back flames. This would be a good nonlethal strike and based around putting out flames. Compared to the forms we see displayed by Kyojouro, these kinds of forms would have more utility and properly express the idea and explain the idea of flames. 

Wind is difficult because the idea revolved all around creating air pockets and pressure waves. Because of this Wind should have the largest blade out of any breath that way it would carry the most air. Much like Flames, this form would rely on the mass high speed displacement of air. While this idea is somewhat represented in the manga, I feel that there is not enough explanation on WHY only his sword movements are creating wind blades which intern leans into the fantastical elements that we are told are not real.

Beast is a forgivable breath because it is clear and simple, there are no real fantastical elements, Inosuke just does his thing.

Flower is a breath I cannot say much about because there is no real foundation for what makes it the breath of flowers. There is no visible uniqueness to the blade or their movements to really differentiate it from the breath of water. If one were to adapt the idea of Flowers to Roses, then there could be a theme here, with a barbed blade that allowed the user to prick the opponent even without a direct hit. This breath would be enhanced by poison and could benefit from very linear but curving piercing motions that evoke the idea of vines. A good way to describe this would be the user launching forward with a rapier like weapon and weaving in and out with piercing attacks, never really drawing but but twirling around to continue the assault, an idea expressed specifically in forms 4 and 6. The biggest issue though is that Kanao's eye technique is placed in the breath of flower as plants have no eyes and it makes no thematic sense as a flower technique. 

Breath of insect is actually a really well developed and logical form with weapon and forms both representing the theme and having good utility.

Breath of love is built around it's user and it's weapon, which is a great foundation, and a few of the forms are very fitting, specifically 5 and 6, but how the concept of love is integrated and why certain forms function as they do is a little weak and needs some consideration.

Mist has a few moves that make sense with controlling and moving through actual mist, and a basic katana would suffice, but I think the rest of the forms need a higher focus on evasiveness and stealth or at least light flowing motions focused on parries. 

Moon is a mess, while the theme fits the fantastical elements, the breath seems to be nothing more than fancy attacks. If the blade had a crescent edge layered with varying spinning crescent blades set along it, then that would help, but this moves is a result of its user. Kokoshibou seems like the kind of person who never understood martial arts, obsessed only with the power of them, and that is why his breath is just him lashing out with strikes and nothing more.

Serpent is another near perfect form with a blade and forms that fit it's theme and have genuine purpose but needs a few more none offensive maneuvers that show Obanai expressing the serpentine idea. 

Breath of sound is a very weakly associated Breath where the connection to the theme and it's weapon is weak. I think a focus on sonar and silent movements would make more sense than just using bombs. Also while Uzui's swords are a great and unique design, I think that a combination of instruments and weapons would be more thematically accurate. Then the forms could follow as a dance similar to Hinokami Kagura where each step represents a strike, counter, or dodge.

Lastly we get Breath of Sun, which we know nothing about except it's supposedly the perfect breath and that all are derived from it, which are two inherently contradictory ideas. If the sun was the perfect form, people would only ever strive to learn it and no forms could be derived from it because that derivation and improvisation would inherently improve it by adding more utility. Because of this we must recontextualize what the breath of sun is meant to be and color is a great way to start. Nichirin takes on a color that reflects the users spirit and what they are best at. If each color is a breath that one is good at, then black merely means the user is good at EVERY breath. Therefore we can interpret the breath of the sun as the use of every idea under the sun. The reason why the breath of the sun seemed so perfect was because it developed a form for almost every opportunity, but because people were flawed they could only master one of the forms from the sun, then they derived new forms by adapting the ideas of that first form. This means that every breath would have at least one form that would be almost identical to, if not directly copied from, a sun form. 

What are your thoughts? Am I being too critical of this concept? Do I give better context? I know there are still flaws in my interpretation but I hope it's a step towards enriching the shows underlying combat mechanics."
e3b3zs,3,2019-11-29,Fiancee pushing me away after 5 incredible years-- not sure what to do.,Disrespekt,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e3b3zs/fiancee_pushing_me_away_after_5_incredible_years/,"Some background-- My fiancee and I started dating our junior year of highschool, and have been together coming on 5 years now. Since then, we've moved in together, had a beautiful daughter who just turned one, bought a house, and we have been engaged for about a year and a half now, we've been planning to get married sometime next summer, but haven't set a date yet. We are now both in our early twenties. She is doing an expedited 6 month school and internship through her work for medical assisting, and I am the Director of Training at a larger chain restaurant. 

We've always had a fun relationship, and have had a strong connection based on love and humor. She happens to be deaf, but has 2 cochlear implants, fluent in asl, reads lips, and had 10 years of speech therapy, so you wouldn't even know she's deaf. 

Our world was rocked when we found out we were pregnant, as it wasn't something we had anticipated happening for a while at least, and learning this whole parenting thing has put a good deal of stress on our relationship. Some combination of sleepless nights, crying baby, and working out schedules so one of us can always watch the baby, as day care is exorbitantly expensive. 

Toward the end of the pregnancy, unfortunately, seems to be where some of our problems began. We used to have sex at least once a day, or every couple days if we were busy. As we got further on in the pregnancy, I wasn't in the mood to have sex with her, almost at all until she gave birth. I honestly don't know why I didn't feel sexually attracted to her during that period, maybe it was stress  from thinking  about how I was going to be a dad, or something in my subconcious. She was still beautiful, and I still loved her, but just not attracted sexually. This really did a number on her self esteem, and she was extremely hurt from that. Ever since then, things were different in our relationship, having a new baby aside. After her 6 week healing period from birth, we had sex about once a week the first couple months, then she went back on birth control, and we had a couple stints where we may have only done it once a month for several months, because she was not feeling sexually attracted to me, for whatever reason. 

And starting around this summer sometime, she started to get very snippy/annoyed with me in many situations. Some of which I deserved, others which were almost completely unprovoked. Within the past month or two, we've had several talks about how she doesn't think we were meant to be together, me asking her why, and her not really being able to give me an answer. She's gone so far as to take her engagement ring off for days at a time, and only wear it around family, because they don't know we're having issues.

She's told me she cares about me, but she's not sure if she loves me. I try to do everything in my power to be a good man, do nice things for her, my share of the chores around the house, and raising our daughter, I go out of my way to do things for her, and I get no reciprocation. She doesn't make time to do anything for me, or put me first in any capacity, wheras I feel I do for her. In almost all interactions recently, she is being downright mean to me: mostly getting on my case about trivial things. We bought a house a few months ago, and this has all come out since then-- which means we're trapped in a mortgage, with a daughter, and with no real financial savings because we saved so much for the down payment  on our house. 

I do still love her, but the way she has been treating me hurts so bad. I know she's not cheating on me, or doing any other terrible things like I see on this sub, but it makes me feel worthless as a man, as if I'm doing something terribly wrong even though I know I'm not. Our first 4 years together have been incredible, but this last one has been so hard on us-- having a baby, buying a house, jumping back into school, with both of us working fulltime, and still trying to juggle friends and family. 

I'm just lost as to what to do. I don't want to throw away the last 5 years we've built together, but I'm seeing little to no effort on her part to try to make it work. It feels like I keep giving, and getting nothing in return. Any advice would be appreciated."

e3c0aa,1,2019-11-29,"My (19y) ex (18y) broke up with me because of her mental issues, but won’t seek help by a professional.",Rashayem,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e3c0aa/my_19y_ex_18y_broke_up_with_me_because_of_her/,"So, I saw this beautiful girl hanging out with some of my friends. From first time I saw her I knew: eventually I’ll fall in love with her. Then I saw a picture she had posted on Instagram with some of our mutual friends in Rome, and I messaged her and asked how long they would stay.
She then told me her friends were visiting her and she would be staying for a whole year. I was devastated but after that we began texting.
We texted every day and understood us so well that I told her: maybe I’m gonna come to Rome in January . (It was October by the way.)
My mom told me then: why aren’t you going right now? The weather is better and maybe you shouldn’t wait for two months. So we searched for cheap flights (I live in Germany) and we actually found some.
Long story short: I flew to Rome two days later and we both were very nervous.
But when we first met, I ran into her arms. We hugged for a solid minute and then kissed. From there on it was all clear.
We had the most beauty week in Rome and really fell for each other. This wasn’t only my projection, as I can tell by the things she said, the way she looked at me, laughed at all my jokes etc.

When I got back home and started working at an internship, we still talked every day. We talked over phone, texted and everything.
But then, after like two weeks, she said she needs a break.
It came totally out of nowhere for me, so I didn’t really know how to react or had a guess, what the reason could be.
I really tried to keep that space, but I felt so miserable that I couldn’t eat, sleep or work at all.
So I asked her the next day to tell what was going on.
She then proceeded to tell me about her mental issues, (which i’m not going to get into here, but they’re pretty serious) and that they’ve gotten worse and worse since we’ve been on long distance. 
I told her, that she needs to find help and that i’ll always be there for her. But I can’t help her with net, i’m not a professional. I also mentioned I could move to Rome for the year after my internship of one month would have ended, if that would help. 
But the next day she broke up with me, telling me it was all to much for her to carry on her shoulders and that it was clinging her.
Which I totally understand. She broke up on Tuesday and we still talked till last Friday. She told me that she loves me, probably more than she ever loved anybody and that she’ll love till the end of her life. But all that was putting so much pressure on here. And she couldn’t deal with that pressure at same time, while having her mentality getting worse and worse. On Friday I told her that I value her choice and that i accept that she doesn’t want or can’t be in a relationship right now.
Since then we haven’t had any contact.
I 100% understand her and her decision, I only hope that maybe we can work when she’s back in Germany at the end of next year. But that is far in the future and we’ll what will be then. 
Of course I miss her like crazy, I’ve been in a very deep hole ever since. 
At work i’ll go to the toilet at least three times a day to cry and i’m falling back into depressive thoughts and behavior. I’m also trying to find a therapist at the moment.
She was the first girl that ever make me feel like she’s the “one”. And the worst part is, she said the same about me.
I’m dying on the inside, but I’m hanging on to the 1% I feel better each day. 

But it doesn’t seem like she is getting herself help. Yes, it’s hard to find that as a foreigner in Italy and maybe she’ll start when she’s back in Germany. I’m willing to go that road with her, because she’s worth it. I’m just really afraid, that she’ll either won’t seek help and never better, therefore never being able to build a sustaining relationship with me or anyone else. Or that she’ll find another guy soon enough and just replace me. (Unlikely, but you know the thoughts.)

She’s back home for Christmas and I really hope that she reaches out to me, when she’s here next month. Should I reach out? I just really want to see her. I accepted that we can’t be in a relationship right now, but I just want to help her get better so we eventually can. And if that means she won’t choose me after all that, that’s fine to, at least i’ll know that she won’t have to deal with this in the future.
I really don’t know if I should talk to her. If I will I’m violating the space she asked for but I won’t i’m afraid she will move on, find another one, but never truly cope with her problems. 
I guess I just wanted to get it out to a neutral party and hear some thoughts...

ALL IN ALL: 
I’m really in love with this girl who I know is in love with me too, but we can’t be together because of her mental illnesses and the distance (although i’m willing to solve that).
I don’t wanna lose her. She’s my soulmate and we both feel that way."

                }
            }

    }

I hope that I have given enough information to show my issue and possible to solve it.  


EDIT:  
I have found the issue after many days of figuring it out. The issue isn't that C# is unable to load the DLL, but that and module in C++ (Opencv.hpp) is unable to work well in a wrapper.

The issue that you will face is that OpenCV has come functions that cannot work in managed code, even though OpenCV is only included in C++ and not the wrapper. it will still give these **warnings** on build, and when you decide the run it C# will give this error.

I have found some possible solutions to this issue, but I decided not to pursue these leads as I do not have the time for that during my internship. I did the C++ code in a DLL and did a DllImport in C#. This brings a whole set of other issues with it namely data send to and from the DLL."

I currently just finished my first year of engineering at the University of Auckland and plan to specialize in civil engineering for the remainder of my degree.

Currently I'm mainly concerned about my work experience and am keen to build up a decent CV while I'm still relatively early as I just finished first year. 

My lack of experience in terms of engineering and in combination with searching so late (end of November) is the reason why I am willing to do these internships for free.

I'm not interested in money just yet all I want to do right now is learn and have some kind of hands on experience in this industry directly so albeit when the time comes I have some actual credentials to apply for a job other than just my degree if that makes sense. Hence I don't necessarily want to waste these holidays.

I've heard from other people to just work as a construction laborer but I'm afraid of the physical toll it might have on my body although I am decently fit and young (19 years old), I just want to explore other options that might be even more closer related.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I don't want to make this post too long but if someone wants to give me a shot working a free internship around Auckland, please contact me, I'd be glad to send in my CV and more details about me personally just dm me, thank you and I appreciate your time reading this :)"
e3cuaa,3,2019-11-29,Need Advice,CallCenterIndian,AusFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/e3cuaa/need_advice/,"Hi AusFinance,

I'm really unsure of where to post this but I need some advice/guidance. I just finished my first year of a 3 year degree ( Data analytics) and since march of this year I've been working in a inbound call center for a big bank, recently there's been a opening for a QA (Quality assurance) position that is something that I'm really interested in and that will give me a great entry level exposure to analytics (using advanced excel/ tableau) . The only drawback is that they want someone who is available from 9am - 5pm 5 days a week.

so my question is should I A.) apply for the position and if accepted I juggle full time uni with full time work B.) apply and if accepted switch to part-time uni and full time work changing my graduation year from the end of 2021 to 2023 or C.) if i get rejected or I dont apply i just upskill more in my own time and try and score an internship summer of 2021.

i've been learning some advanced excel techniques along with other data visualisation softwares in my own time through Udemy and coursera so I have a good idea of what is expected and thing the things I'd have to do, I just feel like me being at Uni full time is limiting the experience that I have the potential to get, and i'm not sure what to do.

again sorry if this is the wrong sub but i'm really unsure of what to do in this situation my parents work in completely different fields so they aren't exactly too much help.

thank you \~"

My CV is all good and I've gotten calls back, but when they ask for my porfolio and I submit it, they NEVER call me back.

I recently had this amazing opportunity to do an internship in Spain, got in with my CV but got told my work wasn't sophisticated enough.

For a background, I studied media as a degree, but I guess that was my first mistake. Pretty much only had the opportunity to create things on a beginner level so it wasn't something that was wow/amazing.

This goes for every role I applied for, junior role, graduate role, intern you name it. My work isn't good enough. And yes, I tried very hard to find work experience during my 2nd year, but no matter how hard I tried, I literally couldn't.

I have this filming opportunity now that I had in contact with 2 weeks ago. But from the way the manager seems to be giving me slow replies is telling me I won't be working with him.

I'm just so fucking tired. I'm working on my own things right now, and trying to build my porfolio but I just want to start working. It's really difficult.

I just thought about going to do my masters in September if I can't find anything by march/April so I can expand my porfolio.

Any tips are needed please.

Thank you"
e3e03p,7,2019-11-29,60 days free now,mementomorinl,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e3e03p/60_days_free_now/,"Hey guys,

I have been sober for 60 days now, which is the longest I have been sober in 6 years. It was 10 years ago (when I was 19) that I tried smoking for the first time, back then I wanted to try new things which did get me out of my shell and in social situations.  

I made a decision to stop smoking altogether during the final week of doing the Joe Rogan Sober October challenge. This subreddit also helped me to realise that I had to stop instead of trying to decrease my usage. When I would try to decrease I would always be pulled back in to smoke way more than I decided I wanted to. 

Reading the posts on this subreddit definitely motivate me to stay sober but I also have the feeling that my addiction was not as severe as others. I spent years smoking in my free time with one or two friends, just staying indoors playing video games, watching reruns and new episodes of series and movies. All the while I would get somewhat decent results in my studies, but I also wasted plenty of time and energy by smoking. This last summer was the epitome of that behaviour. I finished an internship in march and spent most of my time until september smoking even though I had plenty of work to do for my study.

A couple of months ago I started running with a friend and have been doing so for 3 times a week since, which is a great way to do something with your time and improving your health. I even started doing Taekwondo with a colleague from my current internship. If I would give any advice it would be to find an activity you can stick a decent amount of time into and gets you out of the house, sports are great for that.

At this point in my sobriety it seems most important to keep reminding myself of why I quit in the first place, that's why I wrote a whole document on why I wanted to quit and how I felt during those first few weeks in October.

Anyway, thanks for reading all this. Stay strong out there."

Even after school ended, we stayed the same, also we grew closer and felt comfortable sharing almost everything with each other. Currently I'm doing my 6 months internship in another city far from home and my bestfriend was the only one who I would talk to at the end of the day after working my ass off. She was the only one who could give me comfort when I'm far away from home and from her. It's just been 4 weeks in this new city and during this she started liking me and a lot of emotions started to grow within her for me. Though she never told me but I somehow sensed it that she likes me. Coming to the point, she's been ignoring me for a while, she had also all of a sudden blocked me on social media as well as my number. I don't know if I should wait for her to text back or should I end this friendship. She clearly knows I'm alone in this city and still she chose to hurt me like this by ignoring me, even after telling her that I cried for like 2 days after she had blocked me from everywhere.

She's a big deal for me because she's the only true friend left after school and I can't afford to lose anymore friends. I don't know how to deal with this, I'm not at peace mentally due to whatever is happening. There is not a single day when I don't think about her. I've lost too many friends, I can't lose her.

* I used to have an Indian citizenship when I first came to Canada, and on that passport I have a few J-1 visas that were issued for some internships I did in the US. That was between 2000-2002. At that time, my ""home country"" was India because I didn't have ""permanent"" residence yet. J-1 visas have a 2 year home residency requirement so I chose not to go back to the US (even though I had a job) and stay in Canada, and since then I've become an immigrant and citizen of Canada and have a home here.
* I'm currently a Canadian citizen and am going to be applying for a TN Visa under the computer systems analyst category for a job I recently received in the US. 

I know the TN visas are generally under scrutiny, but it's been almost 20 years (and different passports). I'm wondering if I'll have any trouble with the TN visa because of the past J-1? One could argue that since my home country at the time of getting the J1 was India, the almost 20 years I've spent in Canada is not qualified.

Let me start off by thinking you for any advice you could throw my way. I do ask that you please go easy on me. Hate to admit but I'm pretty weak right now about all of this. 

Quick summary of me:

Started my life all over early 2018 after quitting overseas job in December 2017. Wanted to pursue a passion career. Enrolled in school for masters. Been building myself up ever since. Left my little city the west coast. Internship. Older but still incredibly energetic and happy to do anything. Internship changed to temporary full-time work. Awesome. 

Met this lady on dating app. We go out multiple times and really enjoy ourselves. One day job tells me things are ending. I knew it was coming. Been looking for work but nothing came up bummed out. 

We spend my last week in LA together. Amazing time. She sends me off. It was wonderful. 

Get asked to work a gig a few weeks later. Fly back to LA. Stay with her the whole week. She cooks. We use her car. We have a great time I think. 

She slips and tells me she loves me. Blah blah we have a great week. She sends me off. It's a lot more emotional. ""Love you"" is used. 

Situation:

1. We met on dating app. She has since removed me and changed her pictures to sexier ones. 

2. She said she won't do long distance. I'm with her on that. I don't want it. Did it before. Disaster. 

3. When I came back I found a new box of condoms. Three pack. One was used. I get it. We all got needs. I was still on the dating apps too. Can't blame her. I learned not to put all my eggs in basket. We aren't official.

4. Even before i left, she required her dates to pay everything. I don't mind paying for my dates but also I think it's a nice gesture if lady goes dutch occasionally to show that she's not looking for free dinners and sex anytime. 

5. She's been hurt before. Went through abortion with six year (occasionally) verbally abusive long distance ex boyfriend. 

6. Her social media is full of her making videos of overly sexual stuff. Her sucking on cucumbers, showing pics of her ass, tits, answering questions from her followers, etc. 

7. She wants her sisters life. Sister doesn't do much. Has an older bf who provides her allowance. Sister also is into sex parties. 

8. Lady knows her sister is absurd but still likes the idea of allowance. 

9. I am financially ok. I've saved enough money over the years in case I need to go to hospital, car breaks down and need to buy a new one, food, etc. I told her I would never provide allowance for my lady. If I marry my queen, I want to build together. 

10. She told me that without me being in a stable situation in LA and living here, she can't go all in. No long distance. Told me she wants to see me again but I need to move to LA. 

11. I love LA to death. Take her out the equation and I definitely want to make it permanent. I've never felt that way about any other city in the US. Not even my hometown. 

12. I am working on my own life. Semester away from finishing masters. Trying to keep that LA energy going and find something great for both myself and for the place that takes me in. 

Please advise me if you have the time to. I'm trying not to drive myself nuts. I'm really into her. Again, I ask that you please be easy on me. Thanks everyone."

e3gsip,258,2019-11-29,Head Coaching Candidate Breakdown,down42roads,cowboys,https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/e3gsip/head_coaching_candidate_breakdown/,"So, I wrote up a thing a few weeks ago, back when Garrett getting fired was more probable, as opposed to now looking like a sure thing. I wanted to go a little more in depth on a bunch of the names that I am hearing now and go over their records and some pros and cons and stuff.

#**Urban Meyer**

CV: 

* 17 years as a college head coach (Bowling Green, Utah, Florida, Ohio St)
* 3 National Championships
* 7 Conference Championships

Pros:

* Offensive Genius
* Explosive scheme that will maximize Dak
* Lots of former players in the league, which could increase FA appeal
* Connections to form great coaching staff

Cons:

* Kind of a piece of shit
* Holds no one accountable 
* Might ~~quit~~ ""retire for medical reasons"" if things don't go well.
* Never coached in the NFL at any level

I have no qualms about Meyer being our coach from an Xs and Os perspective. I just don't think he's the kind of guy that would succeed as an NFL head coach. I see us having a good year, maybe 18 months out of him before the wheels fall off and he runs to USC or Notre Dame or back to commentating.

#**Josh McDaniels**

CV: 

* Long-time Patriots OC/QB Coach
* Two years as Broncos HC
* One year as OC/QB coach for Rams
* 6x Super Bowl Champion with Pats

Pros

* Did I mention 6 rings?
* Shown the ability to dynamically shift offense week to week and year to year to meet roster and opponents
* Older and wiser than previous ventures from Boston

Cons

* Almost fucked over a lot of people when he bailed on the Colts job a few years back
* Bill's assistants don't always do well: only one ever has a winning record as a HC
* McDaniels kinda sucked in both his previous gigs away from the hoodie
* In Denver, alienated QB to the point where he forced a trade

I'm not sure how good he'll be this time without Bill and Brady, I can't trust to him to actually take the job if he shakes on it, and he's shown that he's not the best people person. I'm not on board.

#**Eric Bieniemy**

CV:

* Nine years in the league as a RB and special teams guy
* 15 years as a RB coach in college and NFL
* Two years OC in college, two in NFL

Pros

* Experienced and respected coach
* Worked under successful NFL Coaches in Andy Reid and Brad Childress
* Effective game planner

Cons

* Never called plays at the NFL level
* Had some personal issues as a coach and player in Colorado

Bieniemy is the type of guy whose name is always floated as a HC but doesn't get the gig. He wouldn't be a bad choice, but he'd need a good staff in place to help continue develop the QBs.

#**Jim Harbaugh**

CV: 

* Former NFL starting QB
* Former Raiders QB coach
* 12 years as a college HC
* Four years as 49ers HC
* Three NFC Championship games and one Super Bowl appearance

Pros

* Obviously, a successful head coach
* Made Alex Smith look like a first round pick
* Made Michigan a consistent ranked team and converted Stanford into a powerhouse

Cons

* Tenure at Michigan has shown inability to develop QBs or adapt scheme to roster
* Tenure in SF ended after power struggle with strong-willed owner and GM
* Don't think he wants to leave Michigan without beating Ohio St

Harbaugh is a good coach that will coach in the league again, probably well. I just don't think he'd mesh well with Jerry/Stephen/McClay.

#**Kellen Moore**

CV:

* Former backup QB
* One year QB coach
* One year OC

Pros:

* Brilliant offensive mind
* Everyone loves him
* Destined for coaching: everyone has assumed it to be inevitable once he didn't physically develop into an NFL body

Cons:

* Super inexperienced
* Very Young
* Might have issues with a roster that he was recently on the practice squad of, and actually on a college team with one player

Moore might get a shot as the ""next Sean McVay"", but McVay had a decade of coaching under his belt before the Rams hired him. Moore was on the practice squad two years ago. I'm not ready to make him our head coach.


#**Chris Petersen**

CV:

* 12 years as college position coach
* 5 years as college OC
* 14 years as college HC

Pros

* Successful everywhere
* ranked in the top 16 9 out of 13 full season as HC, with 8 conference titles
* Kellen Moore's from HC, so chance the offensive staff could be retained

Cons

* Never coached in the NFL at any level
* Never really coached anywhere with expectations

On paper, Petersen is a great idea. Dynamic and inventive head coach with an avenue to keep Moore et al. But, he's never coached anywhere near this level, and a lot of people think he might not want to jump to the NFL

#**Richard Hightower**

CV: 

* Current 49ers ST coordinator
* 10 years ST coaching ability
* One year coaching DBs as well
* One season as college WR coach
* One season as offensive quality contol coach

Pros:

* Shanahan coaching tree (Houston, Washington, Cleveland, SF)
* Has worked as a coach in all three phases
* One of the hardest workers in the league

Cons:

* Never called plays at any level
* Still relatively inexperienced, only three years as a coordinator

The only person I've seen float his name is KD Drummond, but I was interested enough to look deeper. Hightower had a full ride academic scholarship and walked-on at UT, then forced the coaches to let him play special teams and never looked back. He was able to get a coaching internship in Houston when Kyle Shanahan (his college teammate) was brought in as the WR coach. Ever since, he has worked all over the NFL and college focusing on special teams with occasional position coach work as well. 

He's an interesting option to consider, who's career kind of resembles John Harbaugh up to this point.

#**Mike McDaniel**

CV:

* 9 years as an offensive assistant/position coach in NFL
* 2 seasons as UFL RB coach
* 3 years as run game coordinator for SF

Pros

* Scheme and fit guy in SF, building running game with meh O-line and ?? at RB
* Young, dynamic offensive coach in the current trend
* Valuable enough to 49ers that they block OC interviews for him
* Multiple former players call him smartest coach they ever played for

Cons

* Never called plays in the league
* No coordinator experience at any level
* Substance abuse/mental health issues that created issues early in career and required in-patient treatment in Atlanta

In the realm of ""offensive wunderkind"" that is the hot trend right now, McDaniel might be the best option. More than anyone else, he's Kyle Shanahan's right hand. His health and alcohol issues are under control right now (almost four years sober) but need to be considered before hiring.

#**Raheem Morris**

CV: 

* Three seasons as Buccaneers HC
* 9 years as DB coach
* 3 years as WR coach
* 1 year as college DC

Pros

* Very diverse coaching background
* Experienced in current defensive scheme, which we could likely continue, not requiring personnel changes
* 20 years of experience but still young at 43
* Great at motivating players

Cons

* Wasn't successful as Bucs coach
* Has been accused of being too much a player's coach
* Has been up and  down as a play caller

Morris was promoted from DB coach to DC to HC in Tampa in a matter of a month. He had six years NFL experience and was 33. He probably wasn't ready. He had a raw deal in a shitty team with a shitty front office, and he overperformed his second season.

That was then. Since then, he has spent another almost decade coaching under guys like Quinn and the Shanahans, and has shown leadership, flexibility, and results. He's ready for a second chance soon.

#**Matt Ebeflus**

CV:

* 15 years as college coach, including 8 as DC
* 9 years as NFL LB coach
* 2 seasons as passing game coordinator
* 2 seasons NFL DC

Pros

* Knows the team and the front office
* Huge role in developing our young LBs
* Highly respected and effective coach

Cons

* Might be some bad blood in the building

#**Robert Saleh**

CV:

* 4 years as college defensive assistant
* 6 years as NFL assistant/QC coach
* 3 years as NFL LB coach
* 3 years NFL DC

Pros: 

* Continued scheme fit for personnel
* Great for culture
* Well respected

Cons:

* Only one year of elite defense as a position coach/coordinator

He's the hot young up and coming defensive hire. I worry a little about his ability to scale up to head coach, but he's gonna be one of those guys that you hire a year early rather than miss out on him.

#**Lincoln Riley**

CV:

* 7 years as position coach/offensive assistant
* 6 years as college OC
* 3 years as college HC

Pros

* Dynamic, explosive offensive scheme
* Maximizes the talent of the players he has
* Great motivator

Cons

* Scheme relies on out-athleting everyone
* Never coached in a place where defense is a consistent obstacle
* Riley would owe OU almost $5M if he goes to the NFL this offseason
* He loves Norman and probably doesn't want to leave as the guy that couldn't get it done in bowl games

The hype is there for Riley, and I would like him out of the Big 12 as much as anyone, but I'm really hesitant about how much of his success would translate to the NFL.

#**Greg Roman**

CV:

* 7 years as offensive coordinator
* 15 years as position coach

Pros: 

* Great offensive mind
* Ability to adapt scheme to maximize abilities of young QBs
* Made Lamar Jackson, Tyrod Taylor, Alex Smith and Kaep look like stars

Cons:

* No obvious ones?

Roman seems like a really hot name a lot of teams, especially ones with young QBs, are looking at. At least, their fans are. He'd be great for Dak, and has been around the league long enough that forming a good staff shouldn't be an issue.

#**Mike McCarthy**

CV:

* 12.75 years as Packers head coach
* 5 seasons as an OC
* 4 seasons as a QB coach
* 2 seasons as offensive QC coordinator

Pros

* Super Bowl ring as a HC
* Great track record as a play caller and player developer

Cons:

* Very conservative mentality
* Seems a little entitled, even for a NFL coach
* Hard to tell what of his GB success was him and what was Aaron Rodgers Magic

So, on the one hand, Mike would be a really safe hire. On the other hand, it would be too safe. I'm not a big fan of the offensive philosophy that he came up under in coaching (got his start coaching Martyball), and he lost the locker room **hard** in Green Bay. I think he'd be a better fit for a team that is coming up from rock bottom rather than one that needs to make that final leap.


#**Dan Campbell**

CV:

* Former TE and Dallas Cowboys
* Got his first coaching gig as an intern in Miami under Parcells and Sparano
* 5 years as TE coach in Miami
* Named interim HC in Miami when they fired Joe Philbin in 2015, went 5-7.
* Asst HC/TE in New Orleans under Payton since 2016

Pros:

* Former Dallas player, so he understands the demands on the franchise
* Mentored by Bill Parcells and Sean Payton, and adopted their attitudes
* When named interim HC in Miami, didn't just go through the motions. Made more coaching changes, firing both coordinators and really pushed the team
* Look at the hair on this [handsome motherfucker](https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/f9/8a/dan-campbell-051718-getty-ftrjpg_uv2179pygbn1uq9ojg6erla3.jpg?t=1856790763&amp;w=720&amp;quality=80)

Cons:

* Never a coordinator or playcaller, more of a CEO type coach
* Has since cut that beautiful hair


I think everyone should watch his [introductory press conference](https://youtu.be/nh-yd2AqCms) when he was named coach in Miami. It really shows his attitude and philosophy about how to manage a team and players. He will need a good pair of coordinators, but he's the kind of coach that can change the tone of a franchise.

#**Mike Leach**

CV:

I'm actually going to list all this out specifically, because its fucking ridiculous.

* OL coach At Cal Poly (whatever FCS used to be called)
* LB Coach at College of the Desert, which is a community college in California
* Unspecified job with the Pori Bears (in goddamn Finland)
* OC/OL coach at Iowa Wesleyan (which recently moved from NAIA to DIII)
* OC/OL/WR/QB Coach (in various combinations ) at Valdosta State (DII)
* OC/QB coach at Kentucky
* OC/QB coach at Oklahoma
* HC at Texas Tech
* Two years doing media out of coaching
* HC at Washington St

Pros:

* Explosive passing attack. Air Raid, Baby!
* Gets production out of literally anybody on offense
* Incredible coaching tree 
* One time he created a fake play script and ""lost it"" where the opposing coaches could find it

Cons:

* He's fucking nuts
* Fired at Texas Tech after a player accused him of putting him in the equipment shed when he had a concussion.
* Did I mention he's fucking nuts?
* A lot of his former players haven't translated to the NFL, especially at QB

I'm not gonna lie, I would let a few losing seasons slide under normal circumstances just to watch this show. Having Mike Leach get national coverage in press conferences would be awesome.

As a coach, though, I'm hesitantly curious. His scheme would definitely fit the league more than it would have a decade ago, and he could make interesting use of Dak. Tempo would be a concern, and I'm not sure what kind of staff he could build.

#**David Shaw**

CV:

* 7 years as an offensive assistant/QB coach in NFL
* 5 years as a coordinator under Harbuagh in college
* 9 years as Stanford HC

Pros:

* Successful at every level he's coached. 
* Coached under pro offensive coaches in Gruden, Billick and Harbaugh
* Has entrenched Stanford as a powerhouse (except this year)

Cons:

* He's been consistent about wanting to stay at Stanford
* He's just not an exciting prospect

Shaw is a good coach. A really good college coach. He seems content with that. His name floats every year, and he's never once accepted an interview request. He once said that his wife won't allow him to leave Palo Alto. On top of all that, though, he seems like he'd be a lateral move form Garrett.

#**Matt Rhule**

CV: 

* 10 years as college asst/position coach
* 4 years as Temple's OC
* 1 season as assistant OL coach for the Giants 
* 7 seasons as HC at Temple and Baylor

Pros:

* Maximizes talent. Just squeezes everything out of them. 
* Flipped Baylor from 1-11 to 10-1 in two years
* Has coached basically every position group but secondary at some point in his career

Cons:

* Not an Xs/Os type of hire. More of a motivator/big picture guy
* Will need strong coordinators
* Will only come out if he feels the job is perfect
* Only one year in NFL
* Most of his coaching career has been below Power 5 level

Rhule has gotten some love the last few years. He interviewed with the Colts in 2018, and with the Jets last year. He reportedly walked away from both teams. Its unknown what exactly happened with the Colts interview, but it was reported that the Jets wanted some level of control over his assistants and coordinators. He's an intriguing prospect, and I know other teams are interested (reports indicate he's an option for the Giants). He'd be a solid choice, but I don't know if Jerry would be comfortable giving him the reigns.

#**Kevin Stefanski**

CV:

* Vikings Asst/position coach for 12 years
* Promoted to interim OC last year, got job full time this year

Pros:

* Worked under a very diverse series of coaches
* Has Vikings offense in the top 8 in yards and points.
* Made Case Keenum look like a superstar as QB Coach
* Hopefully has adopted some of the Mike Zimmer attitude

Cons:

* Will have 19 games of playcalling experience at the end of the season, plus playoffs
* Also had a lot of potential to pick up bad traits from his long series of coaches

He's young, but has been around for a long time in Minnesota. I'm a little worried about whether the rocket strapped to his ass will blast him beyond his level of confidence.

Fun fact: he was the Cleveland Browns' analytics department's recommendation for their head coach position in the offseason, but they listened to Baker instead and hired Kitchens.

#**John DeFilippo**

CV: 

* 10 years as a NFL position coach
* 4 years as a College position coach/oC
* 3 years as NFL OC

Pros:

* Has made a bunch of QBs look like stars, from the Sanchize to Foles to Minshew
* Has been on an upward track towards HC seemingly for years

Cons

* Three NFL OC tenures, three different teams, no second seasons
* Honestly, lasting 13 games in Minnesota, under a coach Jerry likes, is not a good line on the resume

John was on the good track. Vikings OC was supposed to be the feather in his cap, the final step before a HC gig. Then, he blew it and got canned. I feel like that probably sets him back a few years. Maybe a few more seasons in Jax will get him back into the discussion.

#**Pete Carmichael Jr**

CV:

* Five years as college position coach
* Seven years as NFL position coach
* Two years as passing game coach
* 11 seasons as Saints OC

Pros:

* He's been the third leg in the Brees-Payton team for their entire time in New Orleans
* Real Xs/Os guy that manages the week to week game plan
* Great at managing the relationship between strong willed people

Cons:

* Not the most passionate or energetic personality
* How much of his success is him, and how much is Brees and Payton?

The big question is how much of the Saints success can be placed on his shoulders as opposed to the others. He's coached Brees for 17 years. If they are confident he can continue his success, he would be an amazing hire.

#**Todd Monken**

CV:

* 14 years as college position coach
* 4 years as college OC
* 3 year as college HC
* 4 years NFL WR Coach
* 4 years NFL OC

Pros: 

* Coached in systems from Air Raid to whatever the fuck Cleveland is doing right now
* Former Saban and Gundy assistant
* Favors vertical explosive offense

Cons

* Not a QB guru
* Lost playcalling power in Tampa Bay, doesn't have it in Cleveland

Monken is got HC interviews last year, but lost out to Adam Gase and Matt LeFleur. He gets a lot of buzz, but his entire NFL career until now has been in Dirk Koetter's pocket. Not sure if he's the tier of coach Jerry will target.

#**Dan Mullen**

CV:

* 11 years as college position coach
* 4 years college OC
* 11 years as college HC

Pros:

* Existing connection with Dak (college HC)
* Long time Urban Meyer assistant (get some of the good without the shitty)
* Successful as SEC head coach

Cons:

* No NFL experience at any level
* Never the biggest fish in his own pond (SEC)

Mullen is an interesting idea. He checks a lot of the boxes we are looking for on paper, but he's not exciting to think about. Maybe its just because the hype train is still in the station, but I think Mullen is near the top of the silver medal tier."

At least that's what it looks like after my research of older questions here and some posts in [canadavisa.com](https://canadavisa.com). Here goes:I studied in an Indian university (Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science) and in the last semester I took up a full-time (40 hr work week), salaried (monthly paid, background-verifiable) internship at a company. This was because, for the 8th semester, I could either do a research project at the university itself or do at least one project at a company recognised by the university , or both. Any one of it had to be submitted in the university for grading, irrespective of where it was done. As I chose to take up the internship (it was at Cerner India), my designation was 'Seasonal Intern', and the work i did during the internship was completely along the lines of what my current profession is - software engineering. And one of the projects I was part of during the internship, contributed to my last semester grade in the university, hence to the CGPA. After my graduation, I continued working as a full time Software Engineer in that company for 6 more months until I switched to another company, but remained in the same field. Will I be able to count the 5-6 months' full-time paid internship while filing for EE (Federal Skilled Worker stream)?

From my research, I found a few posts that said that they only care about internships done in Canada - apparently because they don't want people to use the Study Permit program as a means to apply for PR and that internships done in foreign countries are fine, as long as they fulfil all of the other requirements for Express Entry (paid, skilled etc..). A few others said that work done during full-time study is not counted.So, I have still not been able to get a precise answer to my query and I am unsure about the correctness of the comments until today. Can anyone give some reliable assistance on this? Any links/docs that point to information from the official sources or from credible credentials (attorneys or someone who went through something similar) would be wizard! Thanks."

e3hosp,2,2019-11-29,I [16F] am way too attached to my best friend [18M] and it's becoming an issue,I_EAT_COPIC_MARKERS,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e3hosp/i_16f_am_way_too_attached_to_my_best_friend_18m/,"throwaway since he knows most of my accounts.

I've been friends with this person for about a year now, and it's at a point where we're not uncomfortable hugging in semipublic and talking about sensitive topics (self-harm, anxiety, etc).  

We're both still in Highschool, and he's hailed as being one of the smartest in his grade, and people tend to view him as being a walking calculator or encyclopedia.  As a result, he only has a handful of friends who don't use him solely for academic help and are actually interested in getting to know him.  

I'm considered a ""second-rate nerd"" in a sense that I hang around people in my grade who are smart, but I'm not actually worth talking to for academics.  Because of that, I'm constantly trying to find a niche for myself so that others can recognize that ""HEY I'M SMART TOO PLEASE STOP SEEING ME AS LESS THAN EVERYONE ELSE THANKS"".

Over the past year or so we've been interacting mostly over text, since our school divides grades a lot.  He's remarked many times that he's glad I was able to get him to talk about his emotions more and otherwise help curb his anxiety over other's views of him.  I've also been a source of creative inspiration for his work, and have helped him with the brainstorming and graphic design of some of his projects.  He's been a general source of inspiration for me, and has helped me get internships over the summer.  

Our parents aren't exactly a fan of our friendship.  His believe in arranged marriages, and don't approve of the fact that he's this close of a friend with a girl.  They're fine with me as a person, just not the fact that I'm this friendly with their son.  My mom doesn't like the fact that he's Indian and nearly two years older than me.  

\*\*\*

A few weeks ago he offered to drive me home after a math meet at school.  I said yeah and texted my mom that I was ""carpooling with a friend"".  Technically not lying, but she doesn't want me to get into any student's car since she insists that they'll crash and kill me.  It's about 5 minutes of a drive from school to my house.  I get home fine and he drives off.  

For some reason, after he doesn't text back for an hour, I get this thought that he may have gotten into an accident.  My friend only lives about 10 minutes from my house, so an hour seemed to be a pretty unreasonable amount of time, especially for someone as addicted to their phone as he is.  I called him 2 or 3 times and he didn't pick up (his phone is linked to the car and he can pick up without touching the phone while driving).  

I guess the idea of him dying kinda scared the shit out of me.  

Eventually he does text back.  Turns out he was in a super long conversation with his mom and he wasn't allowed to use his phone during it.  

We've since discussed it, but I've found myself being disturbingly clingy after it.  Almost like having-a-crush clingy, except this was based off of anxieties over being without him.  It's been 3 weeks since the math meet and I still find myself thinking about it way too much.  It's like I always need to be near him.  I've been asking him to walk with me to classes and hang out after school whenever possible.  My friend has noticed and remarked that ""\[I'm\] starting to become more clingy than \[he was\]"", and this is a bit disturbing.  

I've always considered myself a fairly independent person who was able to keep her emotions on a tight leash when needed.  I hold that as one of my core values, and this situation is testing it in ways that I don't like.  How do I deal with this newfound clinginess?

\*\*\*

TLDR; 

\- i have a close nerdy friend

\- we're very close

\- i get a scare one night and think he died

\- obscene clinginess ensues

\- not a fan of the clinginess since it goes against one of my core values of being independent"

The past week was totally shite, because all my  intern coworkers got promoted, and I’m still an intern for another 3 months. I feel like I’m an utter shit, everyone’s so smart except of me; I feel dumb, stupid, rejected and worthless. My bf kinda tried to cheer me up, but I think he’s simply tired of it, although he’s never told me that it just seems pretty obvious for me; he rarely replies to my texts, simply ignores that I just want to chat or just to discuss the matters I’m interested in. Although, it’s a bit hard for me right to concentrate on the matters of other people, I always try to make sure that he’s ok and how’s he doing. It’s so frustrating to realize that the person you like and spent nearly 2 years together is slowly pushing you away. I have no one else to talk to. I might be extreme toxic person right now - I’m annoyed and irritated, every time I ask my bf is there something wrong he always replies - it’s fine. I’ve never been to psychologist, though I think it’s the right time to make an appointment. I guess I’m to dependent on him. Sometimes I think he’s better of without me.

e3l4o7,0,2019-11-29,What tax rate do I pay on my signing bonus?,adlahh,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/e3l4o7/what_tax_rate_do_i_pay_on_my_signing_bonus/,"Just a little bit of background. I'm a senior in college in Illinois. Had a summer internship over the summer (also in IL) where I made around \~15k (pre-tax) . Don't have a job outside that so I assume that would be what my taxable income is. My parents don't have me listed as a dependent on their taxes so I believe my taxes are just on my income.

I re-signed for the company full-time starting next year which resulted in a 1 off signing bonus of 10k. I just received this in my bank account via Direct Deposit. Since I received it this annual year, I'm assuming this brings my annual taxable income up to \~25k for this year which is a marginal tax rate of 12%. 

However, the DD only put $6540 in my bank account, withholding \~35% for tax reasons. I don't have any immediate need for the money, but am I correct in assuming I'll receive a significant amount of money back after I submit my taxes this year? Looking back at it, I think I was also taxed \~35% on my earnings over the summer (confirmed via info in my direct deposit that it was withholding at least 30%), I should expect seeing a lot of money in tax refunds, yes or no?

Just trying to clarify this for budgeting purposes.

I guess to simplify this in a TLDR I have 2 questions.

1. Received a signing bonus for a job starting next year, does this get taxed on my income THIS year (because this is when I received it) or NEXT year (when I start the job)?
2. Are they withholding a crazy amount more than they should? Can I expect a significant amount of money back in tax returns?"

Chose Columbia because my enlightened decision making process was ""hurr us news"". 

There's literally no CS community there. There's not even a single coding club... yes, *not even a single one*. ""But isn't there at least -?"" NOPE. Nothing. Unless your idea of coding is Goldman Sachs Investment Banking internships.

So, my first question would be -- does Brown have a good number of coding clubs?

Second question is more subjective but yikes, I don't really enjoy the ""vibe"" at Columbia. The classes are a constant beat down -- tests frequently average in the 50s -- and nothing matters because it's all curved to a B- at the end of the semester anyway. Oh, and I haven't taken a single class I care about yet because... what's an 18-year-old's self-discovery process without a bit of oppressive core curriculum and a side of 400 page rants about the corn harvest in 1582.

My biggest issue though is the community here. There is no community. I don't enjoy the nonexistent personal space, the lack of nature, and the isolation fueled by the insane workload and NYC in general. When I visited Brown, I got this sense of an awesome community where it's really easy to make friends and have fun (perhaps I am naive in that sense? Would anyone care to disillusion me?) 

I guess where I am right now is that Columbia is kind of miserable and I don't think it's worth it. Could I survive 4 more years? Probably. But I am finding success in my professional career, getting the internships ect that I want and suffering here for no apparent reason -- all of these things have come from my own hard work and not the school's ""brand-name"" or whatever (who cares about that in CS anyway if it's not Stanford?).

I think it has helped me out especially with my panic attacks, there are still anxious days and moments but I don't seem to have them as often as I do before.

I know there are many side effects, but the one I have been having trouble with the most is my sleep in general. I stay up really late at night and have such a hard time trying to fall to sleep. When I wake up I am tired and lethargic for most of the day but when I go to try and get some sleep I'm not tired at all and this leads to long night after long night.

It's gotten to the point where I almost missed an interview for an internship because the night before I was up until like 8 in the morning and almost slept through it. I've been dealing with this since school started in August and I haven't found a solution to try and fix this.

If anyone has any tips to help me get my sleep schedule back to normal it would be greatly appreciated. Also, I just had a doc appointment today and I'm going back down to 50mg to see if that makes any difference."

I mean, I'm not that ugly. I could be pretty good-looking, if I bothered to exercise, or to wash, or dress well.. I drink way too much beer and eat too much takeout. But I'm not that bad.

And hey, I'm not without my perks. Your jock boyfriend can't buy you that trashy wine you like to drink, or pay for you to get nice jewellery or lingerie (as long as you mostly wear it for me).

I'll even take you out for dates and stuff. I say ""take you out"", what I mean is that we'll stay in and you can blow me while I watch tv, or a movie, or porn. Probably porn.

The best part about it was it was such a surprise. I didn't expect my new ""intern"" for my IT security company to be such a stone cold hottie. I expected some boring 18 year old who'd be in the house to make coffee for a week. You probably forgot to apply for a real internship, right? so you rushed to find the last available place, and I was it. Before I met you, I don't think I'd ever seen a cheerleader that wasn't in a shower on pornhub.

But hey, I think after you got past my unique charm, you started to enjoy the fat that I wasn't as pretnetious and stuck up as most of your friends. Did it get you off a little, noticing how I leered at your ass through your skirt? I thought so. At first, you were probably just flirting with me so I'd give good feedback to your college, hm? I wonder how long it took for you to genuinely develop a crush.

So now you visit me after classes, sometimes on weekends, and don't forget that the holidays are coming up.. Of course, it's all for valuable work experience! But as you've probably noticed I, I don't do much work. I mean, you have to love life when your job involves a college student stroking your cock while you play video games, or tying her to your bed and filling her up the way her boyfriend just can't manage. Being on the football team and taking those steroids really has affected his stamina, hasn't it?

Sure, I have a few bad habits, some would call me a slob, but I think you like being able to taste last night's cum on me when you suck me off during a skype conference with my clients. If you want me to shower more, all you have to do is offer to scrub my back.

I know I'm not exactly vanilla in the bedroom. Or the kitchen, lounge or bathroom. Even you were a little incredulous when I asked for a rimjob, but you warmed to it pretty quick. I bet that jock isn't anywhere near this freaky, if he can even get  hard after all those steroids. You poor thing. I bet he can't even pull your hair or choke you the way you like. I know you like the romance sometimes, but sometimes you just want to be thrown about like a cheap sex toy, right? Humiliated? Slapped about? Have things written on your body? Think about how mad Daddy would get if he found out you were spending the days with a nice big cock in your ass, hm? Your father, I mean, I know you like to call me Daddy too sometimes.

You're going to worship me. I'm your smelly, lazy, God. You're going to dote on me, Wanting only to give me pleasure. You'll be thinking of me in classes and your panties will be soaking wet by the time you get to my house in the evenings.

So drop by if you're still interested. Make sure you bring the cheerleader outfit, some doritos, some baby oil, and maybe a friend.

------------------

Just going back and polishing an old prompt so that the english is comprehensible.

If you can't tell, I'm very kinky.. Anal, oral, rough sex, rimming, unwashed cocks, cumplay, watersports. consensual degradation and humiliation are some things I'd like to play with. My only limits are kids, animals, scat, vomit, vore and gore."
e3oafy,259,2019-11-29,A recount of my first senior shift.,medrajargon,emergencymedicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/e3oafy/a_recount_of_my_first_senior_shift/,"My fellow holiday-ED bound colleagues, I have a story.

Not a dark or sad story.

Not a tired story.

The story of my first senior overnight shift.

In my very academic midwest EM program, we separate our ER in to two sides: B and M. 

The M side is primarily staffed with PGY-4s and interns. While acuity isn’t sorted by side, the lower acuity, second-opinion complaints tend to end up on the M side. M claims two of our five resuscitation bays, and there’s a running joke that Bays 3 and 4 (the M bays) are reserved for the latest pseudoseizure or one-hypotensive-set-of-vitals-that-magically-resolves-after-triage. 

The B side is reserved for PGY-3s. Higher acuity patients, less PA support, more rooms to manage alone. Bays 1s and 2: ECMO prepared rooms, thoracotomy trays left out to the side. If you’re sick in my state, you will eventually end up in Bay 1. 

So, on my first B shift, I was nervous. I expected drama. A Monday overnight, to boot.

I walked in that night and got the senior computer ready to go. My blank paper folded lengthwise, ED scavenged pen hanging off my lanyard. I was ready. Nervous. But ready.

My attending for the night so happened to be Dr. VIP. The acronym is fitting. He’s a big deal in resuscitation research and makes a ton of money for the university. He works about 5 shifts a month and is a well-loved 5-shifter. Unlike the other research-focused attendings we work with, Dr. VIP enjoys his clinical work, and it shows. He’s sharp, clinically competent, and loves to casually teach. 

We take our sign out, I send the med student to go see a patient and get ready to pick up a few new ones. As I stand up, the trauma radio tones out.

Level 1. Coming to Bay 1. Five minutes out. 

I look at Dr. VIP. Here. We. Go. 

I walk over to Bay 1 and take my place at the head of the bed while the trauma team assembles. Dr. VIP hurries up right as the trauma rolls in and hands me a pair of those ugly, purple plastic glasses. The disposable eye protection things that every good ED resident has on hand for intubations and I&amp;Ds. I personally hate them. Bring on the Hep C. Risk/benefit and all. 

We do the trauma things, patient rolls up to the ICU alive. Success. 

I walk back to the computer and take off the uncomfortable purple goggles. Dr. VIP walks up to me.

“GOTTA HAVE THE GOGGLES.”

…

“IN CASE SHIT HITS THE FAN”

I look at him and slowly reach for the goggles. The overhead goes off: new patient, Bay 2. Maybe Dr. VIP knows something I don’t. I throw the goggles back on and walk up to Bay 2. Standard septic shock. Pressors on, fluids hung, patient rolls up to the ICU alive. Success.

I take the goggles off again.

“GOTTA HAVE THE GOGGLES.” I look at him. “IN CASE SHIT HITS THE FAN. GOTTA HAVE THE GOGGLES.” 

So on the goggles go. Man, Dr. VIP is a stickler for eye protection. I spend the entire night seeing patients with the ugly purple goggles behind my ears. 

In the middle of the night, I try to take them off. I hadn’t seen a patient who I needed eye for protection in hours. 

“WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IF SHIT HITS THE FAN.”

I legitimately don’t even know what that means, but sure. Goggles back on. Can’t irritate Dr. VIP.

I hide at one point in a hallway to rub behind my ears. Stupid purple plastic goggles.

We do okay that night. Patients get seen, the department moves. My M side overnight counterpart gives me a high-five. We did okay. 

At sign out, I tiredly hand over my few active patients and watch out of the corner of my eye for Dr. VIP to walk out so that I can finally take off the stupid goggles. As I’m dictating a note, he walks up to me.

""You did good, but *why in the world* did you wear those hideous goggles all night?""

And at the end of my first senior overnight shift, I watched a bunch of attendings laugh hysterically at their well-executed troll. 

Happy holidays, team.

e3oinb,0,2019-11-29,25 M4A (You Playing F) In Search of the Elusive Long-Term Detailed Story,WritingWizard124,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/e3oinb/25_m4a_you_playing_f_in_search_of_the_elusive/,"Good evening!

So tonight, I've decided to take my time and craft a request thread that more adequately states what kinds of things I am looking for in a roleplay.  I've been roleplaying for approximately 15 years now on various chat rooms and forums, though only about 6 or so have involved smut of any kind.  I love writing, and as such, I'm really looking to find a writing partner that will intrigue me, entertain me, inspire my writing, and create an altogether fun story with me.  And I hope that in return, I will do all of these things and more for you in our stories.

Granted, we all know that a lot of roleplay involves smut, and I absolutely enjoy that as well.  But smut without a story is just a bad porn film, and that's certainly not what I'm looking for.  I need story.  I need plot and world building.  Smut is important and fun and all that good stuff, but why are our characters suddenly sleeping together.  I don't believe a good story has a character simply look at the other and decide to sleep with them.  Something has to stir within both characters, and that something is what I try to explore thoroughly in all my writings.

Now, before I get into the ideas that I have, I would first like to say that I am absolutely open to your ideas as well.  This isn't a one-sided thing, and it never will be with me.  It's important that I enjoy myself, but it's also important to me that you enjoy writing with me as well.  And if you find yourself not enjoying an aspect of a roleplay, I never will be offended if you let me know what you're not enjoying about the story, and we can work to curve things toward another direction if need be.  And certainly, I'll be open with you as a partner as well if things aren't really being enjoyed on my end also.  With that being said, I will -never- ghost a roleplay.  There comes a time in any roleplay where it isn't quite as fun anymore, or burnout happens.  I get it.  But I'd feel guilty as hell if I ever just quit a RP without an explanation, and I'll give you that courtesy.  I just ask that you give me the same.

Now, as you can see in the tag, I'm open to roleplaying with men and women.  But the one requirement I will have is that you MUST play the female role.  I consider myself a fairly flexible writer, but I'm terrible at writing female characters, and I definitely want the person I'm roleplaying with to play the female role.  I am a straight male, but I don't mind if you are a male behind the screen.  All that matters to me is that your character is female.

Now for the fun part:

**Limits/Kinks:**



I will eventually put a more detailed F-list on here, but limits-wise, I am not into non-con, gore, bathroom stuff.  The extremes essentially.  I won't say that I'm vanilla per se, but I do tend to enjoy more usual modern slice of life themes.  I love playful teasing, things happening in water (pools, hot tubs, showers, etc.), small things that on their own don't mean much, but add up toward much more.  Teasing, brushing up against one another, accidental nudity, those kind of things.  Beyond that, if something makes sense in the general flow of the RP, you'll usually find that I'm up for it, but if ever in doubt, just ask.



**RP Ideas:**



Again, not an all-inclusive list, and you're more than welcome to offer your own ideas, but here's some ideas I've compiled of late.  I'll continue to add to this list as I discover new ideas that I enjoy.



**Celebrities** - 

I LOVE roleplaying within the celebrity genre.  Probably one of my favorite things to do.  I generally am looking for the female character to be the celebrity in this, though I suppose for the right writing partner, that could be flexible as well.  Currently, I have scenes involving celebrity incest (Dad/daughter, brother/sister, mom/son) and celebrity fan encounters (this one currently takes place at a convention locally to my character).  But feel absolutely free to suggest your own celebrity ideas as well.  I would love to try something new in this genre.  In the latter scene, I'm willing to play an older or a younger fan, and willing to play any ages allowable by site rules.

Some celebrities I enjoy playing opposite of include, but are not limited to (In no particular order): Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lawrence, Kaley Cuoco, Lauren Cohan, Christina Hendricks, Demi Lovato, and sometimes Taylor Swift depending on the role.  Absolutely feel free to suggest some of your favorites as well!


**Teacher/student or coach/athlete** - 

I really enjoy the power dynamic between the two here, but this isn't your cliche ""You're failing a test, so do things for the teacher to get your grades up"" kind of trope.  That's too easy.  That doesn't cause me to think or be interested in any way.  For these two ideas, I am willing to play either the older or younger role, and again, the younger character, I'm fine with that character being anything allowed within site rules.  

My basic idea for both involve a pairing of two individuals who actually get along great.  Perhaps the teacher or the coach has been their teacher or coach for some time, allowing for a better relationship/bond between the two than most of the people their age.  Nothing unprofessional has happened between them at the time the RP starts, but through time, a very inappropriate relationship begins to build between the pair.  I do tend to love writing scenes involving disallowed relationships, which brings me to:


**Incest** - 

Disallowed relationships really thrill me.  Relationships that society looks down on.  And of course, this is the case with incest.  No, not something I'm into in real life, but writing it has always been enjoyable to me for whatever reason.  For these, I've got scenes involving dad/daughter, brother/sister, or mom/son.  Open to other suggestions as always.


**Boss/employee** - For this, I think the easiest way is to post the scene idea that I have:

*I am a manager at a major marketing firm in New York. Basically what we do is try to get various companies to pay us to run their entire advertising campaign for them. It's a big money business, but someone has to do it, and all the stress and burden falls on our shoulders - they just 'show us the money.'

Unfortunately, that does mean a lot of trips away from home; away from family. But I have a loving wife, and she has been very understanding.

A very big automobile company based in California is my next client, and this one deal could pay for all of our operations for the next year and beyond. And so, being the best representative at the company, I'm the one tasked with flying out that way and convincing them to sign with us.

One problem, my assistant. She's tasked to go with me, but she can't do her job properly. She mixes up phone calls, she messes up the calendar. All of the tasks she is assigned to, she can't do. So I fire her, just a day before I would need someone to come with me to help me stay organized.

I try to see if I can borrow other managers' assistants, but they were all booked as well. So it's recommended that I give you a chance, a young intern in our firm. They say you work hard, and on such short notice, I didn't have much of a choice.

So I agree, calling you into my office to talk to you about the opportunity.*



**TV Show/Movies** - 

Of course, I also enjoy writing within television and movie universes as well.  I find this is the hardest category to find a match, as it does require both people to have some kind of a clue about the film or show itself.  With that being said, I've written scenes within shows like The Big Bang Theory, Girl Meets World, Gotham, Game of Thrones, Marvel Cinematic, and the like.  Always open for those, and this list will expand as well.  Also open to your ideas as well.




As stated, this list and this post will be ever evolving.  At the end of the day, I'm looking for ideas.  Compelling stories.  World-building.  If my ideas aren't something you enjoy, don't hesitate to send me some of your ideas.  I might not like them, but who knows, your idea might intrigue me.  As long as they don't break my limits posted above, I might be open-minded toward them.



Please note that I am ALWAYS looking for capable partners.  So if you see this post, whether I'm online or not, feel free to hit me up.  I will respond as soon as humanly possible.  Let's quench each other's literary thirst!"
e3pcdf,3,2019-11-29,I feel so defeated and it’s like there’s a weight on my chest,slowlygettingby,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/e3pcdf/i_feel_so_defeated_and_its_like_theres_a_weight/,"Without being too too specific, I’ll be graduating soon and I feel very nervous about the whole ordeal. Before I graduate I have to complete an internship for my program and I feel like I’m going in circles. Application after application and then scheduling interviews and then figuring out it’s different to what their posting made it out to be. My friends have secured successful internships with good companies, meanwhile I feel useless and incapable of finding a good one. 

I don’t feel ready to graduate but also don’t see myself staying longer in school/university as it’s not really necessary to continue this in my industry. Frankly I’m terrified, I don’t know what I’m going to do when I graduate and I’m not a fan of the city I currently live in so I would like to move but am also not working at the moment. 

I had a breakdown the other day about graduating and thinking about my whole life filled with educating myself and have default holidays and then back to school every few months. 

I feel like I have no one to talk to about this. I feel so helpless and sad. I’ve never been as down and deeply aching as much as I am now from this combination of things. I just feel weighed down and like I have no skills or talents and am far from ready to start a career in my industry. 

I also feel friendless and alone. I don’t really have reliable “friends” if I try to make plans they’re usually terrible at sticking to them and the plans fall through. Everyone seems to be super busy with their own lives and much too busy time think of anyone else. 

My birthday is coming up and I figured I’ll spend it alone. Probably won’t do anything to “celebrate”, maybe a family meal but I’m not excited and I don’t care. I just want acknowledgment and to be shown some love. 

I wish I could just feel less sad, it’s just a constant aching deep inside my chest and I feel on the verge of crying most the time. Sometimes I think it’d be easier to end things or I’ll think about being hit by a car when I’m crossing the road. Then I wouldn’t have to make decisions for my future or have to face reality. I feel lost"

Also, please don't use reddit chat to message me, I'll *always* decline.

Okay, onto introductions. Hello, everybody! I'm Gwen, I'm a teacher from England (at least until we sink into the sea considering the way things are going) and for my summer break, I'm looking to get into some deep, detailed roleplay with someone intelligent and creative. Also, I love the taboo! Incest, infidelity, rough sex, humiliation, age differences and lots of dirty talk. I'm looking for someone to play a younger man, or maybe my son himself.  

I have a few prompts listed below, although none of those are set in stone and I'm eager to hear your ideas.

Also, since it sometimes helps, I occasionally like to put a celeb face to the character I'm playing. Amy Adams, Bryce Dallas Howard, Christina Hendricks, Halle Berry, Monica Bellucci, Rachel Weisz, Salma Hayek...but I'm open and easy with the other faces listed on my profile, as well as any suggestions you might have. Anyway, the prompts!

**Regular MILF Prompts**

*Camp Counsellor*

You'd been planning to spend your last summer before the start of college hanging with friends, getting laid, and making copious use of your fake ID. Instead, your parents forced you to take a job at a damn summer camp! As a counsellor, no less! Zero internet access, zero alcohol...but still, maybe this place has its upsides. You find you're naturally gifted at this kind of work, the kids are actually a lot of fun, and a few of your fellow counsellors are serious cuties. In fact, one night you and the other counsellors decide to have a secret party out in the woods. *You're* given the job of sneaking out and smuggling beer in...but *I* catch you in the act. Me, the head counsellor, the one in charge, the woman whose husband the camp was named after. I'm fairly beloved by everyone in camp, even you, but I won't abide for breaking the rules. I confiscate the beer and tell you in no uncertain terms that this *will* be discussed at my cabin. You're to come by the next night.

Except, when you do, it's much later than you expect. And I'm dressed...uh, a little lighter than you expected. And I tell you my little routine with the counsellors every fresh summer, and you're the chosen one this time. I have beer, I have weed, and I have a wedding ring that comes right the fuck off.

*Negotiating with the Bully*

As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then *I* will. I might be an upper-class stay-at-home mom, but you? You're just a kid, and no amount of muscles will change that. I'm going to your house and we're going to settle this: the bullying stops now. Yet, when I actually get you your house or trailer park or wherever you lurk, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism. The tables are turned and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...

*Soccer Mom Shenanigans*

I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. It's a little flattering, to be honest. Maybe even kinda sexy, but I try not to think about it. Then, the game ends. My son's team loses, because they always do, and maybe my son himself suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) or maybe they just all go out for pizza, leaving underappreciated mom to pack up the minivan. Whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I do so, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into sudden temptation...

*Other Prompts in Progress*

* Your girlfriend's Mom
* Granny, what great big tits you have

**Incest Prompts**

*Your Mom, the Stripper*

Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...

*Halloween with Mom*

It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....or *does* she fail to recognize you?

*Back to the Future*

And just like that, you find out your professor's time machine works. You're shot back into a time period you were never alive for, and all you can do is wait to return to the present. In the meantime, you're in High School, and who do you bump into but your darling mother? The one you've always had sinful thoughts about? Except I'm not the uptight matriarch you know, *oh* no: I'm the school wild child, a slutty drug user who soon starts laying on the moves pretty damn thick..."
e3qzo9,30,2019-11-30,Broke up with gf after 4.5 years of dating,mtzaj06,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/e3qzo9/broke_up_with_gf_after_45_years_of_dating/,"Hey Guys, 

Little background on me...... I’m 22 years old, a senior in college studying civil engineering , been working for a big international construction company as an intern for over 2.5 years and I just dumped my gf. I’m honestly lost af and i dont know what to do.... here’s my story

I met this girl in hs and we started dating at the very end of hs. We started college and the 1st 3 years of our relationship were great... dates, trips, nice dinners, hotel nights, bars, clubs, going out with friends you name it. Unfortunately her parents were very strict and we basically dated in hiding for over 2 years... Her family never believed that she could go to school and be someone in life... i from day 1 always supported her, motivated her, and told her to keep working hard and good things would happen.... i helped her get a job as a tutor at our old hs so she can get internships under her belt. 
I would ditch class sometimes to go see her, take her lunch to work, help her with HW, help her when her car would break down.... i mean i was all in for her. 

This past year is a completely different story... when my school work racked up, my school/work schedule went to shit... i discussed this with her and explained to her that for the next year things were going to get tough and she agreed to fully support my shit schedule.... time went on and i noticed she seemed upset at me all the time and complained to me that she missed me.... we worked things through but the tension was still there 

Summer came along and the schedule got worse... i worked 2 jobs and took on 11 units in 10 weeks to speed up my graduation... she on the other hand took the summer off because she is starting her credential program in the fall(no classes offered in summer)... basically no work no school.... i busted my ass and i still managed to see her once a week and that one time id see her, she would want to see me more and more and would get upset at me if i stayed late at school or work during the week... 

Now this semester the grind keeps pushing and i reminded her or my shit schedule with constant reassurance that this is only temporary... i gave her my work schedule, my class schedule to make her understand why we cant do what we use to do before... still, she would get upset at me if i went out for a beer with my friends, if i chose to relax at home and not go see her, and i would constantly get the “u dont care about me anymore.” 

A couple weeks ago she got really sick and went to the hospital... im in the middle of class 40 miles away from where im at and asks me for a ride home (she Ubered there dont know why) ... i tell her i cant but immediately ask her what time she will be out so i can try and be there... 10 mins later i get a text saying her gay best friend (we both know him for years now) will pick her up... i text her back saying ok good let me know when you’re safe.... as soon as i send that i post on sc a funny video from one of my friends in class.... right after i get a text from her saying “screw you dude, ive never felt so insignificant in my life........ i called other people who are more than willing to stop what they’re doing to help me and you are out here acting like nothing is going on...” and the rant went on....

I honestly got super pissed at this after all ive done for her and i honestly felt like i gave her everything.... i feel as if i sacrificed myself to help her, pushed her forward with her goals,  went above and beyond to make this happen but i feel like deep down she truly feels this way about me ... after thinking all this through i cut the chord a week later... i truly felt under valued and like she was not all in, in supporting my goals and helping me finish school strong... what do you guys think? I feel lost right now, ive never had anyone else but her and i know the world is ahead of me .... i feel like she was the one and i might have lost “the one” i dont know."
e3rdhi,11,2019-11-30,College graduate thinking of switching to logistics career,darthzilla99,logistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/logistics/comments/e3rdhi/college_graduate_thinking_of_switching_to/,"Hi everyone. Long story short, I graduated at Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston with a bachelors of science in Ocean and Coastal resources (more or less an environmental science degree). Because of my current work experience I'm thinking logistics/ supply chain management might be a more viable career path for me. I live in Houston, TX.

I graduated in 2017. Since then, I did two internships with the student conservation association and then landed my current job in March of 2018. I work part-time at a small start up company called Sentinel Biologics, Inc. When I'm not in the lab assisting my employer with his research, he has me manage his warehouse. 

As far as my skills and duties, at school I did a lot of essays, land surveying, wetlands delineation, remote sensing, and some GIS map making. I have also worked with Matlab and I'm currently learning SQL and Python for fun. Also, in addition to working with Microsoft office suite in college, I also have an excel specialization certification and can do macros and pivot tables. 

As far as the warehouse goes, I'm constantly organizing my employers inventory. I have worked with and lead several of his employees so I have some management experience. I can drive a forklift. I have worked with pallet jacks, hand held bar code scanners, and grinding machines. I also inspect pallets and shipments coming from my employer's clients. I also do shipping and receiving documentation. I'm constantly working with R&amp;L, XPO logistics, and SAIA. I also sometimes do daily procurement calling.

The only thing that I could see being a roadblock is unfortunately is since it is a small company, he does not have a excel inventory spreadsheet list for his warehouse. I have volunteered to set up an inventory spreadsheet in excel, but he told me not to and that it was not necessary.  So for my computer skills I have to keep up at home during my non-work hours.

Needless to say, he is a really nice boss, but he cannot afford to hire full time employees at the moment and so I'm trying to get my career going.

As far as what I like and dislike, I like managing the operations of a warehouse and inspecting inventory. I don't mind inventory management and doing spreadsheets on the computer. Some procurement calling I don't mind, but I'm not fond of being on a cell phone for 8 hours a day. While I'm willing to do it for a year to move on quickly, I do not want to stay at dispatch work long term on a headset like in the video link  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxhbY3Qy-sg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxhbY3Qy-sg) 

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions I'm wondering,

What job positions do you think I could fit? 

Will I have to do dispatch work for a long time to pay my dues as they say?

Even if my bachelors degree is unrelated, could I get by long term in this career with just experience and an unrelated college degree? Will my salary be limited without a Supply chain management degree? Will I eventually need to pursue a masters in Supply Chain or another business degree to surpass the 70k+ salary mark?

What is the best way to learn SAP software since my current job does not use it?

Thanks for everyone's help."
e3rf47,1,2019-11-30,My gf told me she doesn't think we'll be able to have sex and that she doenst want to be very physical when she comes back.,ttmaxie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e3rf47/my_gf_told_me_she_doesnt_think_well_be_able_to/,"Ok so basically the title is pretty a synthesis of the whole thing but ill make it as short as possible because i really need some outside help.

We've been dating for a year now, we started dating while we lived in the same city but then she moved back to her country(she was just studying where i live) and since then we have a long distance relationship with her coming here for 2 weeks last spring break and i went to her country for a month during the summer. 

The only sexual contact we ever had was oral sex, both of us would yknow, reach the climax and that was it, but we only had actual sex like 3 times. During the spring break she supposedly liked it a lot and we only did it a couple of days before her departure, but back in the summer we really couldn't get the hang of it again and she felt very bad about it, she told me she doesn't feel that good when comparing it to normal oral or hand pleasuring and told me she cant really feel truly horny or craving sex, i got very sad but told her we would work it out.
Aside from that irl interaction we would send nude pictures to each other sometimes and she would also tryon clothes and lingerie while we were having facetime calls.
But recently i feel like she is being kind of away from me, she doenst show a lot of excitement when talking to me on facetime, stopped sending me any pictures of herself naked and almost none of her outfits or just normal selfies, which ofc left me wondering.

She is coming back for 3 months and staying at my house, she will have an internship at a company she likes, and she is very excited to come back, and as we were talking about plans for stuff to do while she was here we started talking about some sexual themes and after a while she just said she didn't really think we would be able to have sex and that she isnt really thinking about doing anything like that for a while, that sure caught me off-guard because I taught she would be more positive about it and i also felt even sadder after thinking more about it afterwards.

But i think today was even worse, she is a couple of days away from coming back and she was sounding very lifeless and dull, she randomly asked if i wouldnt mind deleting any nudes i had of her, and i said ofc I wouldnt mind and i would even do it in front of her, but I didn't understand why she was feeling that way, on the beginning she was the one that started sending me naughtier pictures and i turned out to really like them. She would take a bunch of pictures and i enjoyed seeing her body a lot, she even edited some at times! But out of nowhere she said she doesn't feel comfortable with it, she doenst want to send anymore of it and i just dont get it. For example she bought a new bra and told me she wouldd send me tryon photos of it, which i really wanted, but a week later she just refused and said she doesn't like doing it.

I honestly love her to bits and im afraid she is losing her love for me, i never made her do anything she didn't want to and always gave her the space she needed but im very anxious about having her over for 3 months and i dont know what to do about the physical problem.  I really need some opinions here :(


P.s today she said that when she arrives she doenst want to be very physical, but literally 1-2 weeks ago she was telling me how she wants to make out in my bed right after arriving from the flight and i just dont know what she really wants."

Я подаю заявку для позиции “XXXX” чтобы научить Русскии язык. Я нашёл этот програм из моего профессора, Профессор XXXXXX. Потому что я очень хорошо на уроках и в разговорах, она рекомендовала мне исследовать позицию и подать заявку.

Я хочу подать заявку из-за обязанностей этой должности. Я квалифицированный кандидат, потому что у меня много опыта в академической деятельности и внеклассной деятельности. Я осваиваю работу как по специальности, так и по русскому языку. В ресультате, у меня сейчас ГПА 3.99 / 4.00. Кроме того, я всегда получаю отличные оценки. Но в этой трудной атмосфере мне все еще нравится учиться дальше. Например, в прошлым летом я подал заявку на программу XXXXX в XXX. На уроках каждый день мы часто общались и писали только на русском языке. Этот опыт помог мне понять тонкие нюансы в языке.

Кроме того, я получил опыт за пределами академических. Сейчас я работаю в офисе конгрессмена ХХХХа ХХХХХХа. Это волонтерская позиция. На этой работе я работаю с менеджерами кампаний и даже с конгрессменом ХХХХХХом чтобы общаться с донорами, собирать данные, и даже организовывать сбор средств. В этой позиции мне нужно находить мелкие детали и разрешать сложные проблемы. Для кампании важно организовать финансовые данные, и я регулярно использую эти навыки, чтобы помочь своей команде.

Спасибо за ваше внимание, я ценю ваше рассмотрение. Если у вас возникнут дальнейшие вопросы, пожалуйста свяжитесь со мной по телефону (555)-555-5555 или по электронной почте [example@reddit.ru](mailto:example@reddit.ru).

Had to remove some personal information. the translation, if you'd like it, is as follows...

Dear hiring manager,

I am applying for the XXXXXX Tutor position under the Russian language. I discovered this program through my current RUS 311 professor, Professor XXXXXXX. Due to my success in her class and my degree of fluency, she recommended that I research the position and possibly apply. The duties of this position make me very eager to do so. Extensive experience in both my academics and my extracurricular activities makes me a qualified candidate. Throughout both my major and my Russian studies, I fully engage with the material. As such, I currently hold a GPA of 3.99, never receiving a grade lower than an A in any Russian class. Yet in this demanding atmosphere, I still enjoy going further in my studies. In one key example, I applied and was accepted into the XXXXXX in XXXXXX for the summer of 2019. During our daily classes, we would immerse ourselves within the language through rigorous conversation and writing exercises. In the end, I was able to master 10 credits of material in 8 weeks. This intensive experience has opened new doors to my understanding of the language.

I also have relevant experience beyond my academics. Currently, I am a Congressional Intern for XXXXXXXs re-election campaign. In this position, I work closely with campaign managers and even the Congressman himself to contact potential donors, maintain numerous databases, and even organize fundraisers.

Hey RPers, looking to do a Boss and Intern RP! Happy to do both a male boss and female intern or a female boss and male intern ( I think both can have some distinct, hot dynamics). Perhaps this is an affair for one or both of us as well. I’m in the mood for particularly rough (but consensual) sex. 

I was hoping to create a plot with a potential partner together, however if you have something specific in mind that's great too! Some elements that could be included are ""performance"" evaluations, overtime work, using work hours for our naughty fun (while keeping the rest of the office from finding out), and seeing how sexy and slutty your outfits can become, both outside the office room and within our own privacy.

Message me with your kinks, limits and thoughts on the RP. Please be somewhat detailed as it really helps in planning the RP. My kik is matt_rp_22

Hope to play with you soon ;)"

Just having this out there if anyone is interested and maybe looking for presents. I’m in no rush to sell, but I’m trying to reduce so books/material items since they take up so much space. I guess you can understand, especially when half the room has every volume of Naruto, Dragon ball, the current volumes of Berserk and etc. Some books are rare and kept in great condition, and others once rare have significantly deprecated in value-Knights of Sidnonia and Gantz :( . So, I’m listing those items that I no longer have an interest in. Some books are left overs from what I started as a collection-FMA. I’ll also be studying abroad in the summer(luckily I won a scholarship that pays most of it), but I’m not currently working(waiting on my people to call me back for an internship), so I’ll be gone for that period.

People who get other people interested enough in themselves to invest in them, to mentor them, to help them become leaders.

But I'm just a shitty cubicle developer. Nobody gives a fuck, if I were to die tomorrow, some other random react developer #87 would replace me and that would be it. The skills I have are worthless, anybody can learn to do what I do. It's not like I have studied advanced linear algebra at MIT or some shit.

I just go through my little pathetic life, aimless, like dust. Not accomplishing anything of worth. Stupid wage software engineer. Its really fucking tragic."

I am about to graduate in a couple weeks, as an older graduate and I am really struggling to find the right place to work and was maybe hoping for some advice on career paths.

Some background: I've been coaching basketball for the past 8 years, most recently at the college level and it was then that I decided to return to school and finish my degree. One reason I am looking to move away from coaching is the incredibly low pay at the entry level, for reference I made $1500 this past season but had room and board, as well as a school car. I've worked part time as a barista, and bartended but don't really have any experience looking for a job in more corporate America. I have been also working as an intern doing part time ""data analysis"", but the role has mostly morphed into a management role over the other interns on the team (which was reflected in a title change) and basically only involves using excel. 

I've been putting my resume out there mostly entry level, but am not getting any calls back at all and with the end of the term coming up I'm starting to feel the pressure. Any advice on career paths that might be interested in my skill set? 

Thank you!"
e3vugs,705,2019-11-30,Dealing with breakfast at this point has become more of a nightmare than dealing with guests,ur-mom-lesbian,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/e3vugs/dealing_with_breakfast_at_this_point_has_become/,"Weekend night auditor here at a limited service property who makes hot breakfast in the morning, and most likely in two hours there will be quite a few complaints regarding breakfast.

So a little backstory back around April/May my manager hired a new weekend breakfast attending , as the previous one never failed to show up one weekend. Now our main breakfast was the best attendant that anyone could ask for, she knew how to make every menu item perfectly, the oatmeal, gravy, when to order items,etc..., and she trained the new guy. Well we all took a notice that he was performing slow, and well most of us have been there at one point so I'm now one to judge so quickly. Well when summer hit  I performed my internship at our property and for two weeks my manager put me to do breakfast with both attendants during the week and do my usual night audit on weekends. Well when I trained with the new guy I noticed he was just straight up lazy, not refilling any any items u till front desk had to tell him that there were complaints coming in, thank god I only trained with him one day and more days with the main attendant, the I was put to do breakfast for a week alone which was nice 

Cut to October our new hire has remained lazy, but it's not as bad as our main attendant keeps everything in check, but one day she just doesn't show up, she straight up disappeared, everyone tried getti g In contact with her but nothing. Well as you can guess our pure weekend attendant has become the main attendant now,a recipe for disaster, the guy does not stock what needs to be stocked, doesnt make key decisions In ordering, leaves the place a mess for auditors to clean up, and we've gone through more than 4 hires to help him out but they either didn't show up or quit, and the ones who have remained have most likely been trained horribly or are lazy like him.

But today was the worst, there was literally no eggs go cook in our fridge, I only had one bag and that's about to finish as I'm typing this, no fruit like literally theres no fruit to put out, waffle batter was a mess, smoothies are gonna be gone quick and there's none pre made to put out. Now usually I've gotten pretty good at cleaning the mess up restocking all the necessary essentials to get breakfast operating in the morning, but this morning I couldn't fix the main things, as there was nothing to fix it with. I just hope that the am shift does not have to deal with many complaints this morning just cause one breakfast attendants couldn't do their job, and I feel even more for the weekday night auditor as she deals with breakfast more than I do, and yes she has let management know about his/their lazy work as well, all front desk has. Even according to my p.m shift he overheard my manager and the guy talking about what he needs to improve on breakfast and according to my coworkers he heard the attendant say ""I'm 26 I don't need you telling me how to do my job"", like seriously how is he still employed.

Well I typed this in during my shift on my phone as I'm heading straight go sleep afterwards so if there's any misspellings etc. I apologize

Edit: I go into my last shift for the week, my p.m shift tells me all about the mess that he heard was breakfast earlie, and the my g.m asked me to call him after I was done with getting my shift started. The discussion was basically he was tired that the breakfast attendants were being lazy, he was going to have a meeting with them, possibly look into moving some housekeepers into breakfast. He asked me to make egg whites instead, which I've never done and it seems like it's going to take a while. My gm said he would not allow this to continue as our reviews would be close to perfect, but breakfast is messing us up. He's been saying that's it's not gonna happen again for the past few months so don't expect anything to change suddenly, however today was the day he realized how true of a mess breakfast has become. So I hope that is a lesson that he will never repeat again when hiring new people. Only two more weeks of dealing with this mess before I go on my vacation."
e3w485,3,2019-11-30,Weird manifestation of loneliness,spaced_out1,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/e3w485/weird_manifestation_of_loneliness/,"Ok guys I would love to hear your thoughts on this if it isn't suggesting I go see a shrink.

I've been struggling a  lot with loneliness throughout my college years. Currently a senior. The summer before my senior year I guess is when things started to go really wrong. I was in the midst of this drag of an internship and powered through half of it until I couldn't. This was also the point when I had to start worrying about finding a job. Instead of getting its shit together and going on one of its full on productive modes, my brain decided to shut down. This meant slacking off not only in the internship but also the job search. I guess the stress and anxiety was just too much to handle along with this strong affirmation that I didn't deserve a job let alone a future whilst there were people I knew who were already landing jobs. I also messed up my first interview really bad which fueled this belief. This probably was the start of my depressive episode. 

It had been  just a week since the semester started up again and I didn't show up for classes the first half of the week and pretty much stayed in bed all day being depressed and suicidal. A few acquaintances checked up on me and even though I travel from home to college, my parents didn't really care. They literally let me stay in bed and wallow in my misery until they didn't and that's when I got back to college and told myself to pull my shit together and applied for this job. I had this whole plan charted out about how I would get back in the game. The very next day I got a call for an interview and though I suffer from terrible social anxiety, used this powerful technique of slow talk and landed myself this pretty good job. So great! Problem solved. Things should be back to normal right? But guess what. They weren't. Somewhere deep down I knew getting myself a job wasn't what was gonna make me not miserable (Smiths fans where ya at?) cause I had this unconventional plan figured out in case I didn't get a job. Not really a fan of the 9-5 grind. Still unsure Ill be able to bear with it.

During the low point of that summer when I was feeling a bit lonely along with all that, I just had this overwhelming urge to talk to someone. Not necessarily about what was going on but just one of those needs as a human for social interaction. Don't really have friends to satisfy that and not counting my family. I was just laying in bed one night and was just wondering if there was an app which would let you talk to random strangers (voice call). So that's how I ended up on that app. I have terrible social anxiety as already mentioned and phone anxiety is part of the deal so this was an extreme measure indicating how desperate I really was. I still remember sweating profusely on my first call. But at this point, the app was only to satisfy my cravings and after one of those phone calls, Id be set for like a week or so until I had to have my next. The experience was quite hollow honestly, starting at the base with a person is really exhausting and I had to do that every time cause I didn't really feel a connection with any of them. Until I started talking to this one boy.

He was great. One of those bad boy types every one wanted to date in high school. Great voice, played soccer, an eclectic taste in music, opinions on important stuff, confident and a go-getter. He was the whole damn package. I was really enjoying our first conversation and that's when he started talking naughty and we ended up doing it on the phone. He was so smooth with the whole thing I didn't even know what hit me. After that, I let my mind run wild. After being numb for all these years, this was exciting. I made a mountain out of a molehill.  I really liked talking to him and even though he'd always try to work that into the conversation, I was willing to overlook that for the first part of the conversation where things would just be normal. He was perfect to me but I guess he treated me wrong a bunch of times. I thought I was falling in love and had all these love songs which made sense even though he was pretty clear that we weren't gonna be a thing. I was opening up to him like I hadn't to anyone in years and that's when he told me he was going off the app and that we wouldn't be able to talk anymore.  That was a pretty rough time too. We were just talking for 5 weeks and 5 days and this happened a month back. 

After a bit more of wallowing and listening to sad songs and quotes, I was able to get over that after I discovered this concept of self love which was a life saver. That was the best part of this all. Amidst this weird journey, my academic life has taken a terrible hit and I'm trying to salvage what's left of it in the finals. I'm off that app for good and sometimes when I'm too lonely, go on this random website which is just as hollowing and average. I did try my luck on various dating apps cause I have to admit that feeling was pretty good when I thought I was in love and trying to find that in someone else for real this time. Talked to a few people but have never felt worse than when I swiped left on people based on just their bio. So inhumane. I haven't got the whole self love concept pat down yet. I don't talk to anyone I met on those websites anymore. So I'm basically back to square one but just a bit worse. I feel just as depressed as I did in the beginning and I'm so fed up with myself on the outside and on the inside. I'm so done with the life I've created for myself over the past years and really want to break out of it all and get out there and get a dream and work towards it and a social life while loving myself."

Maybe you’re the intern at the financial advisory firm I work at. Dressing to impress but not realizing you look like a clubbing slut.

Maybe you’re my next door neighbor home for Thanksgiving. I’ve got a good relationship with your parents, so they wouldn’t think twice about you stopping by the house to say hi. Unless they knew you’d be polishing my shaft.

Maybe you’re working at the store where I’m buying clothes for the holidays. You help me find some items, I slip you my business card and later that night I’m back fucking you in storeroom.

So many options for you sexy young women. Just be into rough sex and taking hot loads in every hole and you’ll be ready for me."

But I'm just a shitty cubicle developer. Nobody gives a fuck, if I were to die tomorrow, some other random react developer #87 would replace me and that would be it. The skills I have are worthless, anybody can learn to do what I do. It's not like I have studied advanced linear algebra at MIT or some shit.

I just go through my little pathetic life, aimless, like dust. Not accomplishing anything of worth. Stupid wage software engineer. Its really fucking tragic."
e42gp2,1,2019-11-30,My [20M] girlfriend [20F] used to be borderline emotionally abusive and doesn't seem interested in a long term relationship (with me at least). How should I proceed?,Hooded_Puppet,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e42gp2/my_20m_girlfriend_20f_used_to_be_borderline/,"Warning: Long post, TL;DR at the bottom.

I'll start with some background. My girlfriend and I have been together for just short of 5 months at this point and are in pseudo long-distance relationship; we see each other every other weekend. We've known each other since 2018 but didn't really get close until April of this year. This is my 3rd relationship and this is her 1st. We're both Chinese but she comes from a very traditional/conservative household (grew up mostly with her mom) while my family was a little more ""Westernized"". Her family isn't really about encouraging each other or showing affection outwardly and criticize each other pretty often; consequently, she has trouble talking about/expressing her feelings in person, speaks without tact, and is pretty condescending (treats me like a kid).

In the first 3 months of our relationship, I felt like shit because of her. Not to sound arrogant or anything but prior to this relationship I've never really been the insecure type; I never really compared myself to other people and felt bad for it because I was doing worse than them or anything like that. However, she would constantly compare me and insult my height, face, body, achievements, and personality. At first I thought it was just playful teasing but at some point I feel like she crossed a few lines.

For example, one time we were talking about my uni friends (John and Brad let's say) and how they were doing. I was doing pretty well for myself in terms grades and internships but I wasn't revered for my achievements either. I told her that John was almost top of the class in terms grades and that Brad found a fancy internship in the U.S. Her comment was ""Wow, so you're doing the worst huh? Brad will have great work experience and John has his grades to support him, while you're just average in both.""

Additionally, I can't count the amount of times she's mocked me for being short (I'm 5'9"" and she's 5'3"" -.-), having a baby face (she has one too), being the more ""submissive"" one, and looking like ""cardboard"" (I've been hitting the gym about 5 times a week for about 7 months now while she doesn't go at all and everyone EXCEPT her has commented that I'm at least decently muscular). As for the ""submissive"" comments, her reasoning is that I take her feelings/opinions into account too much when we make plans or when we're deciding what we should eat. I understand that complaining about this stuff on its own makes me seem like an oversensitive soyboy but taken that this happened pretty much every other day about the same stuff over and over, I feel like my complaints are justified.

However, I don't want to discredit her good parts. She's the one cooking good meals about 80% of the time, is probably the easiest person to enjoy long conversations with, always seems genuinely interested in my life and my thoughts, is willing to take feedback/criticism, and is pretty down to earth if something is on her mind. There's definitely more to her that I appreciate in addition to this list, I just wanted to establish that she's a good partner in other aspects for now.

Things improved after I expressed how distraught and shitty I felt, and told her to stop comparing me to others and to keep her ""teasing"" to a reasonable level. But, nowadays I find myself always comparing myself to other guys. Thoughts like ""I wish I was as tall as him"", ""I wish my face looked like his (more adult-like)"", and ""I wish I was as muscular as that guy"" sound louder proportional to the amount of time I spend with her.

The most worrying thing for me at the moment is her stance on a long-term relationship. Currently, her parents don't know about me, which is fine because I think I'd prefer it that way for now. However, her exact words one night were ""If my mom disapproved of a guy for a long-term relationship, I'd dump right away,"" followed by ""Yeah, I don't think my mom would like you."" I don't think this really needs much explanation. Another time she said she ""her mom would definitely prefer for her to go through multiple relationships before committing to one."" For me, I don't mind dating for experience I suppose and understand that her stance on relationships is perfectly reasonable but I feel that around my age is the easiest/best time to meet someone because you're surrounding by so many like-minded people so I'm not sure if I want to waste time on a relationship that destined to crash and burn.

TL;DR Girlfriend was borderline emotionally abusive but now even after stopping her from insulting me every other frickin' day, I can't shake the thought that I'm not good enough for her. Furthermore, she doesn't seem like she's interested in dating for long-term, only for dating experience. What to do?"
e42zi9,18,2019-11-30,Same Date every year,handbagqueen-,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/e42zi9/same_date_every_year/,"I posted this in JNMIL before I knew this subreddit existed. But it has an update so I thought I would post it here

ITS literally the same DATE every year

Obligatory I am posting this on a the app and I am fairly new to reddit. This is going to be a long one so please read till the end and let me know if I’m being to sensitive.

Ok so a bit of a background info about me and my DH. We have been together for 7 1/2 year married for about 4.  DH has only one sibling an older bro that’s 5 years older than him. When DH was going to propose  to me he told his family and they helped him pick out a ring and plan our engagement trip. Last minute his bro told him (at the jewelry store) that he was also going to propose to his gf on the same trip (which was a surprise gift to me from DH on my 25th birthday). My DH proposes to me on my b-day and I am over the moon.  Fast forward to 16 hours later (my birthday on that year happened to fall on a major holiday) to a holiday dinner where my BIL proposed to  his gf, meanwhile we hadn’t announced our engagement bc we were waiting until after dinner. This was the first time they really upset me.

Fast forward to a year after the engagement, my DH and I were ready to go ahead with our wedding.  I keep on asking my BIL and SIL if they have decided a date for their wedding bc I wanted to avoid having the engagement fiasco happen again. I really did not want to have our weddings to close to each other. I asked for 12 months and they kept on giving us the run around. Finally after not wanting to wait any longer to get married we set a date that was literally 2 years after the proposal, a day before my birthday and four days before my DHs birthday (that week is really significant for us, for a number of reason). We put down a non-refundable deposit and then left for a family vacation for two weeks with DHs family. On the vacation I asked the first day again whether they had picked a date, they said maybe in the summer after the day we had picked out.  At this point DH and I told his family we picked a date and the date and the fact that we paid a ($15,000!!!) nonrefundable deposit for the venue. Everyone was happy and that was that I didn’t think anything about it again until the last day of our two week family vacation when lo and behold  BIL announces to the family that they to had decided a date and it was two weeks from the day of our wedding. At this point I brought up the fact that it was a little too close to our wedding and was totally ignored. 

When I tell you that I knew it was going to be a disaster from that day forward I cannot tell you how right I was. SIL was a bridesmaid in my wedding and I was one in hers. I picked out my bridesmaids dress and colors for our wedding ten months before ours. She went through several designs and colors until settling in on the same color and same design of bridesmaids dress as the ones I was using. I picked flowers and she changed her wedding flowers to be the same as mine. The list goes on and on and on she even had the same exact menu (except less choices since our wedding had a much larger budget since my parents paid for the entire thing and they were gifted their  wedding by my father in law who is very wealthy but very stingy), same light color, same hair style as mine, you name it she copied it from my wedding. To put the cherry on top of everything, I flew out a very well known make up artist to do the makeup for me and my bridal party including FIL and MIL. The artist charge a flat booking fee and then on top an hourly rate, so I told everyone in my party to be at the venue at a very specific time to make sure that we got everyone ready in a certain amount of time. My FIL and MIL were over two and a half hours late for this, I later found out that my FIL and MIL went shopping for her wedding veil on the day of my wedding. So they missed a lot of my getting ready pictures. We have pictures from the wedding and video as well and during the entire wedding BIL and SIL are constantly on their phone (BIL was my DHs best man and was very inattentive the entire wedding). At this point I am frustrated and I really didn’t want to deal with them. Especially since they were having a destination wedding and were doing it so close to my wedding and during the only time of the year that my DH and I could have gone on a honey moon ( I was in law school and during the summer had to intern to get credit for school so I only had winter break off) . I sucked it up and even rescheduled some very important things with my school so that I could get to their wedding on time l. I won’t go in to the shot show that was their wedding (my SIL mother disrespecting my MIL and I don’t take that shit lightly so I stood up for my MIL and it got nasty bc SILs mother started using racial and religious insults while talking to me) but my SIL cut me out of all of her wedding pictures, by positioning me behind a pillar during their ceremony so that I was obscured the entire time. 

Fast forward to a year later my SIL was pregnant when I graduated law school and chose to be induced on the day of my graduation their by ensuring that my in-laws could not attend my graduation since it was the birth of their first grandchild (understandable). This is where the shit starts getting frustrating, my in-laws got upset that my DH didn’t want to be at the birth of his niece because he wanted to be at my law school graduation. They couldn’t fathom why that was more important to him and why he wouldn’t go to his nieces birth. On top of that I was not allowed to come bc SIL mother (who everyone in the family agrees is a b!tch but no one except me stands up to) still had a problem with me calling her out in being nasty to my MIl, didn’t want me giving the ‘evil eye’ to her grandchild.  My in-laws went so far as to repeatedly try and FaceTime  DH during my ceremony to tell him details about how far along SIL was in her birth (WTF). DH didn’t answer because he didn’t want to miss anything about my ceremony and I was upset that day bc of something unrelated so he really wanted to make the effort to make that day really special for me.

Ever since the birth of his niece my in-laws want to spend every holiday in the state where my BIL lives (understandable) but there is a problem with that my family lives in the state I live in about three hours away so I can’t do the holidays in another city since we spend time with both families. Also BIL lives in a major city where flights and hotels cost a fortune during the holidays and staying with my BIL is out of the question bc he has cats and DH and I both have asthma that is triggered by cats.

The men in my DH family also take a boys trip around the time of one particular major holiday that falls in between my birthday, DHs birthday and our wedding anniversary. This ‘tradition’ started a year before our wedding and always seems to include my DH missing our anniversary and either part of my birthday or all of it. Every year I ask for him to leave early and every year my FIL refuses to pay for him to leave early (technically a business/ pleasure trip but business is done in the first half of the two week trip). Further he gets angry if DH books his own flight for an earlier return bc it mess up the group rate that he gets. Every year I suck it up bc I get that it’s for the business but it’s really starting to irritate me. Especially since the birth of BILs child when they insist that my DH stay in BILs state until the holiday and then come back home to our state afterwards which means that he would spend not only my birthday but the holiday and his birthday with his parent and BILs family.  Every year my DH says no that he wants to be with his wife for that week bc it’s very significant for us and every year it is a dramatic fight, with MIL, FIL, BIL calling me and my husband selfish for not wanting to be with the family for the holidays.  A note here my SIL and I do not get along, it’s obvious and my in-laws refuse to acknowledge this.

This year is a milestone birthday for me, and up until a week ago it seemed like the ‘boys trip’ wasn’t happening so DH and I booked a week long vacation on the beach for our anniversary, my birthday the holiday and his birthday. My FIL called DH two days ago and said the trip was on and that they would be flying out this week (meaning he would be gone for three weeks) and coming back the day after his birthday. DH asked what he should do and I lost it (in the middle of a very high end furniture store no less 😣) I told him he could do whatever he wanted but that with or without him I was spending my milestone birthday on the vacation that we had booked together.  I also told him that whatever his choice was I’d respect it but that he would have to deal with the consequences of this choice on his own. He called his father and told him he wasn’t going on this years trip. My FIL and BIL lost it and started blowing up my DH phone leaving messages like how dare he not come etc.  At this point I started to break down and cry and told DH how upset I am by the lack of consideration by his parents. They know my birthday is on the same date every single year, they know me and SIL don’t get along and that she doesn’t want me at her house bc of the thing with her mother and I don’t want to be there. I feel like they constantly make me out to be a second class family member bc we don’t have children yet ( going through fertility treatments now so extra sensitive about this matter). 

I am going to add that they are happy to drop my name when they want any legal work done or if they want to threaten someone (they often tell ppl that I am a lawyer in the hope of intimidating ppl idk why they do this). SIL is a surgeon so there is no chance she’s intimidated by my career, but I think she is intimidated by my demeanor bc I do have a very strong personality (duh lawyer) where as she is the silent type.  

My MIL who I used to love ices me out all the time when she speaks to DH (my in-laws are immigrants as am I albeit from different parts of the world. MIL only speaks her native language which I understand but cannot speak bc I speak 5 other languages and it’s hard for me to pick up another one verbally. Also whenever I tried to speak the language my BIL made fun of my ‘white girl accent’)

I am at loss with my in-laws I try to make compromises with them. I also try to ask DH if he can ask BIL that if they would come down here (SIL parents both live within an our of my in-laws so they too have to fly to the State my BIL lives in for the holidays) so that it would be more convenient for everyone and so that I would be included in the holiday with my in-laws. BIL refuses to comedown here even though he gets free airline tickets since SIL mother works for a major airline.  It really destroys me that they put my husband in this situation where he has to pick b/w me and his family. But after years of being excluded from holidays and being w/o my DH on my birthday I am tired of them not compromising. So I gave my DH the choice of finding a middle ground with my BIL (which was essentially having the holiday at my in-laws house in our state which he shot down bc his wife is on call) , going without me in which case he would be telling me that he values his family more which would seriously make me reconsider our relationship, or staying with me and taking our vacation as planned and then going to my parents house for part of the holiday weekend. 

I feel horrible about asking DH to pick so Reddit if you have made it this far please give it to me straight, am I unreasonable or are my in-laws systematically treating me like I’m a second class family member? 

Also my husband has told his family that from now on he won’t go to any holiday or events where I am not welcomed.  I regret ever standing up for my MIL but even if I hadn’t i probably would never go to BILs house in another state and spend the holidays with her family whom I don’t like and my BIL who treats me shitty. Holidays are meant for the family and I don’t want to be subjected to being around ppl I dislike during the holidays and my birthday. DH is aware of how I feel and has said that we don’t have to spend anymore holiday with his family unless it’s at his parents house, which is ten minutes from our house and where we can go for a short time and then come back home. 

Am I unreasonable or is this a shitty situation?

UPDATE- my DH didn’t go on the trip and we did the holidays and our birthdays with my family which was so relaxing! My in-laws sent flowers for my birthday which was surprising but it was crickets from BIL and SIL which I honestly am ok with. Three days later it is DH birthday and it’s radio silence from BIL until about 5 when he says to my DH HBD through text and then calls to talk about soccer. My DH mentioned that we went out for my birthday with my parents and I get the same text I get every year from SIL happy birthday. I’m not proud of myself but I replied thank you, but it was 3 days ago like it is every year."

It looks like the chances are pretty high I’ll be relocating to Bloomington for work in the spring of 2020. 

I don’t drive and don’t have a license. Google leads me to believe that Bloomington is a somewhat walkable city, I’d be curious to hear from people living in the area without a car. Based on your experience, is this a realistic option? Do you have recommendations for certain neighbourhoods that are more walkable or have better access to transit?

I’ve mostly lived in big cities (outside the US) with good public transit, so not having a car has never been an issue for me. I’m currently in Atlanta for a short internship and having a VERY hard time getting around and not feeling totally isolated.

(Realistically, I should probably learn to drive anyways but I’m wondering how urgently I need to start this process.)

Many thanks for your time!"

My girlfriend [19] and I [23] are coming up on our 1 year anniversary and I’ve been having some doubts creeping up over the past couple of months. 

We started dating when she was 18 and I was 22. I asked her out because of her maturity, her nerdiness, and how different she was (she dresses somewhat goth, while I’m a bit more hipsterish). At the time, we both lived in northen rural Indiana, and I appreciated that she dresses differently in a place where everyone is the same. We were both Christians at the time, but about 5 months in I became an atheist. She had similar doubts and was actually just going to church due to her family. She was also coincidentally a questioning Christian and became an atheist after I did.

About five months in, we lost our virginities to each other. I grew up in a VERY conservative home, and she was even my first kiss. Sucks, but that’s just how it was for me. 

We’ve never really been in any sort of fight. Sure, we’ve had some disagreements from time to time, but nothing serious. 

In July, I moved two hours away to Indianapolis for a better job. My previous job paid horribly and I was incredibly unhappy. I’m in IT and Security and there was little opportunity in the area, so I moved for the job. Of which I love now. We discussed and felt it was the best choice at the time. 

She started online schooling and has an internship that has kept her very busy. So busy that when we see each other every two-three weeks she is so exhausted that she shuts down and becomes very quiet. 

She hasn’t been able to come to my apartment in three months due to studying, work, and exams. We haven’t had real sex since I left, and every time we are together, it’s me coming up to her house. She lives with her a parents so we can only hand/mouth stuff in the back of my car because her parents are also very conservative and we simply can’t do anything in her house. 

Now that I’ve moved down to Indy, I have this creeping feeling that I want to pick up other girls because I feel like I missed out on that due to how I was raised. I used to be insanely attracted to her to, but now I feel I have to force myself to be attracted to her. She’s my first real relationship, and going through a religious change in the middle of it has given me new desires I didn’t expect. 

We’ve discussed having an open relationship where we can have sex with others, but no intimacy. She’s bisexual and she wants to have another sexual experience with another girl. I don’t have a problem with that, but what if I pick up some chick on tinder, we have meaningless sex, and sex with my girlfriend isn’t enough? I fantasize about being with other girls more than I ever did, and I even fantasize about relationships, not just sex.

I’m at her house now for the holidays and she has just shut down completely. She struggles with depression and self-harm. Which I certainly don’t blame her for, but she refuses to go to counseling because she thinks it won’t do anything. This week she told me she started cutting again. When we alone today and making out, I felt the cuts on her breasts. 
I just don’t even know to process that right now. 

To top that off, she told me that she feels she has little meaning and she wants to re-explore Christianity again to find meaning. The people in her life she wants to be like are Christians and all seem to be fulfilled, why wouldn’t she want that too? It’s tough because I strongly disagree, but we may not see eye-to-eye as much as we used to. We went from questioning Christians, to atheists, and now she may go back because her life feels meaningless in the span of a year. 

I’ve wanted to stay the course and get through this tough patch. She is planning on moving to Indy next year to get away from her parents and so she can coach volleyball once last time in her home town. Once she moves it might better, and once she graduates it might be better too. Problem is, there are days when I feel like I’m missing out on enjoying life waiting around for our relationship  to “get easier”. 

She has so many great things about her. She’s funny, sarcastic, artistic (draws really well), doesn’t give a fuck about others opinions, loves nerdy things like me, and is a really loyal person. But her mental health is really messed up at times. She doesn’t value herself at all, and I wish she could she how great she is. 

I know this is a lot, but I could really use some advice. I have no non-religious support in my life right now."

Finals are rolling around for me in college and I'm in a program that has both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering courses called Computer Engineering. 

I have generally okay grades, but I got a zero on my last assignment despite hours and hours of effort. This dropped me a letter grade, and I went from an A to a C+ as a result. I have another one due this week and I just can't bring myself to work on anything. At all. I've made it this far and normally I can shake myself out of it but I can't bring myself to care and I'm so tired of constantly trying and still failing so much. 

I've worked a lot during college too, and I just quit one of my jobs to try and make time for myself. But it hasn't helped yet.  I'm paying for college on my own and no one else I know has to struggle with that. 

My friends are okay with just C grades, but because of my scholarship I can't get anything lower than a B+. I don't feel very supported ever in my major, and everyone thinks I am smart but I just work really really hard. 

I love my major. I love programming and engineering and all of it. I love math and engineering projects.  This is where I want to be! And I have an internship this summer that I can't wait to start, but the failures make me worry I won't perform very well. 

My love for my major isn't helping me and while I think my assignments are fascinating the idea of opening them up and working on them stresses me out a lot.

I also keep getting stuck with making PowerPoints and posters for my project groups because my teammates work on all the coding and hardware parts without me. It's like the only part I can contribute is the PowerPoint parts because no one communicates. 

In general I'm frustrated and angry. 

What do you all do when you feel like giving up? Have you ever just failed because you're tired of trying? What should I do? How did you get through it? 

I will appreciate any advice."

That's what drives my ideas for any kind of fun we can write and have together! If you're reading this after the first minutes of posting, please say hi! I'm always interested in meeting new DPP ladies!

As always, I have a selection of ideas that fit the theme of safe hands, feel free to make your own suggestions!

***The Trusted Touch***: Being the best friend has it's perks. I'm the girl who's always there when you try on those new jeans in the fitting room and they need a tug, or that bathing suit top won't stretch right. I'm always there to lend aid, even if it is a little odd to be so intimately involved.

***The Touch You Crave***: There is that someone in your life who you just need to feel touch you. The intern at work, that favorite bartender who you sit and chat with for most of her shift, that person you live with, whoever she may be. She is who you want, and who you crave.

***The Professional's Touch***: Massages, a sweet nurse, your own personal trainer. Touch is key to their work, and every now and then you find yourself weak to their touch. Your fantasy is within reach when you admit to who's hands you want to feel!

Those are the ideas! *Come drop me a line, tell me your name and the last song you listened to!* Reddit PMs highly preferred and please be 18+, just like me, so we can engage in some consensual touching between adults"

I did some searching within the subreddit but I couldn’t find someone with a similar situation, so I thought I would post. I’m a college student and will be doing an internship soon. The recruiter told me I’d be making several plane ticket/hotel purchases myself (and reimbursed later), so I’m looking at applying for a second credit card to get some points/cash back for those purchases. 

My annualized income would be ~$44,700. I also have about $10,000 saved up. My only credit card is the Discover Student Cash Back card with a $1,700 credit limit, which I’ve had for a year and a half. I think the short length of my credit history, however good, is what will hurt me the most when applying. I’ve never missed a payment, carry very low balances (&lt; 15%), and always pay in full. Discover says my FICO score is 778. I’m also an authorized user on my dad’s credit card. Paid on time every month, $20k limit. Not sure if that matters, but it does appear on my credit report which I got from annualcreditreport.com 

I’m looking at the Chase Sapphire Preferred, mainly because I think I can hit $4,000 in the first three months to get the sign up bonus of 60,000 points. However, I think getting approved is not very likely considering my credit profile. The AMEX Green would be an alternative. I’ve also considered the Citi Double Cash to get 2% back on everything Discover doesn’t offer 5% back on. What are some other good cards I should consider? Or should I just stick to my Discover card and request a credit limit increase?"

She lives with her a parents so we can only hand/mouth stuff in the back of my car because her parents are also very conservative and we simply can’t do anything in her house. 

Now that I’ve moved down to Indy, I have this creeping feeling that I want to pick up other girls because I feel like I missed out on that due to how I was raised. I used to be insanely attracted to her to, but now I feel I have to force myself to be attracted to her. She’s my first real relationship, and going through a religious change in the middle of it has given me new desires I didn’t expect. 

We’ve discussed having an open relationship where we can have sex with others, but no intimacy. She’s bisexual and she wants to have another sexual experience with another girl. I don’t have a problem with that, but what if I pick up some chick on tinder, we have meaningless sex, and sex with my girlfriend isn’t enough? I fantasize about being with other girls more than I ever did, and I even fantasize about relationships, not just sex.

I’m at her house now for the holidays and she has just shut down completely. She struggles with depression and self-harm. Which I certainly don’t blame her for, but she refuses to go to counseling because she thinks it won’t do anything. This week she told me she started cutting again. When we alone today and making out, I felt the cuts on her breasts. 
I just don’t even know to process that right now. 

To top that off, she told me that she feels she has little meaning and she wants to re-explore Christianity again to find meaning. The people in her life she wants to be like are Christians and all seem to be fulfilled, why wouldn’t she want that too? It’s tough because I strongly disagree, but we may not see eye-to-eye as much as we used to. We went from questioning Christians, to atheists, and now she may go back because her life feels meaningless in the span of a year. 

I’ve wanted to stay the course and get through this tough patch. She is planning on moving to Indy next year to get away from her parents and so she can coach volleyball once last time in her home town. Once she moves it might better, and once she graduates it might be better too. Problem is, there are days when I feel like I’m missing out on enjoying life waiting around for our relationship  to “get easier”. 

She has so many great things about her. She’s funny, sarcastic, artistic (draws really well), doesn’t give a fuck about others opinions, loves nerdy things like me, and is a really loyal person. But her mental health is really messed up at times. She doesn’t value herself at all, and I wish she could she how great she is. 

I know this is a lot, but I could really use some advice. I have no non-religious support in my life right now.

TL;DR The 2-hour difference in location, less sex, her exhaustion, little meaningful interactions, and her lack of personal mental health (cutting and depression without seeking help) is negatively affecting the relationship."
