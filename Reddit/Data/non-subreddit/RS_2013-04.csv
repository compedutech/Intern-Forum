1bfe3o,37,2013-04-01,"Miranda Jane born January 27th! Wow, this is a late birth story...",AfterTowns,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1bfe3o/miranda_jane_born_january_27th_wow_this_is_a_late/,"This little munchkin was born on a Sunday morning after a pretty delightful labour.  I'm not even joking. Sorry for the wall of text!  

Friday (Jan 25) was a very silly day.  We had been given a gift card from hubs parents to buy a washer and dryer as a Christmas present.  Sears had delivered the dryer the week before, but there was no washer to be found and our old ones had already been sold.  So, I spent most of Friday doing laundry at my parents' house.  My cat was also throwing up a lot and I'd made a vet appointment for him that afternoon.  We were *also* picking up a futon that day (can anyone say 'nesting'?) as my parents had given us money for Christmas instead of presents.  So, what happens that afternoon, just as I'm leaving my parents' house to pick up the cat?  My water breaks.  Awesome.  Actually, I peed, stood up and kept peeing (something that had started happening in the last week or so and I was used to by now) I hoped it would stop in a second, like it had before, but either way I had a panty liner on and was in a rush, so out the door I went.  I took my dad's truck and as I'm driving down the freeway, I fart (you guys are getting all the details!) and a BIG gush of water soaks my jeans.  Thankfully it didn't get on the upholstery.  So, I get home, call the vet, tell them I'll be late and change my pants putting on a much heavier pad and throwing the cat in the truck.  

Turns out the cat is fine.  He was allergic to the antibiotics given to him and the vet just tells me since there was only a day or two left, to just stop the antibiotics.  Okay, cool.  Time to pick up husband and futon.  I text my doula and tell her what's going on and she confirms that those were almost definitely my water breaking and that I should take it easy.  Cool.  So, with angry cat and slushee in hand, I text my husband, telling him my water broke.  He's a little annoyed, as am I.  This is the wrong day for waters to break!  We've got too much shit to do!  

Pick up the futon and we're helped by first-day-in-the-warehouse guy.  It takes him upwards of 45 minutes to find the futon. We get home an hour after hubs gets off work.  He runs out to the store and grabs all sorts of deli foods for labour and when he gets home, we finally both smile and relax. 

 Friday night; my contractions started around the time warehouse guy got lost looking for our futon, a couple hours after my water broke.  We both go to bed and I sleep as much as I can, getting up every couple hours to have a really hot shower, do some stretching, and get some water on my back.  I think I had about 5 showers from 10pm - 8am.  

Saturday morning, I text my SIL who is also a chiropractor who specializes in prenatal patients.  She tells us to come by after clinic hours and she adjusts me and talks about the wonder of life and birth and all that.  I'm not a sappy person but I smile because, to be honest, labouring is kind of awesome and I'm just feeling so excited and good at that point. We stop by my parents' house because I'd left my keys there and they invite us in for lunch, but we don't want to let on that I'm in labour, so we tell them we've already had lunch and are in a rush.  

We head off to the mall because I want to walk through my contractions but it's Canada and January so inside the mall it is.  I have a MASSIVE burrito and it tastes awesome.  We both talk about feeling like it's our honeymoon all over again and we end up going to the grocery store in the mall and buying more deli food.  My contractions are starting to pick up and we get stuck behind this very annoyed woman in line who insists all her food that's just been rung through needs to be switched to the customer service desk because she can't reach the debit machine.  I remember leaning over the counter having a contraction while she's bitching out the manager and just thinking, ""Man, I never used my pregnancy to get special treatment.  Maybe I should do that now?  Nah.."" I was seriously on a labour high at that point.

So, we get back home and labour is still going, but slowly.  We hang out while I have contractions and around 9 pm, SIL comes over again to adjust me.  Hubs says that after she leaves, he'll take the dog for a run since things seem to be going pretty slowly still.  Cool.  Little do either of us know, but she's triggered some points on me that significantly kick my labour into high gear. The feeling of her adjusting me was crazy.  I could actually feel the baby's head 'clunking' lower into my pelvis.   I go back to bed after she leaves and wake up at 10:15 with DELIGHTFUL contractions.  I text hubs from bed to find out where he was.  He was still running the dog and had his phone turned off.  

He gets back and we decide bed is the best place to labour.  I lay down and he sits beside me on the floor.  Every 10 minutes, I wake up with a good contraction and he does some hip squeezes.  If your birth coach doesn't know these, make sure they know them.  They were great.  I start talking about going to the hospital and labouring in one of their massive bathtubs.  We text the doula some more, but we're doing well on our own so it's only when I mention that yes, I'm ready to go to the hospital and we'll meet her there that she tells us to wait and she'll come meet us at the house.  

She gets there 2:30 am and I'm half naked, laying in bed and moaning from the contractions.  I get a thought that ""Hey, I must be in transition because I've lost my modesty!  I'm almost done!"" but don't worry too much about that and instead tell everyone I want to puke.  We only stick around at home for a little while longer and at 3:12 (I checked) we leave the house for the hospital while I'm yelling my fool head off.  

We get to the hospital and I go straight to the head of the line.  Finally, I get to take advantage of this preggo stuff, but I'm too far gone to care by now.  We get to assessment and I have 5 fucking people ask me the same 4 fucking questions time after time.  I start gutterally yelling at one poor intern who starts asking me the same questions while I'm having a contraction.  He leaves after the third question is shouted down and we never see him again.  (Ha!) When I'm finally given a cervix check, after telling them that I have an urge to push and them telling me that I'm not 'allowed' to push and then my body trying to push anyways a few times while I'm on my side, they tell me that the baby has lots of hair and that I'm ""9+ cms dilated.""

So, off to the delivery room I go!  By the time I'm up on the table, I'm 10 cms and ready to push.  I get two contractions where I push a couple times each and after the second, the doctor tells me that the baby's heart rate is going a little slow and that if I don't push her out on the next contraction, she'll have to ""help"" me.  I know what that means and I don't want an epesiotomy, forceps or vaccuum extraction.  The time between the second and third contraction, the room has so many people in it, but it's very quiet and I stare at the ceiling and thank whatever power is letting me have a break from the contractions.  It was actually a really powerful and serene moment and I felt close to something.  I don't want to say God because I'm an atheist, but it was something powerful.  Anyways, I just want to say ""I'm sorry"" to all you ladies who have to labour under pitocin because I've heard that you don't get breaks from your contractions and I can't imagine going through that.  It sounds like hell.  

The third contraction I pushed her out (the only push that hurt because they encouraged me so much and told me to push more than I was comfortable with) and she was born!  I just want to say, holy crap.  I was confused.  There was a baby inside me this whole time?  I knew that there was a *theoretical* baby there, but an actual baby, that cries and breathes air and flails around and is covered in gore?  What the fuck.  

It was an awesome experience.  Got a second degree internal tear (something I'm sure I got from the third contraction), but I'm healing nicely and Miranda, a very real, very sweet and laid back baby, is here and, I'm sorry to everyone else, but I got the cutest baby.

1bea4d,0,2013-03-31,Is there any reason to stay here?,[deleted],nyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1bea4d/is_there_any_reason_to_stay_here/,"Growing up, I feel like NYC was always presented as this wonderful place that everyone dreamed of living.  The best of everything was here and it was the only city that really mattered.

Now that I've been in NYC for just about 3 years, I just can't make excuses anymore: this place sucks, seriously.

-Subways blow.  Unless you have immaculate timing, you'll have to wait 5-20 minutes just to GET ON the train, and god forbid if you have to make a transfer or two.  People complain about car traffic in big cities, but I feel like I can't get anywhere outside of my neighborhood in less than 20-30 minutes, which could get me halfway across a city like Houston in a car.  

-Nobody you meet lives here.  Everyone I seem to meet is a tourist from the midwest/Europe, a bridge and tunnel person from Jersey/LI, or lives in some weird off-the-wall part of the city that is painful to get to (Red Hook, Bed Stuy, Crown Heights, Harlem).  In 3 years, I have not been able to find a single person that lives local to me and I've lived in the West Village, East Village, and Williamsburg.  FFS, they were supposed to be the most happening parts of the city, but NO ONE LIVES HERE, well, except for cunty old ladies on rent control that will gladly chew you out for making a peep after 8 PM.

-Jobs are total bullshit.  Somehow, everyone just decided that they were doing you a favor by giving you an internship that doesn't even pay enough to buy groceries.  Everyone I know in this city has either a menial job or a virtually unpaid internship.  The only people I know that seem to make any real money here are in finance, but they work so much, they could live virtually anywhere and not even know the difference.  Of the one real job I've had (engineering), I was treated like shit and paid a salary that was mediocre by midwest standards.  I tried starting my own freelance business, but everyone is so fucking broke here I can't get anyone willing to pay enough for it to be worth it.

-There's nothing to do.  I can't think of anything that's here that isn't present in other large cities.  The highline is the biggest load of horseshit non-attraction I have ever seen in my life.  There's just bars and restaurants (which are in ANY city and good ones in any large city) and parks, but why the hell would you move to a dense city to go to a park?  There's some cool events at the Javits center, but for the money you'd saving living somewhere else, it makes more sense just to fly in every once in a while.

-Holy shit is it dirty.  This city is the grimiest place on the planet.  I fear a piece of diseased ceiling paint will fall on me every time I go into the subway.  Everything is in such disrepair from the 70's and can't be fixed because the city is built on top of itself and it's too hard to shut anything down long enough for meaningful repairs.

-Mom n pop shops suck.  People tout how great NYC is for rejecting Wal-Mart, etc., but I'd take a Wal-Mart over these awful overpriced mom n pop shops that have crap inventory.  I feel like finding some of the most basic life essentials becomes a city-wide scavenger hunt to get the brand you actually want.  Let's not even get into how bad it sucks to haul shit back to your apartment, either.

-Not having a car blows.  I know some people don't like driving, but I'm not one of those people.  Being out in the world without a car makes me feel basically homeless.  A car is like a portable lock box for all of your ""rainy day"" supplies like a sweatshirt, umbrella, etc.  Left the house and realized you didn't need a jacket? tough shit, you're carrying it ALL GOD DAMN DAY.  Want to go to the beach?  Hopefully no one will jack the wallet and phone stuffed into your shoes since you can't put it in a car to lock it up.

-No one dates.  I thought the idea of random hook ups would rock, but having a basically set-in-stone policy of ""one date and then I'll never speak to you again"" is fucking annoying after a while.  I don't want to get married right now, but someone I can see more than once would be nice.  The only people I know with girlfriends moved to the city while they were dating already.  Then again, considering how fucked out the rent situation is and how no one seems to live in a remotely convenient neighborhood, that probably has something to do with it.  Oh, and I swear if I meet another gold-digging ""artist""/non-profit worker making $20,000/yr looking for a guy to buy them out of their $100,000 debt...

-Central A/C, what is that?  Nothing sucks more than a New York summer where you have to trudge outdoors in 90+ degree weather only to wait in an EVEN HOTTER subway in hopes that your train might have an ever-so-slight bit of climate control.  Even restaurants and bars barely have even a shitty window unit that is about to fall apart any minute.  The South might be hot, but at least they know how to install a god damn A/C unit.  Oh, and the few places that do have A/C will politely drop condensation on your head to make sure your hair gets disgusting fungus drops in it.

-The rent.  I don't know why it took me so long to get to this one, this is probably the #1 problem in the city.  The price of living here compared to the quality of life is like a 3rd world country.  A $4,000 apartment here would be $600/month anywhere else in the US just about (excluding San Fran and parts of LA I guess).  Oh, what's that? you wanted to do laundry in your own apartment? Fuck that, gotta haul that shit down the street to a laundromat or MAYBE your basement if you're lucky, well, that is of course if someone else in your building hasn't already hogged all of the machines.  Rent is also largely responsible for horrible business arrangements that underpay and have you elbow to elbow with co-workers instead of, gee, I dunno, an office or even a cubicle.



So, have I nailed it?  Have I finally removed the rose-tinted glasses from my eyes to see the truth?  You can throw some tired saying about ""making it in New York"" or ""You just can't hang"", but then I'd just have to inform you that you have come down with a severe case of Stockholm syndrome.  It's one thing to have a professionally difficult life to enjoy a spectacular personal one, but I feel like this city just works you to the bone and gives you shit on a shingle in return.

Am I wrong?  I'd love to hear any valid counterpoints to what I've said that proves NYC to be worth a single damn."

1bjqhm,6,2013-04-02,"Thoughts on how we got to where we are today. (A two-part essay by me, YoungCubSaysWoof.)",YoungCubSaysWoof,gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1bjqhm/thoughts_on_how_we_got_to_where_we_are_today_a/,"**Full disclosure: A friend writes columns for this magazine, and I've met some of the people that work there.**

So I made a [post earlier on]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1bjeb8/from_civil_disobedience_to_civil_unions_40_years/), and a little bit later, I got the chance to go back and read through it. So as I'm sitting here, reading through the article and smoking this J (cuz that's how I do), I noticed something. [Go back to it](http://outfrontonline.com/focus/features-focus/from-civil-disobedience-to-civil-unions-40-years-of-colorado-lgbt-activism/) and look back at the era of the 80's and 90's; kind of thin, right? It could be a variety of things that led to more coverage for the 00's and 10's; more stories, writers' decisions, research limitations (though this is comprehensive), the demographics dilemma (by readers/writers' age), deadlines, etc. It could have been a myriad of things, right? Right.

What I am interested in, is the thought that the limitations are due to a lack of documentation of LGBT history.  Namely, the oral history of our people.  

Think about it; before writing, mankind learned our history through stories. Your parents probably have laid one or two on you before, if not your grandparents. These stories revealed our family to us: who they were, what happened on that day, and stories that fill the range of emotions. Think about it also from a cultural stand-point, too. How many of your family members are good at something? Woodwork, singing, hunting, painting, numbers, poker, guitar, child care, cooking, or whatever it is. How have they shared that gift with friends and family? Maybe they were even able to have a small business, and they opened up a store, owned and operated by the LGBT community. How cool is that?! That coffee shop? Gay owned. That hardware store? Also gay owned! Apprentice, internships, and part-time jobs in a safe environment are possible for the LGBT youth and young professionals. These are big words to announce! We’re movin’ on up!

Now, lets bring this home and speak directly to and about us gay and bisexual teens and men here. Even though I can’t see you, raise your hand if you’ve ever had sex with a man that was at least 20 years older than you were/are. *Come on! Get them up! My hand is raised!* OK, how about a man at least 10 years older than you were/are? *This would be a fun poll!* So now, most of you.  OK, hands down.

Think of one of those men. Remember him. How did he laugh? What was his full name? What was he like as a lover? As a boyfriend, or a spouse? Do you remember his smile? 

Do you have that picture in your head? Good! 

Now, kill him off.

* AIDS has hit your neighborhood.

* Do it. It’s 1981, and he got infected. Within six months, pneumonia will have gotten the shell that was once him.

* Everyone's asking, 'why are we getting sick?! We've been healthy this whole time?!'

* Your political leaders are watching you all die, and they aren't doing a damn thing about it.

I can’t make you feel it, but I hope those words hit. It’s like our semi just met a concrete wall in a head-on collision, and the semi losing… bad.

Imagine the wake, the funeral. See him, lying in his casket. Only dead people lay in caskets. He's dead now; you’ll never touch, see, or hear from him again. Feel your anger rise as the priest carries on and on about how merciful god is, as you seethe with tears, questioning why god would take this man away from you. Your mind floods with memories, and you cry harder.

See the people in black. Hug one of them, feel their body jump as they’re sobbing. Ask them how they are, and listen as they lie to you as they tell you the auto-pilot answer of, **“I’m good.”** Look at the other people there; why is the strong-man looking gaunt? He *was* 6”1 ft., 225 lbs. of stacked daddy muscle; now he’s 155 and getting thinner. Look at the couple over there; you don’t know them, but they’re holding hands tightly, and one of them looks like he could go any day now.

It’s raining in Denver this day… The gay coffee shop is closed. The owner? Dead. In a year, the hardware store shutters its doors, too. And you went to both funerals, plus four more that spring. Your neighborhood is changing; it was once male gay-borhood. Now, it’s less populated. Over the years, it’ll give way to an influx of women, just like what happened in Fire Island.

That dystopian view, was what a gay man in his mid-50’s shared with me over coffee. That was life back then for our people. And it connected the dots for me…

***Our gay and bi male community is seen as youth-centric, because we lost our elders.***

We lost the guys we could look up to as mentors, friends, helpers, lovers, role models and heroes. We lost our small business owners; our woodworkers, painters, entrepreneurs, and guitar-playing friends.  If you’re in ANY way interested in politics, think of how many LGBT leaders we could have now [at the federal level]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_first_LGBT_holders_of_political_offices_in_the_United_States), rather than the paltry number of 10. Our young LGBT people lost a spectrum of different men whom they could confide in, those that had been through the wringer of coming out. The guys to share your story with, the dudes you’d grab a drink or a smoke with, who’d let you crash on their couch (without trying to bang ya), the guys you could be yourself around, are dead.

Is it any wonder that so many of us felt *so* ***alone*** when we were trying to come out??? 

That’s because we literally were.

1bji9z,5,2013-04-02,Possible Incoming Freshmen Questions?,bowei006,VirginiaTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1bji9z/possible_incoming_freshmen_questions/,"Hello, I have been admitted to Tech as University Studies this fall and am thinking about coming here.
I live about 600 miles away in CT so this is a big decision for me and yes I did visit Tech a few months ago.
I want to transfer into Computer Engineering.
Thank you very much for your time.

1. As my 'home home' is very far away. What will I be able to do during breaks when the halls aren't open? What do you guys do? 

2. Is it worth it to spend about 10,000 more a year to come to Tech as opposed to my state college? I hear most say that undergrad may not be worth it. But with a scholarship and aid, its not that much more expensive. 

3. How are the internship opportunities? Another college I am looking at has companies already lined up for you to intern at and later maybe work for. College is what you make out of it, but I'm not really the kind to be pro active in looking for a job. Blacksburg also feels VERY isolated from the rest of the world kind of. How do job oppurtunities 'pop up' or even internship ones? Is Tech one of those schools where companies will 'just' come? The open house made it seem like that. What is the actual situation here?

4. What will one do for fun? I didn't explore the surrounding area much but comming from the suburbs where city like locations are a short drive away, Blacksburg and its area felt very alone.

5. Do you guys like it here?

6. What is with the ludicrous computer tablet($1,000 swivel touch screen laptop)requirement? I know you can just get a cheap USB writer as I heard most classes will never use it but why keep it?

7. Would it be easy to go from Univ. Studies and get into the engineering department? Freshmen year isn't very major prone classes I know but I am a bit fearful I may not 'make' it in.

Thank you all very much. This and Umass Amherst are my top descisions. Thank you."

1bjcyo,1,2013-04-02,[Update] My recent ex[22m] still wants to have a friendship with me[20f]. (x-post from r/relationships).,stunningpocketrocket,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1bjcyo/update_my_recent_ex22m_still_wants_to_have_a/,"So I'm just going to copy+paste what I had written in /r/relationships and add my update down at the bottom.

This past Tuesday, my live in (now ex) boyfriend of 2 and a half years decided we should break up. Now from my perspective, it came out of nowhere. There were no sudden changes, no fights about anything, and there wasn't anything that should be considered a warning sign or an alarm that things were starting to go bad. He sat me down after he picked me up from work, and opened with, ""I'm moving to San Francisco.""


I laughed and replied with, ""Yeah, next year with me right?"" and he just looked at me and shook his head.


""No, two months from now.""


Now, we had just gotten over a long distance thing because I had an internship in NYC for about 3 months and we decided to stay together because it was only temporary. I thought it was just going to be another long distance thing until I was done with my year at work and I could go up with him.


He then said, with tears in his eyes and his voice wavering, ""I'm breaking up with you, stunningpocketrocket.""He explained that for the past two months, he felt his love for me was dying and that he tried to find it again, but he couldn't. I asked him when he decided it was over for us, and he said about two weeks ago. Of course, I'm devastated because I honestly felt that nothing was dying. We were still showing affection for each other, we'd kiss each other goodnight and say I love you and just did what we normally did as a couple, such as go on dates and such. We were both sitting there, crying and holding each other because we realized it was over.


However, I'm still totally in love with him. I know that time will heal my pain, and there is no telling where the future goes for both of us. The dilemma for me is that he said, word for word, ""You're still one of the most important people in my life and I still want to be friends."" He's still very important to me, but for me to move on, I need to cut off contact with him. Some of his stuff is still in my apartment, and I keep telling him that he needs to get it, but he keeps putting it off. He keeps disregarding that rule I set up for us after we sorted everything out, and is contacting me occasionally. Truthfully, I haven't been following the rule myself and have contacted him, but I was inebriated for those times. The thing that confuses me the most out of all of this is that this is the first time I have ever seen him cry. He never really shows any emotions other than irritation, happiness, or being tired, so it really threw me off. It's making me feel that he doesn't really want to go through with this decision, but I don't want to give myself false hope.


**TL;DR** My boyfriend dumped me and says he doesn't love me anymore, but says that i'm still very important to him and that he wants to be my best friend, leaving me confused, sad, and angry.


So what do I do? I feel we have another shot in the future, although it is a very slim chance and I'm not counting on it because anything can happen. However, I don't know if I want to continue being friends with him right now.



**UPDATE**: I sent him one last goodbye email telling him not to contact me and that I still love him and miss him, but I'm giving him the space he needs. I told him I'd contact him when I thought I'd be ready to be friends again. That was 3 days ago. Today when I'm at work, he's coming over to pick his stuff up. In my head I ended up convincing myself that things would be better between us and he just needed to cool off, but now that he's getting his stuff, it's finally settling in that he's not coming back, not for a while at least.

 It doesn't help that I have people that are mutual friends with him giving me updates on how he is. His new roommate's girlfriend texted me, saying that he hasn't been sleeping much, or saying much, or doing much of anything and that she hears him cry sometimes at night. I keep asking myself, *Why did he break up with me if he's going through this much pain as well?* Yesterday, I visited my old roommate that used to live with me and my ex when we were still together. I thought it would help, and he'd try to cheer me up, but all he did was ask how I was doing and talk about my ex. We ended up wandering around downtown and mistakenly walked past my ex's work. I saw him in the window and he saw me and smiled, but it looked like he was in pain. I went home that night, alone, and drank and cried as I talked to my old roommate over the phone. We pointed out the bad things that happened when I was still together with my ex, hoping it would make the pain lessen, but really it just made me feel stupid for falling for him. I feel like he's been so out of character lately, and this isn't what he'd do, but it was all his choice. It was his decision to leave me, and if he's in pain because of it, that's his fault. He told me himself I did nothing wrong, so I feel that once he realizes that, he might come back. And the fact that I don't know what I'd do if that ever happens scares me. Everything that's happening recently is confusing me and it's really making me feel like there's a chance we can work it out. But really, I just need to focus on myself and I don't know how since I've only ever known how to put others' needs before my own.

I don't have a question this time. I just needed to rant and hopefully get support and advice."
1bj5of,15,2013-04-02,[Request][53704] Heart broken and crushed. Boyfriend left me with bills and an empty stomach,MuffinTin,Food_Pantry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Food_Pantry/comments/1bj5of/request53704_heart_broken_and_crushed_boyfriend/,"I apologize ahead of time for the length, but I truly believe that without knowing the situation it might be hard to understand what on earth is going on (not to mention it makes me feel better).

Yesterday morning I woke up in an empty bed.  It's not unusual, my boyfriend of three years is usually at work by the time I get up as I work from home and he works 1st shift. What was weird was the lack of clothing in his dresser, his laptop was gone and several of my necklaces were missing from my open jewelry box.

I called him immediately assuming, perhaps stupidly, that we were robbed while I slept early in the morning. No answer.  I, stupidly, didn't call the police right away hoping that I could get ahold of my boyfriend and he would help me out.  At about 10 AM I got a text from my bank saying that funds had been withdrawn (we do this because we have a joint account for bills so we know when certain things are paid, etc).  Only this time it wasn't $100-$200, but the entire balance of the account $2,600 or so, mostly of my money which I recently received from a stipend for an internship I did.

Then I knew. He left me. Later that afternoon I called his parents who hadn't seen him and told them what happened. They had always been kind but suddenly they seemed cold and offstandish. I assume he made up some story about how I cheated or something. In reality I am a hardworking individual starting my own business selling vintage items and clothing and working with at-risk kids for a local non-profit business. I love (still do unfortunately) my ex dearly and recently moved here to accomodate his want to live near home.  Even though I work from home I clean the house, have dinner cooked every night, care for our garden and animals and budget money very well to afford small camping trips to places my ex enjoyed or nights out at his favorite places.

I haven't heard from him since and have filed a police report for the missing jewelry.  I went through his history on my laptop (which he uses when his is upstairs and mine is in reach) and found vaguely fishy usage on okcupid.com which is where we met three years ago and pages that link to a locked bank account profile at another bank that he never told me about (which I have no problem with except that's probably where my money is now).

I have no way to get funds currently, no family in the area (my mother lives about six hours away and is not in any shape to help me out), and I'm utterly devastated. 

So here I am, with rent to pay, utility and cell bills calling my bank and trying to figure out how this happened (I'm a fucking idiot that's how).  I have about $8.00 to my name until I get money from my e-commerce business which means I need to be able to sell stuff and spring is slow for me. I have a little food in the fridge but I haven't been shopping in two weeks or so and thursday is my usual shopping day. 

I am willing to provide any details, proof, etc you need and can even provide you will a listing of vintage items if you are interested in purchase. I know it's embarrassing to have to ask, but the soonest I will have more money is likely April or later and, honestly, I'm so overwhelmed even now all I can do is lay down with my dog and cry into his fur.  

I don't know what to do, Reddit. Not only would I sincerely appreciate funding for food through walmart or grocery store gift cards or however it might for you, but stories, words of encouragement or advice would really make my life a little bit better now.

TL;DR: Boyfriend left me in the worst of ways. Stole my money, jewelry, and self-esteem. Food and/or advice welcome.

I just wanted to share this with you since we need more happy here and I don't really have many people to tell.

Due to some family issues, I dropped out of high school at 16 and got my GED. I bounced around community college for awhile while trying to decide what I wanted to do, and finally got my AS so that I could transfer into the school I really wanted to go to.

It's been a tough few years - but I just accepted a well-paying  8 month internship as an information security analyst! There are very few women in my major, and it's been a constant challenge to be taken seriously. I have been told by several group members that before seeing my work, they'd assumed I had just flirted my way through my programming courses. It's sort of soul crushing to hear that about something you're actually passionate about and I started to doubt if I'd even hear back from employers.

Turns out, I received 2 fantastic offers and accepted the best one. I'll be doing security policies, intrusion detection and some network forensics work. When I graduate and have to look for a permanent job, I won't be so self-conscious anymore.

Don't worry fellow tech ladies - we can kick ass too. :)

Columbia's CS program is a little lacking compared to CMU's, but ultimately I just want to go where I will have a good college experience, learn a lot, and have a good solid foundation in CS by the time I graduate so that I can either work or go on to grad school.

I was involved in a road accident in July 2012 where I was hit by a car whilst jogging.
The accident broke the cars wind-screen and dented the bonnet slightly.

Since the accident I have been constantly pestered by the driver's lawyers asking me to pay 6000EUR! for damages to the car.  I was sent a mechanics bill where it shows that the driver had everything replaced.  Wheels, mirrors, bumpers, all windows etc. Damage that was not caused by me.

I was advised to ignore any approaches they made asking for money, however in the past few days my bank account has been frozen and I have been told that unless I pay I can not enter my account.

Does anyone know of an English speaking lawyers I could get in touch with or perhaps is familiar enough with German law to advise me on what I should do.  

I'm conducting an internship here and the amount they are asking for is my entire savings from working in Germany.

Thank you for your help.

It's been 11 months of LDR fun for me and my SO. We see each other every 4-6 weeks for two days at a time (a week at most, one time). We went to college together and dated for 2.5 years before I took a job 7 hours away. She is now graduating soon and is looking for work in my area.

The Rant:
I just want her to get fucking hired. Somewhere, anywhere. But she can't get a break to save her life. She has to do an internship within her course study (hospitality, tourism, event planning) but everywhere she applies she gets some bullshit answer or let down. She applied to the internship program I got hired into. Denied. Requests transfers from the hotel she currently works at? Oh they aren't hiring until Mid-May and wont do interviews until that time. Other Hotels in the area? Nah. we aren't hiring. Another position at the Hotel I work at? You have to come in for a personal interview on a weekday. 

Seriously, this shouldn't be that hard. I'm sick just thinking of the fact of having to do the same bullshit routine every month because she might not be able to move here. I can't just pack up my shit and leave. I'm established and like where I work, plus I'm in a lease that I can barely afford because I'm expecting her to move in with me. 

Then, on top of all this bullshit of her trying to find a job, her dickhead roommate is calling her a dumb bitch anytime he fucking gets. She turns up the heat a bit in the apartment? ""You're a dumb bitch"". One of her guests uses his bathroom accidentally. ""You're a dumb bitch and so are your friends"". Seriously, I'm so fucking tired of feeling so useless. She's stressed to the max and now I'm stressed because I feel like a leashed dog that's watching it's owner get the shit beat out of him. This distance can suck my dick, I'm tired of it. I just want it to be over and have her back again and happy. I also want her to have a good job so I can stop feeling so guilty that I'm holding her back. 

The End.

Thanks for reading. It helped a lot to just write that all of it down and get it out of my system. "

Full story inside",Immaneuel_Kanter,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/1bhy55/family_friends_are_conspiring_with_my_parents_to/,"I didn't think this story was worth posting here until *Buffy* cast members got involved, so sit back, PLounge.

With this one, my parents have been trying for years.

They've consistently attempted to set me up with girls ever since it became obvious I'm incompetent at romance. (The last time I ""picked"" one, she was a Kentucky basketball fan; this should explain everything.)

We'll be sitting at dinner, and they'll bring up some girl who commented on my Facebook wall, or the ex they loved to death, or some nice intern from my mother's public school job, or almost anything else capable of bearing human children and being a Protestant. This whole process will be over and done with after a few weeks of somewhat lovable nagging about their lack of grandbaby prospects. I'll laugh at their attempt, eat their food, drink their non-alcoholic cider, sleep in my high school bed, and drive back to university the next day. The next time it comes up, it'll be another weekend, a new girl, another fit of borderline derisive laughter, and so on.

With *this* one, though, they've been consistent. This goes beyond my college days, even beyond my high school days, back to my childhood when puberty started and my beard flowered into glorious full bloom.

Let's call her Megan McCarthy. I had met her before, when I was eight. There was great chemistry, especially considering she was told she had type-a diabetes the previous week. Really great time.

Actually, I don't remember this at all, but *my parents do*, and they assure me that she's, ""not like that anymore."" No, not the diabetes, but the not wanting to talk to anyone because you're eight and were just told you can't have cake again.

Consistently, over the years, every half year or so, they bring up this girl to ensure that the memory of my parents casually reminding me that Megan isn't a sad, angry, eight year old girl anymore and is a good marriage prospect becomes permanently fixated in my mind.

Lately, they've ramped up their efforts substantially. Over the past year, they've been reminding me about Megan, and how well she's doing in Louisiana, especially her creative writing program--you're a writer too, you'll get along so well--and she's even going to that fancy private school you *really* wanted to go to but couldn't, and, *from what her parents tell us*, your personalities are very similar, very creative and quirky. She watches *Doctor Who* too, remember that. Her parents, the McCarthys, you remember them, are so generous and kind; Mrs. McCarthy is an author; you'll get along great with them.

I grow *suspicious*. There's some future tense verbs and pronouns being thrown around *far too casually*. They're making plans. It was the first I had heard of communication between the two camps. I must be on my guard. In response to this resolve, I do the obvious solution to avoiding the situation entirely by looking up Megan on Facebook, browsing a few of her pictures and looking at her About page.

She's cute. She likes *Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *The Brave Little Toaster*. She's wearing an absurdly tall brown top hat in her profile picture.

*Really* cute. Adorable even.

I am mortified.

The next day, Mrs. McCarthy sends me a private message asking if I've ever heard of this fiction publishing conference that just so happens to be hosted in the town her, her husband, and her family live in and, wouldn't you know it, Megan is coming up from Louisiana too--you'll enjoy meeting her--and if you're able to attend we'll let you stay at our house; here's a scholarship application.

I start searching the house for the dowry. After finding nothing, I return and send her a message thanking her for her generosity and hospitality, and that I would think about it.

Later that night, my parents ask me whether I want to go to the writing conference. I hadn't told them anything about the offer.

They're all in cahoots. There's a bag on the floor and its cat is nowhere to be seen.

In that moment, sitting at the dining room table, staring at my parents, while my little sister beside me is stifling laughter, already knowing where this was going, I knew I was in too deep. So, I laughed *hard*, big booming laughs that could be heard beyond the kitchen walls.

I'm a writer. This was too ridiculous a premise to miss. I have to go through with it. It's going to be awkward. It's going to be amazing.

I fill out the application, complete with a required resume, a writing sample, and summary of literary accomplishments. I've been published once, so I don't have to write that shameful sentence: ""Seeking first publication."" Still, I'm trying to convince these people to give me around five hundred dollars. I didn't know it before I started filling this out, but this conference is kind of a *big* deal. Tons of agents, authors, and publishers are coming in from New York to Colorado just for this conference. I looked at the guest list and saw people I recognized, authors I remembered friends reading during my high school years. If I got in, these people would read my work. So, knowing I had to give it my all, when the application asked, ""Are there any other reasons why we should consider you for this scholarship?"" I answered:

&gt;My mother and father are scheming with family friends, who are attending your conference, to set me up with their daughter. If you don't help me attend, you would rob me of the greatest creative nonfiction opportunity I've ever had.

The next week, I get a reply from the scholarship committee.

I've been given a full ride.

I post the news on Facebook and within *seconds* Mrs. McCarthy posts a congratulatory comment and sends me a private message with plans to pick me up from the airport in Colorado Springs, that I wouldn't need to bring anything besides toiletries, and, since scholarship awards require volunteering for the conference, she assures me that she would assign myself, herself, and Megan to banquet room duty together.

A few days after that, Megan ""shared"" an article I posted about conditions in North Korean concentration camps. We talk a little bit about that, and we just might share some commonalities in concern for social justice.

It's been just over two weeks since then. Tonight, there was a new development. Mrs. McCarthy posted this comment on a status of mine:

&gt; Hey [Immaneuel], FYI: when I take you to the airport after the conference, we'll have a literary agent in the car (Pam van Hylckama Vlieg), and an author/actress (Amber Benson, who used to be on Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Just thought you'd want to know if you'll be conversing with them!

At the end of this story, there is going to be a car with myself, a cute girl, her mother, a literary agent, and Tara Maclay.

That's the situation I'm in, PLounge."

It was supposed to be 70 degrees today so my friends and I were set on going to the beach. We packed the necessary supplies (bowl, 2g's, eyedrops, munchies, grinder) and scooted on out. We smoked a fat bloint on the way up. I say bloint because it was way too big to be a joint, but not quite a full on blunt. All I know is it was some incredible, top notch herb. 


By the time we got to the waterfront, I'm peaking at a [9], barely able to function. It was chilly out at this point (3:00 in the afternoon), so I bundle up in a little cocoon on the beach. Total tranquillity. Eventually we walked around for a bit, got pizza and ice cream and candy, and juggled a soccer ball with some guy tweeking on crack at some sketchy makeshift carnival. At this point it starts to rain a bit, so we head out. It's 7:30 at night and I'm still coasting at a [6].


So now to the bad/scary/awsomeinretrospect part. I'm chilling in the back on the way home. We pass by a cop car on the side of the highway, but don't think much of it as we were going below the speed limit. 30 seconds later, however: blue and red lights. My biggest fear. The four of us in the car yelled a collective ""fuck!"" We pulled over quickly and tried to pull ourselves together. The girl driving nearly broke out in tears. Two cops came up, one to the driver side and the other on the passenger side. Both shined lights through the windows. The backpack with all the weed, grinder, and bowl was sitting right by the passenger seat. The cops looked around and asked for her license and registration. We still had no idea why this was happening, and being high made the anxiety 420x worse. Our lives and wellbeings were flashing before our eyes. My relationship with my parents, college plans, and summer internship all held in the balance as the one cop marched around the car with his flashlight. 

Two minutes later, the main cop comes back. 

He says, ""Your headlights were off,"" gives us the license and registration back, then goes back to his car.  

Not only did we have cannabis and drug paraphernalia, but it is also illegal in my state for someone under 18 to drive more than one non-relative. The driver was 16. That alone warranted a ticket and/or search. 

Instead we screeched on out of there, laughed nervously, and lost all composure. My whole future almost changed tonight. Be safe out there ents!"

I started crying while walking my dog, and then again as I reached for yet another beer from my fridge.

Earlier this evening when I got home from work to my filthy, smelly apartment, and started drinking again I realized I really wanted to talk to somebody. I can't talk to my family or friends, they all think stuffs been going so great the last two years and I don't want to disappoint them again.

So I thought I'd try just writing it out here. I haven't actually had any drinking problems through my life, but I have had some periods where I have been drinking too much. Not like this time though. Since late 2012 I've been drunk 2-4 times a week alone. Not going to lie, it's been fun and really creative. Though hard to hide from people at times. Not so fun tonight though. I haven't cried in a really long time.


Weird thing though. After moving to a new town two years ago I've been feeling really great. Full of self esteem, goals, funny and social, and just having a really good life as a student. I'm pretty good at what I do and landed a internship at a great place. I've been meeting some girls from time to time, actually supposed to go on a date to morrow. But starting to make up excuses for not to in my head.

I'm hiding in my room with my computer. Drinking and smoking. Smelling like shit since I haven't washed my clothes in weeks, just digging for old fresh sweaters when I have to see people. Today I ate a hotdog. My bills and debts are building up because I waste my money instead of paying them.

I should have had a better grip, and not have let my depression eat me away like this. I dropped out of one of my classes this semester too. I should have seen it coming, and I think I did. But I did nothing. I just want it all to go away and have the strength to shower, clean my dishes, pay my bills, clean my place, do some homework, go outside and meet people. Be the awesome guy I've been. Sorry to boast, but I have actually been really proud of myself before this shitty feeling came back.

Now I don't know if I'd rather die. It seems really hard, and giving up is so easy. Not going to do it myself though, but if it happened...

My head is cloudy and my hands heavy. Can't think about anything but insecurity about myself. I feel careless.

I'm currently in my junior year as a computer engineering student.  I have an internship this summer and will (hopefully) have a full time job in ~1.5 years.  I've already studied abroad and have acquired the wanderlust itch.  Once I have an actual income and a reasonable amount of debt paid, I would love to travel, so far the pre30-bucketlist includes motobike trip through Vietnam(TG fuck yeah), New Zealand, and Iceland among others.


I just can't imagine staying in those places for more than the ~2 weeks a year vacation time from work.  I get that many people in this subreddit quit their jobs etc etc but in a field as quickly moving as computer engineering, I'm certain ""I was dicking around in southeastern Asia"" isn't a very good excuse for a 1+ year gap in employment.

One option I'm considering might be to return from travelling and try my hand at Sales Engineering.  I'm already a fairly good conversationalist, and that's probably the one field that extensive travel would look good in.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I would really appreciate it if someone would respond to some of the questions I have.
I am a 3rd year biology major at a large university in the southeastern United States and I will be graduating a year from now (hopefully with a minor in entomology). My science GPA is a 3.80, overall 3.93, if that even matters, and I study like I’m going to med school (OK, maybe not THAT hard). I have enjoyed learning about the natural world since I was very young, and have wanted to become a biologist since I was 8. So far, I still want to become one, but I’m not sure yet what field to specialize in. It has been my goal to go into research and discover cool new things about ecosystems, organisms and biological solutions to people problems. At least, that is what I tell people. However, I have many worries about the future (what adolescent doesn’t). 

Since starting my undergraduate experience, I have sought out research labs to get a feel for the academic environment. I volunteered and worked two years in a forestry lab, helping a PhD student phenotype wood cores, and trying to be as involved as possible in the creative process of streamlining data collection, as well as data analysis. Currently I am volunteering in an ecology lab, looking at the ecology of tree epiphytes, after having decided forestry/forest resource management is interesting but maybe not something I want to do.

First of all, I am not sure what field I want to go into. I like entomology, mostly because bugs are easy to use/manipulate, but also because they are really cool. I like thinking about community ecology, population dynamics, solutions to problems in pest management, but also evolution and organismal ecology and behavior. What kind of thought process do I need to have to work out what I should focus on? Do I need to know yet? Does it even matter? I assume it is based on connections that you gain while working as an undergrad, that turn into internships, etc.

Second, the field of academic research scares me. I hear from people that it is a competitive, sink –or-swim part of academia. That being said, I get mixed signals for my PIs and professors. While they work hard, a lot of them have a very laid back way of approaching life and they seem happy doing their thing. As someone going to graduate school and beyond, what should I expect from starting out as a lowly graduate student? Obviously nobody starts out with tenure at a big name university, so what is life like, as a grad student doing research in prairie grass ecology (for example). Can a PhD student sustain himself and maybe a family? Or are you a stressed out sexless wreck like those medical students I keep reading about over at r/medicine. I don’t expect this to be the case, but you never know.

Third, for some reason I am very anal about things like data, and how it is collected. For example, when phenotyping wood cores, the x-ray images are very grainy, and identifying resin canals is hard. Sometimes you have to make a call and say ‘yes, I’m counting that as one’. How do you justify your research when data is collected that is so subjective. I mean I’ve heard the phrase ‘science is triangulating over multiple fallible perspectives’, but for some reason I feel like I’m just sitting there, wasting time, money and brain power. This is part of the reason why I want to probably go and do something more quantitative than assigning mites in tree foliage to a feeding guild based solely on some amateur entomology knowledge (which was the lab I’m currently in).  

So to round up my ramble, a few more questions: 
- What do I do with my life? Seriously though, how did some of you come to be where you are now, and what personal mindset/questions brought you there?

-  Do I need to stop bitching about data, and just get with the phenotyping?

- How do I academia? Seriously, at what point do people start becoming competent at even writing an academic paper, let alone coming up with fantastic ideas for research projects.  I feel like I am in kindergarten learning ABCs compared to people a couple years into their graduate program, writing comprehensively and efficiently. 

- Is it strange to feel humbled and utterly stupid next to people who made the connection between property values on the northeastern coast and snail-eating crabs in salt marshes?

- Where should I Xpost to for maximum response?

tl/dr: need advice, from fellow biologists, on my future.

I love my job, and I love to share it with people, and I try really hard to be a good team lead/boss/supervisor, because I've had a lot of shitty ones in the past and I know what's like to be at the bottom of the food chain.

I recently moved accross the continent, to a new job, at a company run by a former collegue that went under and is wavering back into it's prime. I am one of two managers in my department, and it is my job to lead new hires and interns. Because we just moved, we don't have a ton of money in the bank, so we made the decision, albeit reluctantly, to move into a roommate situation so that we could save more money faster and then move into a house.

My roommates are all coworkers at the company, and they are all fine except two, lets call them S and E. S has a very important roll at my company, he's been there for 7 years and is extremely valuable, they don't want to lose him, S is awesome, we need S. E is S's girlfriend, she used to work at the company before she went back to school, she did a horrible job before she left, and when she did leave, I started, and me and the others in my department had to pick up all of the work she did not do.

E rides on S's status in the company, and has an extremely strong sense of entitlement, even though she has contributed very little to the company itself. Recently, she was hired under me by the managing director because, in her words, ""they don't want me to take S away from them, and they need help.""  (Okay, I'm also ranting about annoying roommates like I'm in college again, how sad is this &gt;.&lt;)

Anyway, because we live together and because she isn't any more pleasant at home, I am finding it extremely difficult to be assertive with her. If we didn't live together i would really have no problem being firm, and/or guiding her, but since she is my roommate, and a very entitled, egotistical person, who really seems to not realize that I am her supervisor, I'm just not sure how to go about it.

I don't want to embarrass her, or humiliate her, or risk her taking what i'm saying as personal offense, and then go home to an air of awkwardness and tension because of what happened at work, but suddenly I'm just at a loss. Has anyone dealt with this before? 

Sorry for being a huge baby, I've just never been in such a weird situation before. Any advice or shared experiences would be sweet. Thanks for listenin'!"

 As the sub grows, so does the demand for quality content and a place that feels like home. So far our sub is pretty bare bones. What I am asking is that if anyone knows they are freaking awesome at this kind of stuff - customizing a sub - maintaining flair/etc. Working out CSS issues I guess? 

 I mean I do not know enough of this stuff to really take advantage of all Reddit has to offer so this is a shout-out to those who think they have what it takes to become one of our IT-Mods. We will have two, and the duties will be basically focused primarily around maintaining a working environment for all our trainers.

 **I want to make this clear. This is *not* a part of the intern program. The selection process for that is taking some time and should complete this week, this is for a MODERATOR POSITION where you are going to be expected to produce results! All because you love Pokemon, of course.**

 Anyways, 

 This was just a blurb - but I wanted word on the street that we need some of those tech-savvy guys on Reddit to work some magic here and make us look pretty.

  So do it. &lt;3

1bkkns,7,2013-04-03,Being stressed has made me a jerk,biggfist_69,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1bkkns/being_stressed_has_made_me_a_jerk/,"Hey guys,

I've tried posting this under another acct but it keeps getting stopped by the filter. I'm hoping if I'm more succinct it will post.

I'm in grad school, I have a part time job, and I feel overwhelmed and very stressed. I feel like things haven't been going my way. 

When I finished undergrad in 2009 I couldn't find a job like a lot of people. To keep things short, it took me 2 years to get to the point where I wanted to be career wise. I worked at that job for a year, didn't really like the way things were going, so I went back to school to change the direction of my career. 

I told my wife that I could find a part time job and things will be better in the long run. The job was front desk graveyard shift at a hotel. I work over the weekends. It's been really hard on me because I never sleep adequately during the day and I feel bad physically all weekend because I lack sleep.

This year at school, my consulting group put me on a ""performance improvement plan"" because of my attitude. (Usually this is reserved for people who do a bad job with respect to quantity and quality of the work they do.) But not me, I managed to be put on one because 8 other people thought I was a douchebag. I also just got chewed out by the professor that I tutor for because I led a tutoring session and some people complained. I thought it went really well but I guess people didn't like it. 

I have really struggled with finding a summer internship. It feels like 2009 when I got out of school the last time. I am really afraid of not finding an internship and not being successful in the long haul. This is the biggest thing that's stressing me out. The companies I was really interested in weren’t interested in me. And I’ve told myself that I’m not going to make the same mistake I did when I was in undergrad. I’m going to network, I’m doing to do internships, and I’m going to make sure I have a decent job lined up when I get out of here and that will be my top priority. Well as I said I’ve been struggling. I feel like once I get out of school I will be in the same position I was in when I finished undergrad – struggling to end up with the job I actually want. 

This weighs on me because being successful is important to me. Call it vain, call it shallow, that’s what I want. Some people want kids, some people want to devote their life to worshipping God. I just want a good job. That’s what I want at this stage in my life. 

Please help me feel better or give me advice anything you think might help. "

1bk8ag,3,2013-04-02,"[22m] Good grief, where to start...",DistributorOfPain,questioning,https://www.reddit.com/r/questioning/comments/1bk8ag/22m_good_grief_where_to_start/,"First, I think some background is in order. I've considered myself nominally heterosexual for the majority of these past few years and have only now come to re-question the way I am. 

Now, I say 'nominally' for two reasons: **a.** I've had more intimate relationships with males than I have with females and **b.** it was more of an unconscious 'default', if you will, rather than a self-conscious evaluation of myself. 

To elaborate on my first reason, it started when I was very young (perhaps 10-11 y.o.) and the son of one of my mother's friends and I began a relationship that lasted several years. As adolescence is wont to do, it changed things and we were no exception. After him and I quit seeing each other and hanging out, I had a couple relationships but nothing *nearly* involved and by the time I was about 14 or 15, I had ceased in having *any* sort of intimate relationships for a very long time. I suppose I tried to bury that (repressed?) part of my life until I finished high school. Then, when I was 18, I met a girl that was a bit younger than I and we sort of fell into a relationship. She was fairly open about being bisexual but my previous history was a secret until about 2/3 through our relationship. We dated just shy of 2 years when one day we ended it; we haven't communicated at all in the 8 months since then. 

Subpoint *'b.'* is where things start to become a little more muddled. You see, I had considered heterosexuality my default because (at the time) that is what my environment and circumstances dictated was correct. Subsequently, I considered my past and the inclinations/desires/etc. inherent therein to be a deviance that was just that, in the past. 

I guess things started really changing about 4-6 months ago and I started becoming more aware of myself being attracted to individuals who were 'non-conventional' (tomboyish females and more feminine males, for example). Those feelings and attractions have come to a head in three very *very* specific examples:

**1.** My best friend and I, whilst drinking *heavily* at Old Chicago one morning had a very deep conversation covering a myriad of subjects. This came to a head where we got on the topic of me and he confided in me that he thought I was gay. Now, I balked at the term but I thought there might be some truth in perhaps the term 'bi' as applied to me.

**2.** We had a younger intern start at one of my jobs on a different team and all I could think of was how attracted I was to him. Now, this feeling wasn't entirely unique in the raw feeling but what *was* unique was just how natural and quick the attraction came.

**3.** Now, this is where it gets real *real* sideways: I attended a party on Friday (my first after turning 21) and everybody proceeded to get shit balls drunk...including myself and my friend from number 1. Him and I are both IT workers in a corporate environment and we started talking about how shitty his small corporation help-desk duties were and how shitty my large corporation reorganization was. The conversation progressed and others ducked out not wanting to hear shop-talk. From there, the conversation progressed further into various relationships (his girlfriend, my ex, etc.) and we naturally got onto other inclinations. He returned to our Old Chicago topic more forcibly wanting to know if I am gay or not. I told him (truthfully) that I am not sure and he dropped a bombshell on me: he asked what I thought of him, as a sort of litmus test I guess. Alas, I can't recall exactly what I said to him but I will recount how I feel about him here: I would be lying if I said that I wasn't in some way attracted to him physically but emotionally he's too dear a friend to have that sort of relationship. He then dropped *Tsar Bomba* on me essentially saying that we could fuck as a 'one-time only' thing. It was right after that that somebody knocked on the door.

If they had come in, if they had needed me, it might have shaked out differently but as it happened they didn't. They muttered something and were clearly engrossed in something different. He got up to leave and I caught his arm telling him that what I was about to do was out of emotional turmoil; I kissed him. That's as far as I meant it to go but it wound up with us making the beast with two backs. 

So, here I am: confused but at peace, in turmoil but oddly happy, unsure yet inexplicably deliberate...I do love him but still just as a friend. But he *did* open a door for me I think. The problem is I can't see what's on the other side and can only barely make out what's behind me. 

Has *anybody* had an even *remotely* similar experience or know of somebody who has? And, if so, some insight would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the wall of text and thanks. 

**TL;DR** Had formative homosexual relations then one real important heterosexual relationship which was followed by questioning and has culminated in me fucking my best friend. Words of wisdom appreciated.

**Edit:** Added the *tl;dr* and I am actually 21, not 22...I haven't slept much these past few nights due to practically mainlining caffeine and ODing on various metal songs..."

1bk035,1,2013-04-02,Stressed and depressed.,throwaway766969,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1bk035/stressed_and_depressed/,"I want to avoid being too long-winded and boring here, which may be difficult because the way I’m feeling right now is just a conglomeration of stupid shit and first world problems. But I’ve kind of had a lingering cloud of depression hanging over my head for a few months and maybe this will help. I don’t think it’s serious. I just feel shitty a lot of times, and here’s my best go at explaining why.

A little background: I’m married, 25, in graduate school, no kids. When I graduated from college in 2009, I had a hard time finding a job like a lot of people. And I didn’t feel like I was setting my standards very high but in spite of that I still had a hard time landing the job I was aiming for. Long story short, I ended up with it, but it took me 2 years to get where I wanted to be and I felt like I should have jumped right into it after school. A year went by, I didn’t like it that much so I figured I should go back to school to attempt to change the direction my career was going. I sort of decided to do it on a whim, too. At the time, I was the primary wage earner between my wife and I and I said “Honey, I really want to do this. I will pick up a part time job, we’ll cut back and we will make it work. It will all be much better in the long run, I promise.” 

So I entered my master’s program last August and it has been a lot of work and pretty stressful. But I keep my head above water. They really load you up. And unlike undergrad where you can pick a schedule and it’s fairly flexible to some extent, my school basically said “here’s when your classes are, be there” and there really isn’t any other option. Classes would be like 10AM to 5 PM which didn’t bode well to finding an evening job or day job. To make things worse, I live an hour from campus so I spend 2 hours per day commuting on school days. 

The only jobs I could really find that would work with my school schedule would be working graveyard shifts. This is the type of program where you’re not supposed to do anything outside of school. “Fuck that,” I thought. “I’m harder working than most people. I can make this happen.” The dean who talked to me when I got admitted said just take out loans for living expenses, you can’t work more than like 10 hours per week in this program. I got clever and thought that if I worked graveyards I could squeeze in a bunch of work time. 

In theory, my working graveyards idea would work. It’s front desk at a hotel and it’s pretty slow when I’m there. They let me bring in my laptop so I can do homework while I’m working. 

Problem is, day sleep sucks. When I try to sleep during the days (on the weekends when I’m not at school) I will sleep for like 4 hours, wake up, and can’t go back to sleep. I feel like my weekends when I’m working these graveyard shifts are just a 72 hour period where I feel like shit and am sleep deprived. I usually work Sunday nights so that that it feeds into Monday morning and I go straight school. It’s hard to make it through Mondays. 

I’ve been looking for an internship for the coming summer and I’ve been struggling. I’ve applied to a ton and talked to a lot of people. The companies I was really interested in weren’t interested in me. And I’ve told myself that I’m not going to make the same mistake I did when I was in undergrad. I’m going to network, I’m doing to do internships, and I’m going to make sure I have a decent job lined up when I get out of here and that will be my top priority. Well as I said I’ve been struggling. It’s April now, I still haven’t found a summer internship, and that has been stressing me out. I feel like once I get out of school I will be in the same position I was in when I finished undergrad – struggling to end up with the job I actually want. 

This weighs on me because being successful is important to me. Call it vain, call it shallow, that’s what I want. Some people want kids, some people want to devote their life to worshipping God. I just want a good job. That’s what I want at this stage in my life. 

I feel like I don’t have time to spend with family or friends. I don’t have time to keep the house clean. I feel like shit all weekend, I go through weekends feeling like a sleep-deprived zombie. I’m not motivated to eat healthy and stay fit. I just feel like I’m half-assing everything in my life and I’m super paranoid about this graduate school thing not paying off in the long run.

1bjx8h,4,2013-04-02,How is SJSU for a Computer Engineering major??,sjsucompemaybe,SJSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SJSU/comments/1bjx8h/how_is_sjsu_for_a_computer_engineering_major/,"I was accepted to transfer into SJSU as a junior for Computer Engineering this upcoming fall. I see a lot of talk on the school's website of ""Powering Silicon Valley"" and I wonder how much of that is true and how much of that is just self promotion so I figured I'd ask the people who would know best, you guys.

Anyways I have a few questions:

* Is it difficult to get classes? 
* Does the school actively help you get internships? 
* What sort of reputation do SJSU Computer Engineers have (In terms of companies wanting to hire them)?
* What do you think of the Professors and curriculum?
* What do you find lacking or dislike about the computer engineering program?

I'm aware its a commuter school and that's alright with me. Frankly, because I'm a bit older (I'm 23) my goal is to get my degree and get a few internships under my belt as soon as possible so I can be a good candidate for hire by graduation.

Any insights would be extremely appreciated. Thanks!"

The town he will be living is about 4.5 hours away from my home and 3 hours away from his home. While living together sounds fun, I am not sure I want to. He said I wouldnt need to pay any bills only help with the food a little. But I would still want a job, and its going to be hard to get a job for the summer, when I currently live 4.5 hours away. I am basically guaranteed a job in my hometown.  We basically live together now but have classes, jobs, and friends and family around here,  there we wont know anyone but each other and those we meet at work. I am worried living together may be too much time together. But I also feel bad thinking about him living alone all summer, and I usually get pretty bored during the summers.

1bp231,0,2013-04-04,I [20M] don't think I'm in love with my girlfriend [19F] anymore.....,whycantIfeelit,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bp231/i_20m_dont_think_im_in_love_with_my_girlfriend/,"Backstory: We met about 7 months ago in the city where she [19F] lives and close by to where I [20M] was living at the time. I lived about an hour from the city and taking a break from school for a semester in an internship. After meeting via mutual friends at a party, we chatted online for several weeks before meeting up again in the city for what would be our first date. We had sex that first night, my second time ever, and she became my first girlfriend (I never had any previous relationships, no time or interest and no success in my few awkward attempts, just a one night stand that never went anywhere).

For the next few months I would see her in the city every weekend after finishing my intern work for that week. We'd go out, and have tons of awesome sex afterwards. We're into all of the same shows, like the same music, and are compatible on pretty much every level. After two months like this, she says that she loves me after we return from one of our dates - we were both going to part ways for a month while she went home for her winter break and I prepared to go back to school, and we were both rather depressed about not seeing each other for so long. I was floored, but I told her I loved her back as well. Note, this is two months into the relationship itself, and three months after having first met. 

At the time, I really think I meant it. She's my first girlfriend, and emotionally I was experiencing a lot of different sensations those first few months. 

However, as the next four months went on, and I was back at school, I began to feel less and less intensely ""in-love."" Our current relationship is long-distance - we talk online almost every day, and still see each other most weekends, but we're a good five or six hour drive or bus ride away. I began getting a better feel for her personality, too, and there are things I'm seeing that I'm not liking - mood swings, too much self-pity and not enough self respect, etc. I'm also uncomfortable about several of the things she's said she's done in past relationships. And a million other little things as well. Habits I once saw as ""cute"" I'm beginning to find irritating. And sex is starting to become an issue as well - it's become more of a chore to work myself to climax in her. I'm also not going to lie, whereas in our first few months, I didn't pay attention to other girls, now that I'm back at school, I do find myself paying attention to other women a lot more than I previously did. 

So as of right now, I'm not sure if I'm in love with her, and I don't think I really am. But at the same time, I don't think I'm ready to let go - I do enjoy her company, and I care about her, and she's always willing for sex (even when I'm not). Even if I'm not in love with her, I don't want to end it, or I don't think I feel ready to end it.

Is it just my inexperience? Was I never in love in the first place and just inexperienced, or is it just the distance? She's been in two past relationships, and said she had fallen in love with her last ex, though admits she hadn't done it as quickly as she had with me, or as deeply, according to her. She admitted she had began to suspect she was in love after our first month together. I bring this up because with her experience, I'd think she'd know for sure, so it's likely that I think she's actually in love with me, or at least thinks she is. 

My ultimate question is if I can still make this work - can I be in a relationship with some one who loves me if I don't love them back? Should I try to make it work, or should I just cut my losses? Is it unfair? And should I tell her about the way I feel, or would she be crushed? 

**TL;DR I don't think I love my long-distance girlfriend of six and a half months anymore but she still loves me. Can I still make a relationship work or should I break it off?**"

1bopg8,0,2013-04-04,Let's share stores about stalkers and the like...,[deleted],gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1bopg8/lets_share_stores_about_stalkers_and_the_like/,"Alright bromos, anyone want to share stories of your weird stalkers, and how you dealt with them?  I have at least three, sometimes four guys that send me inappropriate text messages, emails, and simply say weird things to me in person.  I do not feed into it and I usually deflect the strange statement into a different topic.  



For context, I just graduated college, finished my internship, and state-mandated schooling. My future profession is generally negatively viewed in the media and on the public stage at all times.  I'm 23 years old, and I'd like to say an “average” kind of guy as far as demeanor and physic.  



*Stalker one:

I used to work with this guy.  He is much older than me; he also had a higher position than me in the company.  When he found out I was gay he was all over me, constantly asking about sexual partners and sexually-charged topics (i.e. size of my penis, roles in bed, etc).  One time on Facebook he asked me if I'd like to see his “red thong” he wears to be the pool.  I just got off face-time with him, as he twisted my arm into it even though I said I was very busy (lie).  The conversation started out innocent enough and then turned into, “so how big is your penis?”  I deflected again and then he asked, “oh, I was hoping you'd show me.”  I replied nicely enough, “no, I'm not doing that.”  I found an excuse to get off face-time then he sent me a text that said, “let's keep that between you and me.”  



*Stalker two:

This guy is always popping out of the blue.  He's definitely not my type and I've made that clear to him; however, he is a nice enough guy who, and for some reason, is highly regarded within the community so I have to watch what I say to him/about him.  We really only have thing in common which most gays don't:  our love of guns.  He's always asking about guns, inviting me to his parent's farm to shoot shit, and talking about gun issues and laws.  Then he'll text me asking me to go out on dates and hang out at bars and what not.  I always decline because I don't care to have a friendship/relationship with him – we have nothing in common and again, he's much older than me.  If he sees me out with friends, he'll approach me and sarcastically say, “thanks for inviting me.”  If he sees me flirting with someone or if I have a date/guy I brought along with me, he'll talk shit to me, talk shit about the guy I'm flirting with or brought, and stare at me the whole time.  



*Let me be clear about something:  I'm making it sound like I don't like older guys.  In reality, a lot of my close friends are 40+.  However, I wouldn't date them.  We all have preferences, and I think we should respect those preferences.  Don't spam me about how I'm a bigot or “one day you'll be my age.”  I know, I get it.*



*Stalker Three:

We went to college together and he's a year younger than me.  He is now in the same profession I wish to be in.  He has a girl fiance and marrying her very soon.  One day we were studying at my apartment and one thing led to another, and we ended up fucking (I had NO IDEA he was gay).  He's definitely a hot dude, and we've pretty much been friends with benefits for nearly three years.  However, he's far from being the type of guy I'd want to have a romantic relationship with – besides, he's pretty much married to a girl.  Within the last year, things got weird real quick.  He'd invite me to play pool and casually hang out.  I declined, reciting our deal that we'd be “discreet” because he's engaged and I was brutally honest, saying he's not the kind of guy I'd want to be in a relationship with.  Then he'd ask questions like, “if gay marriage were legal, would you think we could get married?”  “if I were out of the closet, would we date?”  Then he finally said, “you know, I think we should be boyfriends.”  That's when I drew the line.  I explained that it was obvious he had feelings for me and that I wasn't comfortable with that.  I politely said that I think it's best that we end our FWB thing, as we had a good run and he's getting married soon anyways.  Well, he wouldn't have it.  He has literally sent me 27 text messages since the beginning of February, to which I haven't replied to a single one.  In one text message, he berated me and said he thought it was best we never talk again.  The next message he said he was on his way to my apartment whether I agreed or not (I wasn't home, so I didn't care).  Now he's sending me naked pictures of himself and asking why I won't talk to him.  



Why are people so damn weird?  If I made it clear that I don't want to have intimate contact with you, why continue to be weird?  And not just weird, but sexually weird?  



**TL;DR**:  Share your stories of your stalkers.  


I don't think mine are extreme, but I seem to have an abundance of them.  I'm sure someone out there has a good story...

1bob8w,1,2013-04-04,"College CS student, $300 EFC. Should I get summer internships?",collegestudent51,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1bob8w/college_cs_student_300_efc_should_i_get_summer/,"I'm a college freshman in Computer Science. My mom makes about $25k a year, and I'm an only child.

Our EFC for next year is 300, which is pretty low. This year, it was 900, and that made it much easier for my mom to pay for this year (after I took out loans from the government and my college that don't get interest until after I graduate).

Since I'm a CS major, I should get a really good salary right out of college (if I finish), at least $70k per year. Summer internships would pay similarly for about $16k for the entire summer.

I'm concerned about what taking an internship would do to my financial aid situation. If I make $16k in a summer, then that would dramatically increase my income. The effect of this would also be delayed a full year since my EFC wouldn't be recalculated until after the school year that follows my summer internship.

A summer internship would make me a lot of money, but I'm worried that the money would be useless because my financial aid package might be more greatly reduced than the amount of money I made, making it *harder* to afford college. I'm also considering doing a coop during the fall or spring, but I imagine that would make my financial aid package even worse.

Is this a legitimate concern?

**EDIT**: I *definitely* intend on getting internships because the work experience is valuable. I just don't know how many or what kind. I don't want to get all that money, lose some of it to taxes and living expenses, and then end up with a tuition bill that I can't actually afford because my financial aid package goes away. I've heard that making income would heavily decrease my financial aid."

A story of relapse.,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1bnwyo/first_steps_a_story_of_relapse/,"TL:DNR - Hi Im Local aka J, I have a weed problem.  22yo.  Smoking since I was junior in High School.  Longest period clean - 3 months.  I don't know if I am ready, but I don't know if I want to quit.  I know I need to though.  I go on and off days smoking and being sober.  I used to be clean for a couple of months, but then I feel back onto the green.  I have PTSD and depression.  Backstory below.  

Hey all.  I used to be here under the name local420, but because that was never linked to an email, when I forgot the password, I lost the account.  So I made a new one.  But I digress.   Onto the story.

About a year ago, I was here, I was cleaning up my act and shit was looking fantastic.  I was quitting both weed and cigs and I was able to breath.  I was doing well in school and social life. I mean I was even able to pick up a girlfriend.  I was fucking happy.  Then I slowly started slipping.  First a bowl here or there.  ""No big deal I got this under control"" so I thought.  Then school started back up again, and I started smoking more and more.  ""Whatever I am still getting good grades I don't have a problem again"" I kept thinking, as I looked at my 3.0gpa for the semester (Mind you for me that is incredible.  Not that I am a bad student, I'm really not, I have just had one hell of a fucked up college career.  PTSD, Depression, ya know the good ol' times)  But then shit started going south.  In late Sept, early Nov 2012, I started getting flashbacks and nightmares caused by my PTSD.  These were unlike anything I had ever experienced.  I wouldn't sleep.  Scared of my own bed.  During the days I would just be a goddamn zombie stuck in between the reality of my life and the memories of my past.  I was terrified  to sleep. So scared of my own goddamn bed.  The weed though, the weed was always there to help me out.  Sure I would smoke to blissful oblivion, but it stopped the shit, at least for a while.  I was smoking an insane amount, constantly broke.  I mean hell there was a span of time that I was going through roughly a fucking ounce a week.   A FUCKING OUNCE.  I mean god damn.  The dreams never stopped, nor did the flashbacks though.  If anything they only kept getting worse and worse.  Dec 2012 came around and I was a hollow shell.  I constantly had thoughts, little voices telling me, go ahead, it's ok, It will only hurt for a moment. Driving me insane.  One night I flipped, put a hole in a wall and cried for hours wishing for the goddamn building to just fall on my head.  I wanted out so bad.  I went to the school therapist the next day.  Begging them please, make it all stop.  Please stop the nightmares, the flashbacks.  They only offered me a strong script sedative.  I didn't want to be knocked out, I just wanted other thoughts then what was constantly filling my head.  Even now I cry.  The nightmares cannot be described.  The detail, the violence, the gore.  It would make the devil himself cringe.  I guess I should make a clear note as to the reasons for my PTSD and depression.  I was abused by an internet predator when I was young.  I am one of those stats you see on SVU or Good Morning America.  I paid my dues though, I helped put that fucker in jail.  Though I did what many cannot even consider, it haunts me to this day.  Though the damage was all caused by him, the blood feels like its on my hands.  I feel guilty, so incredibly guilty.  When this prick was first arrested, he walked.  No jail time, no fines, nothing.  They arrested him again a year later doing the same exact thing.  This time, he was found with multiple hard drives and computes filled with, yup, Child porn.  This time though, that fucker burned.  I took the stand with another victim back in late 2010.  He is now serving 20 years behind bars and will be under Big Brothers watch till he dies.  Whew....that was a lot of info, sorry.  So that's the cause of my PTSD and Depression.  This in turn of course fucked with my grades blah blah blah back to the story.  Jan 2013 things are starting to get a little better.  I broke up with my girlfriend, I had to.  I couldn't even have fucking sex without seeing his face.  Yeah, wanna talk about a mood killer?  But whatever, it happened.  It was for the best though.  I was meeting with my therapist (Doc) regularly.  Sometimes twice a week but usually just once.  It helped a lot. Put a lot of things in perspective.  Feb 2013.  I am still smoking a lot.  About a quarter a week.  Grades are starting to slip. I am showing up high more and more often for classes, meeetings, etc.  Failed multiple exams because I was too busy smoking to study.  But I still managed to land a nice internship.  Mar 2013 rolled around and shit is still bad.  Still smoking mad amounts but getting happier and more control of my PTSD.  The nightmares have finally come to a near stop and the flashbacks have been virtually eliminated.  Still i get them both from time to time, but not nearly as serious as it once was.  I started talking with my friend about helping me quit.  They are all very supportive.  That brings us to now.  April 2013.  I am trying to quit.  I am looking to quit.  But I don't know if I really WANT to quit.  I mean, I literally will hunt (and smoke) any weed I can find.  I legit went through my trash looking for stems to smoke.  I will buy it if I can't find any spending whatever money I have to get it.  And then there is the topic of 4/20.  I feel like i can't miss that day. It is the holy day for stoners.  I mean fuck man.  But I guess I will come to that when I get there.  I love weed.  It really is my passion.  I would (and have) sat for hours reading about everything weed.  My friends say I need perspective, but I don't know what I even should be looking for.  I know it's bad. I know I have a problem. Bah I don't know.  One of my big problems is that my roommate and close friend smokes weed like I do.  That really doesn't help but whatever.  Oh and my family is clueless as to my use, PTSD, and depression.  Sorry for the insane ramble.  I will probably update this initial text throughout the day describing my emotions/feelings like I did before.  It helps me the most, even if it does piss people off. Sorry people.  I will gladly reply to comments and all clearing up any questions, comments, concerns.  I appreciate whatever help I can get.  


UPDATE: 1:30pm
     I want to be clean today.  It really is hard.  I find myself staring at my phone finger hovering over the call key.  A simple call, a little wait, and bobs your uncle.  Fuck this isn't like before I'm not angry, not stressed.  Just craving.  just one final joint, one more frozen bong load.  Thats all I want.   But I guess I've already had enough 'last' joints.  Bugga.

I'm finally buying my own car at age 20, and I have my eyes on several 2005 and 2007 Chevy Impalas (reliability is supposedly higher for these years). I was wondering if the Reddit community had any other good suggestions for a sedan that is safe and reliable (plan on having this car into early years of family life), but is still fun to drive now while I'm in college. 

Also, for the helpful car sales people of reddit, what do you think is the maximum sticker price that I could attack at a dealership and get down to a $9k out the door price? I understand that there are a few variables that would affect this, but some ballpark suggestions and advice would help me out. 

I will be getting back to Eastern Iowa (home) next week, from my current 3-month internship in CA. The plan is to spend the next 5 weeks or so buying a car, which will then be needed to haul my butt to an exciting 8 weeks of summer classes.

TL;DR: Need a $9k reliable car that I will enjoy, with only a month to spend on the buying process. Suggestions?

I KNOW I NEED TO GET WORK OK. I'M TRYING! that's a lot more than any of you motherfuckers have done in the last two years. I graduated high school, I busted ass and got MYSELF through college by staying up filling out FAFSA shit all day and finding grants. I got this internship, which YES I FUCKING KNOW DOESN'T PAY ME STOP REMINDING ME.

What do you do? Let's see...
you got fired 2 years ago, it was a shit deal and I felt so bad. And I still feel bad cuz you're my dad and I love you, but fucking christ you haven't even tried to find another in all this time. ""Oh i'm old. Im tired, my body's all fucked up"" Like yes I know but you wanna be homeless?
And then you've got the nerve to bitch at me for using up gas money to go to my job, when half the time you're out with the car god knows where all fucking day.

Brother. You dropped out of high school. Whatever. You went to job corps, I was proud. You graduated with a security degree... awesome. NOW DO SOMETHING WITH IT! ALL YOU DO IS GO GET DRUNK AT YOUR FRIENDS HOUSE AND BITCH WHENEVER ANYONE ASKS YOU TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY FROM YOUR JOB CORPS STASH. You bitch about taking out the trash. You bitch about everyone else. You bitch about how nobody will hire you, but in the same breath how you're too good for this job or that job.

I'm trying. I'm ready to fucking kill myself at this point i'm so stressed out. Mom is so sick and it's like you guys don't even care anymore. She's had to resort to selling her pain medication to help out, do none of you even get how FUCKED UP that is?
 All anyone wants to talk about is how we're probably going to lose the house and how I need to get a job and how I don't do anything around the house. But somehow miraculously there's always scratch ticket money, and coffee money.

 I'm so depressed I can't even sleep at night anymore."

She told me she needed space to work out what she wanted and whether or not our relationship worked for her.  

Up until a few days ago, my way of coping with everything has been to throw myself into work and exercise. I work about 6-7 days a week, juggling uni, an internship, a clerkship and a bar job to pay for my rent. It's worked up to a point, however my uni is currently on easter holidays and I have had a lot more free time as of late. 

I recently broke no contact to organise to send back her camera because her sister's wedding was coming up and she was going overseas with her cousin. She responded to my text, at first things seemed positive, she wanted to see me to talk things over but she ended things with ""take care"", which is pretty indicative that things were well and truly over. I didn't cope with this particularly well, and after a week of contemplation, decided it would be better for everyone if i just posted it to her. I messaged her and told her to wish her parents a happy easter and that I would arrange for the items to be posted. 

About two days ago, she finally responded. Before this time, I was feeling great, like for the first time in a long while, things were on my terms. I also got my hair done and started to feel attractive again. Then she messaged me, saying she understood my need for space and that she hoped I was well. It just pushed me over the brink and I've spent the past two days in varying states of distress. I guess I'm so upset because she seems perfectly fine with everything and that makes me feel like I meant nothing to her. I'm upset because I thought we had a chance to fix things. And I'm upset that I know what I want in life and she doesn't. I've had to stay at my parents for the past few days and I find it particularly difficult to get out of bed each day. I find it even harder to be alone for extended periods of time.

To get to the point of my story, aside from going back to NC, what else works? I've been doing so well up until this point as well, it's just really frustrating. I feel like I take two steps forward and one step back with everything."

1bmv3p,201,2013-04-03,Controlled delivery gone wrong,dat_controlled_deliv,SilkRoad,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1bmv3p/controlled_delivery_gone_wrong/,"Had my first ever controlled delivery last week, and basically talked my way out of it. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've been ordering acid and mj from SR for about 4 months now, though mainly mj. I started off with 7g to try it out, after that I ordered 14g two times, this was my 4th purchase of mj and i became overconfident and ordered a QP, since 4/20 is coming up and i got my friends to pitch in so we would not run out, and maybe even make a little profit on the side. I should mention all orders were done from the same vendor, he is one of the best vendors on the SR and I don't blame him for what happened, I just got too cocky and shouldn't have ordered such a large package.

Now, I live in a uni apartment, and get all my shit mailed to my uni address. This means I have to pick up all my packages from the apt. office, sign and show my student ID. When we get a package we get a little notification from the uni saying ""you have a package, please come pick it up"", etc. Risky and maybe stupid I know, but I did my research, keep our entire apartment clean of any and all evidence, ordered from the stealthiest vendors, and hoped for the best. All my purchases usually took 3-4 days to arrive, but this QP was taking longer and I started to get suspicious. 

What do you know, on the 8th day I get a knock on our apartment door, a mailman in USPS uniform waving a pretty big box in my face asking me to sign. All sorts of alarms go off in my head and I'm about to panic, so I just sort of take it from him and hold it in my hands, looking at it. I paused for maybe 15 seconds (I honestly don't know, time stood still at that point) just staring at the box in my hands like an idiot, but then it suddenly hit me that yes, this is a controlled delivery and if you don't get your shit together your life will be ruined (i have an internship with a big government contractor, parents know nothing, etc.). So I feign suspicion and ask him ""Who are you? Is this some sort of scam?"" and he just looks at me and seems kind of lost and mumbles something about signing for the package. I gained a little confidence so I started pressuring him, ""We get all of our packages delivered to the university mailroom. No one ever goes directly to the address, regular postman would know that. I don't know who [sender's name that vendor used] is. Who are you? What is in this package? You are acting very suspicious. I am going to call the police and show them this package"", etc. And just like that I take the package inside and close the door on him lol (I do realize I should have just given it back to him and closed the door, but I wasn't about to let a QP go so easily, and foolishly thought maybe they'd let it go since I never actually signed anything) He knocked on the door once after that but I really didn't give a shit, as I'm pumped on adrenaline, can hear my heart beating in my ears, and am generally scared shitless. My roommate was looking out the window through the blinds (he smokes with me and when he heard me talking at the door assumed the worst) and later told me the guy just stood at our door for like 3 minutes looking helpless, then just left. 

We inspected the package thoroughly and thought it MIGHT have been opened, but I honestly couldn't tell for sure, and we sure as hell weren't going to open it after what just happened. ~15 minutes later I get a knock on my door and what do you know, guy in a blue jacket and a university cop behind him. He tells me he is a federal postal inspection agent, yadda yadda, and starts trying to intimidate me, saying they know i had drugs shipped to me, and they will get a warrant to search the premises if I don't give them back the package, etc., real bully tone and clearly much more ""in charge"" than the USPS worker (or whoever that was). At that point we still hadn't opened the box or tampered with it in any way, so I just took it and said ""please take it officer, I don't know who this sender is and this package does not belong to me"", and told them to have a nice day. 

It's been a week and so far no one has knocked the door down, so I'm assuming it's all over. 

TL;DR I am dumb, but LE is also dumb, could've just waited for me to sign for a QP of weed at my uni office, instead they tried to do a sketchy controlled delivery to my doorstep and got nothing."
1bmrbq,1,2013-04-03,I get so overwhelmed that I stop functioning and become discouraged.,[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1bmrbq/i_get_so_overwhelmed_that_i_stop_functioning_and/,"**About me**

I'm a first year senior (staying for a second) at university and will graduate with three majors (math, fin, econ) and a minor (cs) which require me to to take at least 17 semester hours in what I would describe as relatively difficult classes; on top of that I work up to 15 hours a week between 8am - 3pm so essentially I have obligations from 8-5 every day.  This, of course, is without homework.

I'm also in the interviewing stages of internships that relate to banking which is an extremely, absurdly competitive industry. Since it's so competitive I have to work on building my resume so if I were to take anything out (major, minor, work) I wouldn't be nearly as competitive as my GPA is lacking (3.2, industry average is 3.5+) due to challenges my freshman year.

**Problem**

Everything I do piles on top of me at an increasing rate.  I have school work that I'm getting more and more behind on, I have work projects that are coming down the pipe line that I'm struggling with because I don't have enough down time to relax my mind, and worst I have this looming thought of if I'll be good enough to find a job when I graduate.  

Whenever things build up I break down.  I completely stop functioning.  My problem solving abilities go down the drain, my memory feels like it's trapped in a vault, and my motivation is no longer existent.  

I try just about everything I have time for.  Exercising, stepping outside, watching TV for 30 minutes, and really doing anything that get's my mind off everything.  It never works.  

I feel like I'm missing something that other people have.  I don't know if it's my mental health, my physical health, or my time management but I need to figure out something because this is simply not good enough.

I'm willing to take suggestions or field questions and any advice will go greatly appreciated."

I've been working with the daughter at a large counselling center for about a year, and we've become somewhat close. Plus I'm attracted to her and I'm pretty sure she's attracted to me. There's been some flirting and a number of intense one on one conversations. 

Recently I invited her to a party and got her facebook. Her pictures verified what I had guessed might be a possibility based on her last name (which I just learned, and is very uncommon). 

The party is actually a going away party because I'm moving far away. So I'll lose contact with my friend, and none of this will matter. But I feel awkward that I know all this stuff about her mom. I haven't told anyone about this yet because I feel like the whole confidentiality thing is such a mess, especially on the off-chance I still become long-lasting friends with this girl.

Does it make the most sense to just let go of this friendship so as to not have to deal with awkwardness/discomfort/ethical issues? 

Also, hypothetically, if I had incredibly strong romantic feelings for my friend (which I don't, not really) and she for me, would that matter or change your advice at all?

Thanks!"
1bpp1i,5,2013-04-05,"I'm beyond frustrated over this ""transition period""",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1bpp1i/im_beyond_frustrated_over_this_transition_period/,"I graduated 9 months and 19 days ago with an engineering degree from a respectable university (top 50) yet I haven't found a job yet. I know the job process takes time, but I'm at point where it's upsetting/frustrating. Yeah I can blame the crappy economy. I can blame my university for not warning me of this situation. Hell, I can even blame myself along with a million other things.

I just don't get it. What the f%ck is going on? As of today I've sent out a total of 145 applications. I've applied *everywhere*! (throughout my home state and even 17 different states across the country). I've cold called/emailed alumni, gone through my school's career center services, networked through LinkedIn, used online job boards like Monster, Indeed, etc....hell I've even gone through subreddits like /r/engineering, /r/getemployed, /r/resumes, and /r/jobs!

I've gotten 1 interview with company X, 2 rounds of interviews with company Y, and am waiting for for Z to set up an interview with me. Company X didn't extend me an offer and I haven't heard back from company Y for 3 weeks. I've had my resume and cover letter looked at by industry professionals, professors, and even some friends.

I feel like it comes down to me being perceived as ""good"" but companies always seem to find someone ""better"". And it's not like I'm applying to positions that I'm not qualified for. I can't even find an internship because a lot of companies are looking for student interns (aka people still in school).

I know that there are a lot of new graduates in similar situations but I don't find comfort in that. I've also seen a lot of my engineering friends being picked up over these last few months. 

This transition period has been a lot more difficult than I imagined. It's like I'm in a dark tunnel right now I can feel the tracks going forward but I can't even see a pinhole of light.

**TL;DR** It sucks to be a new grad right now."
1bplux,0,2013-04-04,"I am eternally grateful, nofap.",chop_it_off,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1bplux/i_am_eternally_grateful_nofap/,"I fucking did it. I mother-fucking did it! For right around three years now I have been crushing hard on this girl and never had the courage to tell her how I feel. I have been promising myself for ages now that I was going to ask her out, but could never muster up enough courage to do so.

Since I have started nofap, I have become a better person. It didn't help me to ask her out, the confidence I had from nofap carried over from my life and gave me the opportunity to ask her.

        
 I felt so out of character doing it, and honestly it was kind of awkward. It was right after the last class of the day. I had been telling myself all day that I was going to do it. I started to doubt myself though, I had told myself that lie yesterday and the day before and so on. I came up with bullshit excuses to not talk to her, usually that it wasn't the right time or that she was talking to her friends so I would ask her later. I had been writing letters the week leading up to this day, reasoning that it would be much easier to give her a letter that explained how I felt. Pads of paper and trash bins later, I never finished one letter. 

The bell rings. Take my time getting up from my seat, talk with friends while walking to get my stuff from another teachers room. I know her locker is right outside that room, I know shes there everyday. I see her, she jokingly doesn't let me pass by her. My mind goes completely foggy, clouded by adrenaline. The past three years have been culminating to this point. Do it, Do it **DO IT** my chest starts to scream, only to be drowned out by the music of my confused mind. The excuses start to kick in. There is always another time, there are too many people around, its not the right moment, she's with her friend. I crack a smile and sputter something unintelligible. I let her pass me and then I turn to make my way to the parking lot. Then I hit the brakes. What the fuck am I doing man? No right moment just exists, motherfucker. **YOU MAKE THE RIGHT MOMENT**. This hit my head in less than a second. I turn around say ""Jane (Name withheld), Can I talk to you for a second?"" At this point I'm on fucking autopilot, It felt like I had no control over what I said. The only way I can describe it would be to say it was like being in third person in the sense that I was watching two other people, but still in first person in the sense that I was looking through my own eyes. I ask her ""Do you want to go out sometime""?

 Those six words took three whole years to utter, and I said it with such little strength. She said sure. Cue me saying ""That was a lot less awkward then I thought"" (still cringing at that one), and then we parted ways. The rest of the day was so surreal, I couldn't determine if I had actually just did what I thought I did, but I experienced bouts of extreme happiness, catching myself cracking my face from smiling so hard. 

This was on 4/3/13. This Friday were going to see a movie.

 



I cant thank you guys enough. Through this community and my subsequent abstinence from fapping, I HAVE become a better person. I have made new friends, lost over 70 lbs, started to work out, gotten a fucking internship at my local state attorney's office, learned python and java, learned how to play the piano, and my buddy and I started a fucking 3D printing company. I just turned 17 in February, and I cant fucking believe how much I have changed in just a year. I have become the person I envied, and there's no derailing this train anytime soon. 

Many of you may not read this post, and that's alright. This post is more of a personal vent than it is a contribution, but I had to get it off of my chest and I figured that it might spark a fire in some other Fapstronaut. Don't give up, keep on keepin' on. To anyone in a pickle similar to mine, think about this :“For all sad words of tongue and pen, The saddest are these, 'It might have been'.”.

1bpl4a,2,2013-04-04,Whoa...Emotions?,NotPunnyEnough4This,thoughtprovoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtprovoking/comments/1bpl4a/whoaemotions/,"I'm going to write for 12 minutes without stopping.  Last time I challenged myself to 10 and ended up going for 16 :)

This has been a super stressful week, and I haven't been handling it the best.  I'm so glad that it is behind me.
I'm a college student. Sometimes I feel like Asher Roth: ""I hate college but love all the parties"" But sometimes I don't even care about the parties, sometimes I'm just like DAMN this is hard. Thats what I get for going to a top 25 public university (rolls eyes).

So, my boyfriend is out of town this weekend.  We are next door neighbors, so we spend probably too much time together. (Ahh, young love.) But he is gone from Wed. midday to sunday midday and somehow 4 days seems like a lot.  To combat my loneliness, I'm going to be extra crafty/productive/on top of my game during the day.  And catch up with some of my buddies at night.  

I sound SO OLD right there.  Like, really?! I'm only a junior in college.  I'm new to the reddit community, but I have been a loooong time imgur lurker and everyone there seems to have such self-pity being single.  Its almost pathetic.  I have always been too damn independent for my own good.  In high school, when my friends had their first serious boyfriends, I was refusing to take boys seriously.  They all had problems.  Any guy that got too close got shut down.  At 16 my ""boyfriend"" (can we even really call it that?) told me he loved me......after 2 months.  People are so devoted to being in a relationship and getting experience and so much of it is for show.  So, he's the only person I even ever kind-of dated in highschool.  And I dumped him a week after he dropped the ""L"" bomb. (perfectly natural reaction in my opinion) 

I got to college and at that point I was just too crazy to date anyone.  I was too busy occasionally getting mind-fucked by this one dude one on hand, and drinking to excess with my friends.  There was no time for the responsibility of a relationship.  

Sophomore year I was still the crazy party girl I always was, but I started to feel like something was just a little ---- missing.  My best friend and roommate had always been single and free with me and she started dating this guy who went to another school.  It was just a little weird.  I always had lots of fun, but i felt sad sometimes about not having someone.  Its not something I dwelled (dwelt?) on though.  I got plenty of attention from my friends, and have a great family.

This summer I lived by myself in my apartment, in my college town, while all my friends liked at home for one last summer.  I worked a 9-5 internship, and just came to my empty apartment everyday and got a little hazy while I cooked dinner.  This solitary lifestyle was a totally new thing for me.  I did a lot of self-improvement like reflection and really built my confidence.  A couple things shook me this summer, but depending on myself for once made me so much stronger.  

I guess it was pretty obvious when we came back to school because suddenly I found myself wrapped up with 3 boys.  I don't mean like, oh I was having sex with three dudes at the same time, because I wasn't.  But, they were all interested and me, and the feeling was mutual.  They were from three different parts of my life and I didn't know what I wanted.  None of them had made a move to exclusivity, so I was just living the good life.  I was concerned because I knew that my days of playing the game were going to blow up in my face.

Then, I met the neighbor boys while I was sitting on the stairs one afternoon.  We chatted for a minute and then I went inside, to prepare for my birthday festivities. (This was at the very beginning of the semester, actually the night before the first day of class) There's a knock on the door and the guys invite us to pregame.  On a whim, I go and have a good time over there.  Another friend gives me a ride out, and I meet up with some other friends at the bar.  A little later I see one of the neighbors at the bar. The cute one. The (hopefully) single one.  The tall one. *swooooons*

I believe that these events: my disinterest in boys, my skepticism about the general young relationship, my resistance to commitment; is ultimately what led me to be  at a place where I can be truly truly fully happy in this relationship. 

Maybe I'm a fool. Maybe I'm blinded by my first love.  Maybe I'm just really enchanted with him.  Maybe one day I will end up hurt because of this. But even if thats the case, even if it doesn't last til the very end, I am grateful for this experience.  The way I feel when I'm around with him and all the wonderful emotions we've experienced together are so precious, no matter the outcome.  I'm living in the moment and I'm happy."

My family does not make a large amount of money, around 70,000/year between both my mom and dad.  In the last few years my mom has had a lot of health complications costing many thousands of dollars and is on track to have her eight surgery next month.  Because of all of the medical bills they were forced to use up all of mine and my brothers savings accounts as well as theirs.  After that,  they then had to withdraw money from their 401k plans to help pay the bills.  The money withdrawn from a 401k counts towards income when filling out the FAFSA so our estimated family contributions are $13,567/year,  none of while they can afford.  The college I am attending costs 30,000 a year but with my ACT score I got a 10,000/year scholarship. I plan on working as much as possible to reduce my student loan debt before graduation.  Is there anything more I can do? 

EDIT: I'm going to school to be majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.

Today I arrived early as usual and sat at my desk reading emails, etc waiting for my supervisor to arrive and start off the day's work. Few minutes later a lady from another department and rudely asked for my supervisor. I told her he wasn't here yet and asked what she was here for and if I could help. She looked me over and I could see what was going through her mind ""just an intern as if he knows or has the authority to help"" so she predictably said no dismissively and went to sit at my supervisor's cubicle to wait for him.

Thinking nothing of it I went back to my desk. Someone passed by and said good morning to her. Thing is the passerby called her ""Lisa"" and then I remembered that I had processed an office laptop to be issued to a Lisa due to be picked up today, the paperwork was done and dusted and just required her signature and she could take it and leave as long as any member of IT, me included, signed for it. 


So I decided if she wants to wait for my boss, then wait she shall. So she waited for him to arrive twiddling her thumbs, me redditing for the next two hours 26 minutes (yes I counted). So he arrived and guess what? He directed her to me to give her the laptop and sign the papers, all of 60 seconds it took. If looks could kill...

1btfbb,13,2013-04-06,Am I A Terrible Person?,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1btfbb/am_i_a_terrible_person/,"Wall of text confession time.

My bf and I have been together for over 4 years and we've had our share of ups and downs. I've expressed to him many times over the years my intention to marry him. But ever since, I would say, last October, it's been not so pleasant. We got into a big fight because in my attempt to be more open and honest with him about problems in our relationship, he took it as me attacking him which led him to not talk to me for a week. When he finally started talking to me again, he said that he didn't speak to me because he wanted me to feel as shitty as I made him feel. Which, to me, is incredibly immature. 

In spite of this set back I was still looking to move this relationship forward. I even started looking at rings. But I guess when you heavily contemplate spending the rest of your life with someone, all those negatives in a relationship really start to shine bright and make you question. All those little things like we don't watch the same tv shows, or movies...or listen to the same music. To the big things like how our ideas of sexual intimacy are sometimes conflicting (to say the least). The fact that his initial reaction when I try to touch him, is to push my hand away. Our sex life has been terrible the past few months. I'm away on business a lot and when I come home, he's usually not in the mood. It's like the stars have to align for him to want it. Which of course gives me lots of confidence

He was the first man I was ever with. He is genuinely an incredible person. He's hard not to love. I'm pretty sure some of my friends love him more than me. And the one thing I am certain of, is that no matter what, I always want him to be happy. But I don't think he makes me as happy as I make him. I've noticed that I come home from business trips and I get upset more quickly. I'm not as excited to talk to him over the phone when he calls. I used to question our relationship but as soon as I saw him, all of those feelings went away. But now those feelings are coming back and a lot more frequently. To the point where I think about it every time I'm away for work and it causes me all kinds of stress. And now I have those feelings when I'm home with him. 

We've been together for so long and have invested so much in each other, (we don't share bank accounts or anything but there have been large joint purchases) I don't want to throw it all away. He's not even a year out of college. He's not making enough money to support living on his own. If we break up, he either has to move in with his best friend's family, or move back in with his mother and homophobic stepfather (who still somehow don't know about us).

Just over a month ago, I got an offer from work to move from Boston to NYC. That started another fight between us. He's started up with a good job that he is doing really well at and we don't want to tear him from that and make him start over with me in another city. He made it very clear that it was either the promotion or him. So I initially turned it down. But the other day they made it very clear that the offer is still open and they want me to take it. When I left college my dream was to live in NYC. After working in the city a lot, it's not as great as I had it in my head, but it's still something I'd be open to try. I feel like it's the perfect opportunity for a fresh start.

Do you know that episode of How I Met Your Mother at the end of season 1 where Lily is applying for the art fellowship in San Francisco, and her car gets a flat tire? Ted comes to help her out and he realizes her plan which would mean that she's leaving her fiance. As she's trying to explain to Ted her intentions, she says that even though she loves Marshall, all her life she has played it safe. From her education, to her job, to her relationships. She's lived her life mistake free. That's kind of how I feel now. I feel like after college every decision I've made has been the safe one. I picked an internship with a company I had no interest staying but took it because it was convenient. I took a job afterward that pays well, and it's rewarding, but it takes such a toll on me, and once my debt is payed off I can't see myself staying there much longer. My bf was there and supported me every step of the way and he and I have put up with a lot together. But choosing to stay with my bf to me now feels like I'm playing it safe again. And I would feel like I've already settled down at 25. The only reason I stay is because breaking up with him, I think, would devastate him and like I said before, the one thing I never want to do, is cause him any pain. But am I really going to stay with him just so I never have to hurt him, even though I feel like it's hurting me?

We met online while we were both in the closet and because he was the first man I was ever with, I've never gone out and actually dated in the gay community. Maybe I want to spend some time to see if I can find THE ONE. Someone that likes the same movies I do. Listens to the same music I do. Likes going out and trying new things. I'm sick of going to the movies alone. "
1btc47,1,2013-04-06,Intermittent no-start on 1996 Town Car (Excessive detail ahead),Gangringo,MechanicAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1btc47/intermittent_nostart_on_1996_town_car_excessive/,"I bought a 1996 Town Car a few years ago.  I know, not exactly the most practical vehicle with gas prices as they are but I'm 6'3"" and got used to the room and comfort when I worked as a chauffeur for a while.

Other than a couple electrical gremlins (horn and cruise control don't work and the turn signal clicker will go off randomly) for the first couple years it was a complete tank, no problems whatsoever outside of regular oil changes.  This last winter it started having serious problems with stalling and warming up when it was cold (California cold anyway) which were fixed with a new thermostat.  Around this time I got a check engine light for a misfire on cylinder 7.  I noticed some damage to the spark plug wires so I replaced them, plus the spark plugs and the coil packs for good measure.  When I did this, I did a compression test and found the 7 cylinder and one other (I forget which) had low, but not dangerously low compression.

This brings me to my current problem.  All of a sudden, even though the worst of the cold is over, the car stopped being able to start in cold/damp weather.  I couldn't narrow it down to either cold or damp because this time of year they go hand in hand.  The starter turns 100% but I get no ignition.  After the day warmed up, the car would start on the first crank, purr like a kitten, and never sputter or stall.  This was even the case if I started it, then it got cold/damp while it was running.  I didn't really have any chance to troubleshoot the problem because if it didn't start in the morning I had to high-tail it to school another way and I had to leave town for a week in the middle of all this.

Fast forward to yesterday.  The car started in the morning, even though it was pretty cold and damp and I drove it to my internship.  When I left it was about 3:00 in the afternoon on a beautiful spring day.  When I tried to start the car I got the same problem, the starter cranked strong and fast, but the engine just wouldn't start.  I had thought ahead and bought some starting fluid to see if that helped, it didn't.  I opened up the air intake after the filter, and the car started right away.  I checked the filter and it was dirty, but not excessively so, but I replaced it anyway.

Now here's my problem.  It seems to me like correlation should not imply causation here.  If it was a restricted airflow then it seems like it should have more problems than just starting, and the temperature/humidity shouldn't be a factor (not that they were the last time I had the problem).

I also ran a full diagnostic on torque and this is what it gave me:

That looks to me like one or more of the exhaust gas sensors are out but I can't find any information on what sensors those codes refer to.

I really don't want to call this fixed if it isn't but I really don't have the time to diagnose it when it does fail, and I really don't want to be stranded anywhere."

1bvs77,1,2013-04-07,I'm so confused about all this.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1bvs77/im_so_confused_about_all_this/,"I'm a 20 year old male in college and after being depressed most of last semester and having an anxiety/depressive breakdown around finals that left me feeling completely helpless, I told my parents that I'd been considering seeing a counselor. When school started again in the spring I had anxiety almost constantly, and after seeing a male counselor for a few weeks and being told that I should go on SSRi's I talked to my mom about how I didn't think he was that great and decided to find another counselor. 

The second female counselor felt really good to go to a few times even though I barely said anything. Being told by her that I should seek medicine for clinical depression just made me really sad and kind of angry with her. I told her about how I struggle a lot with thinking about whatever I'm doing not being the right thing and she said I have an irrational belief of not being good enough. Being told by her that I should seek medicine for clinical depression just made me really sad and kind of angry with her. After being given a set of irrational beliefs and instructed that i could rewrite them into more rational beliefs, I put it off until the day before the counseling session then got extremely worried about what I wrote down not being right. I went in and basically said that I had gotten really defensive about the writing. She said that it was fine, but I've always considered seeing another counselor after. I've had trouble talking with her a little bit, I guess mainly from me just zoning off when she asks something and then realizing I zoned off and then not remembering what she asked. 

It's hard for me to try to think for myself I guess now. I always get the sense from counseling that I didn't get to say the right thing and that no real insight has been made, but I don't know what my problem is. She's suggested I go on depression medication and I have an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I really don't know what will happen. 

I think I've fallen into this helpless feeling where I really just want attention, but don't know what to change in my life to feel better about myself enough without it. I live in an apartment with a random person, and I spend most of my time in my room. I'm on academic probation for the second time and am at risk of losing my scholarship if I can't improve my GPA. It's time to pick classes and I don't know where my degree is going, I don't have an internship, and currently have no summer plans. I just took easier core classes to try to figure myself out this semester, but they ended up just giving me a lot of work I wasn't interested in. I regret not taking classes that could have given me an interest in other possible degrees/fields. I worry about just sitting here on campus all summer and doing nothing, or going back home and just sitting in my parents house. I could try to find work in a research lab over the summer but I worry about having to talk to a professor, and thinking that they'll realize that I don't know how to do a whole lot, and feel guilty about looking for a resume booster.

 I worry a lot about my performance in a new leadership position in my fraternity. They're the only real friends I have, but most of the time I'm a passive participant in anything we do. I don't have any friends that I do things regularly with, but I know that there's people that I could do stuff with, I don't know what I could do or talk about with them when for most of the semester I've just been staring off in my room wondering whats wrong with me that I'm not happy, and then snapping back and trying to get things done in a rush.

 I think I realize a lot of my problems stem from feeling helpless, and worrying about perfection, but I feel like it's been so ingrained I don't know how else to think. Reading a guide to rational thinking I guess has made me feel better, if only to just read again for awhile and focus on something other than depressing thoughts. My problems seem so small, but I don't know, I feel so small against them.

 I have a psychiatrist appointment on Thursday after the Midterm I need to get a good grade on. I don't know whether I should seek anxiety or depression medication, and worry about all the stuff I've read that has said it could make things worse. I think I should've just started exercising and stuck with it, but can't ever seem to stick to any sort of plan anymore. I've considered dropping out, if only to avoid the eventual meltdown that I think will come at the end of the semester.

I've read all the advice and know that I need to just start exercising, eat healthy, stay on top of my school work, think positively. But for what, so I can just get through this semester and then try to get through summer and then try to get through another semester in the fall. why. I'm just angry and want something to change, I know these emotions are childish in comparison to what I'm dealing with, seeing all the things on /r/offmychest. But I'm really tired of things feeling shitty.

I have to go our Chapter soon, and re-reading this I think that even less of what I'm going through. I don't know what to feel.

Maybe I'll just drive away this summer. Try to find somewhere or something I'm happy with.

Feels good to write this out. Thanks for anything."

I have a 20"" LCD monitor, as well as some good audio equipment, a keyboard, and mouse. So no more peripheral equipment necessary.

What I want to build is a high-end tower, with lots of RAM and a Terra-byte of Hard Drive space. I'll primarily be using it for high through-put computer simulations and graphic design, making use of the complete Adobe CS 4 suite, some fractal generation software such as the ones found at this link: http://fractalfoundation.org/resources/fractal-software/, and a large collection of agent-based modelling programs, examples of which can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_agent-based_modeling_software

Gaming is not really going to be a concern, but I suppose anything that is capable of truly dominating in the domain of computer graphics generation should also be compatible with some fairly high-end gaming anyway. I might like to take a break from work to play some Skyrim or watch some truly HD movies. I trust your discretion, Redditors

I've been using http://pcpartpicker.com/ to help select my parts. http://www.tigerdirect.ca/ or http://www.directcanada.ca/ are my favorite distributors.

I've been poking around a bit but have finally realized I'm lost in selecting good parts. I'm not exactly a hardware guy. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I realize some prices will be going up in the near future and as I don't plan to actually order my build until mid-August, which is when I return from an internship in Calgary, some of the builds you have so graciously suggested for me might be a little inconsistent with the optimal $/value package at that time. No matter, I'd at least like to see what people would come up with at this present moment so that I can I get a good feel for what my computer will look like, but if you have any suggestions for minding the gap (i.e. purchase RAM now, waiting for a better GPU, etc.), then please feel free to let me know now.

Primary concern is just getting an image of what my comp will look like and how expensive it will be based on the specifications I have outlined here. I have a good $1500-2000 ceiling to spend including taxes and shipping/handling costs."

I've been finishing up a bachelor's and working part-time, so after graduation, I'm going to go home and work as an EMT while I take a few more classes at a community college so I can apply to PA school.

I already talked to him about my concerns. I said I wish he'd put himself out there more and get serious with his programming or else he won't be able to find internships. That he needs to find things to do in order to build references instead of staying home all the time. I said I worried about his future even if it's not with me. Said I loved him and want to be together eventually. He agreed with all these things but I don't think he really understood.

Unfortunately I wasn't as direct, like saying it's unhealthy to stay up until 5 and sleep in until 2 every day or that instead of gaming or browsing reddit all the time he should be finding work to put on a resume. He had a temp job last fall and talks as if he intends on collecting unemployment for awhile instead of getting a new job.

**Am I just being pushy?** I know we haven't been together a long time, but I reason that if I've already been with someone for more than a year, eventually I want to live him. But it can't happen unless we're both employed, if he doesn't actively work towards that goal, I just can't see us working out in the future.

I don't know if my meds are working like they're supposed to or if I've stopped giving fucks...but holy hell am I doing better.

Lately: The guy who told me he HATED cheaters and that his ex wasn't really his type...was sleeping with her before and during our relationship.  I got angry, naturally, and I talked to him one time after I found out just to try to get some information from him..which I didn't.  When he tried to turn part of it around on me, I stood up for myself and didn't let him.  I haven't talked to him since and I haven't looked back.

I told my ex (different ex) that I still have feelings for him while in a drug-induced state (sleeping meds) after he told me he was seeing someone.  Haven't heard from him since.  While this sucks so bad, I'm actually okay with this ending because I feel like I can move on because...at least I told him. That's out of me.

All of a sudden I'm totally blanking on other stuff that's been going on lately.

I am stressed, mostly over school, my internship, and one guy in particular that I'm unsure how to handle the situation with.  I learned that I seriously need to learn coping strategies and hopefully I will start trying to work on that soon.

My next step is to start going to the gym next week to take classes.  I am TERRIFIED and the anxiety is so bad that words cannot describe...but I feel like I need to face this and do it because it's something I need to do for my physical health, it will be fun, and I will be socializing with people.  It's that first step, especially doing it alone, that's so scary.

So:
TL;DR: I am reacting better to situations that I ever imagined I could and things are actually going good."
1butsu,4,2013-04-07,I just want somebody to love me,Atear,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1butsu/i_just_want_somebody_to_love_me/,"Hi. I'm 22 years old (my birthday was last march), and I go to college right and am majoring in History, with a specialization in Japanese history. I have depression. I've known this for a long time but was never diagnosed until last February when I finally went to see a counselor. I'm on Wellbutrin now and this is the first time I've ever taken anything like this.

I'm not sure where to start so I'll just say this first, I'm fat. I weigh 324 lbs and am 5 ft 10 in. 

Before I get to my whole life story spiele, let me talk about the title of this post. When I'm with the two friends I hang out with the most, one of which I have a huge crush on, we like to talk, obviously. Well every now and then one of them will say, oh so-and-so is so cute, or smart, or funny, usually talking about one of our other friends. I don't join them in this because it's girl stuff that I'm not in to. Anyway, this got me thinking, ""Do they or anyone else for that matter talk about me like this when I'm not there? Is there anyone who says, ""oh Atear is so cute"", or ""Atear is so funny!"". And my final stance was that no, who in their right mind would ever say a thing like that about you. you're a fat piece of shit who has attachment issues, gets depressed easily, noclear future, poor as hell, and what's more, you are a balding (It's thinning at the top/forhead area of my head) virgin at the age of 22. So here's my story...

I tried to kill myself when I was in the fourth or fifth grade by taking my shoelace and tying it around my neck to the monkey bars, and then jumping off. I was so fat the string broke. To this day I don't like things like that hanging around my neck. Since then there will be good days and there will be bad days. Today is a bad day as was yesterday. 

This is a throw away, as I just want to get my story out there. I was born March 6, 1991. My mom was 26 when she had me. I don't remember how old my dad was. The next year my little sister was born. and then four years after that, my little brother was also born. I want to be able to say my life was all sunshine and rainbows but that would be a lie. My dad is a severe alcoholic and drug user. Or at least he was when my mom, my siblings, and I left him for the last time. Anyway, when my dad was in a good mood, I loved him. We would lay on the couch, watch tv, and I would pull at his arm hair watching the points of skin where the hair was attached rise up. But that was during my early childhood, when we are still at that cute stage. I remember many times when my dad would lose it with my mom and beat her. I hated him for that. I sometimes find myself wishing now that I had been myself I am now back then, so I could have understood their fights and help my mom from being hit. 

My dad was a big man. he was a black belt in karate, and had a beer gut. When he would get angry at me for something I did he would hit me. hard. he never really hit my sister, and my brother was still his little baby boy at the time. I usually always sided with my mom in their fights. Probably the reason I would get hit. 

My mom left my dad with us a few times. the first time it was because he got into a big fist fight with some guy in my grandfathers home. We left and went to stay in a shelter. During this time my mom started dating some guy. All I remember is that he looked like William H. Macy only a squarer jaw and that he had three daughters. I was in my room once and playing a prank with a lego box by the door. He saw me doing it and beat me. Nothing too serious I guess but alot harder than an 8 year old deserved. My mom left him soon after she found out about this. 

My dad found out where we were living and decided to come over to us. That was one of the scariest moments of my life. I was in the living  room, alone, standing there, while my brother, sister, and mom were in the back bedroom playing on paint on the old computer we had just gotten, you know, what we all used to do before fast internet. Anyway, I looked out the big back window, and my dad was standing there with his black biker jacket on and his head shaved. I was so scared when I saw him staring at me. He tried to act cool, asked me to go and get my mom. So i went and told her, dad's here mommy. She was terrified. they talked or whatever and got back together, I mean my dad living with us again. things were ok for a while, sort of. Then it got bad again and we were forced to return to that same old women's shelter. my mom found another man she thought might make a good boyfriend so we moved in with him and his son Dustin. That's all I really remember about Dustin is his name besides when we would sometimes go up the road from the house to the old gas station where they still sold old coke bottles that you had to take the metal cap off of. Anyway, this guy beat me as well, to, as he put it, get me to stop saying mommy. That a 9 year old was too old to say that. We left and ended up with my dad again. This time we were homeless. We had to live in a rundown garage of the family who lived next to my grandfather because he didn't want us dirtying up his place. After that, we decided to live in a motel. This was when I decided I wanted to become an architect. I enjoyed doodling little house blueprints and thought it would be a fun job. However things don't work out the way we want. i may have had alot of ups and downs in my life, but this was when I discovered pokemon. I remember it like it was yesterday. I was alone in the room (the one room motel that I would call home for 1 year) when I turned on the tv. I turned it to cartoon network when episode one of pokemon appeared. I was hooked. That's of no relevance, just wanted to share that part.

We moved then to one place where I got my full blooded Alaskan Husky named Vageta from DBZ. I loved that dog. Anyway fast forward two years and I'm 12. My mom has had enough, as if she hadn't before, and finally gets a plan together for us to move back to her home town in Missouri. She works it out with her family there, so that we would have a place to stay until she could find work and get our own place. She told me this meaning she trusted me, also because I think she wanted to tell me it will be ok. Oh wait, I forgot, this was the last house where my dad pawned off my expensive RC Racer I had gotten for my birthday, my birthday money I had hidden from him yet he found and took after I told him no, and also when he pawned off my Gamboy color and all of the pokemon games I had collected so far, even my first game, Pokemon gold. 

So my mom told him we were going back to her home town to see my great grandma before she died as she is very old, 82 at the time. When she told my dad, I didnt know what was going to happen. He at first said ok, but that he wanted to keep one of us kids at the house. My mom argued that all three of us deserved to see our great grandmother one last time. I was so relieved when he agreed. As we were leaving, I said goodbye with tears in my eyes to our new pit bull puppy Sassy, and then now fully crying to my beautiful alaskan husky Vageta. He was only two. The last time I saw my dad in person was when we were leaving the drive way and I looked at the house one last time, and saw him watching us through the kitchen window. 

Anyway, we made it to Missouri, and my mom called my dad saying we had left for good and that we were staying in northern Illinois and didn't actually go to Missouri. We went to school where my mom had graduated from, and we stayed in the trailer she had lived close to as a kid. my mom was actually happier than I had seen her when she was with my dad. I however was somewhat miserable. I didn't know how to make new friends so i acted out, I got in trouble every week without fail. From pushing people, to burping the ABC's (of which I am a pro), to hocking a lugie(?) into a trash can, and also to saying ""fuck you"" in pig latin to someone. That was the 6th grade. After that I made some good friends who lasted all the way through highschool. this was the first time I had ever stayed at one school for longer than two years. I still suffered from my bad depression during this time. My grades were also not what I now wish they would have been. And now I changed my future job from architect to graphic designer. I even planned on going to college where my mom had graduated from. But I stupidly decided to go to a technical school for Computer Programming simply because I liked computers. Well that ran the two years and because I didn't pass two classes I didn't get the associates degree. But rather than take the two classes, one of which was an internship, I decided to go to an actual college for History or English (glad I chose History -_-). So here I am now.

Now:

I have four great friends which is good after the fights with my previous friends a year ago exactly. However I really like one of my friends. She's smart, funny, caring (though she may not act like it much), cute as a rainbow covered sparkle bunny, and who also loves pokemon (I was so surprised that there was someone else in the world who knew all of the pokemon things i knew.), and she loves Japan, of which I had only decided this school year to specialize in. However last february, after silently liking her and keeping it to myself, so began the Sunday of February 17, 2013. A date which I will ever hold a place of contempt in my heart. My best friend, who is the brother of the girl that I like (it's ok, he knows I like her now and is okay with it) was going through some hard stuff early in the day, and so me and my two friends, the girl i like and our other friend who is also a girl are hanging out before we went to dinner at the cafeteria. the girl I like went to use the bathroom before we left so I had a chance to ask our other friend something that had been on my mind. I had noticed the girl I like acting strangely when our mutual friend from china was around. So i asked her straight up, does she like him? at first there was silence, then she said, yes. I was okay with it at first. truly i was. no depression for a while actually before this trigger happened. we went to dinner, and while I was in line to get food, It hit my like a train. All of a sudden I was seething with rage. absolute, unadulterated rage. I suffer from exotropic vision or whatever it's called where both of my eyes don't naturally focus into one image by themselvs, I have to knowingly focus on a point to see one image. I'm saying this because since middle school, i had gotten into the habit of spacing out and just letting my vision problem take over, so that I am only concentrating on what i'm thinking about. Well this took over during dinner, in a big way. I was aware of a huge angry sinister scowl across my face, the same face my dad gave to my mom. And my thoughts were only, I should kill something. I don't care what, but it should cease to exist. I ignored everyone who tried to talk to me, which made me feel worse because they then acted like I couldn't hear them at all and were talking about me in the third person. I decided to just leave without thinking when one friend said he had to go. I went back to my room and beat the shit out of my mattress. I then got onto my computer and wrote out every one of the thoughts I was having. Mostly self-deprecating things. Shortly after this i went and got help from the college counseling office. It was wiered spilling my guts out to a stranger. But i grew to like it. Since then I'm overall happier. Mostly because of the situation with the girl I like. I ended up having our mutual friend let it slip to her that I like her, and then I told the chinese guy she likes that I had a big crush on her, in order to ensure that he wouldn't form any extra thoughts about her. I know this wasn't right, but knowing he doesn't like her is very calming to my nerves especially since I've been diagnosed Extreme Depression with a big anxiety disorder. My mom said She thinks I also have adhd, but I don't know. 

So what prompted me to write this? I don't know. I woke up a few hours ago, and thought about how last night my two friends, the girl and the girl I like, watched a movie in my dorm room, then left afterwards laughing with each other and didn't even say goodbye. stupid thought probably but whatever. 

This isn't a pitty post, I just wanted to talk about what's wrong with me. While writing this I cried at remembering things that I had forgotten, and I have let my depression levels come down some. So this was a good thing, downvote, upvote, do whatever. I'm just happy someone might read this, and understand a little of what I'm going through."

**Weight**: 95 lbs

**Age**: 20

**Body type**: Rectangle. I don't have a measuring tape but that seems about right. Bra size is 32A and I wear a size 0 jean. Essentially I'm just very small all around

**Why?**: I'm short, skinny and have a baby face, combine that with my current wardrobe and people are always assuming I'm 14/15, 16 if I'm lucky. With summer coming up I'm in desperate need for a make over. I have an internship in HR so I need to start looking more professional. Also, I'll be graduating by the end of the year so I need to start looking more like an adult and less like a middle schooler addicted to her converse. 

**You now**: [Here I've made this convenient little album!](http://imgur.com/a/NkftB)

I don't typically wear dresses, but recently I've started to wear them more when the occasion calls for it. I still absolutely stay away from skirts, and things with too much frills or with jewels or bows are definitely not for me. 

**Budget**: Think poor college student whose just returned from 3 months abroad. So *really* not a lot of money haha

**Location**: Arizona

The funny thing is I actually really like dressing for winter. I love all the jackets and boots and scarves and what not but when it comes to summer I'm just at a complete loss. Summers in Arizona get brutal, I'm talking 100+ degrees, so I go immediately to the shorts and short sleeve t shirts and flip flops. The problem is I end up looking waaaaay younger as a result ( Just last weekend I literally had a guy at Costco tell me  I needed my parent's permission  before  I could take a sample  
-__-). So I guess not only do I need an office look but I also need to learn how to dress like an adult for the summer. In addition, everything in the stores right now seems to be oversized which doesn't really work with my bust size and just ends up making me look more boyish. "

We always hangout with other friends. And during our last year in college we had our Intern in a a different city and we always drink on his apartment. One time I got really drunk and really don't know what I was doing. I just wokeup wearing his clothes even his undies. I was so drunk that I lie down on my own puke and he washed me... change my clothes.

That time I started to think he might be like me. Then one time he drove to my town(we're like an hour apart) and pick me up, so we can drink on his place... I was like ... omg I think something will happen tonight, I got to his place we drink, then suddenly I kissed him... he push me a little and told me what the hell i was doing. He told me he is a straight guy, he just feel comfortable with me around. We never see each other for a long time...

years had passed and he sent me an invitation to his wedding, although I wasn't able to attend... He contact me telling me If I need company he'll try to be there so we can hangout."

That pretty much sums up how it is. We've been together for 6 years, but for the past 4, it's been bickering and fighting. He moved to another state just last summer for an internship and we took a break over the course of the continuing fall. We got back together January of 2012 and when he moved to another state this past 2012 summer, I had hoped to go with him. He wasn't ready for it, so he said to wait until he'd gotten settled in. I waited until December when he was ready for me, and we had actually looked at engagement rings. He and my dad negotiated for the ring (my dad bought it as my boyfriend wasn't exactly swimming in money at the time) and I hadn't seen it yet since picking it out. I moved down with him in January and since then, things have been rockier and rockier. This afternoon, we got into an argument and it blew up into ""I want you out"". He helped me pack my stuff, cried with me and then helped me understand that this was what we needed now. He needed to grow up a bit and figure out what would make him happy, and I need to find happiness myself. 8 hours later, and a few calls and lots of texts from him, we're on a ""serious break"" and in May, we'll see where we are and can re-evaluate everything. I'm holding out hope we'll get back together towards the end of the year when we have some time apart.

Right now though, I feel so tired, drained and alone. Just 12 hours ago, I was in his arms and hugging him. Now.. I have a pillow. Not quite the same.

I just needed to get it off my chest. An 8 hour drive with four pull overs to sob my eyes out doesn't exactly lend to good therapy."
1btxla,3,2013-04-06,Braveryjerk: A hilarious attempt at corporate sponsorship of internet culture,btwstopbravery,CircleNiggers,https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleNiggers/comments/1btxla/braveryjerk_a_hilarious_attempt_at_corporate/,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this subreddit but I thought it would be the best place to post what I've uncovered.  Recently I've had a lot of suspicion surrounding the Circlejerk group of subreddits.  In particular, I was appalled how circlejerk moderators could get away with posting [blatant sponsored advertising](http://i.imgur.com/Mtdelap.png) on their subreddit.  This was called out by someone on /r/SubredditDrama but the thread was [summarily deleted](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bnpeu/over_in_rcirclejerk_the_mods_are_pulling_a_scam/).  It's been my suspicion that the circlejerk mods have a lot of influence on this website, and the above confirmed this.

**The Bravery Delusion**

I'm here to talk about a whole different scheme of theirs, however.  This one is so hilarious, so unbelievably insane that it's hard to stay with but please bear with me.  First of all, a quick visit to /r/Braveryjerk gives off a strange vibe.  It's apparently full of random internet memes and Ron Paul's face is for some reason plastered everywhere.  The place seems to be very loosely organized and I was able to gain moderatorship for a few hours.  In that time, I found the shocking secret:  *Braveryjerk is and has been sponsored by the Ron Paul campaign*, and I have proof!

It was hard to find any good nuggets because the modmail is mostly just jibberish and exhausted memes, but after an exchaustive search I was able to find a few good quotes.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/qMv4x) is a recent modmail thread where the users are talking about Ron Pauk/Gary Johnson and the next election campaign.  I dug a little deeper and found [THE FIRST MODMAIL THREAD in the subreddit's history](http://imgur.com/BouIOur).  A little more digging discovered that /u/Boobies_Are_Awesome and /u/GodOfAtheism were, back in February 2012, interns working for the Ron Paul campaign. We can see that the subreddit's creation was a direct order from the Ron Paul campaign itself. Both of these moderators are also high-ranking members of /r/circlejerk.  Skeptics like myself of course remember the time when circlejerk [changed its CSS to the Ron Paul website's theme](http://i.imgur.com/aiZc3.png). Of course everyone passed it off as a joke but it turns out these clever fucks were subtly promoting Ron Paul's campaign the whole time!  It's genious if you think about it, and [it certainly worked](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/search?q=ron+paul&amp;sort=top). Now if you all remember back in February, 2012 the Ron Paul campaign was sputtering and it needed a boost, so the HQ told the interns to consolidate their efforts and make a brand new [subreddit](/r/braveryjerk).  Apparently circlejerk's subtle hints were enough so they created a subreddit where to jam Ron Paul down your throat.  The guy is literally everywhere.  He's in the CSS background.  A bunch of their fake [""advice animals""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/comments/xza63/advice_animals/) have his face substituted in place of popular meme images.  They also have attempted to discredit many of Ron Paul's competitors such as [Mitt Romney](http://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/search?q=romney&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all) and [Rick Santorum](http://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/search?q=santorum&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all).  And obviously the sheep eat it up, thinking it's all a joke when the subliminal advertising is going in their heads.  It's truly genious!  

Now I know this doesn't seem like a big deal because /r/Braveryjerk only has 7000 subscribers or so, but it only represents one level of this advertising campaign.  I unfortunately haven't been able to be modded in any of the other Circle* reddits, but if you go through them you can see the same Ron Paul propaganda emanating through.  Circlejerk mods have also been modded to places such as /r/TheoryOfReddit, /r/Facepalm, and even /r/IAmA.  I'm going to try to uncover as much information as I can about the CJ mods as I can in order to topple their little delusional scheme.  In the meantime, PLEASE keep a lookout on Braveryjerk spammers trying to shill for whoever has paid for them.  The worst offenders are /u/TheSox3, /u/AerateMark, /u/ArchangelleNDTyson, /u/ParakeetNipple, and /u/NyoZa."

I had the meeting on Friday and took a lot of your advice. She was a lovely lady and very approachable. The meeting was basically in two parts; first I asked her about her progression and then talked about what I want to do with myself. She seemed really happy that I had taken the initiative to contact her out of the blue, and asked me what I wanted from the meeting. I mentioned that I'd enjoy shadowing her and that an internship would be the next step for me in my education. She agreed and we are meeting next week to discuss the meat and bones of a contract etc.
All in all it was very successful and I thank you all for your help!

As for any other students working in a large organisation; all I can say is give it a shot! Send one of the bigwigs and email and request a meeting; what's the worst that can happen?"
1byald,2,2013-04-08,"I [23F] always have boyfriends who tell me they want complete honesty in a relationship, but when I am honest, it alienates them and they lose trust.",throwaway1777x,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1byald/i_23f_always_have_boyfriends_who_tell_me_they/,"Background:  I am 23 years old and female, out of college for a year and currently in a relationship with my boyfriend, who is 20, of two and a half years.  It's a very good relationship, but I often find myself hiding little things because of my experiences with honesty in my past relationships.


So let me start at Boyfriend #1.  I was 18, he was 19.  He and I always were always open about sharing even the smallest details of our days because we were in a ldr and it was really the only way to stay close.  Fast forward eight months into the relationship.  I was at a party at school and a drunk classmate tried to make out with me.  This freaked me out not only because I didn't want or ask for it, but also because at this point, Bf1 was the only person I had ever kissed, so any amount of physical contact was extremely intimidating.  Well, in the interest of honesty I told Bf1 about the guy when we had our weekly phone conversation.  And the first thing he asked was ""Did you cheat on me?"" I said, ""No, I just told you he forced himself on me.""  And he interrogated me about whether or not I was making it up.  I understand a person can overreact initially to something like this, so I tried to reassure him and talk through it.


But over the next few months he got really super clingy and kept bringing it up every time I even made a new guy friend (I was in engineering, so couldn't really avoid guys).  Suddendly every guy was a threat and I was not trustworthy.  But he still wanted the relationship so he tried to monitor me from a distance.  Eventually for other reasons in addition to this complete lack of faith in me, I broke it off after a year and a few months.  To make this point clear, I never cheated even once on him and never even thought about it.  And I don't believe I ever did or said anything (besides I guess that night) to make him assume otherwise.


So Boyfriend #2 comes along soon after that (I am 19 now and Bf2 is 21).  We hit it off and we're both easy going and committed and it's all great.  We went to the same university so no long distance.  About six months in, I leave school to work and study out of state for a short time and while away, I had an unfortunate encounter with a coworker.  We were out at a bar with the whole office just hanging out.  I had one drink and a high tolerance so I was still aware of my surroundings.  But one of my coworkers (who had been drinking, but I don't know how drunk he really was) followed me to the bathroom later in the evening (one of those single-person ones) and forced himself on me.  I tried to get away but he was really strong and covered my mouth so I couldn't call for help.  Afterwards I wasn't sure what to do or what to say to anyone, if anything at all.  I asked my best friend for advice, and she tried to help me through it, but advised me not to tell Bf2.  I thought surely she was mistaken and that my bf was supposed to be the one person I could and *should* be honest with.


So I called him anyway and at first he freaked out like a good bf should, but he never really tried to comfort me.  Everything he said sounded like words to comfort him, but nothing that was supposed to make me feel better.  And then he asked me to tell someone at work and I said I didn't think I wanted to (I was just a lowly intern and I was new to working and I was just scared in general, so maybe you can understand why I didn't want to talk about it and confront the guy).  When I said I wasn't sure about talking, he said ""Oh, I see what this is.  You are cheating on me and just wanted to get away with it.  That's a pretty elaborate lie.""  I hung up on him and didn't speak to him for two weeks after that.


We continued dating and he never decided to trust me again.  If a guy tried to hit on me, it was my fault.  If I wanted to drink with my friends, I got a lecture because I was clearly 'being selfish' and 'trying to get away from' him.  We didn't have much of a sex life because he was too big and sex was painful, but we did everything else so there wasn't any real neglect in that department.  But he suddenly decided he was entitled to sex and that I was just pretending to be in pain because I was too busy fucking his friends (I barely knew them).  He forced sex on more than one occasion and eventually I dumped him because I couldn't take it anymore.


By this point I'm 20 and I find a new guy (18).  We're still dating to this day and we have an incredibly happy, loving, and open relationship.  Except in some cases, which is the reason I'm posting this in the first place.  I want more than anything to tell him about all the little things, the good and the bad - the compliment I got from a photographer, the douchebag who grabbed my ass at the gym, all of those things.  But based on past experience, I've started feeling like honesty isn't always the best policy and it freaks me out.  I still believe I should be able to tell my boyfriend anything, but I'm worried even a small amount of insecurity on his part would tear apart an otherwise great relationship.  I've seen my guy friends have similar problems with their gfs, too.


So reddit, I guess I'm just looking for your thoughts on the question of complete honesty in relationships.  Because I want to believe that there are people who don't get bothered by stuff like this.  I try not to, but even with how much I hate myself for thinking bad thoughts, I still have them too.  I just try my hardest to ignore those nagging questions unless there's too much proof of something to ignore, because I would hate to do to someone else what Bfs 1 and 2 did to me.  And I want to trust that my boyfriend would be ok with stuff like this and be able to talk about it without immediately losing faith in me or us, but it's hard not to take my friend's advice about keeping my mouth shut when so far people keep proving her right.


**TL;DR: Got assaulted and bf accused me of cheating.  It ruined our relationship.  Similar instance ruined a prior relationship, too.  Now I find it hard to be open and honest with my current bf because of it.**"

I'm a 22 year old male software engineer returning to SF for my second summer in a row for an internship.

I'll work 32hrs/wk in Potrero Hill.

I lived in the Mission District last summer and really enjoyed it. I'm open to other neighborhoods. I'm not really trying to live deep into the sunset/richmond because it takes forever to get home without a car. Also not a big fan of TL and hunters point.

I'm pretty easy going and can mold to most living situations. I won't be bringing much with me other than my backpack and a suitcase. I'd even consider living on a couch or in a sleeping bag in a laundry room. But that doesn't mean I don't have a budget. For a good room with a bed and such I'm willing to pay up to $1300/mo. 

I can be quiet, or I can be social. Whatever you want in a roommate. I doubt I'd spend too much time at home unless you were super cool. I enjoy exploring the city in my free time.

That was the word on the street, at least. Now, standing in the place where he died, you can almost hear him as “thrumthrum elephant” is taken to mean something about the marginalized voices of animals in the conversation about their own gradual extinction. You feel sick. You fight off the need to vomit, and instead decide to look around for any clues the NIU might have missed. 

0037: There’s sixty cents on the ground nearby. All the objects that floated around the Prince were gathered up as evidence. You recall the oboe, the pineapple, the googly-eyed rock he kept about him like a pet – all locked up now in an evidence room. Because of the random telekinesis, no one spent a lot of time with him, so no one really knew what was there. Sixty cents, though, might just be random enough, especially this far out in the wilderness, to have been in his orbit when he died. But what does it mean?

0012: What’s that, up in that tree?

0013: His hat! He didn’t wear it on his head, but it floated around him like a father’s belt on a make-believing son. 

0014: It doesn’t seem all that odd that he wrote the words SNARE DRUM all over his hat in thick black letters. That sort of thing was his deal. You’d think nothing of it, if you hadn’t heard rumours of a vicious gang known as the Rhythm Section slowly gaining traction in the area. Coincidence? Maybe.

0023: Okay, that does it. How did they overlook the 4/4 carved into this tree? The chief needs to hear about this. His house isn’t far. He doesn’t like being bothered on Sundays but, hell, this is important! (Go to: 12 Seagull Way)

0041: He isn’t home. This is rather inconvenient. It occurs to you, however, that maybe the chief doesn’t need to know about what you’re doing. Maybe you should do some of your own investigating. You decide to return to the place where The Absurdist Prince was murdered.

***

I think I’m stuck in a loop.

Damn. 
Ok, tell me where you went.

***

When asked by a reporter – an intern, really – whom he would later punch in the face on two separate occasions, Thomas was able to pinpoint a specific moment when the idea came to him. The truth, however, was that it was with him, albeit without words or shape, in many moments of his life leading up to that night. In bars and car parks, in beer and in boredom.

It was in him as he stood on a small stage in his friend Emily’s backyard, surrounded by friends and channelling JFK. 

“And so,” he yelled as he held out the microphone to the crowd, inviting them to join in. “My fellow Americans!” Even the people who thought his choice was too much of a cliché joined in. It was a cliché because they knew the words. “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can for your country!”

Nobody was really sure which came first: the portmanteau of oratory and karaoke, or the idea to base a party around such a combination. In either case, Emily had raised her head from the desk during the final class of the year, shouted the word like it was bingo, and then put her head back down. Thus Oratoraoke had come into being – loudly and in need of further explanation. 

“My fellow citizens of the world!” Finally feeling included in the proceedings, suburban Australia applauded for their impersonation-in-chief. It was at this moment when Thomas caught the eye of a girl in the crowd. Not quite Jackie O, but with the same cool admiration for the man with the microphone. This is when he wanted it all to be true. “Ask not what America will do for you, but what we together can do for the freedom of mankind.” 

When he finished, Thomas stepped down from the stage and accepted a shot of something from Cameron, as applause washed over him like a chaser. Someone in a Nixon mask extended his hand to congratulate him, before pulling away at the last moment – ever the sore loser, even at parties. For a few minutes he was all executive power and Boston Irish charisma, and then it was all over so suddenly: Washington to Dallas in a heartbeat. The attention of the crowd was soon focused on a fellow classmate named Hannah, dressed like a hooker and delivering Aragorn’s speech from in front of the Black Gate. The delivery was spot-on, except she replaced ‘men’ with ‘women’ whenever the word came up.

“I bid you stand, Women of the West!” she screamed. Riotous applause, and someone shouted “For Frodo!” but Thomas stood at the back, trying to appreciate the brilliance of the commentary. Instead he had spent the whole time trying to figure out a way to explain to Cameron, now quite drunk after earlier doing his best Billy Bob Thornton from Friday Night Lights, what he was feeling. He didn’t quite get there.

The idea was in him, almost on him at this point, later that night when the conversation at the party inevitably turned to what everyone would be doing next year. Cameron told everyone about a job he had lined up with a marketing firm. Cedric and Li were going to study law. Emily had gotten a journalism internship through her father, who owned the newspaper. May, no longer looking at Thomas like the First Lady, and who was the only one whose response Thomas actually wanted to hear, muttered something barely audible. When it was Thomas’ turn, he thought he sounded like someone who had gotten stoned before a pitch meeting.

“Well, I’ve been working on this location-based hypertext noir adventure… thing,” he told the circle of people. Having never explained it to anyone, except Cameron who was helping him with the app design, he wasn’t really sure what to say. “Like, you start at a location, where you find a number hidden somewhere. Then you take out your phone, put the number into the app, and it tells you part of the story. Then it might tell you to go somewhere else, where you’ll look for another number. Or you might get a choice between going one place, or another. And it records which numbers you’ve already put in, so, say 0033 will read differently if you’ve already entered 0032, than it will if you haven’t.”

There was a moment of silence before anyone said anything. Eventually Cameron spoke up. “It’s still in the beta-testing phase.”

“And are you planning to make money off this?” Emily asked. 
“Subscription fees? Charging people for the app?”

“No, I just… thought it might be fun. Make the place I live more exciting for people.”

More silence. Then, “I think it sounds great,” said May. “I’ll even help you test it, if you want. But,” she paused to consider what she was about to say, “are people going to, like, get it? I mean, the place you live isn’t exactly known for its… culture. It might work in Melbourne, or across the university campus, but the outer suburbs of Perth? Are you going to explain over fifty years of game, film and narrative theory before they start?” 

He didn’t know how to respond to this. His attitude had always simply been ‘if you build it, they will come,’ until now. 

“Just, don’t be disappointed if it doesn’t work out.” 

For the second time that night, he wished he had something real to tell her. He wanted to tell her that the idea was taking the suburbs by storm, or that some developers from Silicon Valley were interested in it. He would have even settled for being able to say he’d also gotten a job interview somewhere, but there was nothing. This was the closest he had come, before the night when his ambition and frustration became an actual string of words, to telling someone that he was also possibly interested in getting involved in local government, but it felt too much like a 5 year-old saying he wants to be a fireman when he grows up. 

“I know,” he said, smiling. “I won’t.” 

It was November, the summer of 2012, of Monsters and Men and Macklemore. Cameron was closely following the rise and fall and rise and fall of Mitt Romney, while Thomas worked on his simulacrum – his sub-suburb. He had taken down all of his posters – Jay-Z, Christina Hendricks, Batman – and covered the walls in maps and sticky notes. He wrote sub-plots within sub-plots within alleyways, obscure characters that could only be encountered with a very specific series of numbers, and toyed with the idea of adding an inventory system. 
“Now we’re getting beyond my skill level,” Cameron told him. “If you want fancy shit like that you’re going to have to hire a pro.” In the three weeks since finishing his degree (the day before Oratoraoke) and starting his job, Cameron spent most of his time at Thomas’ house. There he could get high and watch the American 24-hour news networks – activities not available to him at his own parents’ house. Despite also living with his parents, Thomas was not exactly subject to any real parenting the way Cameron was. Where Cameron’s actions at home were still very much controlled by restrictions and negotiations, the Moss household was governed by the far more subtle means of awkwardness and communicative action. If caught smoking weed, his mother would merely ask how often he did it, and why, and the awkwardness involved would be enough to ensure would not get caught again. 

Paul Ryan, the uneducated man’s educated man, was on screen talking about numbers that were too complicated to be talked about, when Thomas broached the subject of how much spare time Cameron would have once he started his new job. 

“I don’t really know,” he said in reply. “I don’t even really know what they expect of me, so we’ll have to wait and see. But I guess that isn’t even really the truth. The answer is, probably not. But maybe you could learn to do the app stuff yourself. It isn’t really that hard.”

“Yeah, I guess I should.” He had very little interest in learning web design, despite the fact that that was the one skill anybody hired a Communications major for. He liked to reassure himself with the example of Steve Jobs not knowing anything about coding, but the similarities fell apart pretty quickly. 

They would normally spend most of the day in front of the TV, alternating between CNN, FOX and the Cartoon Network, Thomas half paying attention to Cameron’s three quarters. The hypertext adventure, now given the name of Suburbs Beyond Suburbs (with all apologies to the Arcade Fire), was now almost completely written and mapped out, but not yet online. As a result, Thomas had inadvertently, perhaps almost by osmosis, become more aware of what was happening in his real community. So much so that he noticed an ad for a vacancy at the local council. Looking up from his laptop, interrupting an important speech on TV, he said to Cameron, “Cultural Development Officer.”

“Huh?” he responded.

“There’s a job opening with the local council. Cultural Development Officer.”

“And what does that mean?”

“No idea. But it sounds like me, doesn’t it?”

“Mmm. Sure.”

He spent the next day misremembering the past well enough to put together what he thought was a decent resume and cover letter. Going to bad movies and good bars made him “culturally engaged” and his Bachelor of Arts made him “ready for the challenges of public service.” He even cited Suburbs Beyond Suburbs as an example of taking initiative to improve the reputation of the town, believing that such a fresh, experimental idea would make him the clear choice for the job. He finally clicked ‘submit application’ at 3am on a Friday morning. Immediately after doing so, he realized that being that guy who is up at this hour, looking desperately for a job, was not a good look. He hoped the applications weren’t time coded, but knew they probably were. 
The rejection came through, via e-mail, two weeks later on a Friday morning. It sat in his inbox for three hours before waking at midday and opening his computer. No interview, no follow-up, no feedback, just “we are sorry to inform you blah blah blah.”

If he hadn’t been so frustrated at that moment, the images on the TV wouldn’t have had such an effect on him. For the rest of the day, while Cameron was finishing his first week at work, he thought a lot about Mitt Romney. He seemed now, after his defeat, like the least powerful man in the world: almost on par with Thomas despite his millions of dollars. But at the beginning he seemed sure of himself, in an inept sort of way. Like he only needed his own support to become President, but he didn’t always have it 100%. This was the moment he described to the reporter. Surely most public figures could trace a line in their lives from wanting to give a convincing JFK performance, to wanting to impress a single person in a large crowd, to wanting to make the place they live a better place, right through to realizing that the best jobs are the ones no one has to offer you. He left most of that off the record, simply stating that “there was this guy who ran for office and almost won, despite the fact that no one really liked him. He did it because he could. Like the campaign would boost his self-esteem, and his self-esteem would boost the campaign. I don’t know.” The reporter didn’t tape the interview, and the quote became something else later. 

When Cameron showed up after work they soon conceded defeat to an empty fridge and decided to go to the only bar in town. Thomas now had an actual idea to propose, but he made smaller talk for the first beers. 

“So, Corporate Cam. Taking the business world by storm?”

Cameron laughed. “Yeah, something like that. It’s kind of strange though, this business world.”

“Like how?”

“I don’t know. They talk about social media like they can sell you shit while being your friend. The internet’s just going to be one big business lunch when they’re done. They’ve got me working on this campaign – heavily supervised of course – for a housing development out in the hills. So they talk like they’re already your neighbour, welcoming you with muffins and letting you know that if you ever need anything they’re just next door.” He took a long sip of beer. “I guess I need to stop saying ‘they’. I’m the one driving the welcome wagon now. Or at least in the passenger seat, waving stupidly.”

“But you’re going to stick with it?”

“Yeah. If I do the knucklehead Facebook stalker stuff for a while then maybe I can get out and do something better.”

“Like politics?”

“Yeah, maybe. And anyway, there’s this really nice girl at work that-“

“What if we ran for mayor?”

“-I think might be into… wait. What?”

“I think we should run for Mayor.” 

It took a few moments of scrutiny, and half of his pint, to make out whether Thomas was serious. He finished the beer, looked his best friend in the eye, and asked, “We?”

“Well, me. But you’ll be campaign manager.”

“Why can’t I run?”

“Because I said it first.”

I really dreaded getting a full time job in Finance, and didn't get along with other people in my major. I did around 25 interviews, and didn't get offered a second interview once. I had always liked computers, but never really considered it a career. But after reading about the job market and the type of work you can do in software development, I started learning programming on the side and considered switching majors.

The guys over at /r/learnprogramming were very helpful, and this subreddit was a good source of motivation. Now, I'm finally getting decent with Java and C, I've made a few simple websites, and I'm in the process of developing an app for Android. I changed my major officially to Computer Science BS last semester, and I have an internship this coming summer as a Software Engineer at a Fortune 500 company.

And finally, with the exception of class projects and small practice exercises I've done, I'm happy to say that I've shipped my first piece of software. It's a Chrome extension called Simple Blocker:
http://simpleblocker.com/

As the name suggests, it is a simple website blocker that lets you block any number of sites to help you concentrate. You can turn on ""Enhanced Blocking"" mode if you like, which will make the app harder to remove, and password protect it. It also has a sleep timer, so you can force yourself to study for an hour or so, then reward yourself with a break. And of course, it's free. 

I thought that it would be well received in this subreddit, since a lot of people have academic or professional goals which require hours of work grinding away on a computer. Hopefully, this app can help some people concentrate and achieve their goals :)

**TL;DR: Was a miserable Finance major a year ago, now I am doing what I love with computers, and have a great internship lined up this summer as a Software Dev. [I also made an app for you guys](http://simpleblocker.com/).**

Thanks, and feedback about the app is much appreciated!"

I know it is not the end of the world, but considering this has been one of the biggest disappointment in my life it sort of makes me feel bad. I don't know... thinking about this just makes me feel like I shouldn't even graduate. The other problem is that I had an internship this semester, and I sucked at being an intern. Most of my professional critiques stated that I appeared to have no confidence in my abilities, or that I forgot simple details in my write ups. It is true that I have no confidence in my abilities, and that should have been something I need to work on but I really don't feel like putting effort into that. I really don't want to work in the industry after working as an intern. I don't know this semester has not been kind to me.

I started dating this girl during my senior year of high school when she was a junior. The summer before I left for college we really hit it off. We spent almost every day together and things went amazingly. When summer ended, I had to go to my first year of college, but we decided that we would try to make it work long distance. Everything went fine. We talked every night, I came home to see her every 2 or 3 weeks and things were working out fine. Summer came quickly and we soon celebrated our 1 year anniversary. I know that we're young, and probably stupid, but that summer we got really attached. We spent every day and night together besides going to work. We did things apart at times, but we were always together at night to sleep in the same bed. I really fell for this girl. She's the first person I've really been in love with, and I thought it could last forever. Neither of us were perfect, but together we were. I accepted her faults and she accepted mine and we started to talk about our future together. She started to say things about how she wants to marry me when the time is right, and how I'm her soul mate. And instead of running away and getting scared, I embraced it. I loved it. I was thrilled at the prospect of getting to spend the rest of my life with my best friend. Everything was better than I could have ever wanted...I didn't want to go to sleep at nights because no dream could possibly be better than what I was living. And then summer ended...and she went off to college. This is were things get confusing.

She went off to a different school and although it sucked, I never thought we would break up. We did long distance last year, why won't it work this time? The answer to that is because now SHE was in college. She went to school a week before me, and I have to admit I was really clingy that week. I had nothing to do, all my friends had already left for school, and she was off meeting tons on new people. She stopped answering my texts as frequently, and that just made me more clingy, and it was a viscous cycle. I guess being in college, with all these new 'cool' people was a lot to handle and couple that with a clingy long distance boyfriend...something had to give. And our relationship was what took the hit. We broke up. She said that she still loved me, but she didn't want to be held back by a boyfriend in school. She said it wasn't about other guys, but that's what it seemed like to me. So we broke up, and I was devastated, but it gave me some perspective on how much I was asking of her, and it gave me time to calm down. After only about a week, she said that she made I mistake. I took her back, and i made a point to be less in her face. I realized that we had separate lives at school, and as long as we could trust each other there was no reason for us to be talking non stop all the time...we had to experience college on our own. So we were back together, I saw her at school a few times and then winter break came.  We seemed to be right back to where we were in the summer. Spending every night together, talking about our futures and getting married again. Everything was perfect and then before you know it, we're going back to school again. I was worried that we would have a repeat of the beginning of last semester and that was really on my mind, but we pushed forward and everything seemed to be good for a few weeks.  And then, guess what happened? The same FUCKING thing. She wanted to break up again, same story as last time. She still really loves me, and all that stuff, but she feels like being in a relationship would be holding her back. This all came at a time when she was planning for a study abroad session, and internship in Washington D.C for next semester on top of pledging a sorority so, I think this was a decision that came out of stress. I believe that she still loves me, but she had 1 too many things on her plate...and since I was the only thing that wasn't in front of her at the time, I was what got kicked to the curb. After a year and a half I'm not saying I'm not bitter about it, idk how she can go from saying that I'm her soul mate to wanting to break up in a matter of 2 weeks, but she's screwed up in the head. I've come to know that and I love her despite it. I take her for the good and bad. And that's why it's so frustrating. When we're home together, there is no bad, there are NO issues...and then we just break up seemingly out of the blue as soon as we're a few hundred miles apart....sorry I'm rambling, anyway, back to the situation. After we broke up this time, we stayed nc for 2 months, and then I saw her last weekend. 

Last weekend I went to her house to see her. We were going to talk about where we were with the breakup. After a few months, it got easier, but it was still surreal thinking that we weren't together. So we talked, and she just got really into her sorority after we broke up. They keep her up til 6am every night, and besides that and studying there wasn't really any time to think about me. But that all changed when I went to see her. We basically both admitted that we still had the feelings for each other, but she was still adamant that a relationship in college would hold her back, but we decided to make a compromise. We both want to be together when we're home so that's what we're going to do. We never had any issues when we were home, and I don't see that changing. As far as school goes. We won't technically be together. We'll be friends, and check in occasionally, and we'll still be there for each other if the other person needs to vent, or talk or misses the other person etc. But we won't be in communications as much as we used to be when we were dating. And this was the hardest part for me to agree to, but we won't be exclusive at school. I've gotten to the point where I'm okay with this, especially since I've taken advantage of it a few times already, but she can be with other people at school, the only rule there was that it would only be physical...basically making sure I'm not being replaced and vice versa. 

So my issue is basically that I just really miss her right now. If we were dating, I'd only have to go another week or 2 without seeing her, and because of this arrangement, it'll probably be 5. I feel like since we aren't dating, since she wants her space at school, there are somethings I can't ask her. I can't text her every day, I can't hear her voice every day, and I can't ask if I can come down to see her, I feel like that would be a little weird. I want to be with her as much as I can, and once the summer comes, everything will be fine, but getting to that point is going to be tough. It'll take some getting used to, I just hope I can do it. I see a future with this girl. Whether I'm insane, or just holding onto somebody that she used to be I don't know, but I still want to be with her for the rest of my life. That's why I'm trying to hard to  make this work. I'm putting so much into this, for little output from her. But I've accepted that. I love her for her best and worst qualities. At home, I get nothing but the best, and at school, right now...I'm getting some of the worst. "

This is something our church has begun doing with men whom they believe may make good elders.  It's kind of an Elder internship.  After a period of time, the church will confirm a nomination to Elder by vote.

I am a longstanding and beloved member of my church.  I am theologically minded and know the scriptures.  My areas of weakness are in daily meditative disciplines, and my strengths are in relationship management and facilitating grace and hospitality between other believers.  I also am very good at seeing whether or not an issue can pass the smell test, even if I don't have specific scripture recall on a topic.  

One of my hesitations is I am concerned that taking on this role of servanthood may cause others to withdraw from me, or other young men in the church, who are now my friends, to resent me.  

Of course, I know that should God call me to this I should submit and serve in this way.

1c0cw3,0,2013-04-09,"Can someone explain what's ""HD"" about ""AoE II: HD""? The latest hyped debacle?",top5a,aoe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1c0cw3/can_someone_explain_whats_hd_about_aoe_ii_hd_the/,"That feeling.  I know there's a good chance that you know what I'm talking about if you were insatiably excited when a refreshed AoE II was announced.  And, perhaps, when you even pre-ordered the game.  Fast forward a few months.  Do you feel fulfilled?

Now, AoE II: HD (from now on referred to as AOEHD) has been released, and...  you may be asking yourself.. what are the pros and cons between AOEHD and the original?  Can you justifiably rationalize that ~$20 purchase?  What's different between firing up your old copy of AoE II (with the Conquerors, or Forgotten Empires, etc.), and playing with some friends over Hamachi or Tunngle (along with the now famous 1.0e patch)?

Well, when I made my pre-order, two things came to mind.

1.)  Steam multiplayer matchmaking.  No more sitting in lobbies and IRC threads waiting for a scrim (let alone finding a somewhat balanced group).  Friends list on Steam, and the prospects of auto-matchmaking groups/singles, which, in my opinion, has similarly been a saving grace for CS:GO.  Some sort of modified ""ELO"" or ladder system.

2.)  Workshop.  No more downloading, extracting, and replacing game files.  Not that this is difficult, per se, but, remember when you had to attempt to get your friends to download the same map, from the same site, only to find out that they had the incorrect version of the file?  Or, maybe they didn't have the correct patch?  Steam naturally fixes these issues through constant updates, along with the ability to download and install/uninstall mods with a single click.

Notice that there is no point 3 for compatibility in this list.  Why not?  Because, afaict through my own experience, as well as those of friends who play the game, AoE II, with the 1.0e patch, works quite well in Windows 7.  This famous patch, which has been out for years and years, also added improved TCP/IP support, which works as well.

So, what is AOEHD like for me (and, judging by other threads on here, as well as a significant portion of AOEHD players in the official Steam forums)?

Abysmal **framerates**.  Less than 10fps after only several minutes of play.  How an RTS game from the 90s -- that's right, the 90s -- is so infinitely choppy on a modern machine is beyond me.  OK, I'm a programmer, and I admit that I realize there are apparently some architectural changes with regard to how the sprites and textures are being processed.  But, if I'm able to blow SC2, in all its 3D glory, out of the water, there's no excuse as to why AOEHD should be choppy.  One might argue that, well, it's supposed to be nostalgic, and that animations of the sprites were kept at the same pacing with the same frames.  Sure, no problem.  But, why does that mean, when I scroll across the screen, even this simple operation of moving the viewable window /completely/ chugs.  Or, that when more than a handful of sprites are present on the screen, the game is rendered almost unplayable.  But, alas, here's the real issue.... these problems, at least for me and those to whom I have spoken, /do not exist in the original AoE II/ !  So, in effect, AOEHD is far **worse**, in this regard, to the pre-existing product it is supposed to supplant!

**Networking**.  TCP/IP has already been included in the old AoE II, at least with the expansions and/or 1.0e patch.  I am easily able to play online with friends, with very low pings.  If I am in the middle of a game, and something happens with the network, a turtle or rabbit will appear next to the player name, indicating network issues.  If things get really messed up, everyone knows that familiar ""Waiting for Player"" message which occurs (same thing in any other modern RTS game...), whilst the game states synchronize.  Sometimes you have to wait for a second or two... big deal.  Play continues.  What happens now?  I've attempted three 1v1 matches online.  Approximately five minutes into each of these games, the game will dump me to the title screen, complaining of an Out of Sync error.  There was no Waiting for Player.  The game just saves the current state, and exits.  If the state is able to be saved, why doesn't the game just ""wait"" until resync?  Instead, I'm forced to attempt to remake a lobby and hope that the random other person will join.... yea, this never works (probably because both of us are doing this..).  There's no easy way to reconnect... but, if the gamestate can be saved into a resumable state, /why does it exit in the first place/?  This makes absolutely **no logical sense whatsoever** to me.

A side note about the networking... depending on the type of game I select from the quick match menu, the entire AOEHD application will crash out.  If I select Random Map, it's usually ok.  But any other mode, complete crash.  Who coded this?  I can't even imagine how terrible the exception handling is such that, by selecting an option prior to attempting to search a lobby, a complete application crash will be consistently reached.  Was there literally zero testing of this game?  But, I digress.

Now, let's assume that the framerate, networking, and crashing bugs didn't exist.  What are we left with?  Surely, there must be a little extra assumed in ""HD"" releases of games?  I don't expect much -- after all, I realize the nostalgic factor for which the devs (or single intern dev, I should say, because I'd hate to believe more than a single intern worked on this release, judging by its almost comically shoddy quality [I'd laugh more if they didn't have $20 from me]) may be striving.  But... come on.  Really?  The color of the fire is different.  The steak icon for food was replaced by.. some goldish thing I can't quite discern on my 1920x1200 monitor.  There are giant yellow maize blobs on the farms.  How about the opening menu?  Maybe some cool effects?  Or, at least, a, should a say, ""HD"" version of the old menu?  Nope.  Simply a grossly enlarged and blurry version of the original.  No ""crispening.""  Just enlarged, blurry, /exactly/ the same.  I'm not expecting something like realMYST, but perhaps the option to enable, for example, a non-blurry game menu would be nice.

So, I ask you, the community, what is ""HD"" about this game?  What, even, is this game?  AOEHD can't even replicate working functionality from its alleged predecessor, let alone brings nothing new to the table except for a /few/ color swatch changes.

Lastly, what are the meta-implications of this type of a release?  ""release to the community and let them fix it?""  This is somewhat plausible, given the somewhat commendable cycle of patches to games released on Steam (yes I know Steam is just the distributor, but, you know what I mean).  But, not to this extent.  It appears as though almost zero testing, let alone beta testing, was performed.  On a game that **lost significant functionality**.

Thoughts?  I don't want this to seem just like a rant -- I'd rather it can be a discussion of what we, as a diverse group of gamers, expect from our ""HD"" re-releases.  And what went so terribly wrong with AOEHD.  Or, even if you disagree with me completely :P

**Edit:** Wow, post a critical comment, get lots of downvotes!  :O  Must be all the Hidden Path developers @_@

1c0c2s,12,2013-04-09,Help out a young intern do his first office level solution.,port274,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1c0c2s/help_out_a_young_intern_do_his_first_office_level/,"I am a intern (read: tech everything) at a small business moving into a much larger office and the current hardware I have setup is not going to last long in the new space, and I have some goals I want to reach with the new setup and frankly, am starting to feel out of my league. 

A little background about the curent situation:
We have a pc I put together way back around christmas 2011 in the companies old office (the company being about 6 people other than me). This pc was to serve as a combined fileserver for backups (via time-machine for the most part as the office loves OSX over Windows), workstation for certain windows only software, and, if possible, create a VPN since employees often go to meetings in other cities.

The specs of the pc are irrelevant as I intend to relegate it to just a workstation now. I had it do all that by running a FreeNas VM for the time-machine backups, several HDDs in RAID (1) storing the backups, and a gigabit line linking it into the network, which was comprised of a cisco linksys router. Creating a VPN or FTP server was impossible as far as I could tell because the office building our office was leased from did not itself allow these services and blocked anything like it :( .

Now, over a year later, we are moving to a much larger office and are expected to grow to, within reason, to about 25 employees for the duration of our stay there. And I need to set up a whole new network. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I appreciate any help that can be given, and I will study any materials that can be provided. Now onto what I think the new setup should have.

Rack of at least 25U

Router.
Firewall.
VPN for outside connections so that office user files can be accessed.
Fileserver for backups and storage.
(I space these like this because they can be combined, I am inexperienced with rack-mounted equipment so I am asking for recommendations of any kind.)

Backup capabilities with time machine and windows.

A business internet line from Verizon is looking to be the most likely, if that affects anything, such as modems.

Sorry if I am way out of my league, but I have experience with all three major operating systems (more so OSX and Windows, but some on Linux as well), and manage my school's website (taking over this job right now actually). I also have experience with C++ and Java. 

Thanks for any and all assistance that can be provided, components, sites, vendors, tutorials, anything.

So, finally, Reddit, I beg of thee, hear my plee and assist.
sincerely, 
      -port274

edit 1: grammer mistakes.

edit 2: Outside consultant is not really possible, its just not high enough on the priority list to bother. To give you an idea we were using building wifi for a while, and my system was only really there for centralized backups. (small edit: Its main reason for being implemented was for backups)

Budget wise the cap is not really set in stone, under $5,000 would be a good starting point. To give an outline of the office, everyone either uses a iMac, Macbook(Pro), both, and the odd windows laptop and of course the workstation/server I put together before. Up to 20-25 people would be working in this office, not counting conference room users, who would have a direct ethernet line available to a router/switch that would be connected to the fileserver, where, if possible, Timemachine would back up their respective machines. Each employee is, more the most part, independent and often the laptops leave the office (security risks I know, but its not something I can affect), so an additional security measure here would be a good idea if I were to say so myself, perhaps another firewall? Beyond that a VPN solution would be nice to allow for the employee's security as well as to provide them access to their files incase they forget a presentation on their iMac when they took their laptops to the meeting. I can also provide a rough layout of the office taken from a top down drawing if that helps. 

anything other information that can be helpful please ask in the comments.

Thank you for any help you can provide

I also had more stress. I told myself when I started smoking that I would never become dependent on it, for any reason. I had a wake up call halfway through the year when I started dealing to my stoner friends in order to cover the amount of money I was spending on pot.  I was, and still ashamed that I was doing this, and quit selling shortly before I came back for my second semester. I still had a problem where I was smoking too much and was using it to relieve all my school-related anxiety.  I would carve out the most random, and worst times to smoke so that I could cope with all my school, work, and stress.

Fast forward to spring break: I smoked on spring break with a lot of my old friends from back home, and had a great time. However, the last night I was there, none of my friends were getting back to me, I was feeling down and anxious about school yet again, and stayed up real late so that I could smoke on my back porch like I used to. (I have to tip-toe around my parents)

It was during this smoke sesh that I had little epiphany, I was dependent. I was doing what I had told myself and all my concerned (and apparently right) friends all along. I was using weed to cope and escape. I was not smoking to have a good time, nor was I even having fun with it anymore. I was bored, dependent, and done.

I downloaded a little app onto my Droid phone the next morning, and started keeping track of the days. I've been clean since then, and things are really looking up. I even got an internship at an Air Force base as a research intern for this summer, and it is somewhat difficult for freshmen to get internships (at least as engineering students).

If you're trying to quit, take a minute and just be honest with yourself. Sometimes its so hard to be true to yourself, and hold yourself to your own promises, but when you're trying to quit, that's the only way to do things. Good luck!

tldr:I quit because I realized I was dependent on it, which is something I promised myself I would never be. If you're honest with yourself, you can do it, I promise:)

I'll be getting about 1.000,- euro's, which is about 4.900 AED a month. 


So with that information:

1) Is 4900 a month enough for covering the expenses of an appartment, and food/drinks.

2) Anything I should watch out for while traveling? 

3) Even though I'll have a full-time job, what are some of the things the youth does in their free time in Dubai, moreso, where can I meet new people?

I grew up in a loving family that was there for me and supported me 100% financially through college. I went to the school I loved and met the love of my life there. Problem is, I hate my major. I studied petroleum engineering because my parents picked it and did a good job of convincing me that it held a successful future for me. It has so far provided me with good summer internships that paid well and a current job that looks amazing on paper (salary, 401k, health, vision, and dental). Problem is that I have absolutely no passion for the oil industry. I am now much more progressive-minded than when I left for college and I just do not fit in anywhere in this industry. My job isn't all that bad, but when things are slow I start thinking and I'm not where I want to be and I can't even decide where I want to be or where I'm going. The only certainty I have is that I love my fiancee and want to spend the rest of my life with her. Things are going so well for her at her job and it kills me that I cannot be content with mine. I don't know why I'm writing this.. I guess I'm hoping someone out there will say something that helps, but chances are you are thinking the same thing as me: ""get the fuck over it. You have it made. Just keep your nose to the grindstone and enjoy your comfortable lifestyle.""

I just can't. Work is painful (for no known reason). Commuting in this city is painful. Working on a career I don't give a fuck about is killing me. Going back to school doesn't seem possible in my mind and any career in corporate America makes me want to lay down in a hole and die. All these negative thoughts are only perpetuating the problem.

I am a part time grad student and will work full time, she is a full time PhD student who works an internship 3 days and classes 2 days. We are both used to dealing with more or less a 9-5 schedule.

I was just offered an IT position for a swing shift (between 2-11), M-F. I am afraid this will be tough, especially with our new living arrangement. 

What are some ways we can make this work? How can I talk to her and reassure her that, while it most likely won't always be easy, we will be able to get through it. It also will not be forever.

Any advice is appreciated. We usually have a seamless relationship, but I'm concerned with this coming up just as we are about to start living together.

TLDR; Moving in with gf, will be working evenings (2-11). How can we make it work?"

Please hjälp.",riversharkmkII,sweden,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/1bz9pe/i_am_looking_for_some_help_understanding_my/,"This is bound to be a contentious post, but please try to understand the reasons I am doing this before flaming me.

I have lived in Sweden for nearly 5 years, have worked, gone to school, and paid taxes. I have been unemployed/aktivitetstöd since June and have survived until now through that and my savings while looking for a job and doing an internship. I am on the lowest tier of unemployment which means I pull in around 4000/month from that. It is not enough to survive off of with student loans in the states, rent, and food. 

Recently I was offered a job with an online company, but with the caveat that the hours arent guaranteed. It could be 20 hours per week, but it is more likely to be an average of 0-5 hours per week. No guarantees whatsoever. This job requires an F-skatt. I have a company on hold but am unable to obtain an F-skatt while still qualifying for unemployment. This means I am in the position to either have a guaranteed 4000kr/month or a possible range from 0-7000kr/month (erring on the lower side of it).

I have contacted Alfakassan and arbetsförmedlingen to see if there are any possible ways for me to pull in ANY additional income while on unemployment and was told this is not possible. 

I am hoping, that those of you with experience with any of these aspects, could tell me if there are ANY possibilities that were not addressed by these two organizations. I really would prefer not to do anything illegal, but I also would really like to be able to survive while I continue looking for a job which requires more than unemployment can provide. 

In anticipation of comments regarding me, as an immigrant, trying to take advantage of the Swedish Welfare system, I would say that I am just trying to explore ALL of my options. I am a Swedish citizen, I am extremely active in my job search, I look for internships to spend my time wisely, I have paid my fair share of taxes, and I would very much like to continue doing so but that requires a job which requires me to survive while looking for one, which requires more than 4000kr/month. 

All of that being said, I am truly appreciative of any input you can give.

1byqn3,3,2013-04-08,College Funding Help?,FinancialHelpThrower,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1byqn3/college_funding_help/,"So here's my situation: (throwaway because of personal info)

I'm a senior in high school who is planning on going to go to a college that costs a total of $46,000.

But here's the problem..

My parents are divorced and they both are classified as ""disabled"" by the government. They claim government assistance to cover all of their financial needs and do not have jobs. My stepfather is a Navy vet and receives money for his time there. Together, my stepfather and mother ""earn"" $15,000 a year, while my dad earns something less than that. My parents have not gone through college, and I would like to be the first in my family to do so. Unfortunately, they can't contribute to the cost of college.

I have been accepted to this college (and a few others, but my mind is pretty set) and so far have taken the steps to get financial aid. My financial award amounts to $27,000, using a combination of grants and loans. that leaves roughly $19,000 a year for me to cover (this college is a five year school). Now, I have done some research into loans and the different types and providers, but I'm not sure I will qualify for these loans (no credit/parents have bad credit) or if they will even cover the costs of college. The things is, even if I get these loans, that's around $100,000 in loans once I'm all done.

I am going to school for engineering and I'm fairly certain that these loans can be managed as long as I get a quality job after college, but that's a gamble. Right now, my income is limited and I have nothing saved for school. I recently had an (unpaid) internship with a company that just hired me today, so I'm going to start earning some money (to the tune of $500 a month) and hopefully I can manage to save the majority of this before college starts.

So my questions are, what should I do? How am I going to afford this? (loans? if so from where?) And what advice do you have for someone in my position?"
1bygi6,0,2013-04-08,"I’m a 19-year-old college student who has never left the United States, and I’m about to go to China for 9 months. Help!",[deleted],China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1bygi6/im_a_19yearold_college_student_who_has_never_left/,"**TLDR: Going to Beijing in May, staying there for 9 months and have no idea WTF I’m doing.** 


I’m a college student, leaving in May to spend 9 months in China. First I have a week-long tour of Jiangsu province that is part of an award I won through my school. Then I have one free day to get to Beijing and find a place to stay before I start an internship for 3 months. After the internship, I will have about a week before I begin a semester at Peking University. I will be doing all of this by myself, and I have never left the United States before. So I’m really confused and looking for advice. 


I should probably add that I know a decent amount of Chinese, I’m taking Advanced Chinese right now and can communicate pretty easily about simple topics. 

Specific items:

* **Visa:** I’ll probably make a visa-specific post in /r/chinesevisa if needed, but my situation is pretty complicated. It seems like I’ll need a tourist visa, a work visa, AND a student visa. But it seems like you aren’t able to get more than one type of Chinese visa at once? I talked to a few travel agents and one of them recommended telling my company to request me to arrive in China a week before my internship starts, so I’ll be able to get into China for the tour and stay for the internship. I contacted the company and they are working on it. But could this potentially get me in trouble? Also, how would I change my work visa to a student visa when it is time for me to start school?


* **Money:** My internship pays a receipt based stipend (they called it Vaipo?) of 1000RMB a month. Is this enough to cover living expenses for the duration of my internship? I’m doubtful because I heard that apartments in Beijing are really expensive right now. Luckily, my flight to China will be free because of the award I won, I’ll just need to pay for a flight or train ride from Nanjing to Beijing. Aside from that, I have about $800USD saved up. Worst case scenario, I could take out a loan (I already have some student loans so a bit more wouldn’t be a huge deal). I also heard about making money by teaching English on the side? How does this work? Is it feasible to do this while also working a full-time internship?

Once the semester at Beida begins, my financial aid will cover mostly everything, and I’ll be living for free in a friend’s spare apartment that is too far from my internship to live in during the summer, but it is right next to Beida. So money is really only a concern for the summer.


* **Housing:** I’m trying to find a place to stay in/near the Chaoyang district for 3 months during the summer. I asked my company for help with this and they sent me  http://www.thebeijinger.com/classifieds which isn’t too helpful. Any advice about this process will be greatly appreciated. I’m only going to have 1 day in Beijing before my internship starts, so I probably need to figure out housing beforehand. Worst-case scenario, I can stay at a hostel or a friend’s apartment with his parents (he’ll be in America) for a few days to figure out where I’m living. Since my stipend is only 1000RMB a month, I’m looking for the cheapest apartment possible that is still safe, liveable, and a convenient distance to my internship. 


* **Banking:** My study abroad advisor said that I may need to open up a bank account in China, since my debit card likely won’t work over there, and I don’t want to have to pay ATM fees. How does this work? Should I do it?


* **Cell phone:** Using a Verizon phone right now, so I don’t think it will work in China. My study abroad adviser recommended buying a Chinese phone to use while I’m there. What’s the best way to go about this?


* **Stuff to bring:** What should I make sure to bring with me? For the week-long tour, I’m just going to have a suitcase and a backpack, so I can’t bring a lot with me. I can, however, mail things to a friend in Beijing and pick them up when I get there. I know I should bring a big supply of  personal hygiene products because the American brands are hard to find in China. What about medication? I have several prescriptions that aren’t serious, just skin care and birth control medication. Should I mail a 9-months’ worth supply to myself, or should I be able to get those things from a Chinese pharmacy? Is Chinese mail trustworthy for mailing valuable items?


Sorry about the huge wall of text. I am slightly terrified about these next 10 months. Please share with me any advice you have to offer. 


Also, if you are a female redditor living in/near chaoyang district of Beijing and are looking for someone to share an apartment with, PM me. Or if you know a female living in/near chaoyang district that is looking for someone to share an apartment with, please PM me their contact info. Thanks!

I have worked hard the last four years taking rigorous Japanese classes to learn the language as well as I possibly can in America. Furthermore I have been actively pursuing a degree in computer information systems. My hard work has paid off and I have been given one of ONLY TWO spots on an exchange program at Soka University in Japan. This trip starts my endeavor to live in Japan because while I am there for a year I will be actively looking for a job and an apartment. This trip will give me both the experience to live among Japanese people to learn Japanese as it is really spoken in Japan as well as the understanding of what it is like in the business world and interpersonal world of Japan.
This page is dedicated to helping me raise money towards the exchange's cost, tuition, airfare, etc. I currently work all morning, go to school all afternoon, and am picking up an internship over the summer to help my finances. However, as everyone knows, Japan is quite expensive, so I am reaching out to the masses for some assistance. I have already used up all my financial aid (HOPE Scholarship) by taking classes above and beyond to help my career. I refuse to let money stop me from attaining my dreams of being fluent in Japanese as well as living and working there. 
I have never tried to get money assistance outside of what I earned academically with my grades such as HOPE scholarship and Pell Grant. However, I am now asking for any help anyone can give to me. No donation is too small and will always be appreciated and recognized!

1c1gcm,1,2013-04-09,Long Distance SO is coming to see me after almost 1.5 years... And my parents aren't thrilled. Help.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1c1gcm/long_distance_so_is_coming_to_see_me_after_almost/,"SO is on the same sub, so details are limited: we met online 5 years ago, met in person 2 years ago (and have been exclusive since) are in college, and are LD.

Started last summer. He had an out of state internship and met a lot of new people, was working often, and just started acting very distant and barely talking to me as a result. I was confused, hurt and I really didn't know what to do other than to ask him if anything had changed, if he met someone else, or if he personally was okay. I *calmly* asked him several times (via several different communication methods) what was going on, and every time he would give me one-word answers, or act totally callous about it. I felt completely abandoned and lost, so I ended up asking if he wanted to break-up. He said no, and assured me everything was alright, that he was busy and he still loved me.

The same issue came to a head about 2 weeks later, (when I had started my internship). I asked him what he wanted, if he wanted to be with me, and the same questions as before regarding changing feelings/meeting people. He could not answer a single question. I had had enough and decided to break up. I was crushed. (I said we could be friends, but didn't expect much.) Called my best friend, then my parents (they are who I talk to because they've been married for a long time and can see through the bullshit in a lot of situations that my friends can't). I told them what happened, cried it out (for the umpteenth time) and they gave me advice: stay friends with him, take time being single, etc. They are very protective of me and liked my SO, in fact he was their favorite out of anyone I've brought home.

A week and a half goes by with no contact from him. I was okay with that, I could focus on my job at the time and start to get over it (at this point it had been a year and a half relationship). Then he texted me, and called me, said he missed me, the whole nine. Finally, he asked if we could ""talk"" - I said fine. We talked, and told me everything I needed to hear two weeks prior. He told me he knew what he wanted, but thought it would affect my happiness, so didn't tell me until I asked again. He said he wanted me, and had made a huge mistake. That he loved me and wanted to be with me. I was uncertain whether I could trust him at that point, so I said we could keep in touch.

At first we set boundaries (no sexting/webcam/flirting) because we were *not* in a relationship anymore. About a month of this, I realized I definitely still loved him, and he said he felt the same way. I was fed up with ""playing by the rules"" and we just did what we wanted to do as far as expressing our feelings.

Fast-forward to now. I feel like our relationship is stronger, and we have had serious talks (cohabitation!) about our future together after college. I trust him, he is all the more conscious to my mild paranoia about things (which has calmed significantly) and we take more time to do things together, even with the distance. I am still very in love with him, so please **no shitty comments**.

The issue is that after the problems we had over the summer and numerous scheduling conflicts, we haven't actually seen each other in 15 months. He's coming to visit me this summer (I live at home when I'm not at school). I'm very excited and happy to see him, but my parents... I've brought this to their attention, but they have both shown lackluster responses to my suggestions about ""maybe going to dinner"" with my SO and me. I desperately want them to reconcile or at least be civil without it being awkward. I feel like if I try to get them to reconcile it will be forced and I just want my parents to be happy for me and my SO to be comfortable around them.

I know my parents just love me and want me to be happy and not get hurt, but how can I improve this situation? Asked my friends, discussed it with my parents and SO (separately)... Reddit, I turn to you.

**TL;DR**: My SO and I had problems last summer which delayed us seeing each other for 15 months. Now he's coming to see me again and because I was upset over our issues, my parents don't approve. How do I go about this? Thanks in advance."

Just turned 20, studying in college bi(lean towards gay) and with ADHD and I feel completely and utterly alone at the moment.

This year started off kind of great, living with my best friend and his girlfriend (stupid mistake but I guess I have to experience it to learn from it.) It was good except things started to go south (no pun intended) with my ADHD habits coming out especially with houseworks (note that the best friend also has ADHD but undiagnosed.) And s*** just got worse and worse. We haven't talked for 2-3 weeks now with him trying to kick me out (legally he can't but haven't explained that to him yet knowing he wouldn't be able to understand it with his naive and somewhat ehem, stupid, mind.)

And I don't have anyone I can talk to, college counseling is next to useless, not a great family relationship (haven't came out and they are against homosexuality) and with exams piling up, I can't ask my friends to always be there for me (which is what I need to not breakdown every fifteen minutes or so.)

Besides, on the outside, I seem to not have any worry in the world, a top in the class student, a president of a big club, summer internship opportunity (I'm honestly not being narcissistic, I'm just trying to put things to context because I do hate talking about shit in my life and pretty much always end up talking about the positive part and helping other people with their problems.) But nobody knows that I'm breaking down inside. Nobody came to my birthday this year (bad combination of timing and emergencies and some delayed flights) and so I spent my birthday drinking by myself in a bar. Pathetic right?

What should I do?

1c1czg,7,2013-04-09,I'm a 16 year old high school student who wrote a paper on why the Magic's rebuilding plan is the future blueprint for NBA teams. Thought I'd share it here.,jags14,OrlandoMagic,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1c1czg/im_a_16_year_old_high_school_student_who_wrote_a/,"On August 9th, 2012 I sat glued to my phone roughly 4,000 miles from home in the wild frontier state of Alaska. My favorite basketball team, the Orlando Magic, was about to execute the most important transaction in franchise history. The player I had spent my entire childhood worshipping, Dwight Howard, had publicly requested a trade almost a year before and had led the entire sports world, for that year, on what is now referred to as the Dwight-mare. He requested and unrequested a trade multiple times, threw teammates under the bus, and effectively had the Magic’s General Manager and Head Coach fired. I refreshed the ESPN app on my phone and my eyes saw the fateful line that revealed Dwight Howard had been traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in a four-team deal. The man behind all of this was the mysterious, enigmatic 30-year-old General Manager the Magic had hired just weeks before, Rob Hennigan. The rest of the NBA didn’t know at the time but Hennigan had just shown the NBA how to effectively rebuild a team. The Orlando Magic’s rebuilding plan, directly influenced by Oklahoma City and San Antonio, is the future blueprint for how to rebuild an NBA team.
	The story doesn’t actually begin in Orlando, but deep in the heart of Texas in the river city of San Antonio in the fall of 2004. A young broadcast journalism graduate and basketball player from Emerson College in Massachusetts had just scored the internship of a lifetime with the San Antonio Spurs (ESPN). He performed odd jobs including taking recently acquired players house hunting in the San Antonio area. Hennigan was a quick study, and in 2005 was promoted to be the team’s basketball operations assistant helping lead them to back-to-back championships in 2004/2005 and 2006/2007 (Wikipedia). In the 2007 campaign, Hennigan was promoted to be the director of basketball operations for the Spurs and the following year, left to become the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Director of College/International Scouting (Wikipedia). During his two years as the Director, he was responsible for drafting Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka, who developed into the core for their 2012 team that lost in the NBA Finals to the Miami Heat. Due to his success, he was promoted for his final two years in Oklahoma City to assistant General Manager under the acclaimed Sam Presti (Wikipedia). On June 20th 2012, the Orlando Magic concluded that Rob Hennigan was the General Manager that would return them to greatness (Orlandomagic.com).
Hennigan learned the necessity of landing talented draft picks in his years in San Antonio and Oklahoma City, and planned on taking this approach in Orlando. The Magic’s old General Manager, Otis Smith, drafted players he hadn’t actually scouted and consistently wasted draft picks on players who are not in the league anymore. In 2005, Smith made one of the most monumental mistakes in draft history by drafting Fran Vasquez with the 11th pick overall. Vasquez, a Spanish post player, to this day has never played a single game for the Magic due to his desire to continue playing professionally in Spain. 
Hennigan, after intense scouting, was tasked with adding two promising young players with the 19th and 49th overall picks (ESPN). When the 19th pick arrived, Hennigan had a few different directions he could have chosen to go. Perry Jones III and Jared Sullinger two big conference players who had been free falling down the draft board were available but Hennigan stuck to his scouting. He selected Andrew Nicholson, a 4 year physics major and basketball star from tiny St. Bonaventure College in Western New York as his first pick in Orlando. Nicholson was fresh off a near upset of Florida State in the NCAA Tournament and scouts raved about his mature post up game and wisdom beyond years. Most reviews of the draft overlooked Nicholson, but he currently averages 8.1 points and 3.4 rebounds per game and was named to the 2013 BBVA Rising Stars Game for the top rookies and sophomore players in the NBA (ESPN). Ranked by scoring, Nicholson ranks ninth among rookies and ESPN has gone as far as comparing him to Utah Jazz All Star Al Jefferson (ESPN).
With the 49th pick, Hennigan pulled the trigger on the 23-year-old Power Forward from Norfolk State University, Kyle O’Quinn. O’Quinn became known for a performance that helped 15 seeded Norfolk State knock off 2 seeded Missouri in the NCAA Tournament in one of the biggest upsets ever. O’Quinn initially had to fight for playing time, but carved a firm position in the Magic’s rotation, currently averaging 7 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game in his last ten games and 4 points and 3.3 rebounds for the season (ESPN). Now, nearly done with their first NBA campaign, Hennigan’s two hand picked rookies have solidified his reputation of efficiently rebuilding through the draft.
On July 9th Hennigan made his first trade, which ended up working out terrifically for Orlando. Hennigan sent away fan favorite and reigning NBA Most Improved Player, Ryan Anderson, to New Orleans for Gustavo Ayon, a promising Mexican center. Ryan Anderson was a free agent and was close to a deal to sign with New Orleans so Hennigan wisely acquired Ayon and a trade exception instead of letting Anderson walk without anything in return. A Trade Exception or the NBA’s version of store credit is an extremely valuable commodity to have as a rebuilding franchise. This trade served as a precursor for the Magic’s midseason trade to acquire Tobias Harris, Doron Lamb, and Beno Udrih for JJ Redick, Gustavo Ayon, and Ishmael Smith. Tobias Harris, a sophomore player buried in Milwaukee’s rotation, caught Hennigan’s eye as an intriguing asset when the Magic decided it would be superfluous to resign Redick at the price he would command. Since acquiring Harris, his averages have rose from 4.9 points, 2.5 assists, 0.5 assists, and 0.3 blocks a game to 16.3 points, 8 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 1.4 blocks a game (ESPN). Redick is unlikely to even resign with Milwaukee so Hennigan is being applauded for acquiring a potential all-star talent without giving up major assets in return. Trade success and hitting on your draft picks are two sure fire ways to rebuild your team effectively and efficiently as Hennigan has demonstrated so far. 
After Hennigan’s success in the draft and his first trade, it was time to add a head coach to lead the franchise. Hennigan decided upon former NBA player and San Antonio Spurs Assistant Coach, Jacque Vaughn, on July 28th, 2012 (ESPN). Vaughn played college ball at the University of Kansas where he was the all time assists leader and played 12 seasons in the NBA with Utah, Atlanta, Orlando, New Jersey, and San Antonio (Wikipedia). After retiring in 2009, Vaughn joined San Antonio’s coaching staff where he eventually became legendary coach Greg Popovich’s top assistant. Vaughn also played for the famous Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan in his time in Utah as a player. Hennigan cited his main reasons for hiring Vaughn were his experience with elite head coaches and his commitment to talent development and character. Vaughn has done a tremendous job developing the young players that Hennigan acquired through the draft and in trades. Nikola Vucevic, a second year player acquired in the Dwight Howard deal, has averaged 12.5 points and 11.5 rebounds under Vaughn’s watch and Maurice Harkless, also a part of the Dwight Howard deal, has shown tremendous potential as a versatile rookie swingman averaging 7.6 points per game and 4.4 rebounds a game with Vaughn at the helm. (ESPN) Vaughn has earned major respect from coaches around the league and has an extremely bright coaching future.
On August 9th, 2012 the time had finally had come to trade Dwight Howard. The Magic ended up receiving Aaron Affalo, Al Harrington, Moe Harkless, Nikola Vucevic, Josh McRoberts, Christian Eyenga, and five protected picks (3 firsts and 2 seconds) from the three other teams involved (ESPN). Aaron Affalo has turned out to be an integral veteran scoring force. He is currently averaging 16.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game (ESPN). Harrington struggled with injuries most of the year but has a tradable contract to be used in future acquisitions. McRoberts and Eyenga are both no longer with the team and were included to make the salaries work out. The media including Jacob Lee of Bleacher Report who called Hennigan “the most inept GM in the association” initially slammed the young General Manager. Hennigan and the Magic got the last laugh however with Dwight Howard and the Lakers clawing to make the playoffs in the West, and Philadelphia decimated by Andrew Bynum’s eighty year old like knees keeping him from putting on a 76er uniform this year. The Magic and Nuggets made out like bandits with Orlando acquiring Vucevic, who has emerged as a franchise center, Affalo, and Harkless who looks to be the swingman of the future. The Nuggets, after acquiring Andre Iguodala, have propelled themselves to the 3rd overall seed in the Western Conference and seem poised for a deep playoff run (ESPN). Hennigan had once again proved his blueprint was a winning one and he was a phenom that warranted attention. 
As of right now, the Magic sit at 19-54, which is good enough for second worst in the NBA (ESPN). You might be wondering about how the Orlando Magic’s rebuilding plan is the future blueprint if their record is that bad. What wins and losses can’t measure is establishing an identity as a team and young player development. Coach Vaughn has established a strong identity of character and leadership in the locker room and the players have responded. Magic players constantly are in the community serving meals, reading books to kids, and building playgrounds. The team has become a family, and unlike the years before there is absolutely no drama or turmoil in the locker room. The Magic have five players all under the age of 23, who play significant time on the court and have made an immediate impact. Hennigan learned this approach of tearing the team down, acquiring young talent and draft picks, and gaining cap flexibility during his years helping rebuild Oklahoma City and San Antonio. In fact, the Magic are right on pace with their role models, Oklahoma City, who finished 2008-2009 with a 23-59 record overall (ESPN). The Thunder now one of the top three teams in the entire NBA due to their diligent, wise rebuilding tactics. The main reason the Magic are rebuilding right now is due to the rudimentary mistakes made by their old GM, who didn’t build through the draft, created salary cap hell, and ultimately drove the team into the ground. Hennigan’s approach to running a team is all about sustained success through the tactics mentioned above. Doubt him now but know you’ll look silly when Hennigan returns the Magic to glory.

1c12yv,2,2013-04-09,Getting evicted for the third time. Can't get any worse. Not much hope left.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1c12yv/getting_evicted_for_the_third_time_cant_get_any/,"To make a long story short, my family was a dysfunctional but financially-stable middle class family. In 2010, we had a major falling out with a relative who was kindly providing us with a place to stay, so since then, every single year we've had to move from a good house to a crap house, to a REALLY crappy house. Along the way, we've had our already-small family fall apart. My aunt died a terrible death from lung cancer, and my older brother is on the streets.

It's currently me, my aging, somewhat-ill mother, and my controlling, verbally-abusive other brother. I've been unemployed for a year, and my brother's been guilt-tripping me, saying that we wouldn't be in this situation if I got a job and paid the rent...something he doesn't do with a full-time job. So, now we're probably going to have to move to an even worse place...in an even worse neighborhood...and my depression will get even worse.

I've heard the ""new house, new beginning!"" line so many times, it's almost an insult. Things have got progressively worse, my family is nonexistent, my friends have all left me, and I'm psychologically, emotionally, and physically a mess. While everyone I once knew is enjoying college, getting internships and having fun, I'm getting poorer and poorer, isolating myself more and more, and crying myself to sleep each night knowing that the future is bleak.

How the hell can I make it through **this** one?

**TL;DR - My family has become impoverished and completely fallen-apart. My mother and I, after being evicted for the third time, are going to have to move into a crappy two-bedroom apartment, while I work a crappy full-time job in order to support the two of us, as she's starting to get old, and her health isn't looking too good.**"
1c66ey,1,2013-04-11,My CeaseFirePA Story,[deleted],progun,https://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/1c66ey/my_ceasefirepa_story/,"On December 8th, 2011, a shooter entered the campus of Virginia Tech, killed a cop, and then committed suicide when he spotted another law enforcement officer. On that same day, I received an email with the subject line of “BREAKING NEWS ALERT” from a group I had never heard of: CeaseFirePA. The letter, from their then-director Max Nacheman, just linked to a CNN article. That was about it. 

It was the beginning of a long, trying campaign by this group that has recently come to a head. I just thought I would share this experience and see if anyone sees an opportunity in this whole thing.

CeaseFirePA is a nonprofit which supports gun control here in the state of Pennsylvania. Since December of last year, they have been shamelessly taking advantage of the recent events in Newtown to push a gun control agenda. They’ve garnered some real attention in the press here in Philadelphia as of late as a result. On the surface, they are vocal supporters of the Unholy Trinity: universal background checks, the smokescreen of “gun trafficking,” and a ban on “assault weapons” and “high capacity” magazines. 

But make no mistake: that very first email about the murder/suicide at VT wasn’t just a news bulletin. Looking back at it, I saw that it had an appeal from Mike Carroll, apparently the Former Police Chief of West Goshen, PA. (Lord knows where that even is.) In it, he was advocating against the rights of citizens from out of state to exercise their rights to Concealed Carry here in the state of Pennsylvania. He claimed that this was going to get police officers killed. In light of the remarkable PoliceOne survey that was released, I think statement looks ludicrous right now. 

Anyway, if you want help getting rid of CC permits, you don’t come to me for help.

I unsubscribed from CeaseFirePA’s email list. They didn’t stop sending me emails. They were being sent to my school email account. To this day, I do not know how they got it. I wrote a reply to Mr. Nacheman, telling him that he was wrong to treat CCL carriers that way and that I oppose criminal use of guns as much as anyone else. I unsubscribed again. Still, CeaseFirePA continued to send me emails. For a while, I wondered if I could hit them for sending me spam because the “unsubscribe” feature did absolutely nothing. It was infrequent enough that I didn’t get really mad, but not so infrequent that I forgot about them. They’ve been on my list for a while.
So recently, with this latest round of gun control proposals following Newtown and CeaseFire’s new push, I got completely fed up with receiving their emails.

 I wrote a letter and send it directly to them.  In it, I addressed the fallacies in their reasoning, the reasons I have for needing firearms (i.e. no one else but me is able to protect myself and my people in dangerous parts of Philadelphia,) and I threw in facts from the Feds and DHS about the real profile for mass shooters as well as . (As far as I can tell from police records, Philadelphia only saw one death from a rifle or shotgun in 2012.) I requested that they tell me how they had gotten my email address since it was never given out or volunteered and I never requested to be included in their email chain. I unsubscribed again.

Wouldn’t you know it, I got another email appeal from CeaseFirePA two days later, asking me to show up and demonstrate support for the gun bill that’s now in the Senate. This time, it wasn’t sent to my school address. This time, they had my personal email address- not my school email. 

It’s kind of ironic (or unsurprising?) that CeaseFirePA, an organization dedicated to trampling on the rights of law-abiding citizens and treating them like criminals, is completely open to injecting itself into my online world without my permission. Yes, I know that I could block them or send them to my spam folder. I’m not worried about the content of their emails, which are the same garbage recycled through the news media every day. I’m just getting completely sick of the way that they conduct themselves. It’s completely inexcusable. 

I still wonder- but am not entirely sure- if someone who knows me and disagrees with my position didn’t originally slip them my email. Maybe I’m just getting a little too crazy.

Anyway, I’m currently thinking about what the wisest next step to take would be. (Sorry if I was pretty wordy with this post! I tend to be that way sometimes.) I don’t want to call their office and just have some intern pull me from their email list. I want to really get my voice in on this whole thing. I’m curious if anyone else has had a similar experience, or if you’ve got any creative ideas on how to deal with this situation. 

TL;DR CeaseFirePA, a gun control group trying to get rid of Concealed Carry, hasn’t heeded my request to stop contacting me for over a year. Now they’re taking advantage of Newtown, misrepresenting me, and I want to fight back.

This is a problem cause I need to successfully complete that exam to have all the points required to proceed my study. There is a change that I will have another change though.
 Meanwhile my shoulder still hurts, although they say it has cured. 
Got an exam which I thought went really well. Felt good for a week, result: I failed. Now I have only one change left for that as well.

Received an email today, they have rejected my internship (don't really know how to pronounce it in English). It's required to make 400 hours to successfully complete the first internship. I made little over 300 because of the accident I had. They don't give a shit and say that I just have to figure out a way to get to 400 hours. 

The list just goes on and on.

I really reached a point of ""fuck this shit"". I feel like since the start of this year I had no successes at all. I know, I should feel good because there are probably people worse of than me. But still, I don't know how long I can bare this shit. I feel really sad sometimes. Sometimes really angry, or very disappointed.

I’m Alan Grayson, and I represent Florida’s 9th Congressional District. Ask Me Anything.

Some of you may know me from my [September 2009 speech on health care reform]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-usmvYOPfco). I explained that the Republican health care plan amounted to, ""Don't get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.” What you may not know is that Aaron Swartz was an intern in my office, and someone whom I admired. I [spoke at his memorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slmbmd69QHM), and am glad to have a chance to share thoughts with the community he co-founded.

Yesterday, President Obama released a budget that included the chained CPI, which cuts the cost-of-living adjustment for seniors on Social Security.  I have said this many times before, but I will say it again now: I will not support any cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits. Over the past month, more than two million of you have signed on to our [No Cuts petition](http://no-cuts.com?source=RedditIntro), saying the same thing. As of today, over 30 Members of Congress have co-signed our letter to President Obama pledging to vote against any cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits.

Right now, I am stepping into a House Democratic Caucus meeting on chained CPI cuts. When I return at 4PM, I look forward to answering your questions.

I just returned from my meeting. I will now begin answering your questions. 

UPDATE:  Well, we ALMOST answered all the questions -- a half-hour of ""overtime"" helped.  But now I need to go.   Thank you for giving me lots of things to think about.  I had a great time, here -- which means that I look forward to doing it again."

I am 22/M, going to University of Calgary for mechanical engineering.  I am currently living at home, and am 12 months into a 16 month internship at a large Canadian engineering company.  I have saved up a lot of money and am ready to spread my wings finally.  In a month I will be moving in with a few friends.  

I am under the impression that, even though there will be four of us in the same duplex, everybody will be pretty much looking after their own meals.  Obviously, I want to avoid getting take-out every night, as its expensive and usually unhealthy.  So, I would appreciate any advice the Fittit community can provide me on how to shop for groceries.

My criteria is as follows:
- Cheap as possible, as I will be back in school in September.
- Lots of protein (because protein)
- Minimal carbs (don't want a lot of breads and pastas)
- Lots of veggies (because they're low cal, and I love veggies)

Relevant fitness information:

- Doing Strong Lifts 5x5 (2 months in, going to keep going until the program is no longer working for me (I'm following it to a 'T'))
- Currently 205 lbs at 6'1"", aiming to be around 180, so definitely cutting in the long term (I'm down from 220 since New Years).
- Strength is a long term goal, but right now my primary goal is to loose the flab
- Lift stats of the curious:

      - Squat 180lbs (still progressing, starting to get challanging)
      - Bench 115lbs (still progressing, not even close to challanging yet)
      - OHP 105lbs (stalled once at 95, and now once at this weight)
      - Barbell Row 135 lbs (Still progressing, starting to get challanging)
      - Deadlift 225 lbs (still progressings, starting to get challanging)

I am certain that I will probably be buying a lot of frozen veggies and pre-made salads.  Also, I'm sure I will buy a lot of frozen chicken breasts.  But, I need to know what I should buy to round out my meals, and to add variety.  Any of your favourite recipes would be greatly appreciated as well!
 
EDIT:  Thank you everybody for the good tips."

-------------------------------------------------------
Edit: I figured you might want to know more about me. Here's a ""coming out"" story I had to do for my internship with my university's LGBT office. The **[blank]**s are where my last name would be:

“Coming out” I’ve learned that it doesn’t just happen once when you live with parents you know won’t accept you. When I was 14 and watching gay porn, I was still pretty damn convinced I was straight. One of the benefits of being a teenager is this wonderfully horrible ability to hold cognitive dissonance for the most extreme of social fluctuations in an effort to fit in. The first person I had to come out to was myself. This happened around when one of my friends at the time and I ended up hooking up. It was sudden and it was pretty damn hard to deny my sexuality with his lips all over my body. However, liking guys and being in high school can make for a very lonely experience. After that particular experience I knew I had a lot of self-reflection to do. 


Living abroad, within the military environment, and having super religious parents – this coming out process became my quest and I was on this journey to save myself, from myself. No one was openly out; I thought “who could I ask”. I felt I could relate to no one. My family did not have a member who was out and there would be almost no way I could contact them. How could I talk about this subject with counselors, if I could not admit this to myself completely? Slowly, thought after thought after thought I drove myself to the abyss of self-doubt, demotivation, and general apathy. I felt that my conservative environment would lash against me. That I would be the weird one, like that kid in those movies who’s only best friend was his dog or something. It was as if I was in a desert while a stampede of feral horses charged at me. Beating me into the ground, as if nothing could be heard and this weight was silent, heavy even.  Until that point, I had felt sorry for myself, cared only for what worldly perception would have of me that day. Self-aware to the point of guessing what small gesture, action, glance would produce in the minds of others. Having constant thoughts of reassurance that whatever action I fashioned would not be misconstrued as non-straight or queer; I had enveloped into myself. I ate myself alive from the inside-out – feeling like a fleeting star ready to implode. Where were my foundations? Where were my morals? Certainly I had to establish my own. Brick by brick, I cautiously looked over each attribute and decided if it was worth holding onto. Throughout this process, finally, my epiphany arrived through rebuilding myself. I knew it – I do not have to worry about what people would think about me, I do not need their reassurance – I am Nick **[blank]**, that’s who I am. Why would I do, what I do? Because I am Nick fucking **[blank]**, no questions needed. If I don’t need to question myself – they certainly do not need to question me. Liking whoever I want is who I am. Never will I have to “come out” I just need to be me; that’s who I am. “Dear world, I am Nick **[blank]**, I like boys, I like girls, I like working on classic cars, but make sure to pay attention because I will certainly will not be left unnoticed – I will do greatness through being who I am best, Me.” 


This is not a story of “coming out”, rather my story of how I became to be myself and proud to be myself. I might be a bit fickle and worldly at times, but at least I happen to know who I am. I do not need people to tell me who I am, I tell them – through my words, actions, and mannerisms. It is a fact of my being. I would not have it any other way. 

----------------------------------------

**td;dr - I like who I am and you can't tell me otherwise.**

She wants to graduate in 3 years with a double major and she is on the right track to - if she takes five classes for her remaining classes and does 3 classes during summer school.  We're in a LDR but see each other every weekend (literally) and skype every night with texting at least every hour during the day.

The problem is that she is so stressed out and has no time to enjoy herself.  We just booked a trip to Thailand for the summer and so now she is stressing about money and taking out another loan for next year (she is definitely below the amount that I've heard of other people taking, so I'm not too concerned about her future finances).

I try to offer advice, such as quitting one of her jobs but she says that she has made a commitment.  I understand that it is a commitment but she is literally working herself to tears every night and always complaining during the day.  She also misses me, or at least shows that she's missing me more than I show, and so she sometimes stresses about that.

I have suggested meditation, but she says that she doesn't have time for it.  For a time she was depressed (undiagnosed) from her birth control but she has since switched. I suggested that she see a therapist and the one time she did and sent an email to the therapist with her feelings the therapist never got back to her and I assume this is why she does not want to go back.

Her family back at home is taking care of her dog, along with another 4 that they have illegally (3 is the max), and it has attacked the others and so she wants to find a home and I offered to look for a place for next year, but no promises.  Yet, I found a place that didn't take dogs and she literally broke down crying for a 15 minutes. This is yet another thing that she has to think about and I am extremely worried at what will happen if the dog does something else.

I feel like I'm at my wits end, as this has been going on for months with no end in sight.  Is there anything I can do to alleviate it, or just ride the storm for the next year until she graduates.

tl;dr GF has too many commitments and is overstressed and I think it's taking a toll on us."
1c43rh,1,2013-04-10,"I was asked a series of career related questions by a college student at my alma mater, and answered them with what I hope to be good advice. Thought /r/sciencecareers/ might like it.",man_risk,sciencecareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencecareers/comments/1c43rh/i_was_asked_a_series_of_career_related_questions/,"How/when did you decide on your major?
I decided on Mathematics as a major during my sophomore year around Christmas time.  I had a class with a professor who I found to be extremely inspiring, and who pushed me to do it because they believed I would be very well suited to the major.  Before this, I was a music major, and for a little while afterwards I was a music and mathematics double major.  I dropped music to a minor halfway through junior year, when I started to get very serious about my career goals. 

What attracted you to your field of study?
I have always been good at math, and really enjoyed many things about it.  I love symmetry and probabilities, and thinking through interesting problems.  I was able to do those sort of things in mathematics, and as each class I took went very well, I became more and more sure that it was a good choice.

What activities/organization were you involved in outside the classroom when you were at Carthage?
I was in Carthage Choir all 8 semesters, Lincoln Chamber Singers for 2, and I acted in and sang in a few theatre shows and J Term operas.

What advice would you give someone who is trying to decide on a major/career?
Weigh things in your mind.  You have goals (or should, make some if you don’t) and you have things that give you satisfaction when you complete them and when you are doing them.  There are careers you could pursue that will lead you toward your goals, and there are careers that will lead to that sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.  These might not line you pockets or give you much free time, however.  Then there are careers that will make you a lot of money, or that do not require a lot of time or effort.  These careers may not lead to accomplishment of your goals, or may not lead to a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment, but they may make you feel more comfortable.  You have to strike a balance, and when things feel wrong, you have to be able to say “That’s it!  This sucks!  I am going to pursue that other thing I wanted to do!”

What are the top five skills someone should poses before considering this career path?
1.	Just about everyone needs to have computer skills.  You better be able to put Word Excel Powerpoint and Outlook on your resume.  If you don’t, start using them.  You can use excel to keep track of your budget, Outlook to hook up your Carthage and Gmail accounts and keep track of your schedule.
2.	You should probably learn a database programming language.  There are tons of mathy jobs that would benefit from this.  SQL is good, check out this link: http://sqlzoo.net/
3.	Learn to manage your time.  The human mind cannot multitask efficiently.  It is a one core processor, and if you are giving priority to two tasks at once, you are really just neglecting both of them.  Make your priorities into a list, and work on them one at a time until they are done, or set specific start and end times for when you will be working on particular tasks.  This will make you a much more sane person in general.
4.	Take a leadership role in what you are doing.  This is something you just have to learn by doing, and will benefit you greatly.  You are always going to have to interactions with humans, and having leadership abilities is always valuable.
5.	Get good at communicating your ideas.  You are going to deal with a lot of people who will not know what you are talking about, so you will have to figure out a way to relate it to them.  Start out by explaining your crazy hard math project to your cat, and then move up to your mom, and then to your friends.  Try to find ways to keep them interested.  This will benefit you greatly.

What kinds of courses are most valuable in order to gain skills necessary for success in this occupation?
Take a computer science course, and some courses that are more of applied math, such as financial mathematics and physics.  You want to be able to take your theoretical mathematical understanding and turn it into something useful.

What would you say is the most important part of a resume?
Experience.  Make sure your experience section includes accomplished goals for each position, like:
Tutor – Carthage College
Helped students understand complex materials
I accomplished this goal by implementing this plan
I improved the grade of students I tutored by an average of one letter grade by implementing (insert fancy teaching style or trick here)

What is a typical day on the job for you?
Right now, it is working with project teams to support Epic’s healthcare software reporting suite.  I have meetings with Epic customers throughout the day usually, and other time I spend reviewing and resolving issues that customers or Epic has reported.  

How much travel or variety is involved in your job?
I travel for 2-3 day about once every other month, and have been to 5 different states since starting, so it is pretty varied.  As far as variety, the job does not tend to change that much.

Was this the first profession that you had chosen?
No.  I studied actuarial and that is where I intend to go next.

Are there certain professional associations unique to this field?
I am now going to begin talking about actuarial, because there are none with Epic. With actuarial, there are designations and a defined career path with much room for advancement.  SOA and CAS are the main conferrers of designations.

What kind of work/internship experience did you have before this job?
I interned at Markel Corporation as an actuarial intern.  It was a great experience and I would highly recommend finding an internship to do this summer, if you haven’t already.

What do you wish someone would have told you about this occupation?
I wish someone would have told me to be patient and wait for the right career opportunity.  It can take some time to really get going with your career search, and you will then need to wait until something that is balanced and correct for your tastes comes along.  Don’t jump at the first thing just because you want to be employed, but if you do, continue searching for what you really want to do.

Would you consider this to be a growing industry? 
Both actuarial and the IT industries are definitely growing, but entry level is super competitive.  Be ready to fight for it.

What would you change about your current position if you could?
I would have waited to find a better one, and the one I got into would have lots of research and development included in it.

What are typical entry level salaries for this occupation?
For actuarial – 45,000-65,000
For IT – Varies wildly, but probably between 30,000 and 60,000

What are some related occupations?
For actuarial – Insurance in general is pretty mathy stuff, from underwriting to product coordination.  Also, risk management and general data analysis are related.  For IT (Epic) there are lots of different positions, like being a database administrator, computer wiz, programmer, software developer, technical support, project manager, etc.

Also I'm at Uni A right now and will be applying for transfer to Uni B (both made up) after next semester for my Junior year. Instead of taking the next 2 required classes for the Math+CS major at Uni B during the next 2 semesters, I could instead replace those classes with 2 gen eds and get done with most (if not all) of my gen eds by the time I transfer. 

I'm just worried because I don't want to sacrifice getting an A and a high GPA just to continue taking CS classes. This would become a problem when applying for internships since my uni isn't the greatest right now (I went here to save $$$).

1c8cnc,1,2013-04-12,TIFU,[deleted],bullying,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1c8cnc/tifu/,"Today I made a ""little"" mistake at my internship.

I'm working at a software company as a programmer.

The office is an open space packed with people, around 30+ people. 

I went from a period in my life of some years at home with no one and started going to the internship. 

It was a real shock for me. After 3 weeks I still haven't made any friends.

And today, after some pressure from the workers (because of my anti-social behavior), I kinda revealed I had some homosexual activity in the past (which is true, although many many years ago and never done again). 

After that I started hearing some indirect talk on this, you know, the beginning of the bullying. 

Now, I really don't know what to do. I do know it won't get any better, only worse. I don't know if it is worth it.

If I don't go anymore, I do have the possibility of doing the internship in another place. If I go, we all know this can end very badly.

What do you think? Any similar bullying experiences?"

I have a basic understanding of programming, I took the BigNerdRanch iOS Development course, and I try every day at work [work as an IT Manager who has periodic downtime] to experiment and build my skills further. Unfortunately, that isn't always possible and at the end of the day when I get home from my 9 hour work day, I usually just don't have the energy to break back into it before going to sleep. I want to become an iOS developer and feel that I have a few pretty good app ideas, but I think I need to sacrifice to make this happen.

For this reason, I am asking for an opinion. For those of you that are iOS developers or managers of a team of iOS devs, I pose this situation I am considering and am looking for feedback on what could be a huge mistake and possibly a larger waste of time.

I want to offer myself for a committed 6 months or a year to a company who would take me under their wing as almost an iOS intern and help build me into a functional developer. For this, I would ask that I not get paid, with the intent of being able to be transitioned and helped along the way. I want to learn how others develop apps, from beginning to end. 

Is this worth trying? Not sure if the payoff of seeing an unpaid worker in the workforce would outweigh having to hold my hand a little bit to get me to a point where I would be able to contribute to the business and the community.

EDIT: tl;dr I want to know what you think of offering myself as a slave to an iOS app developing firm for free to learn how to program well."

4 student loans:

1. $23,287 @ 6.8%
2. 2,555 @ 8.5%
3. 82,147 @ 7.9% 
4. 57,968 @ 6.8%

Right now I'm on a low-paid internship ($22,000 on the year), equating to about $1300 per month coming in. I have a credit score over 700 (703 average). I own my car out right (2008) and unless something awful happens it should be okay. I have about 13k saved up over the 4 years of loans. I have 3k in a ROTH IRA, but I'm not intending on touching that unless absolutely necessary. I'm looking at reasonably making about 65-70k in my first year of work and getting a job should be relatively easy as I have several prospects lined up (I should receive a doctorate in clinical psych in about 4 months from a respected school, APA accredited, etc. etc.). I should be able to boost my income about 10% after receiving my license (about $6,500) but will incur the responsibility of liability insurance after that (about $800). 

My expenses:

Rent: 1,100 p/m
Utilities: 220 p/m
Travel: 200 p/m
Food: 150p/m
Discretionary: 75p/m

The other noteworthy thing is that I'm planning on getting married in October of this year. Fiance is debt-free and making about 50k right now, with about 6k saved up (she has not done well in saving until recently). Right now she lives with her family, so her expenses are relatively low, as follows:

Food: 150 p/m
Utils: 100 p/m
Insurances: 140 p/m
Healthcare: 200 p/m (she has some conditions that require consistent care)
Travel: 250 p/m (gas mostly) 
Discretionary: ?? Don't know.

So, my questions:
1. How in the blue hell do I dig out of this debt? I know there are several options on the studentloans.gov website, but quite frankly I don't know squat about finance outside of giving the particulars and trying to be relatively frugal. 
2. Should I apply for these repayment plans prior to getting married since our combined income will be higher? 
3. I've heard from colleagues that staying in school (taking some online comm college courses) will carry over the debt into the next year, when more benefits and lower rates should take over? Is this even true? Can anyone show me the sources that say this, or even confirm the legitimacy of the hearsay? 
4. We're both likely to take on some inheritance from family situations, however not directly from our parents, is there a best way to receive this money?
5. To me, it makes sense to pay off that $2,500 loan at 8.6. It's the highest interest rate and I have more than enough to knock it out. Is this actually a good idea?

I appreciate any assistance you all can offer in terms of insight into how to improve this situation and whether #5 directly above seems like a good idea. Thank you so much.

EDIT: Thanks to the two of you that helped. I paid off the small loan/highest interest rate and am setting up a joint account with my parents to start the process. "

1c6hoy,2,2013-04-11,"I don't even know what to title this. ""GF Problems"", I guess. VERY long read",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1c6hoy/i_dont_even_know_what_to_title_this_gf_problems_i/,"GF and I met about three years ago, when she was an intern for a professional sports team I worked with. We went on a few dates within a month or two and got along, but ultimately it went nowhere. I couldn't commit to a relationship (trust issues stemming from a previous break up with the girl I thought I would one day marry). We went on our last date in November of 2010, and talked infrequently until April of 2011 when she called to say she was pregnant (4 months along). The father is a guy she had a long history with, a guy who is IMHO psychologically unbalanced. He is emotionally and physically abusive, and she has told me about times she called the police because he hit her and threatened to kill her. I don't know why she ever stayed with him, but that's something for another thread.

ANYWAY...back to the point. She had her son a few months later, and around December of 2011 she left the father of her son because the issues I stated before escalated to new levels. Apparently he would routinely get black-out drunk and threaten to kill both my GF and their son. We got back in touch and rekindled our friendship. I immediately felt sympathy for her and her boy. But because of stupid shit in my own head, I still didn't commit to a relationship with her.

From then until this past summer, we stayed in touch as friends, infrequently at first, but then a real relationship started to grow. In July of last year I poured my heart out to her, told her about the past relationship that had my head so messed up. I told her I wanted her as my girlfriend, that I wanted to be with her and her son, and that I would do everything I could to make her happy. We've been officially together since then. I love her and her son. I know he's not mine, but I treat him as if he is.

Now, we live about an hour away from each other. I'm in school full time and work part time. She works nights full time. It's tough to see each other a lot, but we're in love, and we've been doing our best.
For the most part, Biological Father hasn't been in the picture much. He gets the child one night a week and every other weekend. When it's his ""turn"", the little guy is usually with Biological Father's parents or a babysitter. Biological Father has shown virtually no interest in his own son. GF's mom and/or dad babysit the little guy when she works and I can't get down there. I spend as much time as I can with him, and he's started to call me ""dad"", which I am thrilled with. I love that little guy.

Little guy had a seizure a little less than a month ago. It was the single most terrifying moment of my life. GF was driving with him in the backseat and me in the front passenger seat. I look back and see his eyes roll back in his head, drooling, and turning blue. We raced to the hospital, while I gave him rescue breaths (not knowing why he wasn't breathing at the time, other than he wasn't choking). We hit the sign in front of the hospital (took a turn too fast) and I sprinted with him in my arms the 100 yards from the sign to the ER doors. He got into the room and the doctors did a great job and he is fine. GF called the Biological Father to let him know what happened, and this asshole shows up to the hospital ranting and screaming about how this seizure is God's punishment for her being a cheating whore and that he fucked her two weeks ago. I should tell you that GF's father, mother, brother and family, and I are all there. And Biological Father's other son who is about 7. Everyone is embarrassed, everyone is angry, no one knows what to do. Anyway, after he's done yelling and screaming he leaves without making sure his son who just had a seizure is okay. A few hours later, he calls GF's mother and father and apologizes, and for some ungodly reason, they both tell him ""it's okay, you were just upset"". They completely let him off the hook.

And so began an endless string of texts and phone calls from Biological Father to my GF about how the whole ordeal was God's sign that the two of them should get back together. That God almost killed their son for the two of them splitting up. That if he ever found me, Biological Father was going to beat the shit out of me. That he would ""die to get [GF] back"".

This has been going on for three weeks now. GF had agreed that she would not do the custody exchanges in anywhere other than public places, and that she would not be alone with him anymore. We both agreed that he is capable of doing horrible things to himself, his son, and my GF.

Sunday, I'm at work and get a call from her sobbing about how she is supposed to pick up her son from the father, but he isn't anywhere to be found and won't answer his phone. I tell her to call the police, she does. Soon after, she calls and says everything is okay, she got in touch with the father, they are going to do the exchange at his house. This goes against our agreement for public places, but I let it go, because I just want her to have her son back. She gets him, calls me that everything is fine, and that's that.

That night, I went to a basketball game with some friends. My phone battery was low, so, in order to have some life left for the drive home, and because cell service inside the particular arena is atrocious, I turned my phone off. Now, since I was under the impression that everything with GF and her son was okay, I didn't think to tell GF my phone would be off. But she did know I was at the game. Once we left, I turned my phone on and saw 5 missed calls and 7 texts messages asking where I was. I immediately call her back, thinking the worst. Everything was fine, but she was SUPER pissed at me for not having my phone on. I apologized for being inconsiderate about not telling her I would have the phone off. We cleared everything up.

Monday I have classes all day, so we talked infrequently, but that’s been normal this semester. Tuesday, I get a picture from her on my phone of her son getting his first haircut. It’s adorable. After the haircut, they are going to little buddy’s doctor appointment to get his ears checked out (ear infection was identified as the cause of the fever that induced his seizure back in March). A little while later, I ask how the appointment went, and she says she’s having a rough day and is at her wit’s end with the Biological Father. I just assume that he’s harassing her via phone again.

Later in the day, we talk on the phone. I find out that Biological Father was with her and her son at the haircut, that they all went to lunch together, and that he was with them at the doctor appointment. The entire time he was begging her to come back to him, to leave me, that they belong together, all the usual shit he spouts. They rode in the same car together (hers). This, to my knowledge, is the most time they have spent together outside of a family court hearing since they broke up near the end of 2011. I was upset when she told me this. I felt hurt, and a little betrayed. I don’t know if that’s the right thing to feel. I mean, she’s going to have this connection to this guy forever. But she has repeatedly told me she doesn’t want anything to do with him. She says she wants to be cordial to him, because she thinks if she cuts him off from her entirely, he’ll kill himself and their son. 

I understand this thinking, and agree that he is dangerous. But my thought is: take him to court and get your son legally away from him permanently. She already has full custody. She “just” has to get him to sign away his parental rights (I know that’s hard to do). But spending an afternoon with the man you thought had kidnapped your son the day before goes well beyond “keeping things cordial”.

I have admittedly been distant the past few days. There’s definite tension between us, not helped by the fact that it’s not easy to see each other like normal relationships. I don’t even know if the hurt I am feeling is appropriate. I guess I’m just looking for someone to tell me if I should be this upset about everything, or is I should just suck it up and get over it.

**TL;DR I feel hurt that GF spent an afternoon with the man who fathered her child, even though he is crazy and she promised she would never be alone with him**

So Then during winter vacation i tried to keep in touch with her at least once a week to avoid being obsessed or any thoughts of me being annoying,the only problem i had with her is that it was like 5-7 texts and then she would leave me hanging and i remember talking about our past and she told me how she had a bf,who never got her anything not even flowers and he never paid for anything and she would always drive,paid for him and went out of her way to see him and be with him because at point she really loved the person but this guy had cheated on her from the gecko and hurt her feelings,so i had decided if i was going for her that i wouldn't be like this guy and become a genuine guy that would never do this but it wasn't until she texted me one time when she was buzzed and this was a rare occasion because she's one of those girls who are kinda straight edge and she texted me saying she was drunk and i remember telling her how i felt about her and how i meant it but she never wrote back.      


  I remember texting her that i was really sorry because i felt like i came too direct and she was like all cool and then i would text her and on valentine's day i had surprised her by sending flowers to her at the school office cause thats where she works and when they had gotten delivered she had texted me on how it made her day and what not and i went to go see her and she hugged me and thanked me,i was trying to have a lone time with her to maybe ask her out to spend the day or time this week but there was these girls who cock blocked me and i just wished her a good day and went upon my day.


I thought she would text me or maybe i maybe sparked interest in her more but i don't know i waited and thought she would hit me up after work cause i know she's busy working and with her school work,so then it became a day and then 2 days and the weekend and I didn't hear not one word from her,and it became two weeks she didn't text me until i hit her up to make convo and she seemed all happy and everything but like always she's leaves me hanging with 5 back and forth replies and then it's been like once a week i try to hit her up and say hi.

So now it's been like the 2nd time i try to get over her because since those two weeks where i didn't hear from her hoping she'd hit me up or show at least some attention like i did to her but this time i feel like i'm sprung and out of ideas to win her over, but it's too hard to resist her because i have to see her these next two months around school because all our college classes and her job is in the same building which is easy to bump in to people.I don't know it's so obvious she knows i'm interested in her  and that i've tried and try to ask about her day.It's been going like this since Easter.


Sometime this week when i came back to school there was this school fair when they had tables from different internships and it was outside to the parking lot and she was part of it in one of the tables and  i've found myself seeing her but i have avoided her and not to try to make any interaction with her and i've tried to make it seem as if i didn't see her,because i was walking to the parking lot with a friend of mine,I was stopped by my school's counselor because she wanted to see how i was doing but that whole time i felt nervous because i tried so hard not to look back and make it seem like i was avoiding her on purpose which i was. So then today 4/11,I go to the science building and I'm studying for my Anatomy Lab Practical exam,with Lab group.


There's this girl who was studying next to me with some people and it happens to be that it was one of the girl's who cockblocked me on valentine's day and I didn't realize then that this girl was in my Anatomy class until like couple weeks ago when i saw her talking to janet and they had a class together,so then i glance through the see through glass walls of the schools building and i notice janet coming to the building I see that she's coming,so I try to act busy and try surpress the urge from looking down the floor(Our Science building is 3 floors) and not trying to make it seem like she's coming,so then i'm like studying reading some things and i was looking through the corner of my eye and I notice janet waking up the stairs and I'm like fuck,getting really nervous and i keep on doing and i notice from the corner of my eye she stops and then walks around and ends up going to to her friend and she's talking to them,so then I avoid any contact and try to make it seem like i didn't acknowledge her presene around me and then my buddies and I walk to class because the Exam was going to start in a couple of minutes.

I don't know try to be the man and take the initiative but i don't recieve any reprocity from her.When we see each other she always seems happy and smiles and there has been times where i avoid her because i don't want to confront her,hopefully maybe she'd text me,call me or show some interest or concern.I've been avoiding her and not trying to call her because i feel like i've tried to make an effort the best as i could but me avoiding her i'm trying to shield myself from getting hurt or putting an effort where i feel like i'm wasting my time.

So guys and girls idk what i should do she seems like a awesome person i want to be with but her actions don't show,but she's always nice to me and smiles when she see's me can it be that she just likes the attention or is it because she's trying to be nice,what's on your take of all of this and how i should go upon it? I have two more months left of school to make anything happen if there's still hope.

I'm also sorry for my grammatical errors,confusion and any misspelling that auto correct or I didn't catch."

1canmb,2,2013-04-13,"Not sure if this is depression, or something else...",very_1984ish,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1canmb/not_sure_if_this_is_depression_or_something_else/,"Some background information first I guess- I'm 21, in my second year of university. My first year of univeristy was incredibly bad. I struggled to befriend people, and the one person in my course whom I did get along with died a few months after I met her. I was of course extremely distraught, and from then on making friends was impossible as people in my course were too awkward and uncomfortable around me. The one thing that kept me going was my course itself. It turned out to be such an interesting subject and for the first time I knew what career path I was interested in going down. I studied often and diligently, and my grades were excellent despite my general unhappiness and lack of a social life.

Then year two started. I joined the university debating club, and just like my course it unexpectedly turned out to be something I am good at that I loved doing, but more importantly I quickly made some amazing friendships. I also got offered 2 amazing paid internships at pretty excellent law firms over the summer. My social life, sex life, and career prospects have never been this great.

But for the past 12 weeks, I have had zero focus or motivation or energy. I can't get out of bed, sometimes I just lie there until I get too hungry to stay curled up. Worse, I can't study. Now, I know all about procrastination - I've always had to force myself to start homework or study, but once I got started and started accomplishing even something small, that feeling would grow until I was in a pretty good productive mood and I could work for hours. At times when it got especially hard to study, I always had a number of tricks to motivate me - listening to music, or just looking at career ads in my chosen field (maybe I'm materialistic, but the thought of earning six figures before I turned 30 always filled me with a huge amount of determination to get studying) and sometimes just looking at silly inspirational videos on the Internet.

I've dealt with depression before. I've had a remarkably shitty childhood and family life and I'm currently trying to care for a parent that's been suicidal for at least as long as I've been alive and is deteriorating. I've always been able to handle it somewhat, especially after discovering how much exercise helps with that. I felt depressed a lot last year given how badly university was going, but what's happening to me now just doesn't feel the same. I'm not sad or overly stressed out, just completely... lethargic. Unmotivated, despite the tricks that have always worked before. I can't get started studying, and when I do I don't get the same feelings of interest or satisfaction so I can't focus or keep working for more than a few minutes. I'm not even watching TV or playing video games like I normally would while not studying, I'm just kinda doing...nothing.  I can't even get the energy or the enthusiasm to enjoy games or reading or food, let alone textbooks (though I always loved studying, and I should really love it even more now that I've got a general idea of what direction I want to take my career in). I don't understand why I'm like this and nothing I do is helping. 

Is this depression, just different to what I experienced before? Someone also suggested anaemia, so I'm going to go to a doctor for a blood test on Monday to get checked out. Hopefully he or she will help me with all of this, but I just wanted to ask for reddit's opinion in the meantime. I'm slightly worried about the idea of being prescribed antidepressants within a few weeks of exams and starting my internships, but I'm more worried about failing out of college because I can't beat this. Especially when I don't understand why this is happening now.

Thanks for reading, any advice or anything is welcome."

1cad7g,1,2013-04-13,"First Post, My Story, Some Questions. Any Chance You Could Help?",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cad7g/first_post_my_story_some_questions_any_chance_you/,"Howdy, y'all. Long time lurker and commenter, first time poster. I'm not really sure why I'm writing today...maybe cos I took my medicine too late after a night of drinking haha, but I feel like you guys understand my situation better than most people and can maybe offer some advice. I'm really willing to try anything at this point.

Here's a general overview of my situation:
I have been struggling with very serious depression since the 6th grade. I'm now a Junior in college, so it's been around 10 years. I was initially resistant to medicine in high school and saw a therapist, which didn't help so I stopped. Things peaked around my Junior year  of high school (with one particularly bad experience, I think you all could have some idea of what I'm talking about) but I was able to control my bad thoughts, and when I left my demanding and snooty private high school, I felt much better. I have a good home life, but at times my parents, who love me more than anything (I'm an only child) could be harsh. 

Freshman year of college was the best year of my life and I was able to keep my depression to a minimal level. But when Sophomore year rolled around my depression came back hard. As of now, my Junior year of college, my depression has come on harder then ever, as I have had a problem with a woman (which started Sophomore year) who I care about very much, but will never feel the same way about me that I do, to put it as simply as I can. 

We were great friends at the time. We put a lot of pressure on each other, and basically we decided not to spend time together for a while (she kinda pushed it on me out of the blue, but I think it was good in retrospect and I agree with her). It has been good and in a way kinda therapeutic, but I still think about her all the time. Also, a few of my friends kinda screwed me over for housing next year and it has put a lot of stress on me. In the past few months, I have started on Wellbutrin and Deplin. At first it did not help, but I have recently noticed a positive change in my mood. My biggest problem that exacerbates my depression is the girl I mentioned previously. I deleted her on Facebook, Twitter, and my phone as part of a process to help move on I found online (like I said, I'm desperate for anything that could help). I recently let her know I meant no offense. I support her 100%, and I know she wants her space. I have been doing absolutely everything to be as accommodating as possible, as it is better for both of us this way.

It is awkward, as we have the same group of friends, but it has been working out alright so far. While we were apart, she found someone, and I think thanks to my medicine I have been able to manage without falling into an even deeper depression (if that's even possible; I'm pretty miserable) even though I know very little about the situation (like I said, I'm not trying to be intrusive). But now she is slowly starting to reach out. We spoke and messaged each other last night and she has re-added me on Facebook. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is to me. I only accepted it as not to be rude, but it feels like a mistake.

I had been steadily getting better, but I feel like, with that, I just started walking down a path I don't want to take. Just being her friend hurts, and I don't know how to deal with it. I have absolutely no idea how to let go or just move on. It's giving me grey hair, and I'm only 21 years old. This is very very disturbing to me, as my father didn't even start going grey until he was in his early 40s, and I definitely have his genes. Problems with women seem silly to some, but when you care about and have strong feelings for someone, it can be crippling. I'm sure some of you know exactly what I'm talking about. Thanks to my depression my grades are in the toilet. Maintained a 3.0+ every semester, but last semester my depression was terrible, and my grades went in the toilet. Now I am worried about finding an internship (I'm a Marketing major; if I don't, I'm screwed).

Obviously my problem is way more complicated than this, but I figured this description was pretty adequate. I have plenty of other stresses, but I chose to discuss the biggest one in detail. If I got rid of this problem, I know I could deal with the rest.

Some questions:

-The tips I got online for how to move on (for the most part) sucked. Any chance any of you have better tips/suggestions?

-Anyone else been on Wellbutrin or Deplin, or both at the same time? The Wellbutrin didn't really work at all until I started taking the Deplin with it. What do you think? Any negative effects? How about noticeably positive effects?

-Could you recommend a better medicine?

-If you were in a similar situation, did you move on? How long did it take?



Thank you so much for reading and helping. Much love, everyone. And know I'm here for you if you need it!

1ca40a,1,2013-04-13,"Should I stay with my mopey, bi-polar, ADHD boyfriend?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ca40a/should_i_stay_with_my_mopey_bipolar_adhd_boyfriend/,"I am 26 F. My boyfriend is 24 M. We've been dating a little more than 2 years. Not only is my boyfriend very bi-polar, but our relationship dynamic is very bi-polar as well. Sometimes my boyfriend is ridiculously happy, hyper, fun-loving and romantic. This is why I fell in love with him. He is a very intense, fun and passionate person to be around. 

In his lows, he's mopey, easily agitated, extremely angry, suicidal and so depressed he's not motivated to do anything. 

I understand that people have highs and lows. I understand that it's not his job to be happy for me all the time.

He also has ADHD, which he says makes it harder for him to focus on tasks and stay motivated to get things done. True to his word, he does get really easily distracted and has hard time following through with tasks. 

So here is the thing. I feel like he's using his ADHD and Bi-polar as excuses to let responsibilities slide. He currently is doing an unpaid internship and has another part time job. But he's making barely any money (like 200 a week). He has a bachelor degree. I am the main breadwinner in our relationship, I earn about 1,000 bi-weekly. 

The money thing doesn't bother me that much. I think a guy's attitude and willingness to contribute where he can is more important than the size of his pocket book. 

He feels extremely self conscious about the fact that he's not making any money, and complains constantly about the fact that he's not providing for me. 

I tell him that there are other things he can do to help. I have given him ONE chore - the dishes. I buy the food. I cook the food (because I enjoy cooking). I pay the rent. He lives with his parents currently (but still stays at my house like 60% of the time and eats about half my food). 

Sometimes he's okay with helping out. Other times I have to remind him constantly to do the dishes. He says he'll do it, but then completely forgets and goes home. I've told him how much this pisses me off - considering it's his one contribution, and that he SAID he would do it. 

Nothing pisses me off more than when a person makes flowery promises, but doesn't keep their word. 

He routinely leaves his trash out and forgets to put food back in the fridge. I always have to remind him to pick up after himself and to throw away his trash. 

The last few times I told him to do these things he did, but was moody and irritable about it. (he apologized for getting angry later, but then didn't do the dishes the next day). I've also given him the option of cooking instead and that I would do the dishes - but he said he'd rather do the dishes. 

He complains about not having a good job, but then doesn't do anything to actually look for a better one. He once again blames his ADHD and says that I need to help him with the job hunt. So I basically have to write his resume and write his cover letter in order for him to get a better job. Which is what I've done for his current job and one he had last summer. 

I feel like I'm doing so much for this guy and getting little in return. I feel like his mother - and that's such a disgusting unsexy way to feel. Like I said, I don't mind being the breadwinner, but I expect my partner to be a MAN and an ADULT. To me, that means being direct about what you want and your feelings. Keeping your commitments. Taking care of yourself and cleaning up after yourself and your mental health. Even if you can't necessarily pay all the bills. 

Oh also, he refuses to go to therapy and had adverse side effects with Adderall (an ADD medication). He complains that taking it for 6 months gave him permanent brain damage (melodramatic much?) 

My BF grew up with parents who did everything for him, and he resents that aspect about himself. I guess most of the relationship I was hoping that if I could be patient and supportive enough he would change. I was taking his transformation from boyhood into manhood as my problem, when I really should be holding him accountable. 

Now I'm beginning to feel like he'll never change. I feel like he's going to continue giving more excuses, more sob stories and more false promises to deliver. And I'll keep having false hope that he'll bloom into the man I want him to be. 

Should I just end this relationship? It's not bad all the time. 60% of the time I feel happy and in love. He doesn't cheat and he's not physically abusive (he's said some mean things).

But I don't respect this guy. I don't trust him. I don't feel stable with him. And I know that's a big problem. 

What do you think Reddit? 

TL;DR! My boyfriend is irresponsible, doesn't contribute and blames this problem on his ADHD and bipolar. 

UPDATE: I just talked to my boyfriend about most of what I posted here. He felt really bad about everything, apologized and says he wants to make things better. I appreciate his apology and willingness to listen, I just hope that his apology is followed by action. This is a frequent thing in our relationship where he will apologize, but then the same behavior repeats itself within a few weeks. So I told him that I would like to see ACTION behind his words.

He told me that I'm not very emotionally supportive, which is true in a sense. I'm not a very emotional person. I'm very logic oriented and I see the world in a different way than he does. If a task needs to be done, I just do it rather than having to summon some kind of energy to do so. 

Sometimes I can be sarcastic and pessimistic - which is probably not the way to motivate a depressed person. I'm also the type of person who shows my love with my actions rather than my words or emotions. He is the opposite. He is a highly emotional person who says sweet romantic things, but I would like to see such promises backed up by action. 

So I need to be more emotional like him and he needs to be more action oriented like me, and maybe we can make this relationship work. 

I also need to expect that he will take care of his own problems - rather than planning out how I can solve his problems for him. 

I also appreciate all the advice from people saying I need to read more about bi-polar. Sounds like there are similar patterns for bi-polar behavior that often get attributed to laziness when that's not necessarily true. 

Thanks everyone!"
1c9fjy,6,2013-04-13,The Fifth Letter,AFetteredSoul,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1c9fjy/the_fifth_letter/,"Four weeks, five letters. For four weeks I have written five letters trying to muster up the words to say to you. The truth, everything that never was mentioned, all that I have wished to tell you but failed to do so; my thoughts, my feelings, my concerns. I have failed to compose anything that is cohesive, let alone anything that really makes sense in any way. So please excuse failed organisation, scattered thoughts, and rambling. It’s the only way which I can write this, and I feel like it is finally time to at least send a letter to you, regardless of form.

I have spent the last four weeks really thinking about not only the things I did with you, between us, but also everything that has happened over the past year. 

The good, the bad, and the absolutely ugly.

Since the beginning of 2012 to the present date I found myself traveling a new country, coming home to dates and constant heartbreak, diagnosed with a lifelong chronic illness I still struggle with, traveled with family I had not seen in years, had my lifelong dream of a degree stripped from me thanks to faults not my own, friends and family passing unexpectedly. And then—then I met you.

You brought to me something that I had never experienced before: intimacy, desire, attraction, &amp;c. The list goes on and on, continuing with dozens of little adjectives that can be used to describe the connection we shared and the times that we had. Everything but one:

Dedication.

There does not need to be any explanation for my actions. You know full well what happened, and I do not wish to reflect upon it once more here in this letter. It was me being stupid and selfish. There is no other way to put it aside from that, generalised anxiety and fear contributed to this, but it was my irrational thinking that caused it all to go.

Without that nothing could really happen, could it? We never dated, as you said, yet it feels like we broke up? This is my irrational behaviour.

I spent the last few weeks doing something that I have never done before, actually setting aside time to read my various journals and notes, in all their forms, over the past few years. So many journals with their covers falling apart, pages seemingly missing, some which have been through hell and back. There are memories of some of the greatest moments of my life documented and recalled with a crystal clear memory. Three stand out above the rest:

1.) July 25, 2011: One of my last days in S. Korea, after exploring myself, staying with strangers, teaching in unfamiliar conditions, and most of all the experience of everything being entirely new.

2.) January 12, 2012: A deeply interpersonal connection with a young girl in a train ride in Paris, France. We were stuck for hours after someone had jumped on the tracks ahead of us, late at night, everyone trying to make it home. Not a word was spoken, no hand gestures made. Laughs, smiles, and eye contact demonstrated the deep connections and similarities that we all have, regardless of our differences.

3.) October 7, 2012: Meeting a girl named L (retracted) for the first time, embracing her, and experiencing one of the greatest weekends of my life—new experiences and someone who for the first time really cared about me.

All of these entries have something in common, they are honestly the only entries of hundreds scattered about hundreds of pages digital notes that are not marked with negativity, fear, depression, or profound sadness. Nothing here but a pure reflection of how the profound beauty of life, people, nature, and the little things that we all take for granted.

Here you can call me a hypocrite—and I admit to being one.

Looking back at all of this I have come to realise that I have problems that I need to sort out. I have had nearly all my friends abandon me once they left for school—including some of my very personal friendships. I moved away from a small town when I was young, and childhood friends were lost, returning back even in the summers and not one would recognise me in the parks when I was young. Something about that hurt me, and I never really wanted to connect with people again. I can still remember all of their names: Ke (Retracted), J (Retracted), R (Retracted), and L (Retracted). We ruled the playground, but once I was gone for a few months, a distant memory-- I was homeschooled during middle school, after the terrible experience of elementary school. I lost more friends from middle school too, only knowing one guy, T (Retracted), as I kept in touch from Boy Scouts, and then came high school. I didn’t know many people there of course and entered an overweight socially awkward kid who did not know any better than to be a total fool. I met K (retracted). He soon became one of my best buddies, a true bro. I can remember helping him move into his dorm a few years later, and after one semester of school he stopped talking to me. It hurt so badly. Soon after, T (Retracted) walked away too. After high school, I only met a few people that I knew, but it was like starting fresh.

Now I only can talk to four people: (Retracted). Those are my only real friends and I mean that honestly. Even still, W (Retracted) and I have been talking less and less, and the same goes with Celeste. Things are changing—and I simply don’t know what to do.

I have not met a single person at school, not one friend or someone I can talk to. I am too afraid of being hurt again. While I’ll be quick to open up and talk to people, I always shy away from being a true friend, being there for people, dedicating my emotions to a friendship. 

In short, I have trust issues. I am a fool who does not know better, and while no excuse, perhaps explains something. I do not know; I am a fool.

I did not really know how deeply you cared for me; let alone how much I cared for you until you were gone. After I let you down and let you go, and that is something that haunts me…

--

While trying to rest my mind and look upon myself in an intrapersonal connection as to what I even stand for, I spent my time free in the park. I took days off of work, too distressed to focus, and set aside classwork and walked to the park near daily and read; books that I have always cited as being a part of my beliefs, but ones that I had not the time to read in perhaps years. The collected works of Plato, the Nietzsche reader, the Federalist Papers, collections of poetry and proverbs of Shelly, Ginsburg, and more—but one of them all stood above the rest. A book that I hold so close to me that is sometimes forgotten, a book which tears fell from my eyes as I read from its pages: 

“…in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, he and soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.”

Like words off a page etched in my soul, I recalled how much emphasis I placed on little banter about futures and getting together. Internships in V (Retracted), among other things, I took them too seriously and it began to play with my mind and what you thought we had. Moving too fast? My ignorance and preconceived notions of how relationships are supposed to go got in the way. I became irrational, it clouded my judgment. I found unhappiness in what was pure bliss… I read on.

“’I ought to have listened to her,’ he confided to me one day. ‘One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take the pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, only should have filled my heart with tenderness and pity.'""

You knew, better than I ever could, what was shared between us. The thing is, I always cited my inexperience and ignorance, but I was scared so absolutely terrified of putting all my trust into you. If I lost any control, it would be over, and I'd lose another. It's selfish, the opposite of intimate. I should have known, I should have taken action. You gave me nothing but love and compassion, and I denied it playing with my head. I came with too much pride in who I was and was too afraid to change that. You knew. I don't know; I am a fool… I read on.

""And he continued his confidences: 'The fact is that I did not understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her...'""

My words cannot compare to those I read, those which tell the same story of lost love and troubles then here. These words of course are those of Le Petit Prince, a man of small stature who in his time on Earth told the story of his small planet and his love, the flower... I know not if you have read the story, but the profound beauty of the flower, its presence, disturbed the serenity of Le Petit Prince's world, so much so he leaves. My life had always been a routine, one with 'principles' and 'philosophical and moral hierarchy' all of it not what's really important.

Love. 

Take pride in what you have, and realise just how important the smallest of things are in life. Love, happiness, and peace. Le Petit Prince learned this from a fox he met on his travels. If only I knew better, if I had a fox. Have my time with monks in the mountains of Korea taught me nothing? I learned the principles of life's troubles and what was really important, discussing them while watching the lotus flowers bloom. I don't know; I am a fool.

It is amazing how much I could read into the subject of love:

 “…when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return, this is linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in early youth, the gal towards which love, of necessity, tends still is bound by love so strong an association of ideas that may well become the cause of love if it presents itself…since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure…” –Marcel Proust in “Swann’s Way”

Reading the profound nature of the give and take, the self-sacrifice needed to make things work. What it takes to become a pair—to rejoin halves as they say. It is not about completion, as I have said, but about complementing. Even that aside, what makes it all work is the level of intimacy and self-sacrifice that is most profound. It is a universal human emotion. 

Why is that concept so hard for me to understand? So many great people, and countless individuals lost in history have known what love is…

The idea is not new to me, far from it; it has existed in poems that I have loved and held so dearly, and very personal stories which defined what a strong romantic love could be. As with many of the things I am citing here, there is a book I hardly touch, yet one which means the world to me, one of the prised possessions that rests upon my shelf. Its cover is warn, bits of cloth peeling off as the binding slowly deteriorates and the spine breaks. Its pages are marked heavily with notes, and beginning to rip and shred from countless hours spent reading it and studying everything that exists between its covers. It was not my hand which left them there, nor does it really even belong to me. It is my mother’s collected works of Shelly. The spine rests broken, opening to only one specific page if left to open on its own. It opens to a specific page, where an old pressed and long dead single rose lay. The colour has faded with time, yet some of it remains, and petals have disintegrated as time passes leaving only parts of the flower in fact.

It is the first rose given to my mother from my father.

Why this is so important is this particular rose, in this particular book, is pressed against a poem that my mom had always told me about love. What it felt to be in love, a poem that spoke to her as a teenager and still speaks to her today. It is called Love’s Philosophy: 

The fountains mingle with the river,
And the rivers with the ocean;
The winds of heaven mix forever,
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle;--
Why not I with thine?

See! the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister flower would be forgiven,
If it disdained it's brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea;--
What are all these kissings worth,
If thou kiss not me?

The concept is not new; rather the poem is one that my mother had taken off the pages and placed it into her soul; one which she had recited to me time and time again over the ages when telling the story of love between them. A story lasting years with distance of thousands of miles between to young lovers for school, education, and money that they did not have. Phone calls lasting only a minute or two a time every month or less, letters written that had to fly across the pacific costing money that at times neither my mother or father had. It was years before they were finally able to be together, happy, and living in the arms of one another. Long distance today is nothing like yesterday. How could I use that as an excused? I don’t know; I am a fool.

I let my own selfish motives and goals get in the way, I let them conquer my wellbeing--I let them rule my judgements regardless of others. That's something I have to live with.

One of the things I never said was the opinion the few friends and family I have. R (Retracted) never liked you too much, for reasons I do not know. He would scoff and me off camera and walk away. It made me so sad to lose his approval. Others who I am acquainted with whom I've confided with told me how this was all stupid. Even my mom as I sat on her bed in near tears the night before you had planned what would have been the time of our lives told me that I shouldn't go. I let my own drives for approval of others cloud what I wanted--what I craved. 

They are not me. They didn't know what we shared. 

Yet I let them be my ultimate judgment. Everyone seeks approval of friends, of a group, but when that ends up ruling their own opinions? I cannot speak on that. I'm weak. I don't know; I'm a fool.

Only one knew, A (Retracted). Every time I confided my feelings she would just tell me, ""It's because you love her."" ""I know."" I'd reply. Yet my actions, my deeds, did not reflect the love and passion I had. My words, perhaps, but not the real importance: my actions. As I continue to write this, to really think about the effect of my existence in others’ lives and what I stand for, the more I realise just how painfully right you were.

Yet I didn't listen... I never accept being happy.

There is a quote that I often cite as one of those ""words to live by"" and it goes:

""Amitié qui se peut finir / Ne fut jamais bien commencée"" -Oeuvres poétiques

Loosely translated it means, ""If a friendship can end, it never truly began."" This is the high regard that I hold my friends, knowing that it is impossible for it to end. You, in a matter of a few short months, became the closest friend I have ever had. Someone I could confide in, yet, didn't always. And this throws everything into questioning. Can things end? Can there really be goodbyes? It's hard for me to say. I don't know; I am a fool.

I write all of this as I feel that I need to. If not to act as a long apology and soul wrenching letter just trying to honestly explains myself, to act as closure. To let things rest. I don't expect you to come running back, nor do I even expect you to even reply to this. You don't have to say anything, you can keep moving on to let this enter into the pages of memories. I tickled the thoughts of buying a ticket to P (Retracted) for spring break, hand delivering this letter and explaining myself--yet I juggled between thoughts of immaturity and living life like a romantic novel. Do as you wish. I've learned a lot in the past few weeks, about myself, about others, about life. Perhaps enough, then again, perhaps not nearly enough to even begin to comprehend some of the intricacies of life. It is time for me to take responsibility and to finally do what I have always thought I'd live by. Once again I draw from the words of others, in one of the greatest quotes I have come to known:

""Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in that grey twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat"" -President Theodore Roosevelt

To take action, to dare to at least try to step outside of what is comfortable and into something new. Something I have denied myself for so long, and just perhaps, the source of my troubles.

This is not another goodbye. I have said that enough, too many times to be exact. All I wish is for you to be happy, for you to dare to do those mighty things that bring you that happiness. You'll always be a part of me in ways, if not there, at least a memory. Someone who was the first to open my eyes and show me just what exists, what is possible, and what it is to love and be loved.

I still carry your drawings, I still have your writings, and every time I walk down the streets at night I can remember how my life was before, during, and after.

With a kind heart and the upmost regards,

A co-conspirator in making the world a better place,

I spend every night crying myself to sleep. its a heartwarming feeling I know. 

Where should I start? The beginning, I suppose. 


I am a 23 year old female and my life has been all downhill. All of it. I'm afraid to be happy for even just a moment because I just know it will all come crashing down. Growing up life was hectic, My earliest memory is of my parents fighting when I was 2 and me sitting on the stairs and them not even noticing me as the screamed about my father's gambling issues. They divorced soon after and it was just fight after fight about custody and visitation. It was terrible. Then when I was 13, my father passed away. He was a former decorated police officer (SWAT to be more specific) in my area, in line to be police chief, but his gambling and then getting hooked on crack destroyed his career. He was high one day and walking around his neighborhood naked. Someone saw him and called the police. The police recognized who he was and 6 officers were sent to get him. They couldn't handcuff him because my father knew all the tactics. So the six officers took my father to the ground, face down to handcuff him and the weight of all the men, plus being high killed him. I remember the day like it was yesterday. Sitting in my living room waiting to go to a baseball game that my mom had promised my sister and I for weeks. I was happy and excited, and then she received the phone call. I cried and cried. What was I supposed to know about death at 13? I tried to live life normally, and go to school but my fathers death was reported on 4 news stations and 7 newspapers. The newspaper from his city did a front page article about his death. Everyone knew. People constantly would come up to me asking if I was alright and if I wanted to talk. I was smothered, and couldn't handle it. I kept trying to push back what I was feeling. 


After the funeral my mother changed. She became angry over the littlest things, and she started to hate me. She would constantly degrade me for no reason, calling me stupid and a mistake. Often telling me she wish she had an abortion and that she didnt want me anymore. While my younger sister was her perfect little angel. (we have the same father) My mother would make sleep on the kitchen floor over night if I didn't clean it to her liking, or have me sweep 6-7 times in a row. I love to read, and my mother would take away my books as punishment, she would disconnect the TV, Internet, and phone lines just so I wouldn't have connection to anyone. She replaced my room door with a glass door that locks from the outside. And yes, I have been locked in there. She's beaten me but not as much as she would like to, as I often ran away. And she loved to constantly call the police on me and tell them I was on drugs and have them search my room to find absolutely nothing. 


Finally when I was 16, I snapped. I ran to the kitchen, pulled out the largest Cutco brand knife we had and held it to myself. (And If you don't know, Cutco knives are great! They cut through everything!) I went to my mother, with the edge towards me, I moved the handle in her direction. I told her to push it in. She wanted me gone so badly just do it, kill me now and get it over with. She didnt and she ended up just driving me to the emergency room. Her story changed between me holding the knife towards her, and me wanting to kill myself. (My mother is very self absorbed). She didnt understand that I never wanted to kill myself, but the fact of having to live everyday with someone saying that you were a mistake and they regret not having an abortion when you have no where else to live is torture. I was in the mental hospital for 2 weeks as an inpatient before the moved me to outpatient where I was for 4 weeks. The second time around 6 months later was 4 weeks inpatient 6 months outpatient. Doctors just loaded me with whatever antidepressant, anxiety pills they could find. All the while my grade and classwork suffered. My sister during this time began to draw fake bruises on herself by mixing the crayons and coloring pencils on her skin. They obviously looked faked but my mother ate it up and told everyone I was a psychopathic bully. 

6 months after leaving the hospital for the second time, my mother deemed I was still not good enough so she called the cops and told them to take me because she didn't want me anymore. I was placed into foster care the next day. I was so alone, frightened and scared. And even though I fortunately was placed with a single mom and her adopted daughter who tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible it was disheartening. I had never felt so abandoned and alone in my life. First my father, then my mother. I had no one. I was in foster care for almost a year when my grandmother fought to get me out. She took care of me for a bit, until the grandfather's Alzheimer's got worse and she had to focus on him. My mother reluctantly agreed to let me go back to her house after that. 


She kicked me out right after my 17 birthday and placed me in Job Corps. The worst thing ever. I would not recommend this to anyone. Began smoking pot to cope with a shitty life. At least my few highs brought me some kind of joy. Through a friend there I met what would be my first, and as of now only boyfriend. Things were great at first, we got along, and I lost my virginity to hit. Sometime down the road, on of his best friends went to jail and he was absolutely torn apart over it. He called me in the back yard of our place at the time because he said he had to talk and he just let me have. Beat me so bad I couldnt see or speak. I was too afraid to move. If I tried to defend myself he hit me harder. Beating me became a regular thing and continued for the remained of our 2 almost 3 year relationship. I have two scars on my face, one on my forehead, and one on my lip of where he hit me. I see these as constant reminders of how shitty my life is and now I'll have these scars forever. While this was happening our roommates stole all of my valuables, jewelry and electronics before running off and saying fuck you. I also found out later they (2 girls) were prostitutes. Awesome. I also must add, I was working a full time job and going to school full time as well. Straight A student, and makeup hid what it could at work. 



After narrowly escaping from the abusive relationship, I was able to run away and had my sister pick me up in the middle of the night. My sister still holds it over my head to this day, saying that she never should have picked me up and she should have let him kill me.  I begged my mother to let me stay there until I could get back on my feet. She agreed and I found a new job and switched schools. After a year and a few months we were back at each others throats and I moved in with a friend and his mom who happened to have an open room. It was closer to work and school and I would spend less time and money commuting. Still able to keep my grades up. Then about 8 months ago, I finished my legal program in school and completed my internship with high marks. My place where I did my internship decided to keep me on for a big case they were working on. Everything seemed to be finally working out for me. The friend I had moved in with spat in my face practically and ended the friendship we still don't talk and Im still living there. I worked on the case with the firm for 3 months out of town. I worked my ass off. 78 hour work weeks as the only paralegal supporting 6 attorneys at trial. I made a lot of money, and I was starting to look for my own apartment, and I even bought furniture. Trial ended we won, but on some preliminary motions the judge threw out our expert witness and our case collapsed after that. Worked slowed back at the office and they cut my hours to 15 hours a week maximum. It hurt. Still does. I don't understand why those who work hard in life get nothing. absolutely nothing. My sister on the other hand, has been stung out on drugs, fired from jobs, kicked out of her university, flunked community college, does absolutely nothing with her life and my mom caters to her. Covers all her bills and gives her absolutely everything. 



Oh, and the first guy I had a crush on since my ex asked me to help him find and track down his one true love. Turns out she was married (has been for 3 years and they were together for only 2.) 


I just want to say, Thank YOU GOD, KARMA, BUDDHA, CONFUCIUS,  &amp; WHATEVER OTHER FUCKING GODS ARE OUT THERE, THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE BIGGEST FUCKING SHIT ON MY LIFE EVER. THANKS. My life sucks. I have never been in love, no one has ever wanted me, my family treats me like shit and constantly degrades me, I work hard and get nothing in return, now I practically have no job with 15 hours a week because that doesnt even cover my bills. 


I hate it when people say it gets better. Because it doesn't. Look at my life. I have lived 23 YEARS OF BAD FUCKING LUCK. Maybe I was a bad person in a past life? I am so tired of trying to be a good person, be the better person, when life obviously doesnt take kindly to that. I am utterly alone and I fight this hard battle alone. Sometimes I just want someone I can open up to and share this with and just have them hug me and tell me its going to be okay. Thats all I really need, is a hug. and someone who will let me cry because I am tired of being strong. I am tired of having to put on my big girl pants and pretend everything is okay, because its not. No matter how hard I try to forget, I still hear my mother in the background telling me she doesnt want me, I feel my ex's punches to my face, I see my sister get everything for doing nothing. I hate it, I hate life, and I hate me. I've tried to open up to people about my life, but to those I do, they just shun me afterwards. I guess it was too hard even for them to deal with. I wish someone would just accept me and this baggage I have and just be a friend. Someone who will call me everyday to check on me, someone to talk or hangout, whatever. Because right now my soul is tired and I can't take this anymore. 




TL;DR - MY LIFE SUCKS ASS. AND TO THOSE WHO SAY LIFE GETS BETTER? FUCK YOU, IT DOESNT.  I believed that for a bit and it got me more bad luck. "

1c9aov,5,2013-04-13,I feel like I wasted the past four years of my life getting a degree that will get me nothing. I am just looking for an open ear.,blonderain,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1c9aov/i_feel_like_i_wasted_the_past_four_years_of_my/,"I have failed. This thought has carved itself into the essence of who I am across the past six months.  It hasn’t been quick, more like a path warn into the ground by feet traversing the same line over and over again until it is impossible to veer elsewhere. 

I know I am young and that according to everyone else I try to speak to I have my entire life ahead of me. And I do. I don’t see how it will be any different than now. 

I am introverted. I am soft spoken.  Rooms of people that I need to meet would be up with the thought of being in a car that has driven into a lake. And that I am sitting there as water fills slowly then quickly as my fingers fumble with the seat belt.  Meeting new people is exactly like that, exactly what future employers don’t want to see. And I know they see it as I try to sit up straight and look at them with smiles. 

I graduated last May with a degree in Creative Writing. It took me half a year to land a temp job at a local bookstore that ends the first week of June. All the money I have been making that isn’t spent on student loans, a little more than half, goes into savings. About another one hundred goes towards a bus pass and I allow myself fifty dollars for snacks a month.  I will probably have three months’ worth of payments scraped up once the job ends. 

Retail is exhausting. I get home and all I want to do is sleep. It becomes like pulling teeth to do anything that requires energy, including writing, the one thing I know without a doubt I want to do with my life. I’m falling asleep now as I write this, trying to stave off my sleeping time. As if the pause of not going to bed will keep work further away. I am struggling to put together more applications. I do not want to be doing this. I don’t know what else I can do. Any writing job requires a portfolio. To get a portfolio I need to have a job or have the time and energy to actively pursue it. I have about four hours tacked on my day that is mine. I spend about 1-1.5 hours in transit each way. 

My mother asks me if I have applied to other jobs in my field. What field? What jobs? How do I do this? How do I find a career? How do I do something that she’ll be happy with? I want to make her happy. I want to so much, I want her to look at me and see what she sees in my cousins who all have fancy gown up jobs and are making money, much more then I can ever see myself achieving. 

I can remember vividly her pleading with my thirteen year old self as she shipped me off to private school telling me she “Wanted me to have chances she never had.” Neither of my parents went to college. They assumed I would go to college and get a good job. I went to college. I have a minimum wage temp job and am living at home.
My parents took on debt for me and more as I sauntered off to get a degree in creative writing that is proving to be as useful as a dead bird my cat like to leave under the sofa every other week. 

Oh but I want to write. If I don’t it builds and builds and builds like a never ending climax until everything that touches you burns and sears.  But how? Jobs won’t take me. I would love to get an internship with video game writers, or any internship that would help expand my career options. But instead I’m told to network and meet people. How I echo back. How? How? That question is slowly becoming the only thing I hear, clogging up my ears with nothing. 
I have made nothing off the opportunity my parents gave me, noting of what my mother gave me. I’m tired. I feel like a fool and an idiot. And very lost. Like someone dumped me in the middle of the ocean and no matter how I try I cannot find purchase. 

How do I help myself? This was supposed to be a simple post. I just needed to get out of my head and I wanted someone to talk to.

1c952x,0,2013-04-13,"Dear Mr. 708,",crushedbyacop,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1c952x/dear_mr_708/,"You're a dick.

When someone asks you if you'd like to get coffee sometime, especially with a witty line like the one I used, the correct answer is not a sarcastic ""Oh boy.""

Clearly, you're 41 going on 14, because every person I've told about my little flub has asked me what's wrong with *you* that you wouldn't go out with me. Everyone that I've spoken to agrees that I must have the biggest balls on the planet to ask out an on-duty cop twice my age. 

Plus, lets be real - I'm fucking *gorgeous*. I'm tall. I'm a redhead with blue eyes. I'm 120 pounds and I'm a goddamn athlete for crying out loud. There's a reason you came in all the time, don't even try denying it. Maria noticed you staring at me like a hungry animal everytime I worked with her, Perry called you out on it when you were on that burglary detail around Christmas, and Mike wouldn't make jokes like he does if there was nothing there. Oh, and that girl you brought in when you were looking for gas right after the hurricane? She didn't look like she liked me too much.

But you did.

I think that's why I'm so hurt. No cop in their right mind sits around for 20 minutes after he gets coffee talking to the girl about his plans to go to Costa Rica again in June, or maybe you'll follow Phish around on tour like you've done since high school, or how you're gonna make me a mixtape of music I supposedly need to listen to. No cop tells random civilians about how Jeep gave you a bad car, so they swapped it out for a new one because you got them with that lemon law shit. No cop tells the coffee girl about how he used to be a copywriter and then a private investigator and then an intern with the NHL and then this andthenthatandtheotherthing. That's what you talk about on a coffee date and thats all I even wanted.

It doesn't help me much that you're so attractive. You're tall, a surfer, and everytime you're in uniform you work the room like a Kennedy. The only thing whiter than your hair are your teeth, and when you smile it makes me smile too. You're the only reason I listen to Phish, the reason I rediscovered my love of screamo music, the reason I planned on surfing all summer. On Memorial Day you told me about a surf school in Long Beach and wrote down the name on a piece of paper - I still have it. That was when I fell for you.

So here I am, 21 years old, totally bummed about some dude 20 years my senior. I don't understand you, and I doubt I will. I also don't understand why I'm so upset about it - You can't possibly be *that* great that it's worth sitting here in the middle of the night on reddit crying over this dique letter that I would never actually send to you. Maybe you or someone you're close to is a redditor and will see this - you're pretty recognizable and so am I.  I'm so unbelievably angry at you for rejecting me the way you did I could scream.

But I won't do that.

I'll just tell you that you might want to turn public searching off your facebook (nice cover photo - your JK sticker isn't THAT funny, your initials or the car model) and that if you ever decide to call me - don't. Clearly I wasn't even worth a happy ""Oh boy,"" so just don't bother backtracking. 

Dear John,

Your Facebook is public. Sorry you have such a bad joke on the side of your Jeep. Lose my number, I don't feel like going out anymore. Hope you can deal with decaf - because I can't really deal with you. 

Maybe I'll see you at the beach this summer,

Your favorite coffee girl"
1c90p4,5,2013-04-12,[FR] Dance like no one is watching. And a question on a REALLY awkward situation. (WALL OF TEXT),Formula7,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1c90p4/fr_dance_like_no_one_is_watching_and_a_question/,"*Note, sorry for the shoddy story telling and the potentially shitty grammar. I didn't sleep much and I'm kind of rushing to get this out before I get dinner and head to work for the night. Also... I haven't written an FR in over a year. Definitely not like riding a bike.*

Ladies and Gentlemen, it has been a while. I just got out of a relationship that lasted a little over a year. I just would like to say that I got into that relationship because of the things I learned here. So, while it hurts to have it end, because it was great while it lasted, I can't thank you enough for what you have shown me, and the things I am going to learn from here on out. You people are amazing. Let's get it going.

Before my relationship ended, we decided to make it an open one since the distance was weighing down on us. I was a little reluctant at first, but I figured, ""What the hell... I have nothing else to lose, this already looks like it's going the wrong direction and I might as well.""
So, my friends caught wind and we started heading out. I brought a good friend of mine along who is an **amazing** pivot. Her, I, and two other guys I knew headed out to the bar last Wednesday night. After getting in, we immediately hit the bar and I started opening girls to get warm. I was doing alright, but realizing that I wasn't where I used to be when I had met my girlfriend. It was time to make a come back to that. We talked to different people through the night and nothing was really hooking. I didn't care. It was a first night back and I was focused on being outcome independent.
Well, my friend who was pivot for me loves to dance. She's really *really* high energy and never fails to lift me up to her level. We ended up being the only two people in the bar dancing our asses off and just having a blast. I kept tabs on what was going on around me and noticed a lot of girls staring and laughing and enjoying our dance battle. One in particular, who I found real cute, went up to the bar after watching us for a while. So, I headed up to get another drink.
I stood next to her, made eye contact, and smiled while holding. She smiled back and I turned to order my drink.
As I was about to say something, I realized there was something odd floating around in my drink and I lost focus for a moment trying to figure out what it was. Eventually she leaned over and said, ""Sorry, it's a roofie."" I let out a laugh and asked why she felt that was necessary. She shot back, ""I'm a girl and I have to make my job easy!"" Without missing a beat I said, ""You could have just asked if I was easy first."" And winked at her. She laughed and we got to talking.
Eventually she asked if I was gonna buy drinks. I told her I wasn't that easy. ""I thought you said you were, easy?""
""No, I said you could have asked if I was and you never asked. So now that you know that I'm not, how bout you buy the first round and I'll get the next. I think that's fair."" She smiled and obliged.
After sometime my friends all recommended we head to the club next door. We followed and, though it was empty, we all danced the night away and brought the energy up. In fact, everyone in the club who wasn't dancing, followed us on to the dance floor and joined in. My friend was up on the Go-go stage dancing like crazy and invited my target up there. I grabbed her by the hand, pulled her in, and gave her a lift on to the stage.

To make a long story short, we had a fun time, danced like crazy, and just enjoyed ourselves. I could not isolate her that night, but I managed to get her number and texted her after she left. We had a short conversation, agreed to go out dancing again the next day, and she went to bed.

Thursday came around and we texted a little bit through the day. I invited some of my friend since she invited hers and I got a guest list to a club my friends and I frequent. She ran late, as girls do, but got there. It actually surprised me because I thought she was gonna flake. I challenged her earlier that day to see how classy she could get, she did a pretty good job dressing up for the occasion. She brought a friend and I brought one. We chatted, did shots, and I eventually grabbed her hand and pulled her out to the dance floor. My buddy actually hit it off with her friend after I did some wing work and we all got to dancing.
Not much more than dancing happened in the club. While my pivot friend wasn't there, I managed to maintain the same frame from the last night of someone who just didn't care and wanted to have fun. She loved it. It wasn't too busy to I spun her around and dipped her from time to time.
Through the night, she was definitely pacing me. Being hot and cold, pushing and pulling. In the past, I would have grown frustrated with the situation, but I continued to just have fun and not care. Eventually, she recommended we all go back to her place for drinks. So her and I walked out of the club while our friends were too busy making out. We got outside and she was cold. So, I put my jacket on her, leaned her up against the wall, and kiss closed. I made sure to not be overly excited about it.
Our friends came out and I took her hand and we headed to the car. We drove back to her place and all had a little fun. Though, she was really drunk after more shots at her house and I'm not one to take advantage. So, I stopped and told her goodnight as she passed out on the couch and headed home.

Since then, we had a brunch date that got cut short by her mom visiting unexpectedly from out of town. I met her, I was drunk, it was hilarious. But that's outside of the point. Fast forward to yesterday.

Through the week we had texted here and there but nothing major. She had come to visit me at my work once (I work at a restaurant). Eventually, we found time to meet up again yesterday.

Yesterday was a tough one. I talked to my girlfriend that day about her coming home in a few months. She said she hadn't found a job back home and was thinking about staying in the bay area where she could find work. After asking where it left us, she gave me a hesitant, ""I don't know."" We hung up and I had a pretty shitty day. Hit the gym for a few hours (I'm there so long since I'm starting to intern as a coach for the power lifting program) and my gf called me up. We talked and after some discussion and some hard moments, we broke up. There were certain deal breakers that could not be overlooked, so, reluctantly, I let go, knowing it was the right thing to do.

That night, I met up with my, now ex, gf's best friend who had become a good friend of mine. We decided to hit karaoke after I told her what happened. She recommended that I bring my HB along. I gave her a text. She was being a little lazy and wanted to stay home. So, without struggle, I told her we'd stick to our original brunch plans we had for saturday and I'd just go out. I didn't want to push the issue. She told me she was originally just going to invite me over to drink with her, but decided that karaoke sounded fun and she'd come out.
We ended up at the bar later that night and met up with some friends. The bar we went to is always pretty random and interesting things always happen there. We ran into quite a few people all of us knew and our little group of five snowballed into something around 20 people. After drinks, singing, dancing, and generally having stupid fun, we decided to hit another bar.
Through this time, two other guys who she knew from school were pretty much clamoring over her. I let them do their thing and headed into the rest of the group to talk to other people and network. I ended up #closing another girl in the group after joking around with her for a while. As the last bar closed, we all went outside and one of the guys who was hitting on my (original) target bought a flower from a homeless guy and gave it to her. I wandered off to find my friend who was driving. As I am walking , I hear footsteps rush up and turn to see the HB grab my hand and walk with me. We got to the car and drove off the get food. She stuck with me the rest of the night, holding my hand and sitting next to me.
Eventually, disappointed, the other guy left. The party continued into the night at my friends house and didn't calm down until about 5am.
I drove her home and we sat in the driveway for a bit. She unbuckled but didn't exit the car. At this point, I had realized how my time being out of the game had taken a toll on my assertiveness and over all ""alpha"" mentality. Long distance relationships can be burdening.
She stared at me and we laughed. I knew what I was supposed to say, but eventually just said, ""I'll come around to let you out."" She smiled and said, ""Why don't you just hang out for a while? It seems safer than your drive home."" (I live pretty far from the midtown/downtown area and it usually takes me 15-20 minutes to get home when I'm out). So we went inside and grabbed some water and sat on the couch.
There was about a foot and a half of space between us and I sat there awkwardly for a bit. I analyzed for a while and finally stopped and told myself, ""She invited you in at 5am, alone, and is sitting near you. You have a pair of balls. Use them."" So, I slid over, took her chin with my hand and we kissed her.
We ended up not F-closing last night. We did, however, end up in her bed and after a few tries and her stopping me (she was pretty drunk again), I let it go and figured I'd give it another shot another time and decided to pass out.
It was 6am, I was exhausted and hadn't slept in almost 20 hours.

This is where it gets interesting...

I woke up about 2 hours later and it was hot. The bed was small, we were under some blankets, and cuddled together.  I reached down to give myself a man scratch and noticed some more-than-normal moisture. Needless to say... I. Freaked. Out.

I sat there reasoning with myself. The first thing that came to mind was, ""You haven't wet the bed in almost twenty fucking years! How did this happen... After my break up, with another girl... IN HER BED."" I turned over and buried my face into a pillow. I wanted to die. I wanted to sink through the bed frame and into the wall, never to be seen again. Her alarm went off and she hit snooze and didn't move as she fell back asleep. I spent an hour formulating a plan to get out of the bed and clean myself off, but I kept being remind that it didn't change the fact that there was piss all over her bed. After about an hour and her alarm going off a few more times, I finally convinced myself to sit up and try to go to the bathroom.
She shifted and looked up at me and asked if I was okay. I responded with a nervous yes. She asked why I was sitting up. After a pause, she got out of bed and turned to look at me.
""Fuck... *fuck*"" Was all she said as she ran to the bathroom. She came back and grabbed her robe and left again. I reached over to the other side of the bed to pull myself out and realized that it was just as wet. I stood up and realized I had to take a leak... then looked at the bed and realized where the majority of the moisture was.

It hit me. And then I felt bad. She came out of the bathroom and looked at me. She pointed at her bedside table to my pill of things. ""Phone, keys, watch... is that all your stuff?"" I nodded. ""Well, I'm sorry. I hate getting that drunk in front of people I don't know that well and I've already done that with you twice. But... I know you were going to drive me to school, but I'm kicking you out now...""
Not ever being in such a situation before, I was thrown back on my heals. I picked up my things and looked over at the bed. Then, we looked at each other. She apologized, ""I'm really sorry, like I said, I don't normally get that drunk in front of people I don't know that well... This never happens..."" I grabbed my shoes and said an awkward goodbye. She opened up the door, said, ""See you..."" and closed it. I drove home in silence and astonished.

I don't really give a shit that she wet the bed. We've all done dumb shit when we were plastered. Puked, pooped, pee'd, jumped on the hoods of random cars, etc. But, I know by her body language toward me and how it had developed over the past week that she had taken a liking to me, so she was extra embarrassed. I felt genuinely bad and empathized.
Later today, she texted me that she had way too much to do this weekend and cancelled brunch. I responded after I woke up telling her that it was cool and we would catch up next week. No response still.

I understand the abundance mentality. I'm fine with it and if I have to let this one roll off, I will. In all honesty, she's a great girl and a lot of fun. I'd love to keep her around as a friend until she moves back home after school. Really, I just would rather her not feel so humiliated, thinking I don't ever want to see her again and thinking I'm going to tell everyone in town (we live in a ""little-big"" city and no, not Reno). I'm not so sure what I do here, guys.

Has anyone else been in this situation before? What do you do? I'm a pretty genuine person in the end and, if anything, just hope she isn't so embarrassed that she never shows her face again and avoids me if she see's me around town. I really do feel bad.

**TL;DR** Met a girl, had a few dates and went dancing with her. Going really well. Went to her place, didn't F-close but fell asleep together. So drunk she wet the bed. Awkwardly asked me to leave and cancelled tomorrow's date. Feel bad that she's so embarrassed. What do?

**Edit**: Shitty spelling and grammar everywhere. I'll edit it later. Sorry, just run with me here, guys."

I met this man on OKcupid ~20 months ago. We met up after a few months worth of messages at a local bar. We had a meaningful conversation pertaining to our political ideologies, our pasts, and future goals. It was a effortless/natural connection and the attraction was so intense that we left ~2 hours to make out in the parking lot where he eventually followed me home. We had sex. I am very picky when it comes to looks and he was my ideal partner physically and mentally. He dressed with style, had long hair, wonderful music taste, and a fantastic sense of humor. I was infatuated. He felt the same way about me. The next day he came back over and stayed for the night. For the next 3 months we saw each other every weekend. I then went on a trip with Habitat for Humanity, and he gave me a care package to take (alcohol, baked goods, with a card). We skyped every night. I sent him a card in the mail since he was in another state with his family. The card expressed my deep feelings for him/wanting to be in a relationship with him. He said he is normally terrified of such things, but wanted to be with me in the most natural way possible.
We dated for three months when I told him I could no longer take him seriously for the long haul since he had no job or education. To pay for things he sold all of his valuables on craigslist. I was at the time applying to graduate schools and working full time advising students at a University. Over these three months I found out the following...


His background:
He used to be a professional musician in Nashville. He was also a drug addict (did every street drug except for heroin and meth). Drugs took him down and it affected him so badly that he quit his career as a professional musician. He moved out of state to where I am, to live with his brother (who is 20+ years older than him) to ""escape drugs"". He quit cold turkey. However his brother's fiance wanted him out after he lived with them for over a year and a half. During this time he said he was ""getting clean"". When I told him I couldn't take him seriously he immediately got a full time job with Walgreens. He cut off his hair for the job. He bought a nice wardrobe. He also enrolled on his own in a local community college to complete his associates degree (only 2 classes short, and had a 3.0 GPA which is great at 54 credits).
When I saw his self improvement, we made the decision together for him to move into my studio apartment (550 square feet). We had a very functional and healthy relationship, we were great at communicating. We had plenty of passionate sex. We had so much fun together. It was my first romance. He met my entire family. My family adored him. They became his number 1 fans. HIS family is not present in his life at all. He also has absolutely no friends he stays in contact with on a regular basis. His parents... I only saw him speak to them maybe twice through out the relationship. His parents never helped him financially or emotionally. His mother sent him shitty care packages now and then, but it was obvious he only had me, my friends, my family for emotional support. It was not unhealthy, though. We made an awesome team, emotionally and financially. I have never been so close with a person. He has never been so close with a person. I found out he has had 2 girlfriends in his past. One was for 3 years but she cheated on him, so they broke up (he thought he was going to marry her). The other girlfriend was crazy and his junkie partner, she didn't matter to him in the end. I was the first healthy caring person he has had in his life, basically. To be clear: he has not had support from friends, family, or significant others.


When he completed his Associates at community college and transferred to the University I work at and now go to school at (I am in a masters program/still advising students). He also started pedicabbing downtown on weekends for extra money because his wages got GARNISHED. He told me his manager at walgreens told him for the next 18 months 25% of his wages would be collected from his paychecks. He said it was because he dipped on a lease in Nashville and they found him in Florida 5 years later... Then his car started to fall apart because . He had to get it fixed constantly for a few months and ended up spending ~$3,000. Pedicabbing is odd hours on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. From 8:00 PM - 3:00 AM.
He took 3 pre law classes. I never pressured him, it was his own choice to go back to school to become a lawyer. I was in my second semester of graduate school, working and interning. We hardly saw each other because through out the week I was busy, however I have weekends free. He went to night classes Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays he was pedicabbing until 4:00 AM WHILE working full time at Walgreens during the day.
Through out all of this going on he made it clear he was a long term partner. We talked about marriage, we talked about children, he bought my family holiday presents, we nested our apartment, bought a bed together (which I had to sign on the monthly payments of 17 months at $46 dollars per month, since he has bad credit). But he made it clear and played the role of being my life time partner. He made me feel like he had my back and I had his, always.


The last few months:
On Valentines day he spent $150 on flowers and we had amazing sex. However, after that day a switch went off. He got burnt out from working 2 jobs and getting absolutely no time to eat, sleep or study. When midterms came around he had no idea what to do. He freaked out. These midterms were take home midterms, he had time to read and complete these tests for quite some time. He waited until the day they were due. He gave himself no chance at succeeding. So, he did the smart thing and withdrew from 2 of his 3 classes.
But then he spiraled into depression. He stopped taking care of himself and his appearance. I tried to be there for him and support him through it but it seemed to make him feel worse. I tried to explain my support comes from love not from a place of ""you're not good enough"". We never kissed. We never had sex for that last month. We hardly saw each other, he worked all of the time. I thought it was a money issue, not a relationship issue.


Spring break came around and for that week my bird was having surgery (whom I have had since I was 5). I was 2 1/2 hours away but before I left I bought ~$80 of easy to eat groceries so that he would at least be taken care of in his depression. The day of my bird's surgery he said he ""needed space"". I told him I needed to talk and that he needs to compromise. He said ""sorry, then"". He has never been short with me so I was in great distress. For a week we didn't talk. My parents saw me unraveling and found out what was happening. Immediately they pressured me to find out what is going on. That night, one week later, the day before coming back home, my family had a crisis. It was emotionally devastating. I thought life is stressful enough and that I needed him for support, not extra stress because at this point I was unraveling.


That phone call he said ""maybe we moved too fast. I feel too much pressure"". I was shocked. He said he thinks he should move out. He said he doesn't know what is wrong with him, but that he doesn't deserve me and is fucked up. He said he had to go (pedicabbing) and was crying. He said we would talk the next day when I drove back because he was off of work. I agreed.


I left him a voicemail that day saying what time I'd arrive. When I came home the apartment was empty. He had moved out. I walked in without him there, when he said he would be there. It was traumatizing. I called him and he said ""I moved out, with a pedicabber, arranged it last night and moved in this morning, I have to sign things so I'll talk to you later"". A few hours go by and I asked him if he was coming over to talk and he said ""It will be awhile, will you be there awhile?"" and I then called him. Crying hysterically. I asked him if he was on a lease and he said he pays month to month. He said he was not on a lease. So clearly he was avoiding me. I told him my mom was driving up to be with me and he got mad because we were supposed to talk later. I then told him I packed up the rest of his things and it was outside my door. I said I was breaking up with him because he called me babe (clearly, he blew me out, but was being delusional calling me babe), he nonchalantly said ""okay, fine"". Only then he came speeding over to get his things. While speeding over he said ""I never wanted this. I never wanted to break up. I don't know what's wrong with me."" I told him I was breaking up with him not because I don't love him, that I love him with all my heart, but the way he was treating me was making me unravel and I need to be able to go to school, intern and work. He picked up his things and tried to get me to let him in but I didn't. He then asked for a poster of my favorite band, Swans (which I put $90 to framing, saying he'd pay me back, he never did). He never paid rent. He claimed for the first week of March he was living out of his car. He never offered to pay for the bed payments (I still have +$700 payments left). Later he texted me that he is ""destroyed and sorry"".


For those next 10 days there was no contact. My mom stayed with me. I dropped 20+ pounds. I went to a psychiatrist to get put on SSRIs, I also started seeing a trauma therapist. If it wasn't for my family and friends I'd probably be out of school, out of a job, and maybe not here at all. I've never had a broken heart, and I pictured my future with this man, and never thought it was possible for him to mistreat me because we had such a good relationship. It was literally an instant complete 180 with no warnings. I tried to get him to get help, he has no insurance but our University has FREE mental health help. He said ""I can't. I am unable to be helped, it doesn't work for me"". Apparently he went to a doctor in his past and was put on anti psychotics for general anxiety and depression, but claimed it didn't work. I told him the dose was probably too low and he probably didn't have a therapist he could connect with, that it could work. He wouldn't try.


I found his mother's phone number and decided to call. She didn't even know my name. She said he lied to her that he was living with a man for that entire year. When I told her of his erratic behavior she was not even concerned. She said ""Oh I'll tell him to call you"". She was so stupidly unaware of anything going on in his life with little concern. So I said ""I am not calling for that, I have accepted he's in my past. I am calling you to let you know he NEEDS YOU"". She said she appreciated me calling, never heard from her again. She probably didn't even tell his father for all I know. My ex told me he has fucked over his family plenty, so maybe they wiped their hands clean. I'll never know.


Two weekends ago he texted me that he was ""hurting too badly, needed to talk to me and see me"" I told him only if he could be open and honest and start acting like an adult and not a child. He said he would ""man up"". The next day I was about to go shopping with my mom and he texted me ""don't want you anymore, I am not crawling back, lose my number"". I started crying again. I didn't respond. Then he said ""I crossed some boundaries and logged into your facebook (the PW was the same as the WIFI PW, but I never thought he'd invade my privacy) and now know how you truly feel about me"". I was talking to a new male friend, who was experiencing heart break as well. He became a part of my support group. It was nice to vent and feel understood. He is just a friend. My ex then says ""He seems cool, why don't you go fuck him."" I was shocked, he never talked to me like this. I told my friend he was reading our convo and was changing my PW. Friend didn't care, understood. Ex called me ""heartless"". Ex and I texted for hours back and forth. He said he was ""crying in my room all day. I am destroyed. I can't talk right now"". I told him to just hold the phone to his ear after 2 hrs+ of texting back and forth. Finally he picked up. He said ""I would never speak ill of you"" (I said to friends that he up and left me, hacked into my facebook, was going through a midlife crisis, and acting like a douche bag) I told him ""I would have never left you"". He said ""I cannot believe you're getting consolation from another man"". He told me to move on. I told him if he didn't want to be spoken of in an ill manner, he should have behaved better, and that I am single and am free to say and do what I want. He started crying saying he had to go and so I asked him what was going on and he said ""I still love you"".
For the next few hours I was a mess and we were texting back and forth. I told him we had to fix things now or else resentments would be too strong, that I couldn't go back and forth anymore. 

Then my parents threatened to kick me out of their lives if I went back to him after what he did to me. They later admitted it was an empty threat, but they were emotional seeing me hurt so much. My ex kept saying he couldn't talk now and he needed time. I told him there is no more time, we have to fix it now, I'm trying to pull you out of the dark cave but you're not coming into the light and I can't stay in the dark cave anymore because it is sucking the life out of me. He said he was pedicabbing and that he would call me later. When I asked what time he said he didn't know and that it was busy. I told him he was making me feel like an obligation. I told him I don't know if he's coming or going, what is happening, that there is no security with him and he needs to act like an adult. He replied with ""fine, I'll make an adult decision. We are over. This is official. I don't want either of us to be in limbo anymore. You are free to fuck and date whomever you like. This fucking sucks but I guess this is how it has to be. Good bye, I'll miss you"". I didn't respond. A few hours later he texts me ""I am on break, you can call me if you want to still talk"". I didn't respond. He then says ""fine, I'll take this as the cut off point. Goodbye, I'll miss you"". I responded and said ""I wish you the best, it never had to be this way, you self sabotaged and made it this way. You blew me out. You created the abusive pattern by leaving me, hacking into my facebook, getting mad at what I was saying when I am single, by giving me bait such as ""I guess this is how it has to be"" and then saying ""you can call me if you want"". If I try to remedy the situation I am just continuing the abusive pattern. It never had to be this way."" He replied with ""If you see me downtown you're allowed to say hi"". I didn't respond.
I found out from a mutual friend that he lives with a 65 year old pedicabber. He also owes the pedicab shop rent money (it is $105 each week in rent). He makes AT LEAST $1,100 a month. I asked him before we cut communication if he was on drugs and he swore he isn't and all his money goes to ""bullshit I guess"".


This past Friday I was on the outskirts downtown at a bar my friends DJ at. A fellow pedicabber offered to give me a free ride so I asked him if he knew my ex. He said he doesn't. So I said the owner of the shops name and he knew the guy and I asked if they do drugs. He said they snort and smoke marijuana. He asked for my ex's description. Apparently that night he snaked this guy out (this guy was about to get a ride then my ex rode in front of him and stole these customers from him). This pedicabber said if this happened in Washington D.C. he would get the shit beat out of him and that the Orlando pedicabbers are all careless crack heads. He said he would say something to my ex next time he messes with him for me on my behalf because he said what he did was not what someone who loves someone would do. Like my ex, this pedicabber is a drifter, and he said he would never do my ex did. he dropped me off.


I then went back to the bar and my best friend gave me mushrooms, alcohol and marijuana. I needed to leave my black hole and use drugs as a means of new realizations. I was surrounded by loving friends. But then I wanted to walk up the street with my bestfriend, while doing so, my ex rode by. There is no business to be made where I was, so he was creeping on me. Naturally, I felt immense amounts of anger, not because he came out to where I was, but because he looked AWFUL. He looked homeless. His beard was grown out. He was skinny. His hair was long. My best friend didn't recognize him and said he looked like scum. I flipped him off and said ""fuck you"". He turned around and said ""real mature"" and I yelled back ""real mature? Real mature leaving me high and dry, sticking me with the bills, dropping out of school, you fail at life!"". He texted me later saying ""I'm sure you feel really great about that, you FINALLY got to tell off the loser who broke your heart with a ""fuck you"" have a good night. I ignored it.
However today I sent him this text message... I told him ""you coming over to where I am without initiating contact via phone, you looking so terrible (my friend and I didn't recognize you, you look homeless), I was on a heavy dose of mushrooms, so when you came out of no where my anger took over. I am so angry that you ruined what we had and I am more angry at you for ruining your life when you have so much potential. I'm just really disappointed in you and what we could have been and seeing you self-destruct. Please do not antagonize me anymore. If you want help, support, or a friend I am here, but I can't see you willingly fuck your life up. Please get help"".


He responded with ""Actually, I caught a $40 ride over there earlier that night and if I looked so terrible, I'm sure women wouldn't have been hitting on me that night. Just wanted to clear that up."" So I said ""I'm sure the caliber of women is not great, but you don't look healthy, don't want to insult you"". He said ""Whatever makes you feel better. I was doing my job. I happened to see you. You said ""fuck you"". I told him ""wouldn't you have done the same if you I had done what you did to me, to you?"" and he said ""No, I wouldn't have. Not making excuses here, but I'm going through some shit, and you claimed you care and are concerned but when you act like that I know you're full of shit. Doesn't matter anymore. You should've left it at fuck you. I've always taken responsibility for fucking up I didn't blame this on you"".


My last words to him are the following: ""Lastly, you take my words for truth. But people say things they don't mean when they are deeply hurt. Speaking ill of you to my support group (whatever makes me feel better, right?) if you don't want to be spoken poorly of, act like a decent human being with integrity and a heart. Take a look at your actions. You up and left me with no warning after playing the role of my significant other (you made me believe I had your back and you had mine) my world came crashing down the way you handled your freak out (so selfish and hurtful, very sociopath like behavior BTW), you then play with my heart and hack into my facebook, use it against me when I was hurt, weak and vulnerable from your heartless actions (and stressed the fuck out because my world was turned upside down since you changed like a flip of a switch, nearly ruined my own reputation at work/internship/school) and while I was in emotional distress you kept slapping me around emotionally abusing me, giving hope, taking it away, coming and going as you please. My fuck you, speaking ill of you, is because I am a deeply hurt human being who was toyed with, abused and discarded like a piece of shit. Then you accuse me for being full of shit for saying fuck you. Those are words from the hurt/scars you have created for me. What I did was what I had to do, not the right thing to do, to get it off my chest. But look at my actions. I've been here, trying to fix things, taking your bullshit/abuse because I refuse to accept that this is you. I refuse to imagine you pretended this entire time and this is your true skin. But you're not taking a deep look at yourself and taking responsibility and changing for the better. You're stuck wallowing and blaming other people for for your careless decisions and are unable to deal with the consequences of your decisions and also unable to follow through, because you're not thinking about anyone else but yourself and your feelings. But you made it this way. I only wanted love and happiness and I gave it without hesitation, fear or doubt. Maybe you cheated on me. Maybe you did drugs. Maybe you have a baby. Maybe someone died. Maybe you killed someone. I don't know what to think and how you could do a complete 180 without hesitation, quit on me, quit on us, quit on yourself, and hurt me so deeply. You never loved me if this is how things end. Maybe you loved me with all you could love, maybe you just don't know what love is because you never had it until me. But you had it with me. You had all of me. But I had none of you. Ever""


He isn't responding.


I don't know how to move on from here. I am still overly analyzing where things and how things went wrong. Is there anyone who could provide observations? I need clarification. I am so lost and confused in my hurt.


My dad told me if he thought he was sincere about me, he would have paid the entire rent. Told my ex not to worry and to just do good in University. He said if he wanted help he would help him. But he doesn't want help. He compared my ex to a stray dog. Some stray dogs want help and are rehomed and great family additions. But some won't trust ever again and run away when trying to be helped. He told me there is no hope, that he will only drag me down, and do it again.
My ex won't hear me out. Doesn't take any accountability. Is there anything I can say or do to make him see the light? Am I doing something wrong? How do I move on? How do I stop analyzing? I have plenty of friends and family who love me. I have a great life going for me. I'll be okay. But I just can't grasp how things have fallen apart, been abandoned by ""the love of my life"", and how he could treat me so terribly. I am so broken. I want to be strong. I want to push through this. But I need advice/validation that I am not the one who ruined this. and maybe there is something else that can be said/done to fix things? I can't stand that my primary relationship is gone, unable to be fixed for even friendship. That he sees me as the one who gave up/ruined things, the nemesis. How can someone not see what they've done? Maybe I am naive. Maybe I am too hurt. Please help me gain perspective, Reddit.


Tl;DR: Ex [28M] and I [24F] lived together for 15 months, said he was in for long haul, wanted to be with me for life. Was living with brother (who I don't know really existed) getting clean for 1 1/2 years after being a professional musician/drug addict in Nashville, Got two jobs (walgreens full time, peddicabbing). Got into University to do pre law. Withdrew from 2 of 3 classes because his wages at Walgreens got garnished so he pedicabbed more and got burnt out. Felt like a failure/turned depressed/distant. Bought a bed with me, nested apartment. Met my family. He up and left me without warning saying the apartment felt like ""a coffin"", erratic behavior, might be on drugs or experiencing a mental break down, comes and goes in my life as he wants but finds reasons that I am wrong (hacking into my FB reading my messages between my support group, blaming me for speaking ill of him when I only spoke of his ill behavior, claiming I don't give a shit about him), tries to get me jealous now, always has to have last hurtful word, takes no accountability for his heartless actions). I don't know what to do or how to feel. Need perspective. Please read my post and give me your best comment."

That phone call he said ""maybe we moved too fast. I feel too much pressure"". I was shocked. He said he thinks he should move out. He said he doesn't know what is wrong with him, but that he doesn't deserve me and is fucked up. He said he had to go (pedicabbing) and was crying. He said we would talk the next day when I drove back because he was off of work. I agreed.


I left him a voicemail that day saying what time I'd arrive. When I came home the apartment was empty. He had moved out. I walked in without him there, when he said he would be there. It was traumatizing. I called him and he said ""I moved out, with a pedicabber, arranged it last night and moved in this morning, I have to sign things so I'll talk to you later"". A few hours go by and I asked him if he was coming over to talk and he said ""It will be awhile, will you be there awhile?"" and I then called him. Crying hysterically. I asked him if he was on a lease and he said he pays month to month. He said he was not on a lease. So clearly he was avoiding me. I told him my mom was driving up to be with me and he got mad because we were supposed to talk later. I then told him I packed up the rest of his things and it was outside my door. I said I was breaking up with him because he called me babe (clearly, he blew me out, but was being delusional calling me babe), he nonchalantly said ""okay, fine"". Only then he came speeding over to get his things. While speeding over he said ""I never wanted this. I never wanted to break up. I don't know what's wrong with me."" I told him I was breaking up with him not because I don't love him, that I love him with all my heart, but the way he was treating me was making me unravel and I need to be able to go to school, intern and work. He picked up his things and tried to get me to let him in but I didn't. He then asked for a poster of my favorite band, Swans (which I put $90 to framing, saying he'd pay me back, he never did). He never paid rent. He claimed for the first week of March he was living out of his car. He never offered to pay for the bed payments (I still have +$700 payments left). Later he texted me that he is ""destroyed and sorry"".


For those next 10 days there was no contact. My mom stayed with me. I dropped 20+ pounds. I went to a psychiatrist to get put on SSRIs, I also started seeing a trauma therapist. If it wasn't for my family and friends I'd probably be out of school, out of a job, and maybe not here at all. I've never had a broken heart, and I pictured my future with this man, and never thought it was possible for him to mistreat me because we had such a good relationship. It was literally an instant complete 180 with no warnings. I tried to get him to get help, he has no insurance but our University has FREE mental health help. He said ""I can't. I am unable to be helped, it doesn't work for me"". Apparently he went to a doctor in his past and was put on anti psychotics for general anxiety and depression, but claimed it didn't work. I told him the dose was probably too low and he probably didn't have a therapist he could connect with, that it could work. He wouldn't try.


I found his mother's phone number and decided to call. She didn't even know my name. She said he lied to her that he was living with a man for that entire year. When I told her of his erratic behavior she was not even concerned. She said ""Oh I'll tell him to call you"". She was so stupidly unaware of anything going on in his life with little concern. So I said ""I am not calling for that, I have accepted he's in my past. I am calling you to let you know he NEEDS YOU"". She said she appreciated me calling, never heard from her again. She probably didn't even tell his father for all I know. My ex told me he has fucked over his family plenty, so maybe they wiped their hands clean. I'll never know.


Two weekends ago he texted me that he was ""hurting too badly, needed to talk to me and see me"" I told him only if he could be open and honest and start acting like an adult and not a child. He said he would ""man up"". The next day I was about to go shopping with my mom and he texted me ""don't want you anymore, I am not crawling back, lose my number"". I started crying again. I didn't respond. Then he said ""I crossed some boundaries and logged into your facebook (the PW was the same as the WIFI PW, but I never thought he'd invade my privacy) and now know how you truly feel about me"". I was talking to a new male friend, who was experiencing heart break as well. He became a part of my support group. It was nice to vent and feel understood. He is just a friend. My ex then says ""He seems cool, why don't you go fuck him."" I was shocked, he never talked to me like this. I told my friend he was reading our convo and was changing my PW. Friend didn't care, understood. Ex called me ""heartless"". Ex and I texted for hours back and forth. He said he was ""crying in my room all day. I am destroyed. I can't talk right now"". I told him to just hold the phone to his ear after 2 hrs+ of texting back and forth. Finally he picked up. He said ""I would never speak ill of you"" (I said to friends that he up and left me, hacked into my facebook, was going through a midlife crisis, and acting like a douche bag) I told him ""I would have never left you"". He said ""I cannot believe you're getting consolation from another man"". He told me to move on. I told him if he didn't want to be spoken of in an ill manner, he should have behaved better, and that I am single and am free to say and do what I want. He started crying saying he had to go and so I asked him what was going on and he said ""I still love you"".
For the next few hours I was a mess and we were texting back and forth. I told him we had to fix things now or else resentments would be too strong, that I couldn't go back and forth anymore. 

Then my parents threatened to kick me out of their lives if I went back to him after what he did to me. They later admitted it was an empty threat, but they were emotional seeing me hurt so much. My ex kept saying he couldn't talk now and he needed time. I told him there is no more time, we have to fix it now, I'm trying to pull you out of the dark cave but you're not coming into the light and I can't stay in the dark cave anymore because it is sucking the life out of me. He said he was pedicabbing and that he would call me later. When I asked what time he said he didn't know and that it was busy. I told him he was making me feel like an obligation. I told him I don't know if he's coming or going, what is happening, that there is no security with him and he needs to act like an adult. He replied with ""fine, I'll make an adult decision. We are over. This is official. I don't want either of us to be in limbo anymore. You are free to fuck and date whomever you like. This fucking sucks but I guess this is how it has to be. Good bye, I'll miss you"". I didn't respond. A few hours later he texts me ""I am on break, you can call me if you want to still talk"". I didn't respond. He then says ""fine, I'll take this as the cut off point. Goodbye, I'll miss you"". I responded and said ""I wish you the best, it never had to be this way, you self sabotaged and made it this way. You blew me out. You created the abusive pattern by leaving me, hacking into my facebook, getting mad at what I was saying when I am single, by giving me bait such as ""I guess this is how it has to be"" and then saying ""you can call me if you want"". If I try to remedy the situation I am just continuing the abusive pattern. It never had to be this way."" He replied with ""If you see me downtown you're allowed to say hi"". I didn't respond.
I found out from a mutual friend that he lives with a 65 year old pedicabber. He also owes the pedicab shop rent money (it is $105 each week in rent). He makes AT LEAST $1,100 a month. I asked him before we cut communication if he was on drugs and he swore he isn't and all his money goes to ""bullshit I guess"".


This past Friday I was on the outskirts downtown at a bar my friends DJ at. A fellow pedicabber offered to give me a free ride so I asked him if he knew my ex. He said he doesn't. So I said the owner of the shops name and he knew the guy and I asked if they do drugs. He said they snort and smoke marijuana. He asked for my ex's description. Apparently that night he snaked this guy out (this guy was about to get a ride then my ex rode in front of him and stole these customers from him). This pedicabber said if this happened in Washington D.C. he would get the shit beat out of him and that the Orlando pedicabbers are all careless crack heads. He said he would say something to my ex next time he messes with him for me on my behalf because he said what he did was not what someone who loves someone would do. Like my ex, this pedicabber is a drifter, and he said he would never do my ex did. he dropped me off.


I then went back to the bar and my best friend gave me mushrooms, alcohol and marijuana. I needed to leave my black hole and use drugs as a means of new realizations. I was surrounded by loving friends. But then I wanted to walk up the street with my bestfriend, while doing so, my ex rode by. There is no business to be made where I was, so he was creeping on me. Naturally, I felt immense amounts of anger, not because he came out to where I was, but because he looked AWFUL. He looked homeless. His beard was grown out. He was skinny. His hair was long. My best friend didn't recognize him and said he looked like scum. I flipped him off and said ""fuck you"". He turned around and said ""real mature"" and I yelled back ""real mature? Real mature leaving me high and dry, sticking me with the bills, dropping out of school, you fail at life!"". He texted me later saying ""I'm sure you feel really great about that, you FINALLY got to tell off the loser who broke your heart with a ""fuck you"" have a good night. I ignored it.
However today I sent him this text message... I told him ""you coming over to where I am without initiating contact via phone, you looking so terrible (my friend and I didn't recognize you, you look homeless), I was on a heavy dose of mushrooms, so when you came out of no where my anger took over. I am so angry that you ruined what we had and I am more angry at you for ruining your life when you have so much potential. I'm just really disappointed in you and what we could have been and seeing you self-destruct. Please do not antagonize me anymore. If you want help, support, or a friend I am here, but I can't see you willingly fuck your life up. Please get help"".


He responded with ""Actually, I caught a $40 ride over there earlier that night and if I looked so terrible, I'm sure women wouldn't have been hitting on me that night. Just wanted to clear that up."" So I said ""I'm sure the caliber of women is not great, but you don't look healthy, don't want to insult you"". He said ""Whatever makes you feel better. I was doing my job. I happened to see you. You said ""fuck you"". I told him ""wouldn't you have done the same if you I had done what you did to me, to you?"" and he said ""No, I wouldn't have. Not making excuses here, but I'm going through some shit, and you claimed you care and are concerned but when you act like that I know you're full of shit. Doesn't matter anymore. You should've left it at fuck you. I've always taken responsibility for fucking up I didn't blame this on you"".


My last words to him are the following: ""Lastly, you take my words for truth. But people say things they don't mean when they are deeply hurt. Speaking ill of you to my support group (whatever makes me feel better, right?) if you don't want to be spoken poorly of, act like a decent human being with integrity and a heart. Take a look at your actions. You up and left me with no warning after playing the role of my significant other (you made me believe I had your back and you had mine) my world came crashing down the way you handled your freak out (so selfish and hurtful, very sociopath like behavior BTW), you then play with my heart and hack into my facebook, use it against me when I was hurt, weak and vulnerable from your heartless actions (and stressed the fuck out because my world was turned upside down since you changed like a flip of a switch, nearly ruined my own reputation at work/internship/school) and while I was in emotional distress you kept slapping me around emotionally abusing me, giving hope, taking it away, coming and going as you please. My fuck you, speaking ill of you, is because I am a deeply hurt human being who was toyed with, abused and discarded like a piece of shit. Then you accuse me for being full of shit for saying fuck you. Those are words from the hurt/scars you have created for me. What I did was what I had to do, not the right thing to do, to get it off my chest. But look at my actions. I've been here, trying to fix things, taking your bullshit/abuse because I refuse to accept that this is you. I refuse to imagine you pretended this entire time and this is your true skin. But you're not taking a deep look at yourself and taking responsibility and changing for the better. You're stuck wallowing and blaming other people for for your careless decisions and are unable to deal with the consequences of your decisions and also unable to follow through, because you're not thinking about anyone else but yourself and your feelings. But you made it this way. I only wanted love and happiness and I gave it without hesitation, fear or doubt. Maybe you cheated on me. Maybe you did drugs. Maybe you have a baby. Maybe someone died. Maybe you killed someone. I don't know what to think and how you could do a complete 180 without hesitation, quit on me, quit on us, quit on yourself, and hurt me so deeply. You never loved me if this is how things end. Maybe you loved me with all you could love, maybe you just don't know what love is because you never had it until me. But you had it with me. You had all of me. But I had none of you. Ever""


He isn't responding.


I don't know how to move on from here. I am still overly analyzing where things and how things went wrong. Is there anyone who could provide observations? I need clarification. I am so lost and confused in my hurt.


My dad told me if he thought he was sincere about me, he would have paid the entire rent. Told my ex not to worry and to just do good in University. He said if he wanted help he would help him. But he doesn't want help. He compared my ex to a stray dog. Some stray dogs want help and are rehomed and great family additions. But some won't trust ever again and run away when trying to be helped. He told me there is no hope, that he will only drag me down, and do it again.
My ex won't hear me out. Doesn't take any accountability. Is there anything I can say or do to make him see the light? Am I doing something wrong? How do I move on? How do I stop analyzing? I have plenty of friends and family who love me. I have a great life going for me. I'll be okay. But I just can't grasp how things have fallen apart, been abandoned by ""the love of my life"", and how he could treat me so terribly. I am so broken. I want to be strong. I want to push through this. But I need advice/validation that I am not the one who ruined this. and maybe there is something else that can be said/done to fix things? I can't stand that my primary relationship is gone, unable to be fixed for even friendship. That he sees me as the one who gave up/ruined things, the nemesis. How can someone not see what they've done? Maybe I am naive. Maybe I am too hurt. Please help me gain perspective, Reddit.


Tl;DR: Ex [28M] and I [24F] lived together for 15 months, said he was in for long haul, wanted to be with me for life. Was living with brother (who I don't know really existed) getting clean for 1 1/2 years after being a professional musician/drug addict in Nashville, Got two jobs (walgreens full time, peddicabbing). Got into University to do pre law. Withdrew from 2 of 3 classes because his wages at Walgreens got garnished so he pedicabbed more and got burnt out. Felt like a failure/turned depressed/distant. Bought a bed with me, nested apartment. Met my family. He up and left me without warning saying the apartment felt like ""a coffin"", erratic behavior, might be on drugs or experiencing a mental break down, comes and goes in my life as he wants but finds reasons that I am wrong (hacking into my FB reading my messages between my support group, blaming me for speaking ill of him when I only spoke of his ill behavior, claiming I don't give a shit about him), tries to get me jealous now, always has to have last hurtful word, takes no accountability for his heartless actions). I don't know what to do or how to feel. Need perspective. Please read my post and give me your best comment."
1ccn7i,1,2013-04-14,The man [28M] who broke my heart [24F]... Please help.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ccn7i/the_man_28m_who_broke_my_heart_24f_please_help/,"Our background:


I met this man on OKcupid ~20 months ago. We met up after a few months worth of messages at a local bar. We had a meaningful conversation pertaining to our political ideologies, our pasts, and future goals. It was a effortless/natural connection and the attraction was so intense that we left ~2 hours to make out in the parking lot where he eventually followed me home. We had sex. I am very picky when it comes to looks and he was my ideal partner physically and mentally. He dressed with style, had long hair, wonderful music taste, and a fantastic sense of humor. I was infatuated. He felt the same way about me. The next day he came back over and stayed for the night. For the next 3 months we saw each other every weekend. I then went on a trip with Habitat for Humanity, and he gave me a care package to take (alcohol, baked goods, with a card). We skyped every night. I sent him a card in the mail since he was in another state with his family. The card expressed my deep feelings for him/wanting to be in a relationship with him. He said he is normally terrified of such things, but wanted to be with me in the most natural way possible.
We dated for three months when I told him I could no longer take him seriously for the long haul since he had no job or education. To pay for things he sold all of his valuables on craigslist. I was at the time applying to graduate schools and working full time advising students at a University. Over these three months I found out the following...


His background:
He used to be a professional musician in Nashville. He was also a drug addict (did every street drug except for heroin and meth). Drugs took him down and it affected him so badly that he quit his career as a professional musician. He moved out of state to where I am, to live with his brother (who is 20+ years older than him) to ""escape drugs"". He quit cold turkey. However his brother's fiance wanted him out after he lived with them for over a year and a half. During this time he said he was ""getting clean"". When I told him I couldn't take him seriously he immediately got a full time job with Walgreens. He cut off his hair for the job. He bought a nice wardrobe. He also enrolled on his own in a local community college to complete his associates degree (only 2 classes short, and had a 3.0 GPA which is great at 54 credits).
When I saw his self improvement, we made the decision together for him to move into my studio apartment (550 square feet). We had a very functional and healthy relationship, we were great at communicating. We had plenty of passionate sex. We had so much fun together. It was my first romance. He met my entire family. My family adored him. They became his number 1 fans. HIS family is not present in his life at all. He also has absolutely no friends he stays in contact with on a regular basis. His parents... I only saw him speak to them maybe twice through out the relationship. His parents never helped him financially or emotionally. His mother sent him shitty care packages now and then, but it was obvious he only had me, my friends, my family for emotional support. It was not unhealthy, though. We made an awesome team, emotionally and financially. I have never been so close with a person. He has never been so close with a person. I found out he has had 2 girlfriends in his past. One was for 3 years but she cheated on him, so they broke up (he thought he was going to marry her). The other girlfriend was crazy and his junkie partner, she didn't matter to him in the end. I was the first healthy caring person he has had in his life, basically. To be clear: he has not had support from friends, family, or significant others.


When he completed his Associates at community college and transferred to the University I work at and now go to school at (I am in a masters program/still advising students). He also started pedicabbing downtown on weekends for extra money because his wages got GARNISHED. He told me his manager at walgreens told him for the next 18 months 25% of his wages would be collected from his paychecks. He said it was because he dipped on a lease in Nashville and they found him in Florida 5 years later... Then his car started to fall apart because . He had to get it fixed constantly for a few months and ended up spending ~$3,000. Pedicabbing is odd hours on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. From 8:00 PM - 3:00 AM.
He took 3 pre law classes. I never pressured him, it was his own choice to go back to school to become a lawyer. I was in my second semester of graduate school, working and interning. We hardly saw each other because through out the week I was busy, however I have weekends free. He went to night classes Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays he was pedicabbing until 4:00 AM WHILE working full time at Walgreens during the day.
Through out all of this going on he made it clear he was a long term partner. We talked about marriage, we talked about children, he bought my family holiday presents, we nested our apartment, bought a bed together (which I had to sign on the monthly payments of 17 months at $46 dollars per month, since he has bad credit). But he made it clear and played the role of being my life time partner. He made me feel like he had my back and I had his, always.


The last few months:
On Valentines day he spent $150 on flowers and we had amazing sex. However, after that day a switch went off. He got burnt out from working 2 jobs and getting absolutely no time to eat, sleep or study. When midterms came around he had no idea what to do. He freaked out. These midterms were take home midterms, he had time to read and complete these tests for quite some time. He waited until the day they were due. He gave himself no chance at succeeding. So, he did the smart thing and withdrew from 2 of his 3 classes.
But then he spiraled into depression. He stopped taking care of himself and his appearance. I tried to be there for him and support him through it but it seemed to make him feel worse. I tried to explain my support comes from love not from a place of ""you're not good enough"". We never kissed. We never had sex for that last month. We hardly saw each other, he worked all of the time. I thought it was a money issue, not a relationship issue.


Spring break came around and for that week my bird was having surgery (whom I have had since I was 5). I was 2 1/2 hours away but before I left I bought ~$80 of easy to eat groceries so that he would at least be taken care of in his depression. The day of my bird's surgery he said he ""needed space"". I told him I needed to talk and that he needs to compromise. He said ""sorry, then"". He has never been short with me so I was in great distress. For a week we didn't talk. My parents saw me unraveling and found out what was happening. Immediately they pressured me to find out what is going on. That night, one week later, the day before coming back home, my family had a crisis. It was emotionally devastating. I thought life is stressful enough and that I needed him for support, not extra stress because at this point I was unraveling.


That phone call he said ""maybe we moved too fast. I feel too much pressure"". I was shocked. He said he thinks he should move out. He said he doesn't know what is wrong with him, but that he doesn't deserve me and is fucked up. He said he had to go (pedicabbing) and was crying. He said we would talk the next day when I drove back because he was off of work. I agreed.


I left him a voicemail that day saying what time I'd arrive. When I came home the apartment was empty. He had moved out. I walked in without him there, when he said he would be there. It was traumatizing. I called him and he said ""I moved out, with a pedicabber, arranged it last night and moved in this morning, I have to sign things so I'll talk to you later"". A few hours go by and I asked him if he was coming over to talk and he said ""It will be awhile, will you be there awhile?"" and I then called him. Crying hysterically. I asked him if he was on a lease and he said he pays month to month. He said he was not on a lease. So clearly he was avoiding me. I told him my mom was driving up to be with me and he got mad because we were supposed to talk later. I then told him I packed up the rest of his things and it was outside my door. I said I was breaking up with him because he called me babe (clearly, he blew me out, but was being delusional calling me babe), he nonchalantly said ""okay, fine"". Only then he came speeding over to get his things. While speeding over he said ""I never wanted this. I never wanted to break up. I don't know what's wrong with me."" I told him I was breaking up with him not because I don't love him, that I love him with all my heart, but the way he was treating me was making me unravel and I need to be able to go to school, intern and work. He picked up his things and tried to get me to let him in but I didn't. He then asked for a poster of my favorite band, Swans (which I put $90 to framing, saying he'd pay me back, he never did). He never paid rent. He claimed for the first week of March he was living out of his car. He never offered to pay for the bed payments (I still have +$700 payments left). Later he texted me that he is ""destroyed and sorry"".


For those next 10 days there was no contact. My mom stayed with me. I dropped 20+ pounds. I went to a psychiatrist to get put on SSRIs, I also started seeing a trauma therapist. If it wasn't for my family and friends I'd probably be out of school, out of a job, and maybe not here at all. I've never had a broken heart, and I pictured my future with this man, and never thought it was possible for him to mistreat me because we had such a good relationship. It was literally an instant complete 180 with no warnings. I tried to get him to get help, he has no insurance but our University has FREE mental health help. He said ""I can't. I am unable to be helped, it doesn't work for me"". Apparently he went to a doctor in his past and was put on anti psychotics for general anxiety and depression, but claimed it didn't work. I told him the dose was probably too low and he probably didn't have a therapist he could connect with, that it could work. He wouldn't try.

She probably didn't even tell his father for all I know. My ex told me he has fucked over his family plenty, so maybe they wiped their hands clean. I'll never know.


Two weekends ago he texted me that he was ""hurting too badly, needed to talk to me and see me"" I told him only if he could be open and honest and start acting like an adult and not a child. He said he would ""man up"". The next day I was about to go shopping with my mom and he texted me ""don't want you anymore, I am not crawling back, lose my number"". I started crying again. I didn't respond. Then he said ""I crossed some boundaries and logged into your facebook (the PW was the same as the WIFI PW, but I never thought he'd invade my privacy) and now know how you truly feel about me"".

He said ""I would never speak ill of you"" (I said to friends that he up and left me, hacked into my facebook, was going through a midlife crisis, and acting like a douche bag) I told him ""I would have never left you"". He said ""I cannot believe you're getting consolation from another man"". He told me to move on. I told him if he didn't want to be spoken of in an ill manner, he should have behaved better, and that I am single and am free to say and do what I want.

I found out from a mutual friend that he lives with a 65 year old pedicabber. He also owes the pedicab shop rent money (it is $105 each week in rent). He makes AT LEAST $1,100 a month. I asked him before we cut communication if he was on drugs and he swore he isn't and all his money goes to ""bullshit I guess"".


This past Friday I was on the outskirts downtown at a bar my friends DJ at. A fellow pedicabber offered to give me a free ride so I asked him if he knew my ex. He said he doesn't. So I said the owner of the shops name and he knew the guy and I asked if they do drugs. He said they snort and smoke marijuana. He asked for my ex's description. Apparently that night he snaked this guy out (this guy was about to get a ride then my ex rode in front of him and stole these customers from him). This pedicabber said if this happened in Washington D.C. he would get the shit beat out of him and that the Orlando pedicabbers are all careless crack heads. He said he would say something to my ex next time he messes with him for me on my behalf because he said what he did was not what someone who loves someone would do. Like my ex, this pedicabber is a drifter, and he said he would never do my ex did. he dropped me off.


I then went back to the bar and my best friend gave me mushrooms, alcohol and marijuana. I needed to leave my black hole and use drugs as a means of new realizations. I was surrounded by loving friends. But then I wanted to walk up the street with my bestfriend, while doing so, my ex rode by. There is no business to be made where I was, so he was creeping on me. Naturally, I felt immense amounts of anger, not because he came out to where I was, but because he looked AWFUL. He looked homeless. His beard was grown out. He was skinny. His hair was long. My best friend didn't recognize him and said he looked like scum. I flipped him off and said ""fuck you"". He turned around and said ""real mature"" and I yelled back ""real mature? Real mature leaving me high and dry, sticking me with the bills, dropping out of school, you fail at life!"". He texted me later saying ""I'm sure you feel really great about that, you FINALLY got to tell off the loser who broke your heart with a ""fuck you"" have a good night. I ignored it.
However today I sent him this text message... I told him ""you coming over to where I am without initiating contact via phone, you looking so terrible (my friend and I didn't recognize you, you look homeless), I was on a heavy dose of mushrooms, so when you came out of no where my anger took over. I am so angry that you ruined what we had and I am more angry at you for ruining your life when you have so much potential. I'm just really disappointed in you and what we could have been and seeing you self-destruct. Please do not antagonize me anymore. If you want help, support, or a friend I am here, but I can't see you willingly fuck your life up. Please get help"".


He responded with ""Actually, I caught a $40 ride over there earlier that night and if I looked so terrible, I'm sure women wouldn't have been hitting on me that night. Just wanted to clear that up."" So I said ""I'm sure the caliber of women is not great, but you don't look healthy, don't want to insult you"". He said ""Whatever makes you feel better. I was doing my job. I happened to see you. You said ""fuck you"". I told him ""wouldn't you have done the same if you I had done what you did to me, to you?"" and he said ""No, I wouldn't have. Not making excuses here, but I'm going through some shit, and you claimed you care and are concerned but when you act like that I know you're full of shit. Doesn't matter anymore. You should've left it at fuck you. I've always taken responsibility for fucking up I didn't blame this on you"".


My last words to him are the following: ""Lastly, you take my words for truth. But people say things they don't mean when they are deeply hurt. Speaking ill of you to my support group (whatever makes me feel better, right?) if you don't want to be spoken poorly of, act like a decent human being with integrity and a heart. Take a look at your actions. You up and left me with no warning after playing the role of my significant other (you made me believe I had your back and you had mine) my world came crashing down the way you handled your freak out (so selfish and hurtful, very sociopath like behavior BTW), you then play with my heart and hack into my facebook, use it against me when I was hurt, weak and vulnerable from your heartless actions (and stressed the fuck out because my world was turned upside down since you changed like a flip of a switch, nearly ruined my own reputation at work/internship/school) and while I was in emotional distress you kept slapping me around emotionally abusing me, giving hope, taking it away, coming and going as you please. My fuck you, speaking ill of you, is because I am a deeply hurt human being who was toyed with, abused and discarded like a piece of shit. Then you accuse me for being full of shit for saying fuck you. Those are words from the hurt/scars you have created for me. What I did was what I had to do, not the right thing to do, to get it off my chest. But look at my actions. I've been here, trying to fix things, taking your bullshit/abuse because I refuse to accept that this is you. I refuse to imagine you pretended this entire time and this is your true skin. But you're not taking a deep look at yourself and taking responsibility and changing for the better. You're stuck wallowing and blaming other people for for your careless decisions and are unable to deal with the consequences of your decisions and also unable to follow through, because you're not thinking about anyone else but yourself and your feelings. But you made it this way. I only wanted love and happiness and I gave it without hesitation, fear or doubt. Maybe you cheated on me. Maybe you did drugs. Maybe you have a baby. Maybe someone died. Maybe you killed someone. I don't know what to think and how you could do a complete 180 without hesitation, quit on me, quit on us, quit on yourself, and hurt me so deeply. You never loved me if this is how things end. Maybe you loved me with all you could love, maybe you just don't know what love is because you never had it until me. But you had it with me. You had all of me. But I had none of you. Ever""


He isn't responding.


I don't know how to move on from here. I am still overly analyzing where things and how things went wrong. Is there anyone who could provide observations? I need clarification. I am so lost and confused in my hurt.


My dad told me if he thought he was sincere about me, he would have paid the entire rent. Told my ex not to worry and to just do good in University. He said if he wanted help he would help him. But he doesn't want help. He compared my ex to a stray dog. Some stray dogs want help and are rehomed and great family additions. But some won't trust ever again and run away when trying to be helped. He told me there is no hope, that he will only drag me down, and do it again.
My ex won't hear me out. Doesn't take any accountability. Is there anything I can say or do to make him see the light? Am I doing something wrong? How do I move on? How do I stop analyzing? I have plenty of friends and family who love me. I have a great life going for me. I'll be okay. But I just can't grasp how things have fallen apart, been abandoned by ""the love of my life"", and how he could treat me so terribly. I am so broken. I want to be strong. I want to push through this. But I need advice/validation that I am not the one who ruined this. and maybe there is something else that can be said/done to fix things? I can't stand that my primary relationship is gone, unable to be fixed for even friendship. That he sees me as the one who gave up/ruined things, the nemesis. How can someone not see what they've done? Maybe I am naive. Maybe I am too hurt. Please help me gain perspective, Reddit.


Tl;DR: Ex [28M] and I [24F] lived together for 15 months, said he was in for long haul, wanted to be with me for life. Was living with brother (who I don't know really existed) getting clean for 1 1/2 years after being a professional musician/drug addict in Nashville, Got two jobs (walgreens full time, peddicabbing). Got into University to do pre law. Withdrew from 2 of 3 classes because his wages at Walgreens got garnished so he pedicabbed more and got burnt out. Felt like a failure/turned depressed/distant. Bought a bed with me, nested apartment. Met my family. He up and left me without warning saying the apartment felt like ""a coffin"", erratic behavior, might be on drugs or experiencing a mental break down, comes and goes in my life as he wants but finds reasons that I am wrong (hacking into my FB reading my messages between my support group, blaming me for speaking ill of him when I only spoke of his ill behavior, claiming I don't give a shit about him), tries to get me jealous now, always has to have last hurtful word, takes no accountability for his heartless actions). I don't know what to do or how to feel. Need perspective. Please read my post and give me your best comment."
1ccl9t,2,2013-04-14,What are your recommendations for reaching 150 Hours for CPA,notrllysure,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ccl9t/what_are_your_recommendations_for_reaching_150/,"I'm currently finishing up my second year of undergrad and pursuing my BS in Accounting. How it stands right now I have several options and am trying to get some advice on which way to go about it. Currently I have one internship with a small unknown company and should have another one next summer after my third year.

These are just some of the many ways I could go:

Option 1: I can graduate a semester early with a major in Accounting  while having not much of a workload to keep GPA high. Then I can get a Masters in Accounting to finish up the hours as well as use that to help prepare myself for CPA.

Option 2: Same as above, but increase the workload a bit, but graduate the same time (a semester early) with an economics minor and then go into Masters. The downside is might hurt GPA a bit, but would have a minor, but I don't know how beneficial that would be.

Option 3: I am also interested in possibly getting an MBA. Similar to option 1/2, but switch out Masters in Accounting for MBA. Although I may need work experience before going directly into it. 

Option 4: Graduate in four years with a Major in Accounting and a Minor in Finance. The benefit is I can work it out so that I have completed 150 credits overall so that I can sit for CPA, or I'll be damn close. I might have to take one or two classes afterwards.

Essentially what I'm wondering is how beneficial would it be to have minors in either Econ or Finance? Is it better to go straight into trying for CPA right after undergrad or get work experience? Is a masters in Accounting worth it or better to get hours done in undergrad?

Thinking it in my head I had a lot more scenario's than while typing it out and it sorta helped me get a better view myself. Either way I have only recently really committed with Accounting and don't have too much background on what I should do, so whatever advice you can help out with would be great. "
1ccgqn,0,2013-04-14,You saved my life then burnt it to the ground (long read),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ccgqn/you_saved_my_life_then_burnt_it_to_the_ground/,"I met you at a party the night I planned on hanging myself. I had the rope ready. I was going to the party to see my friends for what was going to be the last time. I started talking to you. Meeting you convinced me to hold on for just a while longer. I can still remember the shine of the green glitter on your cheeks on St. Patrick's Day. Over time I got to know you. Over time I grew to love you. You kissed me first. You told me you love me first. You accepted me despite my mental health problems. You didn't mind that I had to drop out of college because of my health. You believed in a future.

You moved back home after college. I paid for flights every month to visit you despite being barely able to afford it. I learned yours and your parents language. I eventually moved away from my country, culture family and friends for long period of time for you because I knew to be with you I had to.

You became someone else. You changed from the down-to-earth, easy-going, effortlessly beautiful, electric woman that gave me hope. You made me feel like everything that came out of my mouth offended you in some way. When you were down, I listened with an open mind from a non-judgemental perspective. When I was down, you made me feel inadequate and guilty for thinking or feeling that way. I regret not saying that that's how you made me feel. You constantly judged me and my values. You could have been a racist criminal and I wouldn't have cared, I still worshipped the ground you walked on. You always worried what was  could go wrong as opposed to what was right, what could have gone bad instead of what was good. Every time you did that it broke me down just a little bit more than the last time. You scared the shit out of me.

I went home to my family for Christmas. You suggested that I bring my second suitcase that I used to store the clothes I kept in France. On skype you were distant. You never had time to talk. You made plans to move to another city. You dropped hints. And I noticed them. I confronted you. You said you just didn't like seeing me on skype because she wanted to be with me in person. I went back over to France. I thought everything would be alright and you said it would be.

You kissed with open eyes. I could feel you recoil every time I touched you. You started sleeping with your back to me. But you introduced me to your extended family. We went to your friend's party. You never said a word to me the whole night. I confronted you. You said we were becoming different people. You were the one who originally said you wanted a future and I obliged. You said you weren't sure about your relationship now and didn't want to make sacrifices, despite how much I had to sacrifice. I said there was hope. I saw hope. You refused to see it. I didn't get a wink of sleep.

You officially broke up with me the next day. I had to stand your presence, you touching me, you asking me if I was okay you acting as if everything was alright for 3 days until I could get a flight back home. You drove me to the airport. You made small talk. You said you'd ""miss me"". You kissed me on the lips. Just so you know, that was the worst thing you could have done to me. You shouldn't have touched me. You should have just left me alone, but no.

You e-mailed me 3 weeks after with your ""How are you?"" and told me about how you got that internship you wanted. You said about how you knew I'd need space yet you fucking email me with a newsflash. You just wanted to ease your fucking conscience, you didn't really care how I was doing. I hate your guts but I love you too, and I can't tell you how much I hate you. You quit when the going got tough, despite relationships facing many other challenges. You can't act as if everything is alright, but you know it's lie.

I constantly think about what I did wrong. I constantly beat myself up about every single aspect of my being. I was getting better and now I'm back crawling through piss and shit, because you threw away the future that YOU wanted with ME, just because it wasn't as ideal or easy as you thought it would be.

Despite what has happened, I still can't stop thinking about you. I still love you, and I hate myself for being so weak in that regard. I hate that I wasn't worth it, that I just wasn't fucking good enough for you. I FLEW OVER TO YOU JUST FOR YOU TO FUCKING BREAK UP WITH ME!!

 I just want to forget about you, but it's so fucking difficult. I can't trust anyone now, and I don't think I will for a long, long time.

1cc1ur,3,2013-04-14,How do I start a career in coaching American Football?,Moustachio3d,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1cc1ur/how_do_i_start_a_career_in_coaching_american/,"Ultimately I would like to end up at either the NCAA or NFL level, but I'm unsure of what my first step should be to get into the coaching field.

I graduated from college with a B.S. in psychology 10 years ago, and have worked mainly in retail and tech support ever since.  I have a small amount of coaching experience with Pop Warner and flag football from before I graduated, but I haven't had an actual paid position anywhere.  I essentially need to start from scratch.

I see three different paths to try: get certified to teach and start at the high school level, apply for internships at college and professional programs, or go back to school in a sports related major.  There are benefits and drawbacks to each path, and I can only choose one to start.

My main concern with starting at the high school level is being able to transition to a higher level once I've gained experience.  Do college coaches hire people from the high school ranks?  If so, how much experience is typical?

If I apply for internships, what kind of qualifications will be necessary?  How often do coaches bring in people with basically no experience to work on a staff?  How would I make myself stand out from the other people applying for similar positions?

If I go back to school, what should I major in?  AFAIK there aren't any classes to take for coaching.  Are there classes, volunteer credits, or extracurricular activites that could give me the opportunity to work with the football team and coaching staff?

Is there another avenue that I'm missing?  I would definitely be interested in learning about other options to get into the coaching field.

I'm tired of working jobs where the only thing I look forward to is going home everyday; I want to do something that makes me look forward to going into work.  I love football and have such a passion for it, but my passion alone won't be enough to get me my dream career.  Help me Reddit, you're my only hope!

TL;DR: I have no coaching experience, I want to know how to become a football coach.  Suggestions?

Thanks to everyone that took the time to read my long post!"
1cbsmr,11,2013-04-14,Spending the next two summers in Michigan and then moving there permanently for a job -any advice?,nerdmann13,Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/1cbsmr/spending_the_next_two_summers_in_michigan_and/,"So I am a Crop and Soil Science major at Virginia Tech and I just got into the Natural Resource and Conservation Service Pathways internship program in Michigan. I will know exactly where I will be this summer tomorrow, but I will be somewhere different next summer and then my permanent position will probably will be somewhere different once again so I can get experience in all the different agriculture your great state has to offer! 

The problem is other than the airport in Detroit I have never been to Michigan. I am not a traditional student (29 years old), and before I went to college I was an event planner so I have done a fair bit of traveling but never Michigan related. I have lived in the mountains of VA for most of my life, but spent my early 20s in CA and Las Vegas, so I don't care about moving itself, but I am worried I know nothing about your state. 

I like outdoorsy stuff, especially hiking and flat water paddling, I am assuming MI will be good for this? Are people friendly compared to Southerners? What do people do during the winter, especially since I have never experienced more than 38 inches of snow a year? Am I going to go insane from Nov-April or are there awesome new activities I can try out? I have skiied like once, so should I plan on getting better at that? Do people snowtube, because I love snowtubing? 

My BF will be coming with me once I get a permanent position and I know Michigan has some economic woes, but is that pretty much state-wide? We will probably be in a rural area due to my job and his current job is manager of a shop that installs leather kits and electronics and sunroofs in cars for dealerships, so I am worried he won't be able to find a job. He has great mechanical aptitude and is a hard worker and a smart guy so I  hope he can turn his previous work history into something, even in a small town. 

Sorry for all the questions, I am just trying to figure out if I am doing the right thing. I want this job, it's my ideal career and I volunteered lots to get my foot into the door, so I am excited but nervous about the location. Thanks! "

As well as using this as motivation to achieve my goals.


My life has improved dramatically when I started getting into pickup serious and It really gave me a purpose in life and a goal. What it has taught me during that first year since 2012 that I could really get the hottest girl in the room ‘literally’ and if I did get rejected it and it didn’t really matter.


One year onwards I’ve been in my first relationship and it taught me a lot about myself and the true meaning of what it meant to care for someone. When we did break-up I didn’t really feel anything and I was happy since I could pursue the millions of hot girls in Australia. It has taught me that the true things in life don’t necessarily last unless you put work into it. It showed me the life I was missing if I had kept playing video games and nothing else.


I plan to achieve during this year is truly find my passion in life which I plan to transfer to a lesser status university in order to pursue that dream rather stay in a prestigious university pursuing a degree I hate. I am going to keep busy by applying for internships so that my summer is not filled with nothing to do. I must decide if I want to take career path with the defence force(which has been a dream since high school) or just go through the private route. Since it takes sacrifice that I might not be able to make.



I don’t think I would have time for a relationship any time soon since with university and work,  most of my weekdays and sports on the weekend take up most my life. Currently, my schedule is hectic which I usually only work like one day a week and I’m going to have a set plan so that I know what I’m doing each and every day. But I would continue the approach and meeting new people which is an ongoing process which I plan become a natural. I think 1000 approaches are a considerable number which I plan to finish by the end of the year.



As well, I consider working out a big ‘must’ in my life and I should start going to the gym on the regular and take care of myself better health wise. These would include a decrease in intake from the ‘junk food’ area and more healthy options which is a pretty big ask but I can make it work. Hopefully I can have those abs of steel within a couple of months.  One of the ways is to try out a bunch of martial arts and improve on my sparring skills a bit.


Finally, fashion I consider an important part of how people perceive me and I think I found some stuff I really like which is a mix of Japanese and Korean clothes that I find better fit to my style. Although, it costs a lot of money to change a wardrobe I plan to do over time. Then I can look like a sexy Neal Caffrey .

So that’s it this is my goals for this year and I hope myself I do achieve it otherwise I’m facing my biggest fear heights by skydiving. But I’m going skydiving anyways

Goals
•	Find my career path
•	Have fun with all the sexy girls out there
•	Work out regularly
•	Dress like a boss
•	Make dah money 

I’m 18 and I plan to make the most of my life you should too

I know my grammar sucks but who really cares."
1cb3nw,2,2013-04-13,I want to quit,kersius,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cb3nw/i_want_to_quit/,"I want to quit, to just check out of life.  Maybe commit suicide, maybe just shut down completely and zone out, feeling nothing, doing nothing.  I can't though.  My wife has been working a job she doesn't like to support me while I go back to college.  Watching her as she starts to break from the strain is just making me feel worse, and feel guilty too.  Because I failed at my first try at college, which my parents were paying for, and because I'm too lazy to work while I'm in school, I feel like a complete failure and a waste.  Sure, I have a host of mental health problems but I can't blame them.  I've made choices.  I'm a scumbag and don't deserve what I have.  Every time I try to get better, whether it's exercise, finding a job, getting an internship, making friends; something goes wrong and pushes me back down.  I get sick, I have a panic attack, whatever.  I fall back down and fail again.  It's getting harder and harder (read nearly impossible) to believe that I can succeed at anything anymore.  No matter how hard I try, no matter how hard I work, something is going to come up and sway me back down, so what's the point?  I want to either die, or just stop feeling, stop caring completely and just do whatever I have to do to survive and stop dreaming of ever doing anything more."

I'm writing this cause I could use some advice or maybe some comforting words. 

I had being an intern at this company for a couple of months now, a few days ago they offered me the opportunity to apply for a job as a supervisor, I have zero experience so I was happy that they even considered me and I was also really scared because it would be a huge responsability. I did the interview with HR, did a bunch of psychometric tests, got a medical checkup and turns out they found a lump on my breast and told me to get an ultrasound, I mention this because it caused me a lot of stress and I was really scared (still am to be honest). The last step in this whole process was the final interview with the boss. While I was being interviewed I realized that I wasn't getting the job because I am shy and introverted... and I exploded!!! ... I said a bunch of things I wish I could take back, I didn't knew this was such a delicate topic for me and that it affected me to such lengths, I mean I've never exploded at someone like that I didn't knew I could behave like that and to do so in an interview!! ... Of course I won't be getting the job but I have to keep going there for my internship for a couple more months and I feel extremely embarrassed and uncomfortable, and not only that, but I am going to go through this interview process over and over until I get a job and I don't want to mess up more opportunities like this.

1cebaq,9,2013-04-15,My relationship is making me go broke... How much do you people send on your SO?,bRichthofen,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cebaq/my_relationship_is_making_me_go_broke_how_much_do/,"Brief introduction, 19 years old male, in college. I go to a school with an internship program, so I make about 12k-15k after every eight months of studying. So you could say that I have a salary of 12k-15k as a college student. I usually use my money to pay off my tuition fee, so I can graduate without debt.

I have a gf of the same age as me. She's not in the internship program, so she's a regular student. She's great, I love her, but she doesn't seem to value money.

I come from a fairly conservative and wealthy family (by Eastern America's standard at least), who believes that if I have a reasonable source of income, I should take care of my own dues. My gf doesn't necessarily come from a home that does well, but she has the parents who are dead set on paying for all four years of her college years.

When we go on dates, or plan for dates, it seems like she prefers to do things that are a little bit too extravagant for my likes. $100 cab rides are nothing to her, spontaneously buying multiple hundred dollars worth of shoes, clothes and etc. are all very minuscule concerns for her. Buying three figure sports tickets and meals seem to be her idea of dates. In essence, she's spoiled when it comes to money. It's a little odd, because her parents don't make much and it seems like she's squandering their support simply because it's not her money.

I try to pay for most of our date fees, and meals and it's slowly breaking my back.

I can no longer keep up with this. I live on a tight budget, and I want to save up as much as I can before graduating so I can attend graduate school and further. I've also physically experienced enough to know that my parents have gained their wealth through a strict spending habits of money, and I model that standard.

My question is, how much do you spend on your SO? I'm guessing a marginal difference between males and females, since the former gender is often ""socially obliged"" to take care of the bills. I spend about $600-$700 as a college student. "

I got a call back this morning from an Internship i applied for at a Fortune 500 Insurance Company for a Engineering Data Analyst position. I was not really expecting to get an interview and am the middle of weight loss, so my options for proper attire are very limited.

Here is my dilemma, I do not think I have appropriate clothing that will fit. I am in the middle of losing weight so finding something last minute OTR that will fit adequately would not be feasible. Also given the time constraint I am left with what options I have available in my house. 

Here is what I believe my options to be. For Reference I am a 41/42R for jacket size, 34x30 pants. 6'0 197lbs. 

1. A 44R Alfani suit from Macy's, although I had it taken in slightly to accomodate previous weight losss, the shoulders I too big and I feel like it could pass for a Zoot Suit. 

2. I have a 42R Jos. A Bank Suit that is in good condition, and the jacket fits like a glove. But the pants that came with it are 36x34 and pretty baggy so I would need to rush to tailor those at home tonight. 

3. I have many Button downs, and I have ties that match, so that is not an issue. I have both Grey and Khaki pairs of Dockers D2s that fit me well and I can match with any of these suits. However my only available sport coat is a 42R Brooks Brothers Linen Sport coat. It has rough textured fabric, so it's definitely not a very formal option.

I am all set for shoes regardless of what I choose for clothing.

So MFA, with this knowledge let's see if you can help me answer a few questions?

1. How Long does it take to tailor pants DIY? I am capable enough at sewing that I wouldnt have to learn how to do everything from scratch. 

2. If I can't get those pants to fit, what would be the best alternative I can throw together?

3. What would be considered appropriate dress at a corporation like this? I know that for the employees in their office, a polo and jeans is acceptable but obviously as an interviewee the rules are different. 


I apologize if I did anything wrong information wise to anger anyone. 

Any help is appreciated.

1cdk89,17,2013-04-15,I'll turn 29 next week.,[deleted],ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1cdk89/ill_turn_29_next_week/,"I was born with a cleft palate, and despite being fortunate enough to have it repaired at an early age have still struggled most of my life with social acceptance and self image.  I can't really look back on my life and think of a time that was truly happy.  

In grade school I was made fun of relentlessly.  In high school my nose started to cave in on itself and the scar on my lip started to stretch badly.  I was socially awkward and ostracized.  I spent the majority of those years skipping school and being very reclusive.  My parents tried their best but fought most of the time and weren't really around.  My sister treated me badly so she could fit in at school.  I had tried to kill myself twice in high school, although I had only made a serious attempt once.  In my hysterics I was taken by the police and my mom came and picked me up.  Seems a bit funny now.

I was smart enough in highschool to get into college without really applying myself.  I had a single room in a 3 room freshman suite.  That whole year was dominated by anxiety.  I stopped going to class.  I stopped eating.  I mostly just slept.  My entire world revolved around how people perceived my distorting features.  It was an oppressively lonely time and place for me.  Needless to say, isolating yourself to that extreme extent is not a good strategy for staying in school.  My record was frozen and i left and went home.

The summer after I left buffalo my father prioritized me getting my face fixed.  This kind of facial reconstructive surgery is never perfect but it was probably all I could hope for at the time.  My septum was reinforced, my nose fixed and my lip put in proper proportion.  There were 2 of these surgeries.  During this time my father became ill and I became alopeciac (started randomly losing my hair).  During this time I started an engineering curriculum at a local school.  I did quite well, the curriculum came easy for me, and despite having to shave my head and having completely random spots of hair covering my head and face, I was doing better making friends and sticking in school.  Within the 2 years completing the curriculum my father passed away.  When that happened i lost all the rest of my hair and started gaining weight.  I was emotionally numb at that point.

Despite being emotionally and financially broken I was able to finish my 2 year program, keep some friends and transfer to a rather good 4 year school with enough financial aid to make it on loans.  The first year went rather smoothly as I managed to use the friends I met in the 2 year school that I transferred with to help make new friends.  The first year went smoothly.  The school work (mechanical engineering curriculum) came easy and I had a fairly high GPA.  I had made new friends.  I took a research internship that summer.  That's when the backslide started.  I started losing my eyebrows and didn't have the comfort zone of my other friends around me.  I became reclusive again but still managed my way through it.

The next year, my senior year, I was completely withdrawn.  I made it through the first half of the first semester but kept fighting with my facial hair and eyebrows.  At this point the hair on my head was all gone.  I started skipping class and not leaving my room.  I was made by one professor to go see a counselor (which was not at all helpful)  I got through by the skin of my teeth.  I still managed mediocre grades (a 3.0) but because i was a transfer it had a substantial affect on my overall Gpa.  My roommates were going through relationship drama which made me feel so much more alone on top of that.  I searched for jobs but was unfortunate enough to graduate through the market crash (2008).    I had to go back to my mother's house. 

I spent the 3 months after graduation just looking for engineering jobs.  I spent the 3 months after that just looking for temp work.  I couldn't believe i couldn't find anything with such a powerful degree.  My family consisted of my sister, who moved away long ago and my mother, who on a good day I felt was there for me and on a bad day I felt resented me for not being born as she wanted (she can spectacularly obsessed with appearances).  At this point a piece of the inside of my nose was causing me pain and I couldnt breathe.  I needed health insurance badly.  I found a box boy position at a local warehouse store that gave health insurance after a certain period of time.  I worked there for a year and then scheduled an operation.  That life was a bit heartbreaking.  I was completely alone and the friends I had made in school were all moving on.  Some getting married.  I didn't have any social life.  I still, at the age of 26 had never been on a date.  My situation, being broke, broken and alone and living with my mother was not a recipe for a relationship.  The job was menial and I felt I had more to offer the world.  I applied to graduate school and was accepted.  I worked at the box store the rest of the year and then left to school.

The beginning of graduate school was ok.  My apartment was a dump but I actually knew people their from undergrad.  The last vestiges of my eyebrows and eyelashes were falling out but I didn't let that get to me so much.  My first semester I met knew friends and formed stronger bonds with my old friends.  I worked hard (and gained 50 pounds) and got a 4.0 on the semester, which i was rather proud of.  The second semester I was finally completely hairless.  The little remnants of my eyebrow I shaved off.  I still had like half of the eyelashes on my right eye.  Despite that, I was okay with myself more than I had ever been before.  I tried to go out more and try to meet girls.  This was a rather embarrassing failure.  On paper, aside from my appearance, I felt like I had a good thing going.  I was charismatic, much more than most of the engineering students I was around, I had a good sense of humor, I had perspective, and I had a little bit of confidence.  None of that really mattered as I didn't get anywhere with any women.  What bothered me the most was that I was starting to have unwanted feelings for a female roommate that was becoming a good friend (or so I thought).  I was incredibly lonely and again started to become reclusive.  My adviser noticed and had me start seeing the therapist again.  My depression had actually become worse than it was ever before.  I had trouble getting out of bed many days.  I missed a lot of class, which in grad school is a catastrophe.  I wasn't fulfilling my research obligations.  I wanted to just get over it.  It was a willful battle against the more loathe aspects of my nature.  Almost at the last minute I got over it.  I made up enough work to get 3.0s in 2 of the 3 classes i was taking (which in Grad school is the lowest acceptable grade).  In the 3rd, the class I actually was most involved in I got an incomplete.  It was incredibly gracious of the professor to give me the I and I should have just wrapped up my work and been done with it.  Instead I became more reclusive.  The entire summer washed away.  I was just in bed and depressed.  

The next semester I managed to extend my TA somehow (I was very good at it) but half way through the semester I had an incident where I was drunk and tried to kill myself (although it was a half-hearted attempt).  My therapist forced me into a hospital.  I was stuck in there for a week.  It was a miserable experience.  When I got out, I was by the rules no longer enrolled in school.  I still had not finished the incomplete.  I had lost my TA position and lost my side job in the bar to boot.  I had no income and huge bills and was forced to see a psychiatrist every month if I wanted to ever return to school.  The focus at that point slowly shifted from getting in a good enough state to get back to school to getting in a tenable financial state.  I eventually got my job at the bar back, but that wasn't enough.  Work in that town was hard to come by, there were 4 universities of students who needed work in this small area.  This limbo lasted the rest of the school year plus another semester.  At times i thought I could make it through.  At the end I got kicked out of my apartment because I couldn't pay the rent.  

Since then i've been searching for work for the past few months.  It's hard to find anything.  It's hard to explain why i got mostly good grades and didn't finish school.  It's hard to float my resume on a Bachelors degree I got years ago and some coursework.  I'm in debt to so many people.  I'm stuck back in my mother's house (thank god for that).  All the friends I ever had have long since moved on with their lives.  I don't see anybody except for my mother who seems to hold back a river of disappointment with every interaction.  I still have never had a relationship, never had a real kiss or a meaningful embrace.  The part of me that cares is slowly dying away.  I wan't to accomplish something, to experience something.  The worst part is, is that all these failings are mostly my fault.  The phone doesn't ring anymore.  Nobody thinks about me anymore.  I'm 29 next week.  I mostly wish I had killed myself when I was 17."
1cd74c,1,2013-04-14,I have trouble talking about my issues.,That_One_Shy_Guy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cd74c/i_have_trouble_talking_about_my_issues/,"I have been on reddit for a long while now, but never really created a user because I just enjoyed reading and browsing through the different subreddit's. Whether it was to get a laugh or to read one of those few articles that got me really feeling or connecting with the person posting. 

I never really felt the need to post anything because I thought that my post would just be looked over or receive a few replies, but never really get a response that would help me. However, I decided I would finally make a post about my issues, something I just can't see myself ever doing with someone face to face, and see what kind of advice / responses I can get. So, here's a bit of a background on me.

I have said it to one other friend of mine before this, and he is the only person I have ever really told that I am depressed. I am currently in one of my last semesters in college and have really known I have been depressed since I was just a freshman in high school. Throughout high school I was bullied because of my size, and I often got into fights because I didn't like to take what people said about me. I had a small group of people that I guess I would consider friends, but I always felt I was on the outside of conversations and I would often just sit there and listen to conversations without ever really putting in much input. While in high school I also was the person that the group of people turned to if they were having issues. I don't know how it really started, but whenever someone in our group of friends was having an issue of some kind I was the person they turned to when they wanted to vent and get their issues off their chest.

I felt I did this because I was a good friend and found this was something I was good at. I talked several friends out of hurting themselves anymore, a few cut themselves and I guess I was the only person that noticed and took them to the side and used my way of connecting with their emotions to get them to talk about their issue, and was always there if something was wrong with their lives. However, as high school progressed the bullying continued, I was bullied at least three or four times a week at the minimum, and I continued to hear out my friends issues. This eventually led me t having to bottle up my own issues because there was no one else in my small group of friends that I ever felt really comfortable expressing my own issues to. I became more and more quiet, not that I talked very much in the first place, and just continued to be the big, kind-hearted guy who always stuck up for his friends and listened to their problems.

Now in my senior year of high school I decided to ask a girl out that I really connected with and we seemed to really connect with one another. She was one of my friends who was always extremely happy and a loving person. She was not one of the popular girls, but generally got along with everyone she talked to and was much more involved in high school than I was. This was around the time that Facebook was starting to become big and we chatted on there almost everyday. We flirted with one another and I thought she was having he same feelings for me that I had for her. So, one day I worked up the courage to ask her out only to have her say that we were just too good of friends and that if we tried to date things could get weird. 
After that conversation I promised her we were still friends, and to her I made it seem like nothing had changed because of that. I bottled up my emotions and just finished off my high school career with a small group of friends. 

I started college and went to a college where I did not know anyone, and would have to make a new group of friends. I thought I found a group of friends, but as a semester went by I realized I only hung out with them because they talked with me and we had one or two things in common. The big issue with them, though, was that one had scammed me out of some money, I did not realize this until a few semesters later, and the rest of them did drugs. This was just something I wouldn't do and I slowly began to distance myself from them. I slowly found that after I distanced myself from them that I had no friends and I hardly talked to anyone at the college. So, I decided to become a resident assistant because this would make me interact with people and get me more involved on campus. I was an RA for one semester and found that I really couldn't balance being an RA and my school work. So, I stopped doing that but because of being an RA I got involved with an organization on the campus that did basically all of the events that happened on campus and got me talking to people. However, I found that I wouldn't really let anyone close and while I talked with everyone in the group multiple times a week I made it seem like nothing was wrong with me, even though when I went back to my room I felt empty and alone. 

Flash forward to today and I stopped getting involved with all of the groups I had become a part of because of school work or having everyone who I knew in the clubs graduate and move on. I have made one friend from the hall council that we were both a part of and we still talk weekly, but he is so much different than me. He introduced me to some people, and I have made a few more friends because of this. However, none of them really know me and as far as the know I am just fine and there is nothing wrong with me. My friends from high school I still talk to occasionally, but I haven't really sen any of them in a long time. I did attempt to meet up with the girl I had asked out a few times, but the only time that we were actually able to meet it was with another two people and one of the other people was an ex of hers who it was obvious she still had feelings for and was distracted the entire night and we hardly talked that evening. 

So, here I am putting on an act everyday that everything is fine with me when really when I get out of my internship everyday I go back to my room and just feel like crap. I would never hurt myself, do drugs, or anything dumb like that because I can reasonably think about the consequences of each action and what it would do to me. However, I do think about each and can understand why some people do, do some of those things but I just couldn't ever see myself doing any of them because I know most of them are selfish acts. 

I just don't know what to do anymore though. I go through each day trying to be happy, put on a not sad face, and try to get through every day. I just need some advice on what I should do. I have becoming more and more depressed for the past two weeks to the point where I just feel like lying down and doing nothing. I'm just feeling really helpless. Everyday I go through it like a machine: put on a strong outer exterior, don't show any weakness, don't let anyone see your problems. I feel so empty. It's hard to go through each day because I can't think of any motivation to do so other than the fact that I should."

I applied for many internships for the summer, and didn't manage to get any of them. I was nervous about not getting any new work experience to prepare me for the real world when an opportunity presented itself.

I was asked by a professor I had in undergrad to join her architecture travel studio to Hanoi, Vietnam next month to add the perspective of an urban planner. **While there, our design team will tackle the urgent problems that come with a dramatically increasing world population, such as urban density, food, infrastructure, and jobs.** [Here is the competition link for anyone interested/wondering how valid this is.](http://www.verticalcitiesasia.com/?q=competition)

Since I was asked after the general application deadline for spring travel studios, I could not apply for scholarship funding to help make this trip affordable. Instead, I have to pay the $4,000 spring semester tuition on top of the costs of the travel studio. I would greatly appreciate any donation you would be willing to make to help me make this possible! (I have added ""rewards"" to try and ""pay people back"" with the few talents I currently have if you are interested in that).

Alternatively - I am also interested in knowing any **other funding opportunities** such as scholarships that might be out there for someone in my situation.

**Lastly, if you have ever been to Vietnam or have some travel advice for me- that would be fantastic. I am very nervous about my trip!**

1chsiq,6,2013-04-16,Update from Day 61,thekidaintfappin,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1chsiq/update_from_day_61/,"Hey guys, hope you're hanging in there.

Here's a brief update from day 61. Sorry I haven't been really active, I've been super busy lately. (Which is a good thing.)

**Quick Rundown:** 20yr old straight male in college. Masturbated ~twice a day on average. Always had a bit of trouble with sex, but it was mostly due to anxiety. Developed HOCD* after a bad breakup. Started masturbating really frequently to try to block it out. Got sick of always lacking interest in real women and being a victim of my anxiety. Needed a reset.

So this month has actually flown by. I've kept myself really busy and actually have been getting a ton done this past month. I edited my friend's entire short film, I wrote my first script for a short I'm directing this weekend, and basically got together the entire cast and crew together myself. It's been a month of pulling really big things together. 

I've always been the guy that gets really psyched over something and then my interest wanes after a week or so. Not anymore. Been pouring my heart and soul into the things I want to get done. It's been surprising to everyone around me, especially myself. This is definitely NoFap at work. I've become a more passionate person. I don't need instant gratification. I don't avoid my huge wave of work to just jerk it and laze around. I step up, be a man, and get shit done. Hard to believe I used to trade this feeling for sitting alone in my room, hand on my junk, staring at a computer screen.

Friend-wise: I've been making leaps and bounds. I began to force myself to get over my slight social anxiety. Just gotta think, ""eh, fuck it."" Go ahead and text your friends to hang out or talk to that beautiful Brazilian girl you sit next to in class or strike up a conversation with your professor after class. I've learned that my anxiety had been lying to me. Making me think situations would end up extremely awkward, or I would come off as stupid, or the person wouldn't like me. Once you ignore it, it begins to lose it's grip.

And women! Oh gosh, I can feel the desire slowly seeping back into my brain. I used to be so stuck up about women, finding faults in the smallest things. Why, you ask? Oh, because I was used to the perfect women I saw on the internet. Who weren't even real. Who I had no contact with. Fucking pathetic. I've begun to notice the way a woman looks at me, or her smile, or her laugh. Small things that interest me about her. It feels amazing.

Exactly a month from today, I'm taking a road trip with one of my new friends from school out to LA, where I have an internship for the whole summer. I'll be driving from Philadelphia across the country. I would've never said ""yes"" to this unless I was on this journey of self-improvement. 

**NoFap works. It's a journey to improve yourself, so get going. You're the hero of your own story, start acting like it.**

See ya at Day 90.

*For reference:*
*HOCD (or SO-OCD) is basically the fear that you're the opposite sexual orientation then you believed you were your whole life. It's a really strange thing to go through, look it up if you want more information."
1chovn,1,2013-04-16,Construction Family Business,[deleted],Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/1chovn/construction_family_business/,"My father started his own construction business after he graduated college and it has since become quite large and profitable. I have been regularly working on his construction sites during my summers since I was about 12 years old. I then decided to go to college for construction management. I am now in my 4th year on a 5-year plan (yeah go ahead laugh it up lol) but I haven't taken school all that seriously. I have gotten mostly A's and B's but it has not been very challenging. It is a decent size division 2 school of about 15,000 students. However, I have not learned hardly anything useful for my construction career. I am now at the point where I must take an internship and decided to do it through my father's business. He does mainly commercial and large industrial steel buildings with about 40 employees or so. As you can imagine with most family businesses our relationship has begun to change. It seems like the only time we talk anymore it has to do with business in some way. I am his only son and it seems my entire life has been laid out not allowing me to make any of my own decisions. I know that I can go off and do whatever I want but we are from a town where everyone knows everyone and I would feel responsible for all the lost jobs and disappointment of my family as a whole. However, at the same time I don't even know if I am capable of being as successful as my father has been. I don't like the idea of working non-stop for the rest of my life just to have a lot of money. I already cannot get the business aspect out of my mind and it seems like I will never have peace of mind again unless I get out of what most would call ""the American dream"". If I end up fulfilling my ""destiny"" in taking over the family business my relationship with my father will be pretty weak, which I find extremely sad. Him and his father (my grandpa) seemingly hate each other and I fear we will be the same. On the other hand, If I leave and make my own life for myself he may resent me all the same. So, with that being said, any tips, pointers, hints, words of wisdom, etc, etc, would be appreciated by anyone that has gone through a similar situation or not for that matter. I know parts of this start to sound like I'm just looking for somebody to feel sorry for me but that is not the case. I don't like to talk about this with anyone so some outside inspiration would be awesome. Thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you Redditors! "

I went three piece black suit last year, and while I got plenty of compliments I wasn't thrilled with the end result. Of course, I've been browsing(read:lurking) in MFA for quite a while, and thought one more prom thread couldn't hurt too bad. Forgive me if it's too long a read, I'm excited and don't get many chances to dress up. The prom is in a month, so I've got more than enough time to get an outfit together. 



I live in a beach town(my school is situated on the beach, the prom is taking place at a hotel on the beach) but nobody there embraces the formal-casual style that can be associated with where we live. So I thought after last year, I could escape the ill-fitted black suit that everyone wears to prom and buy a suit that I could use again(college semi-formals, internships, that deal) and get it tailored. I'm a 6"" 160lb, so not incredibly lanky but not an athletic build, if you needed to know. 


Did some research, and a navy or dark blue suit would fit best for what I'm going for. It's formal enough but not as formal as a black suit and I can get more than one use out of it. I found some H&amp;M suits that work and there is an outlet that I'm going to this weekend to see the material and if it is what I'm looking for. This [blazer](http://www.hm.com/us/product/04773?article=04773-A) has a matching pair of pants. If you've got a better suggestion on where to get suits(I'm limited in local area shops or I'd buy local) I'm all ears. 


Going bowtie because I love em'. A pattern bowtie that pops would be great, if you have a suggestion or a website to browse for one, I'd love to see it. (only stipulation is the color, red) 


My girlfriend is wearing a solid, dark red floor-length dress, and I ran it by her and she said it'd be fine if I went a little more 'casual' than her(and showed her what I was thinking with pictures). What this means is I'm thinking about brown penny loafers. Sadly, these [penny loafers](http://www.gilt.com/brand/gordon-rush/product/148511063-gordon-rush-spencer-penny-loafer) are out of stock(and no longer on sale). If any redditors know of a replacement of a similar style and price, I'd be very glad to look them over! If you think brown is too casual, I'm open to suggestions with black shoes. 


Finally, I'll be trying on a vest to see if I like it. If not, I'd like a suggestion on what to wear underneath the jacket. Plain white with an oxford collar seems to be the way to go with the vest, but I'm not sure if it's too plain without a vest. Suggestions here are very welcome.


Other than that, I'll be getting the suit and shirt tailored at a local shop to make it really fit. My price range would be around $300 for clothes, at the most. I figure I might end up growing out of these clothes, but I do want to look great while I'm in them. If I made any mistakes or you require some more information please ask!(I think it's all here, I really did make a check list.).
Please weigh in! If the response here is good I'll post pictures as I get them.

Thanks in advance!"

I've never kissed, made love, or felt as passionately as I did with him.

5 months of just casually dating someone -- through my college graduation, through summer, through my internship 2 hours away -- and he still kept in contact with me. Before I left, we saw each other every week. When I got back, we were seeing each other almost everyday. He told me things he only told he serious ex-girlfriend; he told me I was incredible and that you hadn't felt this way about a girl in a long, long time. He told me he wasn't seeing anybody else but me. He was my ideal, everything I'd ever look for in a guy. I felt stupid for thinking he was just trying to get into my pants, because now that I look back on it, his feelings were genuine. Who wants to be with a girl through all that time? And ""casually,"" at that?

And then the summer was over and I landed the job 200 miles away. He was going to ask me out to be his girlfriend officially, but distance got in the way. On my last night, we stayed up together and talked about all the things we were going to do -- all the things we wished we could see each other do. And then we slept together one last time and said our goodbyes.

Now it's been 8 months, and I'm still here, far away from him. He still occupies my mind -- something reminds me of him everyday. Since then, we've exchanged a couple texts back and forth. 

And then you called me out of the blue yesterday. Just to say hello and that you were wishfully thinking I was around. That I looked gorgeous and that you wanted to see me. Is this real? *You're still thinking of me, too?*

I think I'm in love with you. I just don't know how to approach this -- I don't want to be some crazy girl that you dated 8 months ago that's trying to get back in contact with you. But if you didn't feel the same way...why did I just randomly cross your mind?

The **TL;DR** is we're looking for social media interns for 3 months, travel and lunch costs paid for, after which you'll be paid as we should be in stage 2 investments. If not - we'll ask for you to either volunteer or leave with a glowing reference if you've made it that far. We're not out to exploit anyone but neither do we have the money to pay anyone just yet. 

We're a startup as lean as they come.

So if you're still interested the details are below.

---------------

We're looking for several self-motivated individuals who have a passion for social media to help form a team for a media website located in Google Campus, Shoreditch. We're a start up and as such the positions are unfortunately unpaid however we can pay for your travel and lunch. 

As you're an intern, and you'll be working with people who remember how grueling it is, we'll be keeping your hours and time spent with us to a reasonable pace of 4 hours for 4 days a week. With only one of those days spent on campus - the rest of the time providing you have an internet connection and computer capable of running some web apps you can work remotely. If you wish to work from the campus that is fine - we're just wanting to ensure the best we can for your needs so you can perform your responsibilities.

So the bad news is that it's unpaid, for all of us so far, but the good news is our venture has found its first round of investment to allow us big boy servers and to actually redevelop our site into something usable. The even better news is that if we can gain traction we have various interested parties who are looking to invest further.

That's where you come in - we need your help to grow. We need you to help us maintain our small existing community and to help it blossom into something much more.

As this is going to be my team I'm also going to want to teach you so you can walk away from this if need be and straight into a job if things go south. A lot of places expect you to do grunt work and just chew through some admin work until your time is up and they churn you out but I'm looking to form the foundation of a strong team. I want to be able to give you a task and have complete faith that not only will it be done but you'll make it your own. Because I'll be trusting you with more than just posting images but representing a company that's gathering some serious attention. 

I want someone who in 3 months time when we've our second stage of investment I feel that not only do I want them to stay but that their up to the salary we'll be offering.

-----------------

**Job Details:**

**Position:** Social Media/Marketing Intern

**Starting date:** 29/04/2013

**Remuneration:** Travel Costs/Lunch

**Responsibilities:** You'll be responsible for social media engagement, monitoring, moderation, and outreach. You will be taught how to use various CRM tools and how to seek influencers and communicate with affiliates in a tone that belies our company mission...one which is essentially to cater to a generation with the attention span that does not exist. Our demographic is the 16-25 crowd and they don't exactly give much time for things these days. 

You'll also be learning various marketing techniques and as such we'll discuss areas you can work on developing if you have an interest in doing so. We've various big names mentoring us and have an established and experienced team on this project who are already known experts in their fields. Take advantage of that.

**Requirements:** You need to understand social media beyond the point of ""Getting it"". You need to be interested in it. Whether it's Twitter, Facebook, or G+. Why? Because you're going to be taught how to use these as a tool beyond liking your Mother's photos of the cat. 

Beyond that you don't need to have a degree, or prior experience, just be willing to learn. It would help that you're computer literate though.

It's a given that you need to be driven but if we're going to trust you to work remotely we also need you to have enthusiasm and be contactable. I need to work with people I can rely on. 

**Location:** Shoreditch, Google Campus


So if you're interested - hit up daniel@planetivy.com and ask me some questions. Feel free to PM or ask some questions here too.

I'll have plenty for you so let us make it an even trade off."
1cg7pl,1,2013-04-16,"I (F, 21) feel my world will fall apart when my SO (M, 23) graduates and leaves me for a new career.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cg7pl/i_f_21_feel_my_world_will_fall_apart_when_my_so_m/,"Relationship experts of Reddit, I need some advice and general comforting. Brace yourself for a wall of text:


In about two and a half weeks, my boyfriend (M, 23) of almost two years will be graduating and leaving me (F, 21) and our college town for his new career. We decided it would be best based on his new job (which entails mainly traveling to job sites across the country for extended amounts of time with long work days) to break it off but still want to remain good friends. Obviously the fact that we know our time together is coming to an end is quite depressing, and neither one of us really knows how to handle it. Thus far we’ve had the “neither one of us thinks the LDR would work at this time in our lives” talk and the “we’ll still be really close friends” discussion, but have pretty much left it at that and ever since have avoided the topic, spending our time together as usual. Lately I've been getting very sad, crying at night knowing our days together are almost over and time seems to be going extremely fast.


We started seeing each other within the first few weeks of me entering college, and have been together ever since, seeing each other almost daily. The longest we’ve gone without seeing each other has probably been about two to three weeks during the summer. We never really considered ourselves a couple until later on, but we’ve always been close and in a generally exclusive relationship. We’ve of course have had our ups and downs, but overall have had a really great and open relationship for the past twenty or so months, the longest either of us had been with another person. He means so much to me, and while I wish we could stay together even when he leaves, I know it makes more sense to end things on a good note and possibly pick things back up once he has more of his life in order. I know he’s really scared about entering the real world, and the uncertainty and unknowns of his new career are huge factors. I also don’t know if I could ever be so close with someone again, at least while I’m still in college. He encourages me to date again once he leaves, but I don’t know if I can anytime soon.


Because I started seeing him within the first month of being in college and we spend so much of our time together, I literally have no idea what to do with myself once he’s gone. I have a few close friends, but almost all will be graduating or gone for the summer, so I don’t really have anyone to turn to when he leaves. Summer in this town is pretty dead/deserted, so not many people will be around to meet. Literally the only person I would be hanging out with is my real older brother (who I love dearly), but has a full time research job with university and therefore won’t be able to hang out a lot anyway.


To fill my copious amounts of free time I landed an internship which will be about 20 hours a week, plan on continuing to volunteer at the local animal shelter, and will be taking an online class during the summer, but I’m not sure how I’m going to get by outside work or school, ie weekends, evenings, and overall free time. I still have two more years of university left, live alone, and, to top it off, my best friend and psuedo-older-brother will also be graduating at the same time as well, leaving to take jobs in other states. I’m a generally shy and quiet person, but managed to make this great group of friends when I first arrived to college, mainly neighbors from my freshman year (including my boyfriend). The downside was they were all older than me, but I figured I wouldn’t have to worry about it for a year or two. That time has come, and I’m kinda freaking out.


I really do not feel emotionally ready for any of this at all. 


But back to my boyfriend and our future relations. I’m pretty bad about keeping in touch with friends via phone and internet, since I always feel a much more personal and stronger connection when I can see and not just hear someone. Skype/FaceTime have, however, helped a lot but it’s never the same, of course. He'll be working very long days and will probably not be able to talk often while at the various job sites. I'll be very busy myself with classes once fall semester begins, and we probably won't be able to meet in person very often due to conflicting schedules. 

What efforts can we make to keep our friendship alive? How should I approach this subject when talking to him about it? How can we make the transition from intimate and seeing each other daily to platonic and only speaking occasionally and rarely seeing each other for an unknown amount of time? 


**TL;DR:** Basically I feel like in three weeks, my whole life is going to fall apart when my boyfriend (and best friends) graduate and enter the real world, leaving me behind. I have no idea how I should or will handle it. I’ve made efforts to keep myself busy once my boyfriend and friends leave, but I feel it may not be enough and I will be overall very sad and depressed for the whole summer and some time beyond.


So Reddit, has anyone been in a similar situation? How did it work out for you? Does anyone have any general advice or things to make me feel better before I have a huge mental breakdown?

1cg4kn,6,2013-04-16,Can anyone make me feel better? :/ (long post),simplegrays,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1cg4kn/can_anyone_make_me_feel_better_long_post/,"My good old friend depression is back! I spend every night crying myself to sleep. its a heartwarming feeling I know.

Where should I start? The beginning, I suppose.

I am a 23 year old female and my life has been all downhill. All of it. I'm afraid to be happy for even just a moment because I just know it will all come crashing down. Growing up life was hectic, My earliest memory is of my parents fighting when I was 2 and me sitting on the stairs and them not even noticing me as the screamed about my father's gambling issues. They divorced soon after and it was just fight after fight about custody and visitation. It was terrible. Then when I was 13, my father passed away. He was a former decorated police officer (SWAT to be more specific) in my area, in line to be police chief, but his gambling and then getting hooked on crack destroyed his career. He was high one day and walking around his neighborhood naked. Someone saw him and called the police. The police recognized who he was and 6 officers were sent to get him. They couldn't handcuff him because my father knew all the tactics. So the six officers took my father to the ground, face down to handcuff him and the weight of all the men, plus being high killed him. I remember the day like it was yesterday. Sitting in my living room waiting to go to a baseball game that my mom had promised my sister and I for weeks. I was happy and excited, and then she received the phone call. I cried and cried. What was I supposed to know about death at 13? I tried to live life normally, and go to school but my fathers death was reported on 4 news stations and 7 newspapers. The newspaper from his city did a front page article about his death. Everyone knew. People constantly would come up to me asking if I was alright and if I wanted to talk. I was smothered, and couldn't handle it. I kept trying to push back what I was feeling.

After the funeral my mother changed. She became angry over the littlest things, and she started to hate me. She would constantly degrade me for no reason, calling me stupid and a mistake. Often telling me she wish she had an abortion and that she didnt want me anymore. While my younger sister was her perfect little angel. (we have the same father) My mother would make sleep on the kitchen floor over night if I didn't clean it to her liking, or have me sweep 6-7 times in a row. I love to read, and my mother would take away my books as punishment, she would disconnect the TV, Internet, and phone lines just so I wouldn't have connection to anyone. She replaced my room door with a glass door that locks from the outside. And yes, I have been locked in there. She's beaten me but not as much as she would like to, as I often ran away. And she loved to constantly call the police on me and tell them I was on drugs and have them search my room to find absolutely nothing.

Finally when I was 16, I snapped. I ran to the kitchen, pulled out the largest Cutco brand knife we had and held it to myself. (And If you don't know, Cutco knives are great! They cut through everything!) I went to my mother, with the edge towards me, I moved the handle in her direction. I told her to push it in. She wanted me gone so badly just do it, kill me now and get it over with. She didnt and she ended up just driving me to the emergency room. Her story changed between me holding the knife towards her, and me wanting to kill myself. (My mother is very self absorbed). She didnt understand that I never wanted to kill myself, but the fact of having to live everyday with someone saying that you were a mistake and they regret not having an abortion when you have no where else to live is torture. I was in the mental hospital for 2 weeks as an inpatient before the moved me to outpatient where I was for 4 weeks. The second time around 6 months later was 4 weeks inpatient 6 months outpatient. Doctors just loaded me with whatever antidepressant, anxiety pills they could find. All the while my grade and classwork suffered. My sister during this time began to draw fake bruises on herself by mixing the crayons and coloring pencils on her skin. They obviously looked faked but my mother ate it up and told everyone I was a psychopathic bully.

6 months after leaving the hospital for the second time, my mother deemed I was still not good enough so she called the cops and told them to take me because she didn't want me anymore. I was placed into foster care the next day. I was so alone, frightened and scared. And even though I fortunately was placed with a single mom and her adopted daughter who tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible it was disheartening. I had never felt so abandoned and alone in my life. First my father, then my mother. I had no one. I was in foster care for almost a year when my grandmother fought to get me out. She took care of me for a bit, until the grandfather's Alzheimer's got worse and she had to focus on him. My mother reluctantly agreed to let me go back to her house after that.

She kicked me out right after my 17 birthday and placed me in Job Corps. The worst thing ever. I would not recommend this to anyone. Began smoking pot to cope with a shitty life. At least my few highs brought me some kind of joy. Through a friend there I met what would be my first, and as of now only boyfriend. Things were great at first, we got along, and I lost my virginity to hit. Sometime down the road, on of his best friends went to jail and he was absolutely torn apart over it. He called me in the back yard of our place at the time because he said he had to talk and he just let me have. Beat me so bad I couldnt see or speak. I was too afraid to move. If I tried to defend myself he hit me harder. Beating me became a regular thing and continued for the remained of our 2 almost 3 year relationship. I have two scars on my face, one on my forehead, and one on my lip of where he hit me. I see these as constant reminders of how shitty my life is and now I'll have these scars forever. While this was happening our roommates stole all of my valuables, jewelry and electronics before running off and saying fuck you. I also found out later they (2 girls) were prostitutes. Awesome. I also must add, I was working a full time job and going to school full time as well. Straight A student, and makeup hid what it could at work.

After narrowly escaping from the abusive relationship, I was able to run away and had my sister pick me up in the middle of the night. My sister still holds it over my head to this day, saying that she never should have picked me up and she should have let him kill me. I begged my mother to let me stay there until I could get back on my feet. She agreed and I found a new job and switched schools. After a year and a few months we were back at each others throats and I moved in with a friend and his mom who happened to have an open room. It was closer to work and school and I would spend less time and money commuting. Still able to keep my grades up. Then about 8 months ago, I finished my legal program in school and completed my internship with high marks. My place where I did my internship decided to keep me on for a big case they were working on. Everything seemed to be finally working out for me. The friend I had moved in with spat in my face practically and ended the friendship we still don't talk and Im still living there. I worked on the case with the firm for 3 months out of town. I worked my ass off. 78 hour work weeks as the only paralegal supporting 6 attorneys at trial. I made a lot of money, and I was starting to look for my own apartment, and I even bought furniture. Trial ended we won, but on some preliminary motions the judge threw out our expert witness and our case collapsed after that. Worked slowed back at the office and they cut my hours to 15 hours a week maximum. It hurt. Still does. I don't understand why those who work hard in life get nothing. absolutely nothing. My sister on the other hand, has been stung out on drugs, fired from jobs, kicked out of her university, flunked community college, does absolutely nothing with her life and my mom caters to her. Covers all her bills and gives her absolutely everything.

Oh, and the first guy I had a crush on since my ex asked me to help him find and track down his one true love. Turns out she was married (has been for 3 years and they were together for only 2.)

I just want to say, Thank YOU GOD, KARMA, BUDDHA, CONFUCIUS, &amp; WHATEVER OTHER FUCKING GODS ARE OUT THERE, THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE BIGGEST FUCKING SHIT ON MY LIFE EVER. THANKS. My life sucks. I have never been in love, no one has ever wanted me, my family treats me like shit and constantly degrades me, I work hard and get nothing in return, now I practically have no job with 15 hours a week because that doesnt even cover my bills.

I hate it when people say it gets better. Because it doesn't. Look at my life. I have lived 23 YEARS OF BAD FUCKING LUCK. Maybe I was a bad person in a past life? I am so tired of trying to be a good person, be the better person, when life obviously doesnt take kindly to that. I am utterly alone and I fight this hard battle alone. Sometimes I just want someone I can open up to and share this with and just have them hug me and tell me its going to be okay. Thats all I really need, is a hug. and someone who will let me cry because I am tired of being strong. I am tired of having to put on my big girl pants and pretend everything is okay, because its not. No matter how hard I try to forget, I still hear my mother in the background telling me she doesnt want me, I feel my ex's punches to my face, I see my sister get everything for doing nothing. I hate it, I hate life, and I hate me. I've tried to open up to people about my life, but to those I do, they just shun me afterwards. I guess it was too hard even for them to deal with. I wish someone would just accept me and this baggage I have and just be a friend. Someone who will call me everyday to check on me, someone to talk or hangout, whatever. Because right now my soul is tired and I can't take this anymore.

TL;DR - MY LIFE SUCKS ASS. AND TO THOSE WHO SAY LIFE GETS BETTER? FUCK YOU, IT DOESNT. I believed that for a bit and it got me more bad luck.

1cfqr2,17,2013-04-15,I could really use some advice.,Invo_RT,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/1cfqr2/i_could_really_use_some_advice/,"As the title implies, I could really use some advice everyone if you could take a minute or two out of your day.

I am asking because I do not have a strong source of advice within my family as none of them have been to college and the best they can offer are simple platitudes which, while appreciated, are not all that I need. 

As a brief back story to my current plight, I am the first in my immediate family to go through college. I was the typical, ""over-achieving, good kid"" growing up. I was valedictorian in high school and graduated in the top percent in my college class after choosing to go to a state school to keep my post-college debt under control. I decided to get my B.S. in Business Administration, I had a great and actually relevant internship, and I had a great capstone project experience. That's when everything went to hell.

As well all know, the economy exploded in late 2008, just months before I graduated. I came out of school and could not immediately find a job with companies tightening their financial belts. A friend of mine ended up getting me a job at a call center for a company that he was doing HR for. It beat living back home with my mother, but it was honestly a textbook case study in a horrible company for a number of reasons. Long story short, after being there for two years, I was terminated due to budget cuts and despite my most sincere efforts, I am still unemployed and it has been more than 6 months. Having been such a hard worker my entire life, this is anathema to me. 

TL;DR: I am currently considering returning to my alma mater to pursue a computer science degree (since my former peers seem to be doing just fine in their fields/STEM degrees are good/all that) beginning in the Fall semester of this year. All things being equal, I'd rather just start working as I enjoy the work my degree is in, but I can't find anything no matter how hard I try. 

My question is: Is it worth it? "
1cfnqs,1,2013-04-15,Questions about setting up NAS,[deleted],computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1cfnqs/questions_about_setting_up_nas/,"Apologies if this is the wrong place for this question, /r/techsupport didn't seem appropriate

[Short version]

Need to set up a NAS accessible via internet. Is [this one](http://www.seagate.com/external-hard-drives/network-storage/business/business-storage-4-bay-nas/) any good and will there be any issues running it from a home using standard cable internet?

[Long Version]

So I was just asked by my dad to look into setting up some kind of ""file server"" for his business.  After asking some questions, I decided what he really wants is some kind of NAS setup.  I have plenty of experience with computers, worked in the IT department for my city for a couple years as an intern, almost have my CIS degree completed etc, etc.  But I've never really dealt with NAS before so I figured I'd ask here for some input.

Heres the situation: small business. 3 employees, all in different cities.  Its an engineering business, so the storage is for their various design files. mostly solidworks I think.  The NAS itself will be set up in the house.  I did a little searching, and found one from [seagate](http://www.seagate.com/external-hard-drives/network-storage/business/business-storage-4-bay-nas/) that looks like it would do the job just fine and its a brand name he knows and likes, so thats a plus.  

My main question is about access.  I'm assuming the actual file transfers are handled through a web interface of some kind, so that should be fine.  The only issue I can think of would be how the other employees will be able to connect to it.  Do NASs typically come with some sort of software that handles the remote connection, or am I going to have to deal with keeping the employees up to date on the current IP address? I just keep picturing it as an FTP server and having to deal phone calls asking for the current IP address. 

Like I said, I have zero experience with NAS, so any input would be appreciated.  Bonus points if anyone here has any experience with the Seagate NAS I linked.

Thanks"

I am currently in high school and I will be taking my third and last ACT in June. Following that, I will be narrowing down my colleges and applying in the fall. This means I have to create my portfolio over my 3-month summer break.

I am somewhat lost. Not only because I am in high school and it's up to me to choose which path to take for the next step in my life, but also because I just don't have enough experience in the design field. 

I am considering industrial design and ultimately automotive design. I am passionate about art and everything automotive. 

However, my drawing skills are anything but exemplary. I rarely draw anything at all, but I have have always been around cameras and I feel confident in that area of art, especially when it comes to capturing the curves and design put into cars.

I have a strong desire to work in the design field. I am considering going to either my state university or perhaps a more ""general"" art institution to get better at design, build a better portfolio, and move on. I am considering School of the Art Institute of Chicago to work on my general art, and then transferring to Art Center College of Design in Pasadena to get my bachelor's degree in either Industrial or Automotive Design. 

I am also considering Cleveland Institute of Art because they have close ties with major automotive companies and students usually have a job or an internship after graduating. 

I also have an interest in computers. I know there is a high demand for programmers. I am unsure if programming makes it's way into the design world at all. I am aware that software is used to render designs and things of that nature, but I don't know if going to school for programming/design is a good idea or if it will be a struggle. 

Pardon my nonchalant writing. I am just trying to get some professional advice. Thank you. "

So January of 2012 I started dating this dude. He was my first EVERYTHING. First relationship, sexual partner, ect. The relationship was very unhealthy. I am pretty sure he cheated on me. He would lie to me all the time and hang out with girls and go to parties without letting me know. He pressured me into a lot of drinking and drug use and sexual things I was not comfortable with. The first time we had sex we drank a lot and I smoked weed for the first time and blacked out and woke up with his penis in me. I wanted my first to be with someone I loved, blah blah blah, so I tried my best to make it work. I have daddy issues and low self esteem already so it didn't take much for me to stay with him.At the beginning of our relationship, our routine was that I would drive to his house, watch him get wasted/fucked up, we would fuck, then I would drive home after he passed out. He would tell me he loved me and he would eventually get his act together, ect. However, let me mention he was very sweet and charming and he did good things too and we did have some good times together. Anyways, fast forward to july 2012. That night we were at my house with my friends and my mom and everyone was drunk. However, my one sober friend even remembers him talking down to me. My friends afterwards told me they got so pissed that night cause of how he was talking to me. My mom said he was saying things like I was such a slut, ect. She was pissed. This went on the 3rd of july. that night when everyone was upstairs, my dude decided that he was mad at me for being drunk and didn't want to sleep with me upstairs, so he went downstairs to sleep on the couch. drunk me wants everyone to like me so i went downstairs to try to make him not to upset and just cuddle. i was starting to sober up at this point (2 or 3am... i started drinking that afternoon) and was just a little tipsy now. I laid down on the sofa beside him facing the inside of the sofa. he kind of turned over on top of me and i was stuck. He started fingering me (i was wearing clothes, they were just soffee athletic shorts) and i told him to stop but he wouldn't. then he pulled down his pants and shoved himself inside of me ( was still wearing my clothes, he just pulled my shorts to the side). I kept hitting him and telling him to stop it but i tried to stay quiet so i wouldn't wake people upstairs. I was crying and then he started having anal with me and i hurt really bad so i got hysterical then he like snapped out of whatever trance he was in and just got up and went to the bathroom. He came back and said he was so sorry and just passed out. I was freaking out. My whole family woke up that mmorning and we were supposed to go to the beach so i pretended everything was fine and that never happened. He then told MY BROTHER and all my MALE FRIENDS about the first time he and i ever had sex and even told them other sexual things about me when i wans't in earshot. I had to hear this from my friends. There was a month where I wouldn't have sex with him but I was so desperately trying to forget what happened and I convinced myself that if I stayed with him it wasn't rape it was just a relationship problem. This turned into months of depression and i started cutting myself and tried to commit suicide. I would sometimes cry after sex and he still kept trying to pressur eme into anal and i would cry and we would get into fights over it and other things. He would say I'm being emotional and crazy. My grades were slipping and I didn't want to do anything and thought I wasn't good enough to do anything. This year, 2013, I finally broke up with him. It was a messy break  up. I wrote him a letter explaining what happened on the 4th wasn't ok and how he treated me in general wasn't ok and that it was over and that i wished him the best in life and was very nice about it. A week after breaking up with him I strated talking to my now current boyfriend, M. M and I have been friends for a while (he was actually one of the guys there on the 4th... he says that he had to leave because he got so mad with how my ex dude was talking to me). Our talking quickly escalated into a happy relationship due to us already being friends. He and I have been together 3 weeks now. However, in this weird 1 month period of M and I talking, my ex dude kept contacting me. I almost went back to him. There was 3 days where I visited him every afternoon and we talked about things and even kissed and I told him I was going to quit seeing M and we were gonna get back together. However, as soon as I left, I realized thats the same thing that girls in abusive relationships do and I have to stop this. I finally broke it off completely and told him to move on. He kept calling me and texting me and coming by my house. When I was there and when I was gone. He'd come and talk to my mom and talk to her on the phone. It was almost like harasment and i keep my dorrs locked bevcause of him. He's been arrested multiple times and has a short fuse. Last week he texted me some break up song and I called and told him to quit sending me shit. He started a conversation and I was like fine, I'll be nice. He told me about how he's out everyday of the week partying and dancing with all these girls and living it up ect. and I told him about how I am maintaining a 4.0 and got the internship I wanted. He then texted me later that night saying that im a piece of shit and a waste of the year and he hopes matt cheats on me with a slut and breaks my fucking heart, ect. I HAVE NEVER CHEATED ON ANYONE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE OR ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO IT. I did not deserve that. He then called me 36 times and left messages saying hes sorry and he loves me. Today my boyfriend woke up to his tire being slashed. My ex knows where he lives and knows his car. My boyfriend has seriously no enemies... he is the definition of a nice guy. We both know it has to be him. There is secutiy footage at his aprtment complex but the security people says itll take a while til they can process the footage.. wtf. Anyways, he filed a police report. I am livid. I am so frustrated. I wish I could move away. I am so tired of always getting panicy when I hear a motorcycle thinking its him. I hate having to keep my fucking door locked and I am tired of having to deal with this. Idk what to do. I'm afraid that my ex is gonna break me and my boyfriend apart. I'm so lost"

I won't have access to a car, so close access to a transit (with a reasonable commute, ~30 minutes) would be a must. Being able to catch a train into the city for the evenings &amp; weekends would also be something I'm looking for. Anything fit the bill?

I've heard recommendations that North York / NYCC as being a good compromise between short commutes and downtown access.

I'm not trying to brag so I apologize in advance if it seems that way, I'm just very excited because I picked the wrong school to attend. (Went for in-state w/ scholarship over total ranking and regret it)

I had a quick question about handling an interview opportunity. I have already accepted summer internship positions with a Federal Judge and a military JAG Headquarters (both unpaid). A local and Fortune 100 local company has request an interview for their paid summer legal intern position.

I would like to attend the interview, however I don't want to burn bridges with the Federal Judge, or the JAG office. I would love a paid or unpaid position with the Fortune 100 company this fall and I would love the chance to get a job in their legal department after I graduate in December and take the February BAR.

How would you all handle the interview which would allow me to meet the staff and try to set myself up for a fall or full-time position?

I am considering having the interview and waiting to see if a summer internship offer is extended. If so, regretfully decline because of the internships I have already accepted, but ask to be considered for a fall internship position.

Alternatively, if I was to get offered a summer position with the Fortune 100 I could turn down the JAG and save 6 weeks of high living expenses, stay local which I love, and the Fortune 100 position is paid. I have already signed and returned some waivers and student standing forms and the JAG is letting me work for 6 weeks instead of the mandatory 10 weeks. Lastly, I am not even sure the Fortune 100 would let me only work 6-8 weeks since I am unable to turn down the Federal Judge.

I would love criminal law and corporate law with both of them being my strong areas.

Thanks for any suggestions!"

Shell shocked and heartbroken***

***- Story***

I'll be upfront and say I violated her trust by looking in her phone. It the first and only time I have ever done that in a decade of dating various women.

I'm 28. I have a full time job with a growing company, just got my own division, and bartend one or two nights on the weekends for extra money. I can make 500-1000 in a few nights. I workout 6 days a week and powerlift frequently. I've got a 6 pack and I can bench 375. I have a BS and have just enrolled in a one day a week MBA program to further my career. I do many things to further my development as a person, business, and my relationships. I would say I am a great catch.

She's 24, goes to school full time, and will graduate this summer. She as a part time unpaid internship in her field that will turn into a full time position in a month, and bartends on the weekends to pay bills. She is gorgeous, funny, has good values, and is extremely driven. Our sex is probably the best I've ever had. I would say she is a great catch... until today.

Our relationship started out as we were both bartenders at a venue. She was in school, and I was doing it to make cash after my previous division had shut down. We started at the same time, and  I was immediately attracted to her, and pursued. She was about 8 months out of a 4 year relationship with someone who she shared a house, dog, boat, and many bills with. They knew each other for years before that, and lived and worked together. He apparently cheated on her multiple times and was a general dick. She got tired, left, moved to our area. It took about 6 weeks for her to finally say yes to hang out with me. She said it was because she thought I was out of her league.

It was amazing. Sparks flew, lightning crashed, the waters of the seas parted. It was as if we had grown up together, the similarities were so striking.

She was reluctant to disclose our relationship, because a manager and bartender were fired for dating. I agreed, and was a bit fun to have a secret relationship at work where no one knew. We both met each other's families about a month into it, and everything was amazing. I left our venue after about 6 months because I was able to get back into my field. She still didn't tell anyone we were dating, which was a serious flag for me. She brought up marriage constantly, children, and being together. Being an attractive bartender you can guess she gets a lot of male attention. I don't give a shit about those losers, but I did state explicitly that if she wanted to hide me, she could hit the road. You cannot talk about love, marriage, and kids, and not want to let everyone know you are taken. She agree that it was wrong and hurtful and wouldn't hide me. Shit hit the fan when a male bartender there slapped her ass in front of me, and she confessed she hadn't told him we were dating [more than dating if you are talking about fucking marriage IMO.] She went to dinner with him one night for about 2 hours. She didn't tell me and I saw them come back. I told her she could have all the male friends she wanted, but that it was disrespectful to try and hide it from me. I almost broke up with her right there, but she begged me not to. From then on she had little contact with him, but I clearly knew he was interested. We would see him around at places, and he would never look me in the eye, and would stay away from us unless I wasn't near her. Then he'd go over and give her a hug and talk until I started to come back. Cockroach.

Months pass, things are good, we rarely ever fight. If we do its mainly because we are both busy and haven't seen each other. Last I had heard, she wasn't talking to him anymore because he was an asshole and was mean to her. I again said I don't care who you talk to or hang out with as long as you do it in a manner that is respectful to me and our relationship.

This morning the alarm went off at 6AM. She hopped in the shower. Her phone buzzed. For whatever reason, my groggy self looked over at her texts. It was not him, and didn't open any of them, but I saw his name about 4 spaces down. Curiosity got me and I opened it up. 

I found texts about him wanting to be with her, missing her, and why won't she talk to him. She says it's the way things have to be. I start shaking. I scroll up and find more texts about him missing her and wanting to see her, and playful flirtatious banter between them. Nothing too serious, and girls flirt with everybody. I already know this. I calm down a bit. 

***I scroll up again and see him say ""I want to smack your ass again,"" and she responds ""I'd like that."" My heart drops. Further back and another one saying ""I want to kiss you again"" and her saying ""Me too."" I am shaking with rage at this point.***

***I scroll up further and see a picture he sent her from January. It is 3 pictures of them in a photo booth, one hugging, one tongues touching, and one embraced in a deep kiss.*** 

I am fucking devastated. 15 seconds of looking at this and my whole world has shattered.

I thought about just leaving, but my rage and sadness went into overdrive. I walked into the bathroom and asked her ""Do you love me?"" She says with a smile and happiness in her voice, ""With all my soul baby!"" I reply with ""Then why the fuck is there a picture of you kissing ______ on your camera and texts message saying he wants to slap your ass again???""

She manages to get out a ""...why did you go through my ph-"" before I shut her down ""It doesn't matter, what matters is that there is a picture of you kissing a man that isn't me, and sexual text messages between you."" 

I was seriously about to rip off the shower door, and I'm sure I looked horribly angry. She is silent, and says it was just a joke, it was a work party [that I had somehow never heard of,] and that other people had taken pics kissing him. It happened once, and that was it. I say ""That's a lie, why is he saying sexual things to you, and I want to slap your ass and kiss you AGAIN?"" She says it was wrong and she shouldn't have done it, and it was a joke. I ask her why she didn't tell me, and how she would feel if I was texting someone else sexual messages and fucking kissed them and took pictures of it. She says she would be crushed, and is silent. I leave.

I left and went to the gym and work. She will not be home until 7 or 8. I sent a few texts ripping her a new one, and her maintaining it was just that once, and it was just a joke and she's sorry. I ask her if she wants to continue this relationship, she says yes. I reply that she had better show some damn respect for me and our relationship, and she'd better think long and hard about that before we talk again. There has been radio silence since that time. 

***- Questions***

I've got one foot out the door. My life is too goddamned important to me to waste time on liars and cheaters. However, I do love her [stupid me right?] 

I'm a calculated individual, everything I do has a purpose and script. I've written down everything I wanted to say, how betrayed and disrespected I feel. I have questions I want to know, and I want the truth. I am ready to accept that I will not get them. Our trust is gone. I violated hers by checking her phone, but she fucking went nuclear on our trust by hiding this, and she's probably done more. 

If she fucked him, I'm gone. If it was just an emotional affair, and some kissing somewhere, I will make an effort to move forward. I absolutely want this taken care of, and I am willing to talk extensively with her about it. If she wants out, I'll say I love you, go be happy, and I'll get the fuck out of there.

I'm just so angry, and so hurt at the same time. I do untold amounts of shit for her it's unreal. Flowers, jewelry, cook, clean, romantic getaways, vacations. I would never cheat, I turn down advances of some seriously hot tail, I don't respond to flirting texts from exes or co-workers. I have an amazing place for her to live. I've got my shit together, and am working to continue to grow and provide a life for the woman I love. I don't control her or make her answer to demands. She can go out with work or school colleagues and drink, I just ask she not drive drunk. She can not come home and stay at other people's houses, I just ask that she tell me she's ok. I just ask for respect, like I respect her. Not to be boast, but I work out 6 fucking days a week and look like a fucking greek god. What in god's name could possibly entice her about a guy that has nothing going for him [bartender, in school, DUIs, former alcoholic, Weighs 60 lbs less than me?]

This is probably so rambling, I don't know where to start. Does anyone have any advice? Remember, I have no problems dumping her immediately. I can get another one tomorrow if I so chose. I do however, love her, and want a future. But I want the truth, and I want fucking respect, just like I give to her.

I don't know if I'll the truth. If she doesn't want to give it to me, or isn't remorseful, I'll be hurt and move on.

Give me your best, and your worst. Slap some sense into me, or help me go in the right direction."

I've been on the paleo diet since August of last year. I feel amazing. I've been pretty faithful to the diet except for some frozen yogurt here and there. I'm a girl, I'm 5'4"" and weight about 115 lbs. I'm not fat by any means but I want to get ripped. [Think this girl](http://zuzkalight.com/), she is a huge inspiration and I do her workouts or something similar on a pretty regular basis (3-4 times a week). I also bike to and from work 3.2 miles each way and then 7 miles one way to my internship 2 days a week.

My diet consists of 3 eggs, and veggies (peppers, onions, squash, sometimes sweet potatoes, etc) chopped and fried in coconut oil and some black coffee or sometimes coconut milk (canned) in it. I sometimes add some bacon.

For lunch I usually have a similar meal except for either burger or chicken or some pork of sorts instead of eggs. Sometimes I'll bake a potato if I'm too lazy and have that instead of veggies.

Dinner is pretty much the same as lunch.

I work 7 days a week. I work 5 days at a coffee shop and 2 days at my internship. I do my best to get 8 hours of sleep a day but sometime that's not possible.

Anyway, I gave you as much information as I could about myself to see if you have any suggestions, tips or changes that have worked for you. I want to significantly improve my physique and cut the last bit of fat around my waist and on my abdomen. 

Thank you for your help!"

I had good luck filling a couple of open internships through Reddit [last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfHouston/comments/tf349/houston_company_looking_for_engineering_interns/), and I wanted to post something again this year.  I'm a manager at a SE Houston area company that makes electrical equipment, and we're looking for summer interns. We hire primarily ME's for my department, but will also consider IE's and EE's since other departments in the company have IE and EE needs long-term. The job is CAD-based, so you should be interested in doing that type of work. We use mostly 3D CAD, so our ideal candidate has experience with ProE, Solidworks, or another 3D solid modeling package.

Requirements:
- Please be a sophomore who's completed at least 3 semesters of college. (No ""I'm a sophomore because of AP credits!"" please.)
- Enrolled in an Engineering curriculum
- 2.5GPA or better

This is a paid position, and we've had very good luck with UH students because many of them choose to stay on with us part-time during the school year 10-15 hours a week. If you have questions post here please. PM me your email address if you think you're qualified and I'll shoot you an email so you can provide a resume.

1citwm,14,2013-04-17,[Hiring] Social Media Intern - Google Campus,Planetyeah,london_forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/1citwm/hiring_social_media_intern_google_campus/,"Update 18/04/2013: The response to this has been great. We're still working through responses and as such we'll be closing applications tomorrow at 18:00. We've got a lot of great candidates but if you think you'd be a great fit get in touch!

Hey there,

The TL;DR is we're looking for social media interns for 3 months, travel and lunch costs paid for, after which you'll be paid as we should be in stage 2 investments. If not - we'll ask for you to either volunteer or leave with a glowing reference if you've made it that far. We're not out to exploit anyone but neither do we have the money to pay anyone just yet. We're as lean as they come.

So if you're still interested the details are below.

-----------

We're looking for several self-motivated individuals who have a passion for social media to help form a team for a media website located in Google Campus, Shoreditch. We're a start up and as such the positions are unfortunately unpaid however we can pay for your travel and lunch. 

As you're an intern, and you'll be working with people who remember how grueling it is, we'll be keeping your hours and time spent with us to a reasonable pace of 4 hours for 4 days a week. With only one of those days spent on campus - the rest of the time providing you have an internet connection and computer capable of running some tools you can work remotely. If you wish to work from the campus that is fine - we're just wanting to ensure the best we can for your needs.

So the bad news is that it's unpaid, for all of us so far, but the good news is our venture has found its first round of investment to allow us big boy servers and to actually redevelop our site into something usable. The even better news is that if we can gain traction we have various interested parties who are looking to invest further.

That's where you come in - we need your help to grow. We need you to help us maintain our small existing community and to help it blossom into something much more.
As this is going to be my team I'm also going to want to teach you so you can walk away from this if need be and straight into a job if things go south. A lot of places expect you to do grunt work and just chew through some admin work until your time is up and they churn you out but I'm looking to form the foundation of a strong team. 

I want to be able to give you a task and have complete faith that not only will it be done but you'll make it your own. Because I'll be trusting you with more than just posting images but representing a company that's gathering some serious attention. I’ll be there to hold your hand but I’d like to have someone we can see fly with this.

------

Job Details: 

**Position:** Social Media/Marketing Intern

**Starting date:** 29/04/2013

**Renumeration:** Travel Costs/Lunch

**Responsibilities:** You'll be responsible for social media engagement, monitoring, moderation, and outreach. You will be taught how to use various CRM tools and how to seek influencers and communicate with affiliates in a tone that belies our company mission...one which is essentially to cater to a generation with the attention span that does not exist. Our demographic is the 16-25 crowd and they’re part of the right now generation.

You'll also be learning various marketing techniques and as such we'll discuss areas you can work on developing if you have an interest in doing so. We've various big names mentoring us and have an established and experienced team on this project who are already known experts in their fields.

You’re not going to be told to go get likes or other useless metrics - but shown how to engage with people and how to build relationships. 

**Requirements:** It's a given that you need to be driven but if we're going to trust you to work remotely we also need you to have enthusiasm and be contactable. I need to work with people I can rely on. You need to understand social media beyond the point of ""Getting it"". You need to be interested in it. Whether it's Twitter, Facebook, or G+. Why? Because you're going to be taught how to use these as a tool beyond liking your Mom's photos of the cat and telling the world how hungover you are.

I don’t expect you to have a degree in English but I do expect you to be grammatically sound for when it counts. 

**Location:** Shoreditch, Google Campus


So if you're interested - hit up daniel@planetivy.com and ask me some questions. I'll have plenty for you so let us make it an even trade off. If you have a CV please send it through but if not write up a cover letter about yourself.

I work as an EMT in an emergency room now for 5 years, and I've worked as a firefighter for 2 years while I was in college. I've also worked for the State of Washington doing Search and Rescue, some disaster planning and search management. At this point, a job outside the hospital might be a refreshing break, but, I'm open to anything. 

Anything helps! I won't have to worry about housing, but, definitely would want an internship/job/etc to get settled into the area. 

Thank you guys!

**2,466** readers for **2 months!**

The Butthole. The *BUTTHOLE*. I have seen it, and it’s fucking terrible.

Now, I cannot explain in words what the Butthole looks like, because I’ll just sound insane. I didn’t have a camera with me at the time, so I couldn’t take a picture of it or my expression as I was seeing it. Believe me, it is horrible, I hope you never see it.

I am now one of the people on /r/WeHaveSeenTheButthole, we’ve all seen a absolutely horrid figure that we hope you will never see in your LIFE. Unfortunately, many people have seen it twice, some thrice, maybe even fourice, if that’s even a word. Could someone from /r/Logophilia help me out on that one?

It seems that you seeing the Butthole is inevitable, since so many people have seen it already. I mean come on, [Spongebob’s seen it](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/4609030/spongebob-sees-the-butthole-o.gif), [Bert’s seen it](http://i.imgur.com/AgsGW.gif), and even [Pinkie Pie](http://i.imgur.com/IPngP0L.gif). It’s spreading, and it’s spreading fast.

The Butthole just posted pictures of itself recently, but it quickly deleted them. *That's* how we all came to see it, after those unfortunate people who've seen it before us. I pray for you guys. I really fucking do. Like, getting-on-my-knees-with-a-gun-and-knife-pointed-to-my-head-threatning-to-kill-myself-until-you-realize-I-care-for-you kinda prayer. 

Some people think that the Butthole is a “he” or a “she”, but I can assure you, that it’s neither of those things, it’s not an animal, human, or anything that is logical in the universe, that’s all I can say without sounding crazy. Now, it’s time to talk to the first person to see the Butthole, /u/CTRL_ALT_RAPE.

&gt;##1. Why did you create /r/WeHaveSeenTheButthole?
&gt;&gt; **/u/CTRL_ALT_RAPE** It all started [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/16yg3y/speeding_ticket/c80nfjo) as a joke, I wasn't even expecting any subscibers.

&gt;##2. What’s your favourite post on this subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **CTRL_ALT_RAPE** My favourite was [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeHaveSeenTheButthole/comments/1a3hdu/mrw_i_have_to_click_on_the_butthole_link_for_the/), having a reddit admin post here made my day.

&gt;##3. Have you seen the Butthole?
&gt;&gt; **CTRL_ALT_RAPE** Too many times.

&gt;##4. On the topic of buttholes, give or receive?
&gt;&gt; **CTRL_ALT_RAPE** Neither.

&gt;##5. Anything to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **CTRL_ALT_RAPE** If you haven't seen the Butthole as of yet, still subscribe, it will only make your inevitable first time more special.

There you have it, you now have a new creature to do your research on, maybe suggest it to your teacher so the whole class has to do an exam on it with pictures and shit. Teachers love dem pictures. Well, this has been your intern KangaDude873 (PKA Kanga), and farewell."

I don't really post a lot but I don't know what to do and needed some advice. So here it is. 

I have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year. And he is absolutely great. He is a great boyfriend and even greater friend. The relationship we have is great. The problems I think are with me. 

Lately I have been becoming really insecure about myself. I am in college and I still have doubts about what I want to do. My parents are going through a nasty divorce with my two younger sisters caught in between. So there's that. But all of a sudden I just am second guessing everything, especially when it comes to my relationship. I have been living with my bf for 6 months now and I'm afraid one day he will want me to move back to my place. I wonder if he will ever get bored with me because of the fact that we live together. I constantly worry about what my bf thinks of me. Lately I have been a little moody/short with him but I don't want to turn into a bitch of a gf because he deserves way better. I don't have a lot of confidence in myself. All of my friends are getting internships and starting some good jobs and I still have no clue what I want to do. I want to do so much for my bf to show him I love him but money is tight. He really does deserve the best. And I don't want him to leave because I could have been a better gf. 

I feel like a mess on the inside. And I don't know how to sort through all of these feelings. I don't know how to stop being so hard on myself and insecure about my relationship and myself. :/

TL;DR: I am feeling insecure about myself and I am afraid that insecurity will drive my bf of a year out of my life. I don't know how to stop being insecure.

(X-post from r/jobs),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cmp0i/im_about_to_give_up_and_end_it_all_please_help_me/,"Before 2010, I was a confident, outgoing, and charming guy with the potential to change the world. I was in college had just gotten back from a year abroad and was aiming for graduate school. I considered my life to be an extraordinary success.

In October of 2009, the first friend I had ever made decided to take his life. He had just recently gotten back from overseas, a member of the Armed Services. He took his life publicly in front of some of our friends in the back of a movie theater. I remained strong. It motivated me to go to the gym, it motivated me to study, and it moved me forward.

In winter of 2009, my father started to make some strange financial decisions. First he bought a new couch and new television set which I really thought nothing of. It wasn’t until the holidays that I realized something was very strange. He bought a new tractor for the family farm, and he bought me a Four-Wheeler for the holidays. I never wanted one, and was aiming to move abroad full time – which he knew. My mom and I began to ponder what was going on. Right after the holidays he began sitting on the couch more than usual. He starting saying he was in pain, unbearable pain. He then stopped going to work. One day, he fell on the floor and tried to crawl outside for a cigarette. It was the most demeaning and embarrassing moments of my life, seeing my father in such dire need of a cigarette. My mother and I ran to try to help him up. My mom happens to be a physical therapist and noticed my father’s spine just wasn't sitting right. She told me to go back to upstairs and to go back to bed, she then called the ambulance.

The next morning, I woke up and received a call from my mom. ""Come to the hospital, your father slipped a disk in his spine - will have to have surgery.""

The next couple of weeks were very dramatic. My dad was in the hospital recovering from falling and preparing for surgery. They discovered he had a degenerative bone cancer found in mainly African-American men, which is highly unusual because my family is Caucasian.

The surgery was very long and then afterword he hooked to a machine for what felt like an eternal march into Hell. After two days in the Intensive Care Unit and my mom and I were approached by a close family friend, a clergy member, and several nurses. They told us to go outside and that it was time to have a conversation. They told to us to think about making a decision on his life.

It was the hardest moment of my life to date. Mom and I both cried and hugged each other and knew the right thing for our family was to let him go if it came to it.

In February 2010, while my dad was still in the hospital, I met a girl on campus. Things were beginning to look hopeless except she somehow managed to light up the world. We had a quick conversation, but never moved much beyond that.

My dad had made it through his surgery. He came out of the ICU and then struggled for months at the hospital. During this time I was taking well over 20 credits in the hopes I could graduate on time. Surprisingly during that stressful time, I had the highest GPA during that semester than any other. I would show up at the hospital every day and do my homework and study while holding his hand, smiling, hoping he would wake up. It was very dramatic, but I continued on.

Later in the spring of 2010, the girl I had mentioned earlier happened to run into me again, and I asked her on a date. Romance bloomed. However, hospital drama was putting a damper on my spirits and I quickly found I was not the only one who needed support. She did too. She was a graduate student from the Caribbean who moved to the US for college, and decided to stay for graduate school. She left everyone she knew, both friends and family, to come to my sleepy town of Muncie for a graduate program that no longer exists. We fell in love because we needed each other. Some would call it fate. She helped and motivated me to apply for an MBA, something I had dreamt of doing for several years.

While my dad was in the hospital, college began creating many hurdles to jump through in order to graduate. By this time, it was fall 2010 and I was not able to transfer any study abroad credits because they came from a college, my college did not recognize, one in Israel. The college did not recognize my four semester’s worth of Hebrew and insisted I take two additional semesters of Spanish to fulfill my language requirements. Then I was discouraged from writing a thesis and found out at the last minute that I would need an internship in order to graduate. I was given no help to navigate the bureaucracy. That is something I did on my own. As a political science major I began applying to every policy and government internship program I could, embassies in Chicago to government relations at the University. Everybody I applied to or interviewed with turned me away.

During fall 2010, my dad was now home from the hospital but still had to go to chemo therapy and physical therapy. I would take him to his appointments, and then quickly run to class while he was in therapy. It was a 30 minute drive in both directions. One day after driving my dad home, and coming back to school I noticed a poster for an internship at Republican Party HQ.

I did not put any though into it. I reached out and grabbed all the posters and ripped them off the walls. I made sure no one else knew of the opening. I interviewed for the position even though it was over an hour's drive away. I did not see this as a challenge, but rather an opportunity to graduate.

My father was counting on me to graduate before he passed away. My father started viewing my graduation as his goal. It inspired and motivated him knowing if he worked hard the doctors would give him permission to be at my graduation, nothing could stand in his way. So he started fighting therapy and doctors more than ever. I would become the first in my family to graduate college. I knew I could not let him down. And there she was the kind, gentle voice in my ear from the Caribbean. She gave me rest and she supported me. She helped me realize the potential of an internship. She became a supportive whisper like a gentle breeze in a sleepy field.

I decided to do the internship, even though it was over an hour away from home. I drove through snow and ice, wind and rain, fires and sunshine to make it there three days a week. I was needed so they asked me to stay for four days a week. I ended up working the full week. It may have been a political internship but fortunately I wasn’t doing policy work, I was doing administrative work. I assume the biggest reason they wanted me to stay longer and longer, is that they were teaching me skills and I was picking up things and beginning to teach myself basic graphic design and was making event flyers, brochures, and they even published a directory that I had made for them.

And then, one late winter morning in 2011, I was coming back from the internship. I wasn't used to walking in such nice business shoes. I slipped on the ice walking from the car to the front door; there was no traction on the shoe. I had broken my wrist. It got worse before it got better, a month went by before my parents and my girlfriend realized I was in real pain. I had asked her to be my girlfriend officially over the summer of 2010. She had become my backbone, while I gave mine to my father who had lost his.

My hand was officially broken. They did a scope on my wrist and found nothing except some torn cartilage. It still hurts today, several years on. I had a cast on for several months. I talked to a doctor who told me I needed to get a second opinion. I asked him how logical he thought it was that an uninsured 24 year old could actually afford a second medical opinion.

To top it all off my dad was informed he would have to go through a bone marrow transplant. My mom was forced to make a decision to be with my dad back yet again in the hospital or with her son now at a surgery center. The pain she went through is still with her.
I started applying for real jobs and graduate schools in early 2011. I got lucky and was accepted into a MBA program that was an accelerated one year program at a good school. The jobs I applied for in 2011 all rejected me. The graduate program accepted me right before I was going to make a decision from a personally set deadline between schools, the military, and working.

After the internship was over, I graduated. My dad made it less than several weeks after a major surgery. The doctors had no hope he would make it, yet he prevailed. He climbed nearly 100 stairs with a walker determined not to miss my graduation. For the first time in history though, graduation was always outdoors – that year they had to move the whole ceremony indoors because of rain. This ruined my girlfriend’s day because of scheduling. With the original schedule she would graduate in the morning and I in the afternoon, with the rain schedule we would graduate at the same time. I was the only person she knew at graduation, and I had to walk in a different room. She walked alone, by herself. No one clapped for her. She boldly grabbed her degree and quickly came to find me. I was happy my dad had made it, but crushed my school did not handle that well.

For graduation I went to visit my girlfriend’s parents in the Caribbean. Without her knowledge, I had ulterior motives I asked for their permission to marry her. This was more difficult than you think we come from very different backgrounds from faith to race to creed. It wasn't easy but I had convinced them. I proposed soon after. We moved in together in a different city and I got my MBA. She worked as a security guard, a mortgage processor, and a secretary, which were all temporary work and internships. Hiring manager to this day still believe she moved around too much, yet we remind them temporary work pays the bills for only a limited time – and then you have to find new work. If someone hired her she would stay and so would I.

Then in fall 2011 I lost a friend to the Indiana State Fair Stage Collapse, some of my peers from high school were much closer to her. I have a reason to mourn her passing; she was who I asked to go to senior prom with specifically because I knew she wasn’t interested in going with anyone from our school and it would take the relationship pressure off me. That is another story, but has added to my struggles.

 My MBA was not easy. It was accelerated and I had to learn accounting, finance, all while competing with peers who had studied and worked in it for years. I fought hard. We would also do consulting projects with each semester. The workload was intense enough, that I would complain to my wife that 24 hour days were too short to complete the work.

2012 came and I got married in a beautiful ceremony. We had both been applying for jobs, internships, and opportunities since early 2010 when my dad was first in the hospital, yet still had heard nothing. We got married very soon after I graduated. We didn't spend much on the wedding, we refused to take out any loans for the wedding, and I had saved enough money to take her on a honeymoon that lasted for several weeks. Getting married was its own challenge. Synagogues, Churches, and Secular places were all charging exorbitant fees and strict religious guidelines, and many made us feel hurt for being in love. We had always believed when people wanted to wed it was something to celebrate not to discourage. We overcame the obstacle however. I digress.

We thought at least one of us would have gotten job after we got back from our honeymoon the fall of 2012. We had to make a hard decision and move in with my parents. It took a while but I finally found a paid internship and we moved out in December. Now here we are going on our fourth year, and yet somehow my dad is still alive, my wife and I are still together, and neither of us has yet to find a job.
I'm growing sick and tired of pretending I can work hard to get one on my own. I’ve gone to networking events, I’ve called companies, I’ve gone door to door, and we apply online daily. I am being told I'm over qualified and inexperienced or that I'm under qualified and over experienced, and sometimes that they'll help find a job and they never follow through. And I strongly believe it is our Federal Congress who has the biggest role in causing my inability to get a job. And it’s because of two very different laws:

Obamacare - has a become a barrier to entry because small companies and business owners are now telling me they are too scared to hire me because they do not know if they will be able to afford to pay for a new employees.

Citizens United - has allowed corporations to skirt paying taxes, meaning that the Government has no more ability to pay to hire on new staff.

I’ve just got one last thing to say and it’s specifically addressed to all legislators Federal &amp; State - watch your back. My generation is headed to the ballot. We are watching you. And we can see that You have created No New Jobs.

I'm applying for an internship position at a small newspaper, and I am currently working on my cover letter. I was hoping to get a little guidance for the information I should include.

Of course, I'm including my college experience. However, besides that, I am fairly limited in any real world (paid) experience. I am trying to illustrate my big ambition for journalism and writing. I was wondering if there were any editors or journalists who could lend me some advice. 

Should I include some of my favorite authors and the books I've read? Should I address my limited experience and present it as an opportunity to learn, or should I only focus on my strengths as an applicant? I have written hundreds of pages of poetry - are they appropriate examples of writing experience? It doesn't seem that poetry has any value in the journalist world, but it is material.

Lastly, the editor has asked me to present two writing samples. One piece I am going to send is a 20 page report on bike lanes that I wrote for my last writing class. Incredibly boring subject, I know, but I did well on it, and I'm going to rewrite it to make it more entertaining. Other than that, I am curious as to what I should send. Would it be poor etiquette to write a mock report based on a fabricated news story? Or should I send a short story that I have already written? 

There's a ton of questions here, I know. If you have any advice to offer on any or all of them, I will be deeply grateful!

Thanks!"
1cmn14,1,2013-04-18,I'm about to give up and end it all. Please help me random internet strangers. (X-post from r/jobs),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1cmn14/im_about_to_give_up_and_end_it_all_please_help_me/,"Before 2010, I was a confident, outgoing, and charming guy with the potential to change the world. I was in college had just gotten back from a year abroad and was aiming for graduate school. I considered my life to be an extraordinary success.

In October of 2009, the first friend I had ever made decided to take his life. He had just recently gotten back from overseas, a member of the Armed Services. He took his life publicly in front of some of our friends in the back of a movie theater. I remained strong. It motivated me to go to the gym, it motivated me to study, and it moved me forward.

In winter of 2009, my father started to make some strange financial decisions. First he bought a new couch and new television set which I really thought nothing of. It wasn’t until the holidays that I realized something was very strange. He bought a new tractor for the family farm, and he bought me a Four-Wheeler for the holidays. I never wanted one, and was aiming to move abroad full time – which he knew. My mom and I began to ponder what was going on.
Right after the holidays he began sitting on the couch more than usual. He starting saying he was in pain, unbearable pain. He then stopped going to work. One day, he fell on the floor and tried to crawl outside for a cigarette. It was the most demeaning and embarrassing moments of my life, seeing my father in such dire need of a cigarette. My mother and I ran to try to help him up. My mom happens to be a physical therapist and noticed my father’s spine just wasn't sitting right. She told me to go back to upstairs and to go back to bed, she then called the ambulance.

The next morning, I woke up and received a call from my mom. ""Come to the hospital, your father slipped a disk in his spine - will have to have surgery.""

The next couple of weeks were very dramatic. My dad was in the hospital recovering from falling and preparing for surgery. They discovered he had a degenerative bone cancer found in mainly African-American men, which is highly unusual because my family is Caucasian.

The surgery was very long and then afterword he hooked to a machine for what felt like an eternal march into Hell. After two days in the Intensive Care Unit and my mom and I were approached by a close family friend, a clergy member, and several nurses. They told us to go outside and that it was time to have a conversation. They told to us to think about making a decision on his life.

It was the hardest moment of my life to date. Mom and I both cried and hugged each other and knew the right thing for our family was to let him go if it came to it.

In February 2010, while my dad was still in the hospital, I met a girl on campus. Things were beginning to look hopeless except she somehow managed to light up the world. We had a quick conversation, but never moved much beyond that.

My dad had made it through his surgery. He came out of the ICU and then struggled for months at the hospital. During this time I was taking well over 20 credits in the hopes I could graduate on time. Surprisingly during that stressful time, I had the highest GPA during that semester than any other. I would show up at the hospital every day and do my homework and study while holding his hand, smiling, hoping he would wake up. It was very dramatic, but I continued on.

Later in the spring of 2010, the girl I had mentioned earlier happened to run into me again, and I asked her on a date. Romance bloomed. However, hospital drama was putting a damper on my spirits and I quickly found I was not the only one who needed support. She did too. She was a graduate student from the Caribbean who moved to the US for college, and decided to stay for graduate school. She left everyone she knew, both friends and family, to come to my sleepy town of Muncie for a graduate program that no longer exists. We fell in love because we needed each other. Some would call it fate. She helped and motivated me to apply for an MBA, something I had dreamt of doing for several years.

While my dad was in the hospital, college began creating many hurdles to jump through in order to graduate. By this time, it was fall 2010 and I was not able to transfer any study abroad credits because they came from a college, my college did not recognize, one in Israel. The college did not recognize my four semester’s worth of Hebrew and insisted I take two additional semesters of Spanish to fulfill my language requirements. Then I was discouraged from writing a thesis and found out at the last minute that I would need an internship in order to graduate. I was given no help to navigate the bureaucracy. That is something I did on my own. As a political science major I began applying to every policy and government internship program I could, embassies in Chicago to government relations at the University. Everybody I applied to or interviewed with turned me away.

During fall 2010, my dad was now home from the hospital but still had to go to chemo therapy and physical therapy. I would take him to his appointments, and then quickly run to class while he was in therapy. It was a 30 minute drive in both directions. One day after driving my dad home, and coming back to school I noticed a poster for an internship at Republican Party HQ.

I did not put any though into it. I reached out and grabbed all the posters and ripped them off the walls. I made sure no one else knew of the opening. I interviewed for the position even though it was over an hour's drive away. I did not see this as a challenge, but rather an opportunity to graduate.

My father was counting on me to graduate before he passed away. My father started viewing my graduation as his goal. It inspired and motivated him knowing if he worked hard the doctors would give him permission to be at my graduation, nothing could stand in his way. So he started fighting therapy and doctors more than ever. I would become the first in my family to graduate college. I knew I could not let him down. And there she was the kind, gentle voice in my ear from the Caribbean. She gave me rest and she supported me. She helped me realize the potential of an internship. She became a supportive whisper like a gentle breeze in a sleepy field.

I decided to do the internship, even though it was over an hour away from home. I drove through snow and ice, wind and rain, fires and sunshine to make it there three days a week. I was needed so they asked me to stay for four days a week. I ended up working the full week. It may have been a political internship but fortunately I wasn’t doing policy work, I was doing administrative work. I assume the biggest reason they wanted me to stay longer and longer, is that they were teaching me skills and I was picking up things and beginning to teach myself basic graphic design and was making event flyers, brochures, and they even published a directory that I had made for them.

And then, one late winter morning in 2011, I was coming back from the internship. I wasn't used to walking in such nice business shoes. I slipped on the ice walking from the car to the front door; there was no traction on the shoe. I had broken my wrist. It got worse before it got better, a month went by before my parents and my girlfriend realized I was in real pain. I had asked her to be my girlfriend officially over the summer of 2010. She had become my backbone, while I gave mine to my father who had lost his.

My hand was officially broken. They did a scope on my wrist and found nothing except some torn cartilage. It still hurts today, several years on. I had a cast on for several months. I talked to a doctor who told me I needed to get a second opinion. I asked him how logical he thought it was that an uninsured 24 year old could actually afford a second medical opinion.

To top it all off my dad was informed he would have to go through a bone marrow transplant. My mom was forced to make a decision to be with my dad back yet again in the hospital or with her son now at a surgery center. The pain she went through is still with her.

I started applying for real jobs and graduate schools in early 2011. I got lucky and was accepted into a MBA program that was an accelerated one year program at a good school. The jobs I applied for in 2011 all rejected me. The graduate program accepted me right before I was going to make a decision from a personally set deadline between schools, the military, and working.

After the internship was over, I graduated. My dad made it less than several weeks after a major surgery. The doctors had no hope he would make it, yet he prevailed. He climbed nearly 100 stairs with a walker determined not to miss my graduation. For the first time in history though, graduation was always outdoors – that year they had to move the whole ceremony indoors because of rain. This ruined my girlfriend’s day because of scheduling. With the original schedule she would graduate in the morning and I in the afternoon, with the rain schedule we would graduate at the same time. I was the only person she knew at graduation, and I had to walk in a different room. She walked alone, by herself. No one clapped for her. She boldly grabbed her degree and quickly came to find me. I was happy my dad had made it, but crushed my school did not handle that well.

For graduation I went to visit my girlfriend’s parents in the Caribbean. Without her knowledge, I had ulterior motives I asked for their permission to marry her. This was more difficult than you think we come from very different backgrounds from faith to race to creed. It wasn't easy but I had convinced them. I proposed soon after.
We moved in together in a different city and I got my MBA. She worked as a security guard, a mortgage processor, and a secretary, which were all temporary work and internships. Hiring manager to this day still believe she moved around too much, yet we remind them temporary work pays the bills for only a limited time – and then you have to find new work. If someone hired her she would stay and so would I.

Then in fall 2011 I lost a friend to the Indiana State Fair Stage Collapse, some of my peers from high school were much closer to her. I have a reason to mourn her passing; she was who I asked to go to senior prom with specifically because I knew she wasn’t interested in going with anyone from our school and it would take the relationship pressure off me. That is another story, but has added to my struggles.

1cmfvp,10,2013-04-18,A response to some intern generated form-letter from Senator Feinstein....,hzrdsoflove,progun,https://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/1cmfvp/a_response_to_some_intern_generated_formletter/,"I don't know if you guys really cared, but I was a little pissed that Feinstein's office felt like today they needed to send me some form-letter stating how much she disagreed with me on gun control issues.  Below is my response (which is a bit of a novel).  

I'm depressed to be from the same state as her, and that I did once vote for her when I was a dumbass 18yr old.
___________

Senator Feinstein:

I appreciate the time you had your interns take in order to send me your form letter further explaining your position against responsible gun ownership and the Second Amendment.  I am especially grateful that my Senate acted prudently, upholding the fundamental rights established at the creation of our amazing and wonderful nation, rather than act on fear and disproven false-statistics that has been pandered by the anti-gun lobby.  I understand your frustration being defeated twice now, however I would implore that you consider that your opinions may not reflect the opinions of your constituents, which as you may recall, you were elected to serve.

I, too, am heartbroken over the recent and historical violent tragedies that have shook our nation.  Shootings and gun-related crime is abhorrent, and definitely one of the problems that our society faces.  However, I disagree with your solution path: regulating and banning weapons.  I believe our disagreement is inherent in the belief I hold that guns and weapons are not the issue, rather, the issue has deeper roots within our society, by which mental health, improper or non-existant training, vilainizing guns, and a lack of enforcement of established regulations have exacerbated.

It has been repeatedly studied and concluded that areas with increased gun ownership have some of the least instances of violent crime.  Contrasted with such areas like Chicago and Washington D.C., after implementing extremely restrictive gun laws and regulations have seen violent crime increase.  In fact, FBI data shows that since 1990, while estimated gun ownership in the U.S. has risen, the rates of violent crime has decreased overall.  Recently a survey of our police and officers of the peace indicated that these members, who serve on the very front lines of violent crimes, do not feel that banning assault style weapons, or further regulating guns reduces gun violence.  In fact, an overwhelming majority of respondents indicated it would make the situation worse.

In the most strongest way I can, I urge you to reconsider your position and perhaps focus on the issues behind the guns which cause these despicable acts, and tragic events, rather than take away rights of the citizens.  And while I may have voted for you in the past, if you continue to vote to take gun rights away from responsible citizens, I will do everything in my power, including donating heavily to your opposition, to see that you are not elected again.

Thank you for your time (both for the intern reading this, and perhaps Senator Feinstein if this comes across your desk)!


Respectfully,

This will be the first new car I buy, so I figured you guys would be a great group to talk to. My limit is $21k out the door and I'm willing to put down about $6000.

I'm a Graphic Design student at the University of Cincinnati who has an internship this summer in New York. My boyfriend (musician and music journalist), our friend Cat (also a Design student), and I are looking to sublet a 1BR apartment together. We are hoping to find something less than $2000 total.

We don't have any specific location, just anything anywhere that fits our budget. Our internships are in Manhattan, though, so the closer to there, the better. If you have a multiple-bedroom apartment with one or two rooms open, we would be up for that, too.

I also have a three-year-old, trained and well-behaved Pomeranian that would be with us.

Furnished would be preferable, since we are not able to bring much stuff with us. But desperation is starting to kick in, so we would consider unfurnished.

If you have a place available for only a portion of the time we'll be there, please still let me know. Maybe we could arrange staying in one place for the first two months and another for the last two?

Thanks!"

The Lutz teens who make up MBL Trio, last year’s Rockus Maximus winners, are still at it, despite Michael Lindo’s move to Boston, where he now attends Berklee College of Music.

“The band and I continue to perform together when I come down for breaks or if we have a really important gig,” Lindo wrote in an email. “We just finished playing a few shows one at the Market on 7th in Ybor, The State Theatre in St. Petersburg and we played the First Night in St. Pete New Years event.”

The band, which includes Michael’s brother, Lorenzo Lindo, and Ben Kennett, both Steinbrenner High seniors, is also finishing up its new E.P. (extended play)

That should be done soon, Lindo said. “Then we will release a single while we finalize post-production.” 

The guys all have backgrounds in blues and jazz, but said they don’t subscribe to a particular genre when writing their music.

“It’s refreshing,” Lindo said in a previous interview. “We have a blues influence that you don’t hear on the radio every day.”

The studio time at Morrissound Studios that MBL Trio won was used to record a few songs for the new E.P., Lindo said. 

“It was great working with them and we learned a lot from the experience in how we produce our music and made a few friends there. One of the interns we worked with there actually goes to Berklee, so we've been able to become good friends,” Lindo said.

The Pasco Library System's Rockus Maximus XVI is coming up in March. As a past winner, Lindo said there are plenty of reasons local bands should get involved that go beyond the cash and recording time.

“Rockus Maximus was such a great experience for us,” Lindo said. “We met so many awesome bands through Rockus Maximus that we continue play shows with today.”

The band also got video and photos from the events that they shared with their fans, he said.

“The prize money was great and allowed us to buy some new gear, but the friends we made through the competition was the best thing we gained from the experience.”

It’s not just about winning, though that’s the ultimate goal. Lindo said there’s more to it than that. For bands considering the competition, he offers this advice.

“Put your best foot forward trying to put on the best show possible and to take advantage of the opportunities it opens up.”

As well as the ability (and desire) to rapidly pick up new programming languages.

I will be spending the summer developing medical software in C# and ASP.NET (as well as for mobile devices).

I'm not currently living in Seattle, so I will appreciate and pursue any leads I can find.  I'm also interested in looking into smaller companies and start-ups that would be interested in taking on a highly driven intern.

I'd be happy to provide my resume, LinkedIn, or any additional information - send me a PM and I'll get it to you!  Thanks!"
1codm5,0,2013-04-19,Boyfriend [26] not understanding/encouraging about my [23 F] school work and summer internship. How can I get him to understand where I'm coming from?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1codm5/boyfriend_26_not_understandingencouraging_about/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 6 years. I am a senior in college with one semester left, he is working a union job he plans to work at forever. He made the permanant decision to settle down in the state we grew up in and also bought a house. I resent him for making me choose between him and job opportunities (if they even exist) upon graduation. He wants to provide for us and that's fantastic but I dragged myself out of the worst depressive episode of my life following flunking out of school. I'm about to graduate with honors and for the first time in my life I've been excited to go after a career I'd enjoy. 


We've been through a fairly traumatic loss of friends after living with them and they turned into entirely different people. Neither of us socializes with other people much anymore but I'll occasionally go out with friends from my part time job. Just providing this information because I wanted to illustrate that we are a little too dependent on one another for company- he wants nothing outside of hanging out with me.


While I don't need an internship for my degree program I have little experience in my field and was fortunate to snag a paid internship about 2 hours away from home. It was not originally my first choice but I'm still able to study what I wanted to and I made the compromise after he made me feel terrible for ""wanting to leave him"". I also have a trip out of the country for school coming up that will last 11 days. This summer will be the longest amount of time we won't have seen one another. 


I've been making an extra effort to drive the hour to see him at least once a week because the semester is coming to a close. I'm nervous enough about this entire thing (I've never been more than 1 hr away from home and I've never lived in dorms) but he makes me feel terrible about it. I've been putting my school work on the back burner for the past month and it has finally caught up to me. The other day we had plans for me to come out and see him but he canceled and went into work on his day off (his choice). I told him originally I would come out the next day to visit instead but realized it wasn't feasible later on and told him so (I couldn't get to his place until 9 pm and he had to leave for work at 4 am- then I'd have to spend the time and gas to drive home to get to class for the next day). 


I can't adjust my plans every day or I know I realistically won't get all of my work done. He made me feel terrible for it, despite the fact that HE was the one to cancel our pre-arranged plans. I even went out to see him three times last week because I feel bad about going away. He goes into work on his days off when we have plans and even if i do come out he just plays games because its his day off. When I tried talking to him about he he thought switching days to come see him was an ""even exchange"" and somehow I should have gotten all of my work done the day he canceled on me. He doesn't seem to understand I've put him first all semester and now it's coming back to bite me. 


If he can't support me what am I supposed to do? I don't think I could ever get him to move and I've already made that mental choice not to if we're going to stay together. If I can't get him to support me through this one summer away is that a good indicator of what my life would be like with him? How can I get him to understand how important this experience is, especially if I need to compete for a job in such a small area of the country?


TL;DR: boyfriend and I have a somewhat unhealthy codependent relationship (he more than I). He expects me to continue to put my work on the back burner to come see him after he cancels our plans, but if I can't I'm a terrible person. He is not supportive about my summer internship and about finding my dream job upon graduation. I feel trapped and am constantly guilt tripped."

I asked for a half dozen nuggets.
'We don't have half dozen nuggets,' said the
teenager at the counter.
'You don't?' I replied.
'We only have six, nine, or twelve,' was the reply.
'So I can't order a half dozen nuggets, but I can order six?'
'That's right.'
So I shook my head and ordered six McNuggets

I was checking out at the local Wal-Mart with just a few items and the lady behind me put her things on the belt close to mine. I picked up one of those 'dividers' that they keep by the cash register and placed it between our things so they wouldn't get mixed. 
After the girl had scanned all of my items, she picked up the
'divider', looking it all over for the bar code so she could scan it.
Not finding the bar code, she said to me, 'Do you know how much this is?'
I said to her 'I've changed my mind; I don't think I'll buy that today.'
She said 'OK,' and I paid her for the things and left.
She had no clue to what had just happened.

'Hmmm, I don't know. Do you have an alarm, too?' I asked.
'No, just this remote thingy,' she answered,
handing it and the car keys to me. As I
took the key and manually unlocked the door, I

I'm new to this subreddit and hope you guys will welcome me. I am trying my best not to violate any rules, but please let me know if I am.

To get to the point, I'm a 22-year-old white male. I'm more or less 6'2"", 225. I can hide my extra weight well when I dress/wear a suit, but won't take off my shirt in public for anything. I eat freaking terribly, but I drink even worse [just beverages, not alcohol. I would rather not eat for two or three days than go a day without tea or some sort of high calorie drink].

I am getting married in a month and I'm not happy with how I am going in. I don't expect to do anything to have results that will change what I look like before then, but I'm not too concerned about it. I'm more worried for my general health and future career goals.

I want to be in the military. I had an interview with the military today to intern in their law program [I'm a law student] and want to be able to perform when the time comes. I made myself a promise that if I get this internship, I would start working out. I want to do so regardless of my internship.

I want to get started. I was wondering if P90X was a good way to do so. If not, can you guys talk with me and help me figure something out that would work? I realize I'm asking a lot, but Redditors can be incredible like that. 

Don't get me wrong either -- I'm not looking from some quick gimmick to get me fit then be lazy. I just want an accelerated start [e.g. P90X], then to maintain.

Driving distance to Georgia Tech is 2.5 miles and takes 8 minutes. We've got a patio, BBQ grill, so smoking (if that's your thing) is fine. My roommates, who will be staying, are very personable and easy to get along with. We've got a washer and dryer along with a full kitchen and small dining area, as well as a living room.

The room itself is about 15x15 feet and has a queen bed along with a desk. You'd share the private bathroom with one of my roommates.

Rent is $600/mo, which includes ALL utilities as well as cable TV and internet. The room will be available from May 4 until August 16, so it'll be about 3.5 months rent total. Please PM me or email me at [my username]@gmail.com if interested! Thank you."

I have always dreamed of spending a season at a ski area. I graduate from university in May, and I think that my only realistic opportunity for spending a winter at a ski area would be next season.

My tentative plan is to get a computer science internship this summer, save up, see if I can stretch it out until October, and then move out to a ski town and find a job there that would allow me to ski for a sizable chunk of the winter. During the winter, I would also spend some time looking for more permanent work in an area that would permit me to continue skiing on the weekends.

Before I commit to this plan, I would like a little input from any of you that have experience or knowledge about ski-town living. Specifically:

* Is this plan completely unrealistic? Should I focus on seeking permanent work in a place like Nor Cal or the PNW and resign to being a weekend-warrior?
* If the plan feasible, what kind of jobs should I look for? I've heard good things about working in snowmaking. I've also heard that it's better to work off of the mountain, though.
* Any recommendations for where I should look? I'm thinking Tahoe (Kirkwood, specifically, but I'm open to recommendations)
* Any recommendations for where I should live/how I should find roommates?
* Is there anything I should consider that I'm leaving out?

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated."

In New Jersey, a recent graduate works under a veterinarian’s license. However, that vet is not required to be present when the intern is working, or to personally supervise him or her. 

When we take our pets to the hospital, we should be able to trust the people caring for them are experienced professionals. That's why I've written to every animal-friendly legislator and started a petition on Change.org to restrict the responsibilities of recent graduates and require experienced veterinarians to supervise them—in person. It would also require hospitals be transparent and honest about exactly who treats the animals left in their care.
 
Eighteen months ago, I lost my incredibly loved and irreplaceable collie, Jack. He died in Red Bank Veterinary Hospital as the result of being left overnight in the CCU under the unsupervised care of an inexperienced intern. It was only after Jack died that I learned the sole medical provider “caring” for him had just graduated two months earlier and had only been working as a ""veterinarian"" for less than two weeks. In fact, she had not even passed the state exam or received a license from the state.

I was hoping to pick your brains for some advice on how to beef up my application prior to applying for MPH programs. I'm not in a hurry, but I'd like to at least begin the application process in the next 2-3 years. My situation, however, seems unusual in comparison to most of the inquiries I see posted from aspiring MPH candidates, and frankly I'm not sure where to begin. A little background:

I went to a smallish private university in the mid-Atlantic where I majored in Literature with a Cinema Studies concentration. I absolutely loved my course of study, despite having to constantly defend it to the ""if you major in anything other than a STEM field, you're wasting your time and money"" crowd. I didn't have any clear career goals entering college, and I intended to explore some of my areas of interest (health policy and advocacy, journalism, arts administration) through internships.

Unfortunately, early in my sophomore year, my parents ended up in something of a financial crisis, the result of which was that I needed a paying job to stay at my alma mater. I ended up taking a lot of late afternoon and evening classes and working 30-40 hours a week. 

I still managed to graduate with honors, but unlike my peers, who had the financial support to take on several unpaid internships, my professional experience was all in retail operations management - not a career I intended to pursue.

It's been a year since graduation, and I'm still plugging away as a retail manager. After doing a lot of reading and talking to folks in the field (my parents are administrators specializing in rehabilitative care, so both they and their colleagues have been great resources), I'm confident that I want to pursue an MPH. But frankly, I'm not sure what the best course of action is to ensure that my application is competitive; I have no academic or professional experience to speak of.

I've been looking at idealist.org for some entry-level jobs at health-focused nonprofits, which I think could be a good start - even if it's just as a receptionist, at least I'd have some exposure to the field to reference on my applications. Is there anything else I you can recommend for someone in my situation?

We got into a big fight and I can't stop crying. People don't realize how lucky they are for being able to speak the same language as your parents. Please, kind strangers of the Internet , if someone could take some time to translate this (I know it's long) it would be greatly appreciated

Mom,

Recently, very recently my mood has been very unpredictable. Do you think I've been mean my whole life? I wanted to say 80% of our fights is about how messy our household is and my frustration with not being able to find things. in the fall, I'm trying to take Chinese class!

With my job, I'm learning that everyone wants you to work for free. They never expected a 19 year old intern to do as well as I have shown them. I think I'm very good at what I do. I wasn't even expecting to work for them. I initially Went in for an interview to sell  ice cream at stores for 11$ an hour. During my interview they liked me so much they have me this current position. At work I purposely don't do work because then they will expect more and more. I could do a lot more for them but I feel like my hard work is overseen. I don't think they value me enough. In the past 2 months I've gotten events for them for 15,000 people, and I'm consistently doing impressive work. But they dont show me enough appreciation, and as soon as I'm done doing one thing I'm already being told to do something else. Just this weekend they told me to do a delivery which took an hour just to deliver 3 boxes of ice cream to someone's house. Clearly they do not value my time. I'm very good at what I do, but they never want me to be proud because they don't want to admit I go far beyond their expectations. I do about half the work I am able to do because I don't think they deserve to see me at my full potential.

I feel like dad never listens to me, and is just interested in dropping the argument. I try and tell him a problem but he's so quick to say ""okay I'm wrong"". It doesn't matter if he's wrong I just want him to listen. I try so hard to have conversations with him but his responses are very abrupt and doesn't leave room to make conversation, he just says what he thinks I want to hear.

Mom I don't have anything wrong with you or dad when I say I hate being home. I just really feel trapped with all the messy things. I cannot be physically or mentally at ease. 

I'm sorry I haven't been spending time at home, even for a few years, I think we have a lot of catching up to do.

I read a funny conversation online today asking parents what the weirdest thing they've seen their kids do. Also another one asking what the weirdest thing they've found in their kids room. What's your answer?

I also want to know what you write in your journal. Mom what are your hobbies and what do you love to see and do? I feel like I need more hobbies or else ill be sad

Thank you for being ever so forgiving, as always. I tried to not fight today, I don't know if you could see that or not.

I had a really mature conversation with my friend recently that reflects how far I've come in terms of how I view the world. I think I'm growing up with a very positive outlook.

Her: Life is hard
Me: that's what I always say
Her: It's true. The more I'm alive the more I'm just so done 
Me: it's not so bad
Her: Not usually. But I'm just very tired and I'm still so young. This society is too fast paced to keep up with. It's too twisted to deserve being kept up with 
Me: Idk girl I feel like we don't have much to complain about
Her:But everything is just so damn complicated.  Humanity had to go and give everyone these unrealistically high expectations and make life really expensive to live if you want to do good things like travel and eat well 
Me: Trust me I used to say the same shit but you gain perspective. we are in NYC, you go to one of the best schools in the country, you got to travel recently, you're given all the food and resources you want and you're free to explore one of the best places in the world. I know that we're young but everyone went through the same thing which is one of the many things to look forward to with age. we have so much freedom compared to the rest of the world. people may have dumb perspectives and biased judgement on who deserves to be at the top of the hierarchy, I know. but even at the bottom were luckier than most parts of the world. I used to complain a lot too before I realized how blessed I am. I realized I should change how I see the world bc there's no point in complaining about things you can't change
Her: Cause having to put so much effort into living is draining  Like obviously hunting for food and surviving is draining too, but it's more natural. But I'm conflicted because I do like the pursuit of knowledge and art and things that modern convention have allowed us to pursue. 
Me: No one is forcing you to do anything you pursue learning art and whatever you like BECAUSE you like it. If you think you're putting in all this effort and you're not enjoying it then maybe you need to pick a different path. I work as hard as possible  learning all I can about psychology and I lose sleep all the time but in the long run I really enjoy working hard at something. It kind of sounds like you're just complaining for the sake of complaining which is what i did for like my whole life and what a lot of people do

I'm sorry I don't make enough time to talk and spend quality time with the only Two people that deserve it. I waste all my emotion on people that don't care nearly as much about me as I care about them and not even 10% of how much I know you love me. I realized its easier for me to blame you and get mad at you for things that are my fault. For instance, I get mad at you for not talking to me when it's actually my fault for not being home and always in my room. When I feel bad for you driving me at 2 am you can notice that I get mad and make you feel bad. I thought a lot about my actions and realized it is a mental defense mechanism. I make you feel bad to make you think you owe me a ride. Because I'm mad, you driving me will make me not be mad. How could I be so evil and selfish? Mom I'm so sorry for being a bad daughter"
1cpqud,1,2013-04-19,I'm just a big ball of confused and upset.,Qwenie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1cpqud/im_just_a_big_ball_of_confused_and_upset/,"I'm a generally happy person most of the time. But lately, I've been feeling more and more sad and alone and I'm really sick of it. The problem is, I can't just pin it down to one thing that I can fix, it's a lot of stuff, and I can't really control all of it. 

The stuff that I can't control would be my family life. First off, my parents have always had a lot of problems that they tried to hide from me for a really long time. But then when I was in middle school my mom started telling me about how she wanted to leave my dad. She told me that the only reason she was still with him was because of me. Obviously, that didn't make me feel too good about myself. Then after a year of college, my dad told me he didn't know how much longer he could take being with my mom. That's all fine and dandy. If they don't want to be together anymore, that's on them. I don't even live at home most of the year anyway because of college, so I honestly don't care what they do. The problem is that they are still together, and every time they get the chance, they tell me how much they hate it. Also, two years ago I found out that my dad might not be my biological dad and that that might be why he doesn't really help with college. So there's that. 

And college. I'm currently a sophomore in college studying something that I thought I loved, but have since grown indifferent towards. That indifference is hurting my grades, which is lowing my chances of getting scholarships that I desperately need to put myself through school all on my own. I've thought about changing my major, but I have no idea what I would change it to, because I've yet to find something that interests me more than what I'm currently doing. 

For a while I thought about joining the military. Just to take a break from this and get away from this godawful shit hole midwestern state and get a little bit of much needed structure in my life. I feel so scatter brained and at the time it seemed like a good idea. It still does. But my mother told me she'd be disappointed in me if I did that. Neither of my parents went to college, so they want me to because they want me to be better off than them. She also just didn't like the idea of her ""little girl"" shipping off in the military. 

I want to travel, but I have no money. I want to study abroad, but I can't because I just signed a lease for a house for August and I can't just bail on my housemates like that. I wanted to study or intern in either Europe or Australia over the summer, but my parents talked me out of it, told me I can't. Basically, I've passed up a lot of opportunities because my parents told me not to take them. 

Also, I'm really, really lonely. I have my core group of friends, and I love them to death, but there's just some things I can't tell them. We have a friend that tells us pretty much everything, and they complain because she does. I'm scared if I went to them they'd complain about me, too. I've been single for almost a year now after a three year relationship with a guy that I thought I was gonna marry. In hindsight, I'm so glad that I'm not with him anymore because he was an asshole and I'm also just not in a place where I'm ready to get married. I'm happier without him, but lately I've been wanting what comes along with a relationship, but with the understanding that I want to commit, but that I need to work on myself first and foremost. Lately I've been seeing this guy, and it's been nice, but I just don't know how I feel about it. I'm 19 and he's 25, so it's a six year difference. He graduated from my university last year and was in the army before that. He's nice and all, but I almost feel like the only reason it's been working is because it's convenient. And I think that's how it is on his end, too. He even told me that when we started talking he didn't particularly care if I liked him or not. So I feel like it's just convenient that I do, and that's why we're together. But last night he brought up how his little sister's boyfriend proposed and how that upsets him because she'll be getting married before him. It seems like he wants to do that soon and that's just not my thing right now. I really, really want to get married one day, but now is just not that time. I need to travel and figure out what I'm doing with life first. The age difference is the main thing and one of the only things that bothers me about him, but I think it might be enough to be a problem. When my parents asked how old he was they kinda freaked out. Got off the phone super fast after I told them, like they just didn't want to talk anymore. That kinda adds to the problem with the age. 

Long story short, I've got a lot going on and I just don't know how to deal with it anymore.

Hi               :
 
After we talked on Wednesday night, I felt kind of heavy hearted and was really praying about your situation.  ""Out of the blue,"" which is usually a good sign to me that this idea came from God rather than my own head, I was reminded of what we had learned about ""alignment"" when we all took the Cleansing Streams classes several years ago.
 
Remember the diagrams which showed we need to walk out our lives like this:
 
SPIRIT
 
SOUL  (mind, will &amp;amp; emotions)
 
BODY
 
This alignment is important because only when our spirit is leading our life can we connect with God's Spirit and be led by Him.  It also showed a half circle or ""umbrella"" of God's covering which we walk under when we are letting our spirit be the ""line leader"" and our soul and body submitting to our spirit.
 
Anyways, I felt like God was showing  me that you have been living your life this past year in a total opposite alignment:
 
BODY:   Your physical and social drives leading the way.
 
SOUL:     Your studies
 
SPIRIT:   Prayer kicks in when all else fails
 
 
I really believe Law School is part of God's plan for your life, but I think it is time to re-align yourself to be led by Him.  My verse of the day this morning was 2 Corinthians 1:9-10  ""We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure and we thought we would never live through it . . . But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God.""  Kind of sounds like where you are at with trying to find an internship for next summer, right?
 
You said you were planning to spend the next two weeks working full time on sending out resumes, etc.  That's great, but I really want to encourage you to make the first priority of each day a time to talk to God and listen for his direction. (Spirit).  Follow that with the resume stuff (Soul) and end you day with exercise or fun (Body). 
 
Sustaining a spirit-led life is impossible to do on your own, which is why God gave us the church.  Start your two weeks with a Spirit led activity---check out this church and be open to the Spirit.

I was led to this one online.  It looks pretty cool and the lady I emailed said the Georgetown location has a lot of college students there from both schools.  Start your two weeks off by putting God first---and then do it again and again and again.
 
I think part of the reason you don't have interviews and things coming to you easily right now is because HE wants to use this time to teach you to ""stop relying on yourself and learn to rely only onGod.""
 
I can't give you any better advice or help.  I really hope you will try it---beginning with this church on Sunday morning.  I double dog dare you.

1ctq9r,1,2013-04-21,End of my rope,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ctq9r/end_of_my_rope/,"::sigh:: as the title of this says, I have reached the end of my rope. I need to just write and talk to someone because I am completely lost with my life right now and I don't know what to do. I am 26 years old and I feel like my life is at a standstill. The past year was the roughest year of my life as I had to make a life changing move to a place where I don't really know anyone. I made this move because at the the time it seemed logical and being with a SO it meant that it was something for the future. Things didn't quite go as planned and now I am working a job that hardly pays the bills and I struggle every month to make end meet. Unfortunately to make ends meet it means that I have to rely on credit cards that are already to the end of their limit. I couldn't finish college because of this move and since I could never get any financial aid my parents could no longer afford it. The reason to my non-existent financial aid is because of my citizenship status. I don't want to talk to much about that but know that I am a legal resident of the US. anyway, my dreams are to work at a TV Station. I am was going for a degree in computer graphics and then changed it to animation. I have a huge passion for it but recent events have led me to practice my skills and I feel stuck in a rut. Life has taken its toll on me this and last year. I just wish someone would be able to tell me how to keep going and how to get out of this situation. argh nothing of this probably makes any sense but I just need to talk. I'm desperate to get my life back on track but where I am right now I can see that I will not be getting anywhere anytime soon. My job does nothing for me in the sense of wage. I am looking for a second job but my odd hours make it so hard to do so. Maybe that's why banks like to give odd hours, so their employees cant just be stuck with them. Idk, I should be grateful that I at least have a job but it's just not cutting it. I want to move back home where my family is but I cant even do that. I have no money to do any of the things I want. I would love to get started in a career with design but everywhere I look it's either I need a bachelor's degree or I need 3-4 years experience. WHY?? If I'm applying to an entry level job why do I need 3-4 years experience?? that makes no sense. Maybe it's just me but I just cant seem to make anything work. I'm sick of needing food, I'm sick of watching others do what they love, even though I am happy for them, I am just so sick of everything. I was with this SO of mine for seven years and then she left without any reason as to why and then acts as if I owe her something. WTF kind of bullshit is that? seriously you left why keep bothering me? It's her fault im in such a shitty situation seeing as when she left I couldn't pay for rent and everything else. I love it when she asks ""so you're blaming me?"" NO IM BLAMING SANTA CLAUS! you know what though, it is my fault for letting myself get in this mess. I should've always been careful and not given so much. As I said before I just need to talk and if someone could just guide me and help me get my shit together. My credit is almost non existent so I fear applying for a new job and get denied because of it. I probably will not be able to get a new apt until 10 years form now. I will never own a house. Why haven't I spoken to my parents? well because right now my dad is the only one working but every time I've asked for help I get that shitty line ""that's life and you'll have to figure it out"" or ""I don't have any money right now"". I don't blame them but I wish I could just get more then just that. I wish I could have someone just sit with me and tell me that it gets better. That I just need to do this this and that to get back on track. I dont need reddit gold, I dont need karma I just need guidance. If You work in a TV Station or anything related with design please tell me how you got there. Yes I know Internships go a long way but with my job and with my pay that is not an option."

I'll be moving from Illinois to Ogden for a summer/fall internship with Kimberly Clark and I had a couple questions:

1.) I've looked into the general sites like ksl.com &amp; craigslist, but I was wondering if you guys had further insight into finding housing for a poor college student.

2.) Do you recommend certain companies for utilities/ internet?

3.) How is the public transportation in Ogden? I don't know if my budget allows for me to rent a car. As of now I'm planning to either bike or bus to work.

Thanks a lot!"

Everyday since January 17th, when I had the contraceptive implant put in, I have gained weight. My diet hasn't changed, and while I've always been a little ""bigger"" than I wanted, I have never been obese. 

I am now clinically obese. I have gained 2 stone (28lbs) since the end of January. My clothes don't fit any more. I look in the mirror and I feel sick. 

I really need help and advice. I just feel like my body is against me. I've been trying to diet, but I'm an intern and have pennies to feed myself. Every day I eat porridge (semi-skimmed milk I steal from work), a ham sandwich and for dinner plain pasta with pepper. This is the same diet I ate before January 17th but now that my body hates me I'm gaining weight that I never had before.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel so depressed. I feel miserable. I hate that my body is working against me.

1ct6pp,0,2013-04-21,24 [M4F] Twin Cities MN - Neurotic Law Student Needs to Get Out More Often,gAlienLifeform,Minnesotar4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minnesotar4r/comments/1ct6pp/24_m4f_twin_cities_mn_neurotic_law_student_needs/,"**So why are you here?** I was in a relationship for a while that broke up a few months ago; I've also been crushed under the weight of academic/professional responsibilities for more than a year, so I didn't go out much except for her and a small circle of friends I've had for a while.  These two things have caused me to get a little jumpy/rusty when it comes to meeting and getting to know new people, so I'm looking for chances to practice being charming and clever bar/coffee/meal/adventure company.


**So what are you all about?**
In case you haven't noticed already, I am occasionally given to rambling aimlessly and burrying the lede, as it were, especially when I'm talking about things near and dear to my heart, like myself. I mean, before I give you the information you're asking for I need to give you its context, and all the qualifications on how I know what I know so mistakes can be spotted... Sometimes it can take me four or five sentences to even get to the information I meant to tell you! If I've decided to be ""humorously"" self-aware and exaggerate this tendency, well, then may god have mercy on your soul.


**I still have no idea what you're all about...**
Right! I've been living in the cities for about 4.5 years, first for undergrad and now for a dual degree Graduate and Law school program. I don't know precisely what I will be doing after this, but I'm 75% certain it will be in this area and 90% certain it will involve providing services to people and families near the poverty line. I do as much volunteer work through the law school as is physically possible for me (and sometimes more than that), because helping single mothers get divorce paperwork filled out on a guy who left years ago so they can get onto a public benefit program, or helping people get their criminal records expunged so they can get employment, or giving people copies the statutes and forms they need to get a court to force their landlord to turn the damn heat up, or etc. is pretty much my favorite thing ever. Bike rides, live music, rock climbing, reading, video games, and occasional partying/hijinks with friends are all vying for second place.

**So what's your biggest flaw?** I'm ADHD as all hell, so active listening can be a real challenge for me, and I can generally be a bit hyperactive and overwhelming if I don't keep a handle on myself. Also, I tend to over-commit my time, so I'm late to things or have to cancel them with short-notice more often than I'd like.

**What about sexy-times?** I'd probably also be willing to help you out if you're just looking for an FWB or someone to trade pics with. I'm really here to get more first date/talking to new women practice, but I feel like I have to offer since I know there's a shortage of guys out there who are looking for anything like that :P

**I'm shallow, what do you look like?**I'm narcissistic, so I don't mind telling you! I'm quite short (5'4"") and slender bordering on scrawny (between 110-120), with a dense but closely groomed brown beard and medium short brown hair that's usually going a minimum of 3 different directions at the same time and smelling somewhere in between coffee, cigarettes, spicy food, and printer ink. There's a fight for the soul of my closet right now between a stereotypical late 90's stoner/slacker and one of those maddeningly sanctimonious young professionals from the 00's, so depending on how far you catch me away from laundry day you'll be getting either collared shirts or poorly fitting hoody sweaters.

**What's a good story about yourself you could tell me?** On the 1st day of an unpaid internship in the juvenile division of the Department of Corrections I helped get a kid into state funded counseling instead of being sent a hundred miles away to a locked facility.

**What's a bad story about yourself you could tell me?** The 1st time I ever received head I ended up having to jump out a second story window and outrun angry frat-bros. 

**Alright, *if* I reply, do you expect me to answer all these same questions?** Nope, I expect you to do whatever you want. I'd like someone who is at least willing to consider meeting in IRL, but I'll read anything interesting and reply to everything I can find the time for. I'm willing to exchange pictures as long as there's a good faith effort to be reciprocal.

**What's it mean if I sent you a message a while ago and you still haven't replied?** Probably that there's a mound of work I'm stuck underneath at the moment. Sometimes I need to disappear off of reddit for 2 or 3 weeks at a time, so please don't take it personally if I can't get back to you promptly."

1cszhv,1,2013-04-21,Need advice. Figured I would post here because you girls are freaking awesome.,littlemisssunshine9,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1cszhv/need_advice_figured_i_would_post_here_because_you/,"ok so here it goes.

My dating history has been horrible. I have been used, taken advantage of and even raped by a ""friend"". I was in a really bad place and felt horribly worthless after that. I compensated by acting like I was fine. No, I acted like I was invincible. I slept with anyone, went clubbing, got hit on quite easily (I've been told I am pretty), the works. Literally the only reason I stopped was because I had an STD scare.

Alright, I'm fine on my own, I will focus on school. That was my mentality. And for a while I was ok. It was hard (the ""friend"" is in my very small program and i see him daily while the rest of my year thinks I am a huge slut rather than the truth of what he did, somehow he came out to be the victim) but I was ok, had amazing grades and a few close friends to keep me going. 

This is where the story starts.

You see there was this guy a year above me who was also very focused on school. He is a perfectionist and very hardworking, something that I find very attractive. (Most, if not all the guys I have seen so far have been lazy and don't know where they are going... last time I hear one of them was caught up in a pyramid scheme.)

Anyways, this guy (who literally looks like enrique iglesias) is a year above me and I needed a textbook. I've always been intrigued by him  and we often spoke and hung out so I though nothing of it when he suggested I walk with him to go to get the book at his place. He lived close to the school and I needed the book for the next day.

One thing led to another and we end up hooking up. He was really sweet but I was so damaged I knew nothing could come of it. Alright story's over right? Nope.

We end up spending more time together, sharing ideas and stories, generally getting to know each other. Somewhere in there I realize I want to be a better person and that he makes me want to be better. Not that he fixes me. This is important. But that I want to make myself better for him. I slowly eliminate my vices, of which there were many, and begin standing up for myself to my parents ( my relationship with them is complicated and while I love them and would do anything for them, they are horrible people to me, I should be moving out soon) and start being a person that I am proud to be. Got an internship in my field of study, I am much more confident, and while I am still learning I know I am on a much better path. 

All the while I am still hanging out with this guy. Which turns into seeing him, which turns into him saying we are dating. We fully support each other, help one another, and are real with each other (babe, you are obsessing, that's a stupid idea don't do that, hey that project turned out amazing!)

I have come to realization that I love this guy and would do anything for him. I finally work up the nerve to tell him and he feels that same *happy dance*

Here's the thing, he graduates this year and was only in the country for school. He is moving back and will be far away and needs to set up his life. I still have a year of school but want to be with him. Plus my student loans are cripplingly scary. 

I want a LDR but know that its not a permanent solution. He wants me to visit as much as possible. 

the kicker? He's not sure if he can be exclusive with me so far away. His needs, he feels, will make him unfaithful and while he said he wants to try, wants to make sure we stay friends if it doesn't work. THIS CRUSHED ME. 

If he loves me how can it be that hard to go without for a year until I finish school and then we decide if I move with him? How can that even be a concern? What the hell happened to wanting to be with just one person? 

I honestly don't know how this is going to turn out. Am I being too demanding? the thought of him with another woman absolutely destroys me. Advice or thoughts?


EDIT: ultimately I want us to work, any suggestions?"

Last week while we were distracted by the events in Boston and West, TX the House of Representatives betrayed us and passed HR 624: The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (aka CISPA).  This bill is the successor to last years SOPA and PIPA bills.

I urge everyone that reads this to call their Senator. CISPA needs to be shut down in the senate! Knowing what to do when you call is of vital importance.  First off when you call you aren't going to talk to the senator personally. One of their secretary's aides or interns will answer. Tell them you want to speak with Mr./Ms. So an' So. They will tell you that the senator is in a meeting right now. Tell them that you are calling in regards to HR 624. Or, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing Protection Act. Say you know that your house representative voted (Yea) (you can verify your congressman's vote here: http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h117) and you demand that the senator vote (NAY!). 

They will say they will pass the word along to the senator. This is now the important part, ask them if they need your phone number because you expect a call back. They will say they have it, and probably read it out to you. Tell them if you don't receive a call back from the senator you WILL be calling them back. Then give your address, so that they will know you live in state. 

Finally follow through with the call back.  If you do not here a call back within 24 hours call back and repeat, pointing out that you are calling back because you did not receive the callback you requested.

For my friends in Texas here is our senators information.  Calling the DC office is preferred as that is their main line of communication.

I can't help it, 4 years insofar University just finished my 2nd year of courses. Now I have the option to sign up for internship program that I was looking forward to, I'm boarder-line on GPA and its a low one. Anxiety kills me when I look at the registration sheet, ""It doesn't hurt trying"" but it does. Mistakes that I done, ignorance that got me here now realizing that a dream that I pursuing is fading. 


Looking at the sheet makes me sick, makes me hate the person that I am, the way I grew up, the position I am in, the pressure that suffocates me. I was never a smart person and I do try hard but circumstances never allow me to do what I wanted, from tragedies problems in my household I should have dropped the courses but reasoning with myself saying ""you'll just neeed to try harder for the final"" never happens. Money wasted, regret eating my sanity.   


Rejection is scary, humiliating. Not getting wait you want the most is scary, Working at a place you hate is scary. Not doing what you want to do the most is scary. 

If you read this and you are in pursue of something  , please please please try your hardest to fulfill your dream, what you want to do. Once you start something work hard on it.

My SO and I have been married 11.5 years, I have a stable job, and we are very happily married. That all said, I am absolutely freaking out right now because of the state of our finances. SO is in school getting his master's degree, and while he has a part-time job (""internship"") that brings in about $1000 a month, we are living outside our means as it is. We have accumulated significant credit card debt- when I took my current job after graduating from school, we owed $25,000 with our two cards. My SO decided that, since he was going back to school, we would pay down our CC debt by taking out student loans for him. So now, we have traded copious CC debt for copious student loan debt (how much, I don't know as he kind of won't tell me). Oh yeah, still have $12000 in CC debt. We have an underwater mortgage (not terribly underwater, probably only $10,000, but still), but at least we own both our cars outright.

I have set up budgets in the past, but neither of us seem to be able to abide by them. And while I know that we share the blame for our predicament, there is a growing part of me that really resents some of the actions of my SO when it comes to money. He never knows how much we have in checking. He knows I set up a budget, but when I tell him he can't get something because we can't afford it, he gets incredibly defensive. I feel like I have really taken on the bulk of the financial responsibility, but clearly this isn't working at all. So now I am trying to figure out how we are going to afford our baby arriving in October. Our parents (both sides) are incredibly generous and willing to pitch in for just about anything, but a big part of me just wants to scream ""I REFUSE TO LET YOU BAIL US OUT AGAIN, I'M FREAKIN' 33 YEARS OLD"". There is no way I am letting our parents finance things for us just because we aren't responsible enough to actually live within our means.

I think that the bulk of this rant can really come down to that- I feel like I have been incredibly irresponsible the past 8 years or so with our finances. And now that my SO has finally come on board with the idea of raising a family, I am realizing how much this will impact our future AND our baby's future... and I am freaking out. And, of course, when I freak out about one thing I freak out about lots of things. Like how long it has been since I cleaned (like really cleaned). Our house is disgusting, I often wonder what someone would think of me if they came by unannounced. Our poor cat is out of his wet cat food and has been for 3 days. He has dry food, but have either my SO or I actually gone the 1.5 miles to the store to get him the food he really enjoys eating? No! How am I supposed to care for a baby when I can't even take care of my cat?

Add to this a general lack of friends of any sort within 500 miles, and you will see why I am sitting on my bed crying. I just feel so overwhelmed with feelings of failure and irresponsibility, and I just don't have anyone who will listen. I don't even know if I need anyone to tell me what to do. I feel like I need a swift kick in the ass, someone to tell me to just buck up and start being an adult. And maybe just as importantly, someone to do the same to my SO. Cuz I feel like he stopped listening to me about these things because it never, ever changes.

So yeah, that's my rant. Wish I felt better..."
1crwgr,1,2013-04-20,"""I enjoy things more when you're asleep."" (really long sorry)",[deleted],SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1crwgr/i_enjoy_things_more_when_youre_asleep_really_long/,"So, I am having relationship problems and I didn't want to go to the main relationship subreddits because I'd most likely get yelled at.  SRS really should have a relationship based subreddit!  Anyway, the following may be a bit long.

  I have been when my current boyfriend for 3 years.  We are both 21 and he is graduating college soon with a job already lined up in computer science.  I have to take an extra semester with a Zoology degree and I don't know what to do but I like birds.  Currently, one of my main issues is that I have no financial help from anyone but my bf and I just lost my lab job because my supervisor left and i'm currently having a hard time trying to find a paid internship.  I'm in debt because of my hospital bills--I was hospitalized for pancreatitis in december and now i'm sure it's chronic because I have random bouts of pain.  I eat healthy and exercise so no one knows what it is.  I do know that my stress levels, anxiety, and depression makes it a ton worse.  Lately, I have been pretty sad.  I usually have dysthymia coupled with anxiety but lately it's been getting worse.  My boyfriend is incredibly socially inept, and has no friends besides me.   Even though i'm his only friend, I feel that most of the time he really doesn't care about the things that I am really passionate about.  I have changed dramatically these past three years and have gained lots of new interest including my extreme passion with birds, feminism, and environmentalism.  He hasn't changed at all, and spends 90% of his time playing GW2, which is a great game but I rarely have time to play video games anymore.  I used to play with him before my video card died on my desktop.  I really don't have that much interest in playing anymore though.  The main think i'm interested in is birds and nature.  I'm really passionate about nature and I want to be as self-sufficient as possible.  My boyfriend comes from a rich, catholic, Italian family and grew up in the city. (I am quite the opposite) I have talked to him a lot about what I wish to do in the future.  Today at the grocery store I told him to get some organic apples and he comes back with regular apples.  I ask him why he didn't get organic, and he said it ""didn't matter"".  This really hurt me, because it tells me that he hasn't been listening to anything I've been saying.  The title quote refers to something said a couple months ago during a fight with one of his friends (see my previous post quoting his shitlord friend).  I always think of this quote when i'm upset even if he apologized for it later.




   I think about the future a lot, and I don't want to be a housewife, which he considers to be a full-time job.  I see his mom, who had to quit her job as a chemical engineer, who discovered a new technique and had it patented, to raise four kids.  Honestly, I think i'd be happier doing research with birds and adopting parrots instead of having kids.  I've gone to couples counseling and I still go to my own counseling but I'm just not happy.  The problem is that I have no money, and if it wasn't for my boyfriend I wouldn't be able to eat.  I can barely pay my half of the rent.  In terms of my family, my little sister is going through cancer so my mother relies on government support in order to support herself and my sister.  My step-father is in jail because I spoke up about my 8 years of sexual/mental/physical abuse me and my step-sister suffered.  My biological father is wealthy, but is about as much help as a rotten cabbage.  Whenever I tell my friends, they pretty much agree that my life sucks.  I see that, but it doesn't really help me.  I'm not sure what to do anymore."
1crt9j,6,2013-04-20,How do I (22M) prepare for never seeing her (22F) again?,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1crt9j/how_do_i_22m_prepare_for_never_seeing_her_22f/,"I don't want to get to into the relationship and breakup but I will give enough back story so what I say makes sense -- hopefully I do a good job at that.

About a month ago my girlfriend broke up with me. It was my first full relationship. Since then we have managed to leave everything on good terms and stop contacting each other to help us both move on.

However, we live around the corner from each other... I walk past her house every time I leave or come back to my house. It is so painful to know sometimes that she is right inside as I walk past.

In a week I will be going back to my hometown for a summer internship. She is graduating [I graduate in Dec.] and will be probably moving to a new city for a job she offered sometime this summer (it is a research position and they are waited to hear back and see if they will have the funding to pay her, it seems promising).

Assuming they get the funding and she takes the job we will no longer be living in the same city and will possibly never see each other again. Although the city she is going to has been my top choice to move to after college for a while, there is an alternative route to my life that I may take which will potentially ensure that we never see each other again. 

The last time I saw her was last Sunday morning, that was when I told her we should stop contacting each other. In a weeks time I may never see her again. The idea that this person I love, the first person I fell in love with, is never going to even be in my line of sight terrifies me. I have no idea how to handle this.

Thanks for the advice all, I appreciate it."

1cw3kl,5,2013-04-22,Day one. Let's see how this goes.,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1cw3kl/day_one_lets_see_how_this_goes/,"Got drunk for the first time 20 years ago.  I was in 7th grade and was staying up late to finish making a poster or some dumb thing for school. Folks had gone to bed, so I opened up their liquor cabinet.  Pulled out a handle of Cuervo Gold and a shot glass and started taking shots.  After about 5-6, I was having the time of my life.  Since then it's been pretty much non-stop. I've gotten several DUIs, which was the motivation I needed to go back to school.

I moved home with my folks, enrolled in college, and am set to graduate with a BS in computer science next fall.  Last weekend was my 32nd birthday, and I have decided that I need to make a change.  During the past two years that I've been away at college, there hasn't been a single night when I didn't drink.

I was recently offered a summer internship as a computer programmer, but the day after I signed and returned the offer letter, I got a notice to provide consent to a background check.  Still waiting to hear back as to whether my past record will cause the company to rescind the offer.

Not ready to request a badge here just yet, as it would be height of shame to have to message the mods tomorrow and tell them to reset it.

Just going to take it one day at a time and see what happens."

Planning on getting the Surface Pro.

Background: Surface is being used to program, Android development mostly, along with playing simple/stupid games, Quake Live.  I understand it does not support Quake Live, but I plan on hopefully dual booting with Ubuntu and getting it to work there maybe?  Ultimately, this is a laptop replacement for an internship that's too far to bring my desktop. 

Some questions:

Type cover vs. Touch cover?  For programming, from what I've read online, I read touch would work best/is more accurate.

Programming.  Is it easy?  Can I do Android development?  Eclipse, not ideaJ.

Would it be smarter to get a real laptop, rather than a Surface?  I figured a Surface would work best as I get the mobility (I'm skating to/from work) and has enough productivity, that I can actually do my own thing on it.  But their may be an alternative that might be better?

That's really about it.  Any insight is appreciated =)."

I've been accepted by both New York University and Carnegie Mellon University, both great schools but I'm having difficulty on deciding between the two.  I'm trying to narrow things down to several categories: Education, Social Life, Finance, and Future (such as internships and career opportunities).  With NYU, I have been accepted by the Computer Science program in CAS, though I might plan on transferring to the Tisch school of the arts (Film/Television is something I really enjoy).  I enjoy the city life, living an hour away in New Jersey, but I acknowledge that costs are high.  With Carnegie Mellon, I have been accepted into the Information Systems program, a combination of business and computer science. This field was suggested by a friend, but I don't know too much about it.  CMU has a good arts program as well, so I might dabble in their.  In terms of financial aid, my parents and I will still need to pay around and over $50,000, though CMU has offered more financial aid so that it is $5000 cheaper than NYU.  Still, NYU was my dream school in Junior year and still resonates within me.

I don't know a lot of people in NYU, so I was hoping on getting a current student's perspective and opinion.  I need to enroll within the next week, so please help!  Thanks!"

1cuhz1,14,2013-04-22,How do I [F21] tell my SO [M22] about my past?,thegirlformerlyknown,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cuhz1/how_do_i_f21_tell_my_so_m22_about_my_past/,"This is going to be long, so I apologize in advance. ~~I've also bolded the most important information to make it easier to follow.~~ Apparently this made it more difficult to read. Sorry!

We've been dating for about three months. Though we originally thought we couldn't get too serious because we would be in different places (him moving, me traveling), things have changed, and we know that we'll at least be in the same place until the end of the summer. 

Because I didn't originally think we were going to be serious, I didn't worry about telling him all the intimate details of my life. However, now I feel as if I'm hiding part of myself from him. We've said that we love each other, and I've never felt this strongly about anyone before. I just can't help but feel that I'm being dishonest.

The issue(s): I'm embarrassed to talk about my past. From the outside, I would say I appear fairly put-together. I was super involved in high school, 4.0, scholarships to college, etc. Here in college, I'm involved in a few organizations I feel strongly about, do well in my classes, have internships and research experience, all that jazz. 

BUT: in high school, I struggled with self-injury on and off for four years. I was somewhat suicidal, though I never attempted it. In college, I gained an eating disorder, which has also been on and off. I haven't struggled with it since last semester, and I am trying to be healthier in both my habits and my mindset. Last semester I was also somewhat sexually promiscuous; while I am not sure if this fits here, I personally view it as another form of self-destruction (not for everyone, but for me specifically, as my reasons were less than healthy). Finally, I am clinically diagnosed OCD, though I would say that it does not interfere in my life that much.

This all sounds horrible, and quite frankly I feel ashamed when I think about telling him this. He is an amazing person, and I don't think he would judge me for it; however, he seems extremely well-adjusted and normal, for lack of a better word, and I am worried that he would A. not understand and B. think of me differently.

With him, I am fun and silly and sweet. And it's not an act--with him I am my best self, the person I want to be all the time. I don't think it's wrapped up solely with him, either; if we were to break up, I would be heartbroken, but I don't think I would return to my previous habits. I've stopped thinking of myself as crazy. I want to be healthy, not just for him but for myself.

Part of me is insistent that I need to tell him these things, because they were such a big part of my life. However, another part of me doesn't even feel like that person anymore. I don't want to do those things, and I honestly feel like I've changed. How do I express that the way I acted and the things I did are no longer a part of me? I don't want to scare him away, but at the same time I can't handle being dishonest when he's such a good person.

**TL;DR Dating three months, I had a slew of issues in the past (SI, ED, OCD) that no longer define me. I feel dishonest keeping them from him. How do I express that those issues are no longer a part of me?**

/u/MojoSavage and the [Top Post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/15qf0e/can_a_group_of_ksp_fans_but_an_inexperienced/) inspired me late last night to organize a way for us to do this over the internet.


&gt;**Reddit Space Race**
&gt;
&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;Mission Statement:
&gt;
&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;
&gt;The Reddit Space Program (RSP) will take the minds and hearts of /r/KerbalSpaceProgram and put them to work on building a single save file to rule all save files. Together we will grasp the stars in our collective fist of power and reign over our dominion.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;Predicted Milestones:

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;1. Orbit and reentry of Kerbal.

&gt;2. Orbit of Mun and return to Kerbal

&gt;3. Land on the Mun and return to Kerbal

&gt;4. Launch the official RSP Kerbal Orbital Station (OS) and additional parts as required.

&gt;5. Construct KSP Mun OS, synchronous orbit

&gt;6. KSP Mun Surface Station (SS) directly below KSP Mun OS.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; Jobs:

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; *Submit photos/videos of your exploits for reference.*

&gt; Pilot: You'll be piloting all space craft from first person controls. If you can stream smoothly, that would be amazing. Good personalities are welcome here.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; Engineers: 

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;You'll be responsible for collaborating on rocket, ship, and construction designs. You get the pilots into the air in one piece.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; Mechanics:
 
&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;This can go one or two ways. If you're a modder, and you can make parts to the engineer's designs, that's good. You can have a new job title. If not, we need people to build these projects so that our Kerbalnauts don't rapidly disassemble along with the ships.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; Mission Control:

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; * Flight Commander: Maintain order and control over the flight. Makes all final decisions during missions.

&gt; * Flight Intern: Working under the Commander you will be responsible for ensuring that things go smoothly. You will fill in the gaps as needed, and if not, get the coffee and hold the white board.

&gt; * Flight Officer: You'll plot the course and monitor all progress.

&gt; * Petty Flight Officer: Working under the Flight Officer you'll be responsible for assisting with all duties. Primarily monitoring flight data and reporting to the Flight Officer.

&gt; * Communications Officer: You'll be responsible for maintaining communications with our pilot.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;How will this work?

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; The rules are simple. The entire crew will be on Teamspeak. The pilot will be in the cockpit channel. Everyone else in Mission Control. Using the multiplayer mod Mission Control can monitor the flight progress, trajectory, and vitals of the pilot's ship.

&gt;Using this, the pilot will be locked into first person during the entire fligt using cockpit controls only, unless on a spacewalk or surfacewalk.

&gt;Mission Control will separately monitor the flight and discuss the changes. Flight Commander will make decisions and Communications Officer will relay them to the pilot quickly and clearly. 

&gt; Upon completion of each successful mission we will release a file containing the saves and mods needed to use it. This way all players can play in our world with each upgrade."

     ""Dear Googler,

My name is pinkcadillac28.  I go to school at The University of Pennsylvania with my boyfriend named boyfriend.  

Boyfriend was a summer intern at Google two summers ago, and he is a huge fan of all things Google. 

A few weeks ago Boyfriend made a submission to the If I Had Glass contest, and was disappointed to find he was not selected to be a Glass Explorer.  Beyond his submission to the contest, he has been talking my ear off for the past few months about all of the exciting things Google Glass would bring, and the amazing ideas he had for it.  

He was so incredibly excited about the project, and I hated to see him so disappointed in not being able to participate in something he so strongly desired. I know he is someone who would appreciate being a Glass Explorer more than anybody I, or you, probably know.

Now I know there are many people out there just like Boyfriend, but I believe that Boyfriend does not only love Google for its products, he also is incredibly passionate about the company where it is now, and where it will be in the future, and he hopes to one day play a part in that.  

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help make Boyfriend's dream come true.  His birthday is in Month and I was hoping to work some kind of miracle for him :)

I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.

My wife and I have always been bigger people, and struggle with weight regularly. When my wife was pregnant with our first daugther, I balooned up to 265 lbs (6'0""), and my wife put on far more weight than she should have. It got to the point where she was pre-eclampsic, and the doctors decided to enduce to put a halt to it (was about a week early, so no biggie - daughter is perfectly healthy). 

At the start of January, my wife and I started trying to get pregnant, and by February we were. Ths time around, I was down to 245 when we started, and my wife's starting weight at conception is 40 lbs less than conception the first time around. She'd been awesome, and knocking off the weight - I'd been supportive but not joining in. Also around the start of January I began a new job (internship), and my senior year of my B.S., and decided that I'd start working on losing weight after getting settled into the first week of class. I'm now at 223 lbs, and have been getting commented regularly from people and friends about it. I even got called a ""skinny-minny"" by the Pastor's wife, which for me, is a total mind-scramble.

The issue I'm dealing with, is that my wife, at 13 weeks, is starting to show. She's happy for me, but she's dealing with all the things that pregnant women deal with. Including some self-concious issues about size, and the contrast of my weight-loss to her gain. I try to reassure, and affirm her that her gain so far is completely natural and healthy, but it doesn't seem to put her at ease.

So, for the TL;DR: does anyone have suggestions on how to help a 13-week pregnant woman not get disheartened in the face of a spouses weight loss?"

A week ago my 22end birthday passed and even for being young I have not even done simple things people my age have done. I'm not depressed. I don't want to feel better, I want something to change. when I look objectively at my life it's just really bad, and yet I can't see my life improving.

I had a pretty bad childhood and grew up as a latch key kid with little support(I was an immigrant and my parents were usually busy), my childhood was filled with bullying and not fitting in due different background which caused some serious lack of self esteem, confidence issues, and inferiority complexes.

I'm currently not depressed at all but the state of my life has really been stagnate for the past few years. My life is generally tedious and uninteresting, yet I feel I'm not in any position to change anything about it. I want to get out of this but I feel like there's dead ends everywhere and it causes this immense feeling of extreme frustration and feeling of being trapped.

I graduated HS 4 years ago now and I've been attending a small boring community college. I didn't feel passionate about anything and couldn't figure out what I wanted to do which caused some serious time wasting and bad grades. The place was packed and I often couldn't get any classes I needed which wasted a lot of time. I began taking classes I didn't need so I could acquire priority in registration. During my time at community college I often had extreme bouts of negative emotions, felt depressed, extremely lonely, bored, directionless. I withdrew from a lot of classes and this screwed me over. I had nothing to strive for, no goal, I was going through the motions, and began to have issues sleeping and started having awful grades, this kept going down in spiral. The campus was often empty, drab, and no one was around. There were no clubs. I just wanted to get out and I could not. I'm socially proficient, yet despite all attempts I found it extremely difficult to make friends at community college(due to the nature of the place).

I spent the two years or so slowly improving myself even more, talking to people, dressing better, going to the gym every so often, but not much changed in my life. I still have only 3 friends and no social network to speak of. My weekends are spent at home, yet I highly dislike being at home all the time, I often feel VERY alone and VERY lonely. I did finally just recently find a girl and we went on a date, went well. I do look good on the outside and people often assume some very positive things about me(That I'm cool, have friends and that I'm intelligent and get good grades and have my life together), but the reality is I'm a failure. I often feel very odd when people compliment something positive about me.

Compared to many people I am incredibly underdeveloped life experience/success wise for my age, yet at the same time I have the potential but no conducive environment for it. I'm not around anyone successful, I'm not around anyone my age who's doing something fun, or interesting, I don't have a group, there's no one for me to ""network"" off of. I'd love to get into a niche, or meet some person who's doing something interesting, or be in a place where something is happening. I'm still in the same town I was when I graduated, surrounded the same people, and experiencing the same things. I hate my life everyday. I have potential and but I'm not in the right places and around the right people............I'm just here......stuck.

 Most people my age are living it up, having so much fun with their lives, yet I'm stuck here and experienced none of it. Fuck I haven't even gone to a real party yet, and I just recently got my first kiss. I'm so behind compared to the way people seem to generally view me, and it's really annoying. My lack of life experience makes me extremely frustrated. I'm wasting away my 20s and some of the best time of my life, where I have the time, youth, and energy. 

 In the last six months I finally settled on something for a major. I need about one more year till I transfer, at the same time that many of my peers are GRADUATING and getting internships and jobs and getting paid well. This is something that causes me a lot of turmoil. I eats me up inside. I know it's not a race but I personally WANT to finish already, I can't bear being in the same situation any longer. I so badly want my life to ""start"" and I keep feeling like my life hasn't ""started"" yet. It's like big puzzle piece and I want the puzzle to finish but the goddamn fucking pieces aren't coming together and I can't make them together because they're just not there so I have to waste more of my life. A lot of those four years of life were completely wasted, I try not to dwell on the past but I'm still not going anywhere. I just wanted to get out of this place and I can't, I have to wait about one more year, then after that there's at least 2 more years when I transfer. This makes a total of approximately six years to get my degree. Now let's just hope I even get a chance to get a job....that's another story.

My parents are very old and sick, and I'm from a lower poor class. They're very demanding and negative about me, and I admit I have many short comings. I need to step up and I always needed to but I never did and wasn't able to, and I let them down. 

I feel trapped in my situation, I'm trapped in school, I'm trapped in my lacking social life, I'm trapped by my lack of money, I'm trapped at home. I want my life to start already, I want the rocket to launch but I feel grounded, stuck in the dull black tar pit of my life. My personality is one that seeks novelty, yet my life is extremely monotonous. After four years and seemingly no feeling of ""moving forward"" anywhere school has become a chore. I have a constant feeling of ""frustration"" like I'm stuck, trapped, at a stand still, like I'm trying to run but I'm bound. The ennui of life is bearing down on me and I feel like there's no novelty or purpose to my life. It feels like I'm in life's stream swimming in a pool of molasses. 

tl;dr

-I'm 22 now

-only 3 friends, no social life.

-no money, poor, parents sick, very old

-4 years wasted at community college, still not done, feel trapped in my situation

1cx788,20,2013-04-23,"Dear Reddit, I just got my first job offer, and I worked for every fucking ounce of it.",tathrowawaynow,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1cx788/dear_reddit_i_just_got_my_first_job_offer_and_i/,"Ok, it's technically not the first offer, but it's the first ""real"" one, I guess.

I started in an unpaid internship after my graduation, because I had no other choice that wouldn't lead me to a dead end job when I had no experience. 

I worked 60-70 hours a week, sometimes I would go to work on weekends with 1 days notice, sometimes I work until the morning, get 4 hours of sleep, come back for another 12 hours day. I moved to a place where I know no one, I sacrificed my social life, and I literally have an hour or two to my own everyday.

I took every opportunity to learn new software, new skills; took every criticism like it's a god given gift to point out my weakness and make me a better person; I stayed around office to the morning to help out my team, even if it's not my project.

And my friends would ask me, in their comfortable, dead end jobs, ""hey, have you got paid yet?"" And I would joke with them about it, I would joke about myself. But deep inside it only made me want to work harder.

I dreamed of a day I can pay my own rent, pay for my gf's dinner because I can afford it, buy things and not feel guilty about spending money from my parents.

After about half a year later, they hired me, with very low pay, but even more pressure and more hours. I once worked through three weekends, work until midnight on every single day. I would get yelled at by my boss for two hours, and as soon as I get out from his office, I put a smile on my face. 

Because everyone likes someone who smiles.

All of these, everything only made me stronger, made me want it more, and made me motivated. When I finally started job hunting again, I was drowning in interviews, i got call backs from more than 30% of my applications. And finally, I got an offer today with a large corporation doing a job in my field. 

At first I was surprised, and then it just felt like validation, validation for every fucking bit of hard work I put into it, every fucking 24 hours work day, every yelling I took and worked through.

And then they come and say I'm lucky.

No, I'm not fucking lucky. I want to tell the world, I deserve every interview, every offer I get, because I WORKED MY ASS OFF for it.

When you are out drinking, I'm working; when you are dating your girlfriend, I'm working; before you go to sleep, I'm working; after you wake up, I'm still fucking working.

And I'm going to keep improve and learn. Because I know, for a fact, that hard work pays off."

I just landed a summer internship for a late night talk show in Burbank and need a couch for the duration of it. (I'll even get you tickets to the show - trust me, you'll want to come).

I'm currently living in Orange County but am only planning on staying in LA for the days I work (depending on the couch situation/how lazy I am - but can easily get out of your hair for a few days if you need privacy). I'm open to any area as long as it is relatively close to the studio. I've lived in Silverlake/West Hollywood before and loved it.

I've seen some posts on Craigslist offer $15 for their couch a night or a set price a week in exchange for some help around the house. I love to cook and clean - so if you want to lower the price in exchange for some help, no worries buddy, I got you. I'm a lurker of Reddit, screenwriter and an inactive democrat.

1d18c8,2,2013-04-24,I [M21] am on the hook while my (ex?)girlfriend [F21] decides if she wants to be with me.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1d18c8/i_m21_am_on_the_hook_while_my_exgirlfriend_f21/,"So I've posted a couple questions on this matter thus far but I've reached an impasse. Basically, I've with this girl for 6 months, but have done an internship for the last 3.5 months. I flew to see her three times and she flew to see me once. When I got back, it was in time for her 21st birthday, and I got drunk and acted like a jerk because I was being jealous of her being happy with her other friends. 

She says that she doesn't want to be with me because I am jealous and possessive, while that may be true, it has been greatly exacerbated by me spending so much time apart from her. She says that being together alone, with her family, and with certain friends she is very happy. She also says that being with certain friends who she knows I don't like feels uncomfortable. She also feels that I am keeping her from going and hanging out with her other friends because of my possessive behavior. 

This has all been within the last 36 hours. I genuinely love this girl and am willing to do whatever I need to do. I have scheduled a counseling session at my university to start to try to change my possessive ways. For now, she says that she doesn't know if she loves me and that too much damage could've already been done. She has agreed to wait 2-3 weeks due to her uncertainty. 

At that time I plan on asking her on a date to see what happens. My question: should I try to ignore her during this period, give her an occasional text (she agreed to text me every couple days to let me know she's doing ok), or just try to move on? 

I love her and am willing to do anything to keep her and to improve myself as a person through counseling.

TL;DR what should I do after being put on the hook for 2-3 weeks?

EDIT: I'm fully aware of my mistakes and I know that I'm reaping what I have sown. I'm prepared to go through months of counseling to fix my deep seeded issues if I have to. Commenters are right: if I truly love her I will wait."

I will be moving to Indianapolis from Connecticut in mid-May to begin a new job and to return to school part-time at IUPUI. I already have a list of around 30 places I've found, of which 10 I've contacted. I'm reaching out to you guys for some recommendations on places to look at and not to look at. Obviously my search is a risky one since I won't be able to see the apartment in person before I move in. 

Here is some criteria I'm trying to match: 

* 1 bedroom for ~$500 a month, though I'm willing to pays as much as $575. Apartment should have kitchen appliances (though I'm finding this is the norm).
* A 15-20 minute drive (no more than 25-30) from downtown, where I'll be working at and going to school.
* I'd like to stay on the west or north side within the 465 loop, though I'm not opposed to the south. I actually lived in Indy from last August to December for an internship and lived by the Speedway, and really liked that area. 
*  I'd like to stay away from the sketchy/unsafe parts of town. From what I gather, the northeast part of town is the sketchiest, but someone please correct me if I'm wrong. 

I've been using apartmentratings.com to read reviews, but some more feedback would be great! Also, if you have recommendations on other apartment search engines to use, that would be cool. Thanks so much!

1d01nx,0,2013-04-24,I was molested by my teacher. (I apologize for the length in advance.),[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d01nx/i_was_molested_by_my_teacher_i_apologize_for_the/,"(I am a female, and I was 20 when this happened. At the time, I had never been drunk, had never smoked, or gotten high. I also had and still have emetophobia, an irrational fear of vomit.) I am an art student, and I go to a private institution, across the country from where I was born. I have no family and few friends here, so I get homesick from time to time.

The teacher-student dynamic at my school is very different from academic schools, and even some other art schools. The way the classes are structured makes it so that teachers and students develop close, but still professional, relationships:
1. The class sizes are relatively small, about 15-17 students
2. Classes, whether studio or lecture, are 3 hours long (some classes are 5-6 hours long)
3. We talk about ourselves and our work in group and individual meetings, so we ALL learn about each other

There is one particular teacher at my school, who is very popular. He has a very good reputation, and has a very likable personality. I admired him immediately when I first met him 3 years ago. I later learned that it was not unusual for him to invite students (both male and female, although it was usually males) to his studio. He would have jam sessions and drawing sessions, and although he was kind to all of his students, he only invited a select few.

The next year (last year), I took my most important class with him. We had many one-on-one talks about my work, and about my professional future. Over the course of the year, I began to think of him as a father figure since I was away from home and family, he always gave me support and guidance when I needed it. He also had a daughter my age, the same year and in the same school I was. Towards the end of the year, we became Facebook friends (as he was with most of his students,) and had short Facebook chats regularly, none of them personal. The school year ended and summer vacation started. I usually flew back home for vacations, but I found an internship, so I stayed where I was. 

He invited me over to see his book collection, which I had seen photos of on Facebook. I was elated that I was one of the few people he had deemed worthy to spend time outside of class with. After a bit of persuasion on his part, I agreed. I met him at his studio late in the evening, around 8 or 9 PM. It started innocently enough, with a beer for each of us, and a review of the school year. (As innocent as supplying alcohol to a minor can be, anyway.) One beer turned into two, and then beer turned into shots of whiskey. I said no to the whiskey. He wouldn't take no for an answer.

I took the shot. He offered me a cigarette. I said no. I never saw the appeal, although many of my friends do it. I have no problem with it, but I had no interest in smoking. He put the cigarette in my hand and told me to inhale while he lit. My resistance caused him to have to light the cigarette more than once, but it eventually lit. He never took ""no"" as ""no,"" just that I needed more pushing.

Another shot. More talking. Another shot. More talking. Another shot. Then he brought the weed out. Again, I said no. He shoved the pipe in my mouth. Drowsy and dizzy, I still said no. Didn't matter. Put the pipe in my mouth again and lit it. Another shot. Another hit. Four more shots, with one hit between each one. From the first beer to the 9th shot, only 2 or 3 hours had passed. I felt okay until the 8th shot. The 9th one did me in. I felt sick, and because of my phobia, I felt afraid. I got out of my chair and collapsed on his couch. The room wouldn't stop shifting. I thought to myself that I would NOT be sick, not here, not now, not ever. I thought if I told myself mentally enough times that it wouldn't happen. I just had to concentrate.

He asked me if I was going to be sick. I said no, and that my emetophobia has prevented me from vomiting since I was 5. He asked if I was going to be sick again. Yes. I was. He led me to the restroom. I barely coughed up anything, too afraid. He asked me if I was okay. I managed to kick him out of the restroom. He left. I checked my phone. It was well after midnight, almost one in the morning. I threw up silently over the course of two hours. Traumatized. He eventually came back to fetch me. I was exhausted.

He helped me off of the floor, I collapsed on the same couch, since it was the first thing I could lay down on. It only seated one, so I lay in the seat with my head on one of the armrests, my legs over the other. He told me that I looked uncomfortable, and that I was free to use his bed. Like I did all evening, I said no. He tugged at my arm and told me his bed would be more relaxing for me. I yanked my arm away from him and told him to leave me alone. He pulled me up forcefully, all 125 pounds of me, and threw me towards his bed. 

I collapsed again, this time on the outside edge of his bed. Even though there was nothing left in my stomach, it hurt very badly, and I still felt quite nauseous. I rolled over on the side and held my stomach in the fetal position. He pushed me to the inside edge of his bed, against the wall and bookshelves. He climbed into bed next to me. He asked me if I was alright. I told him I was not, that my stomach hurt.

And then he touched me. He started rubbing my stomach. 

""What the hell are you doing?!""

""It'll make you feel better, I promise.""

""NO, DON'T TOUCH ME.""

I threw his hand off of my body. Silence. He reached over and started rubbing my stomach, this time his hand was lower than his first attempt, but just barely. 

""I'm serious. You better stop.""

Again, I threw his hand off of me. Silence. My labored breathing. My spinning brain. He reached for me again, below my jeans, my pubic area. 

""I swear to God, you better stop.""

""But why? It feels so cute down there.""

""You're sick! Don't touch me! You have a daughter my age! You're old enough to be my father!""

""But, I'm not your father.""

""That doesn't make it okay! I'm telling you to stop! PLEASE.""

He touched me again, this time going for my breasts. I moved his hands yet again, telling him to stop. He wouldn't. His hands roamed my upper body, I kept moving his hands off of me.

I focused on clearing my head, to get the room to stop rolling around me, to sit up straight. It was around 4:00 AM that I was able to sit up without falling over. By 4:15, I was able to stand. I put on my shoes, and I left. I walked all the way back to my place, crying. 

It's been almost one year since this happened, and after lurking here for a very long time, I decided it was time to talk about what happened. I realize my situation is not that heavy, in that nothing serious happened, but I am sheltered, and I trusted him. I looked up to him. I am in no way over it, but I have been trying, and I thought posting it here would be a good start.

I'm sorry for the long (and slow/boring) read. If you managed to read all the way through, I really, truly thank you. It took a very long time of debating with myself whether or not to post my story.

1d00bl,2,2013-04-24,I feel like I have Borderline Personality Disorder.. (venting),thatonegirlt,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1d00bl/i_feel_like_i_have_borderline_personality/,"Firstly, I see the rules on the subreddit. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, that was just my thoughts and what I felt like naming this.

Secondly, I haven't done anything like this before. I typically write on a little private blog that I vent on, but I don't know, I just thought I would give this a try and see what comes of it.

Thirdly, for context I am a 4th year college student.

So anyway... back to the point at hand. I don't know where to start. I feel like I have been ""out-logic-ing"" my sadness for a while now. I mentally decide that I am fine, that this will pass, and that these emotions are not serious. I have a friend with bipolar disorder, and I used to talk with her about it. She would explain to me how she sometimes could tell when she was sad because of something truly saddening, or when her brain chemistry was causing irrational sadness. Basically, I feel like a lot of the time I pretty much have my brain stfu, go about my day, and get over things.

But I haven't been able to do that. In fact, I don't think that ever even worked. I have random break downs, like right now, where I just need to be completely unproductive, cry for a while, and listen to music. Or harm myself in some way or the other. Which is odd, because I don't cut or things like that, no, I'm much more likely to bash my head against a wall, punch some concrete, or bite a hole in my tongue. Yes, I know that it's bad. That's more of a built up anger though I suppose, rather than sadness. I don't try to do it, it just happens, not really a conscious choice. Yeah, I'm just all over the place with this post.

Anyway again.. so right now I have a shit ton of work to do. Like seriously, I need to be awake in basically 4 hours, I have homework that's due tomorrow but instead I'm sitting here typing this ridiculously long post that no one will care about,  I'm sure. I don't know, I just feel like my life is going no where. I just was offered a summer internship, I'm a computer engineering major, I have a few solid friends, supportive parents... but I feel like I'm going no where. I feel like I am going to fail it all. I haven't taken proper notes this entire semester. I know how important my classes are but I can't bring myself to really care, until I'm (mentally) beating myself up for being such a terrible student and having to try/stress so hard to cram before tests. I'm financially responsible, saving a good portion of money here and there, but then I go and spend like $300 on Kickstarter in an hour.. I just feel like I look at myself from an outside view and just have no idea wtf is my problem. 

I have a loving boyfriend of almost two years, who I really don't know how my emotions are on that. I know the relationship isn't going anywhere, but eh. Dunno. Sometimes we are great, sometimes it's terrible. I just think I am too apathetic to try anymore. In anything. But then I get pissed at myself and by then it's too late. I am digging myself deeper and deeper into this self-hatred hole. I am having this breakdowns more frequently. I used to have a few a year, then one a few months, now I feel like I'm closer to having one at least once a month. I just don't know. I guess that it doesn't help that I have my issues all over the place.  I don't know what else to say."

I'm currently doing an internship for a branding agency, and one of my tasks was to create a user database with custom information whenever someone registers. 

So as you know, a stock wordpress install only asks a user for the basic info like name, email, etc.

I'm using a plugin called Profile Builder Pro, which allows you to add custom fields for users. So now with this plugin, whenever a user registers, it asks them for the basic info along with their address, business name, account number, etc.

Now my main goal for this is to have a custom order form where the some of the fields already have the user's information entered already as default. For example, once they enter their address when they register, whenever they go to the order form, its automatically entered already. 

Ok so here is my problem. 

Contact Form 7 allows you do enter default field information from the user's account, but right now it's only working with their name and email. The custom fields that were created with Profile Builder Pro have custom ""meta keys"" that i assigned for them. For some reason i just can get those custom fields to show up in the form's default values. 

One custom field for example: Account Number (the meta key is acct-num). 

If anyone can help me out with this it would be awesome! I could PayPal you some mula! 

Thanks"

Advice on boundaries?,thr0wx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cz7qh/my_f19_boyfriend_m22_and_his_ex_f21_are/,"I [F20] have been dating my [M22] boyfriend for about five months now. He dated his previous girlfriend for two years and she was his first everything. Because they lived on the same dorm floor both years and had the same major, classes and friends, they basically lived and worked together their entire first half of college. They started talking again a couple weeks ago when they helped each other on homework for their extremely difficult senior capstone class. After that they started scheduling study dates for their upcoming test.

That's a lot of memories and good reason to be friends, but I can't help but feel insecure. We're long distance this quarter because I took an internship 2 hours away. Their relationship ended and scarred him because she cheated on him repeatedly toward the end with her current bf, and I know she's helped another guy cheat. I don't think they would physically cheat (I'm independently somewhat friends with her), but I'm concerned he might accidentally emotionally cheat. Over the weekend I looked over his shoulder while he was texting her and read texts telling her about how he was so stressed from their upcoming midterm and a fight with his parents that he broke down in the library. He never told me about a fight and it hurt me to read her messages calming him down, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to stress him more before his midterm.

I really like him but this is my first serious relationship and I want don't want to be overly demanding. Is it appropriate, after his tests, to explain why those texts hurt me and to ask to read the rest of his other texts to her? To ask that he not study with her at her place or at his? To text me when they are together? What would your boundaries be? For people with SOs who are friends with ex-es, how do you deal with insecurity?

**tl;dr** long distance bf and his super serious ex are resuming their friendship. What are reasonable boundaries and how can I stop feeling insecure/needy?"

1d3odh,2,2013-04-25,Young White Male | Overprivileged Failure,wokeupwithaplan,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1d3odh/young_white_male_overprivileged_failure/,"I have been given every chance to succeed from a very young age. My parents have provided me with anything I've ever wanted or needed, yet I still can't seem to get off my feet. It is completely my fault. I need to change and I don't even know where to start. I have told this story in snippets to many people, picking what to tell them so that I looked like a victim. I would like to get the entire story off my chest, and admit that I am wasted potential, a coward, and a bully. Unfortunately this boils down to a very long, unedited rant. 

A little background, I quit High School at 15 in favor of staying home and playing video games for 18 hours a day. My parents supported my decision. I had mild success in a few games that led to a very small amount of recognition, which I allowed to get to my head. When I turned 18--after a very embarrassing incident with an online relationship--I realized that it was time to try to get out of the house and  get into a decent college. I went to community college for a year and finished my High School diploma there. This year is the only time in my life that I can say I performed particularly well. 

I applied to a few colleges far away from home and was accepted to all of them. I chose to attend the one that was willing to give me the biggest break on tuition. 

As soon as I got to college, the only thing that was on my mind was losing my virginity. I saw myself as being weak for being a virgin for some reason, and believed that I would be empowered if I could only convince people to have sex with me. I lost it within 2 weeks! Go team! Afterward I was completely obsessed with being in a relationship. Throughout college I found it very easy to begin relationships, but unable to hold on to them. I craved not only the attention of another person, but also their ability to legitimize or complete me. At no point did I understand how to be my own person. It was very easy for me to be the kind of person that I saw them being attracted to, allowing me to be off the hook of discovering myself. Each relationship lasted about one year each (and about 8 months longer than they should have). I held on to someone as tight as I could until they couldn't take it anymore. When it ended, I recreated myself, and moved on to the next person (usually within the span of a week). 

At the same time, my academic life was atrocious. I loved every one of my classes and felt the need to over-challenge myself. I took too many hours every semester, despite the urging of my counselor to do otherwise. Reaching my goals was not nearly as important to me as creating them. I took on tons of extra work outside of class, like journals, conferences, and other academic projects. I finished maybe a fourth of what I started. What I finished was either absolute shit, or mostly the work of others on my team. I burnt almost every bridge that I built with my work ethic, constantly making promises and deadlines that I couldn't keep (yet I still convinced people to trust me with new projects). College seemed to be a place that gave points based on perceived effort, and not a well-polished, finished product. I exploited this and graduated a semester early with a 3.6.

Directly after college I began searching for jobs in my field (as much as a humanities triple major can be called a field). The world was mine for the taking! I had a degree! After plenty of rejections, and months of unemployment (I was looking for a real job, I didn't want to be a server! And my parents were supporting me, so why not take that time to focus on the hunt!). Throughout this entire period I also had a loving girlfriend who emotionally supported me, truly believed in me and my success, and saw a future for us together (more on this later). 

After being rejected for a few career paths that I had always seen as my “calling,” I started to look at more feasible career paths, that I had recent experience in. During one summer, I had done some work tutoring/teaching underprivileged children, and I enjoyed it. I put a lot of effort into it, and I performed well with the small groups that I worked with. I entered a quick-start teaching certification program and was the happiest I have been for a long time...until that program actually started. This program was the first time I put a tremendous amount of time and effort into something and fully expected to still succeed. 

After the training period ended, I was launched into a school and I had no idea what I was doing. I was in the classroom for 4 hours, taught for 1 hour, then left for more training for another 4 hours, I went home and prepared lessons for another 3 hours. On weekends I gave myself 2-3 hours of free time, and spent the rest preparing material for my classes, practicing my lessons, and going over teaching techniques. Every class period was a disaster. I would sweat profusely, I would stutter over my words during the lesson, and I constantly felt like I was going to vomit or cry. Students took advantage of this and either did whatever they want, or push my nerves and fears as far as they could. Every technique that I had studied, practiced, and tested seemed to whirl past me while kids would throw out insults at me, get in fights, or be legitimately upset that we weren't using this time to learn. Everything seemed to move far too fast. The classroom was completely out of my control, and it was completely my fault. I was asked to leave after two and a half weeks. 

Takeaway 1: If you're in college, take every project seriously. Follow through on every promise, and be sure to do a good job. Learn how to manage your working time as efficiently as possible. Once you're in the real world no one cares how hard you worked. If you show up with a quality product, you're out.You exist to provide a service, otherwise you're useless. This may seem obvious to many, but it wasn't to me. 

Allow me to preface the next few sections with this: if you didn't think I was worthless before, allow me to prove that I am a complete scumbag. 

Throughout this period my girlfriend was completely supportive of every decision I made. She was excited that I was teaching, and understanding when it didn't work out. We had been together for almost a year at this point, and it had been a rocky one. When I graduated from college I had lost my libido, I blamed my new “less-exciting” sex life, and she blamed herself. She did everything she could to make me happy sexually, but it just wasn't working. I know now that it was my disappointment with myself, and general depression that would not allow me to perform sexually. At the time, I didn't blame her, but I didn't stop her from blaming herself. Together, we thought of ways to try to make our sex life more exciting. She would often compromise her comfort to try new things. Nothing worked, and I can only imagine the frustration she felt. This came to a head one day when I caught her masturbating in my living room. I yelled at her. I didn't care that she was masturbating in my living room, but for some reason I felt as though it was a direct insult to my manhood. At the time I felt like this was the equivalent of her telling me that I was good for absolutely nothing. I couldn't even succeed at basic biological interactions between a man and a woman. I belittled her, I cried, I said anything I could to try to embarrass her about what she had done. She went back home for the summer, but continued to love and support me. Retrospectively I've never felt worse about an action that I have taken “in the moment” in my life. 

This had all occurred before I began “teaching”, once I started working I became an insufferable ball of nerves who would lose control at his loved ones at the drop of a pin. At this point my relationship was long-distance, and once I was let go, our situation took a turn for the worse. I frustrated her to the point of tears almost every time we talked. She stopped responding to me as often, and I suggested that we take a break from talking, until she could be interested in me again. Two weeks later I met someone who seemed very interested in having me around, loved to talk to me, and was open to a sexual encounter. I called my girlfriend and broke up with her immediately. I gave her maybe five minutes on the phone. I then proceeded to have a fling with this other person. 

During this period I gained some sort of God complex. I snagged a shitty hourly job that could pay my bills, I had scored an internship at a dream job involving entry-level video game journalism (I was corresponding and writing news posts), and a bunch of people seemed willing to have casual sex with me. I felt completely on top of my shit! I even tried as hard as I could to assert a position of power over the women who were having sex with me. After all, this was my first time being outside of a committed relationship for more than a week. I boasted loudly about it at bars, to my friends, and even to any new people I met. Throughout my life I have enjoyed telling self-deprecating, and self-embarrassing stories. Now that I didn't care about the people who had sex with me, I could publicly humiliate them as well as myself. I got laughs and generally positive reactions from most of the people that I told these stories to. At no point did I consider it a problem. It was not long until this caught up with me. 

For a few months I acted like this until my ex-girlfriend came back to town. We started texting, talking, and hooking up again. I realized that I still loved her (I have since realized I may not have a proper concept of love, but instead I seem to practice entitled addiction to living human beings). She took me back, and we started to plan our future together again. Things were going great, we were finding things about each other that we never appreciated before. Our conversations was amazing, and the sex was better than anything I have had before. We seemed to finally be connecting on every level, and I had never been happier in my life. 

Remember, this is “future me” providing a retrospective. 

After an overly drunken night, I found out (by answering a text message for her) that she had been seeing someone else while we were apart. I completely lost it. I had disclosed every encounter that I had, and felt that she should have done the same. She had told me multiple times that nothing had happened while we were apart, and stuck to this story despite me finding “evidence” to the contrary. Disgusted with her, I tried to continue the relationship, but it wasn't the same as it been when we first rekindled. 

For some reason, it was at this point that I received some sort of clarity. I looked back at the way I had behaved in the last few months, the terrible way I treated those who loved me, and the way I had become a repulsive human being. I couldn't think of anything else. I got scared, and I ran. I gave two days notice at one job, told my dream job that I was having a family emergency and could no submit work for them, and told my girlfriend that I found a really great job back home and was going to pursue my future. I broke my lease, packed everything into my car and moved home. 

We broke up again later. Long distance is always hard. I blame my ex for absolutely nothing. She gave me chance after chance to prove that I could be mature, and all I did was take advantage of her kindness. I sincerely hope the next man that she is with is deserving of the title. 

Takeaway 2: Do not shit on the loved ones who consistently show that they believe in you. They are worth much more than you think they are. I don't know what else to say here. 

I've left out quite a few details—as to not identify anyone in particular—I'm sorry if this story is so long, and rough. Thank you for reading it, those of you who did. 

Fast forward to now:

I live with my parents. I spend most of my time playing video games, getting rejected from jobs, and hoping to one day create content again for a gaming website. I love to write, but the only things that have been coming out of me have been versions of this story (I realize that it boils down to a horribly written, self-pitying rant, but it's not at all indicative of what I enjoy writing). I have rewritten this story plenty of times and showed it to no one. Posting a full version of it will, hopefully, get it out of me forever, so I can move on with my life.

tl;dr 
1. I graduated college, yet developed no discernible skills because I focused on the wrong things.
2. I severely mistreat people who have nothing but love for me when I'm stressed. 
3. I want to change, but am not sure where to start."

&gt;she has woken up as well

&gt;""oh, me and your bff were super drunk and ate the rest^TeeHee

&gt;""I thought you were vegan""

&gt;""Oh, I am, I just love dairy sooooo much""

&gt;""....That's not vegan""

&gt;""I'm vegan most of the time""


You can skip this part if you'd like.  Eventually she does some FUCKED UP shit and destroys the friendship.  With me, she sleeps with my FWB (he tells the next story).  Obviously we're not in a relationship but she's in my sorority and knew for a fact that I was sleeping with him.  To me, that's a little messed up.  He didn't know we were in that organization and actually felt really bad.  Said he never would have done that had he known.  Then she really fucked up my roommate/really close friend, also in my sorority.  They have the same major and my friend was nominated for a scholarship.  She was REALLY excited because she didn't receive any scholarships because even though she had a 4.0 GPA and led a shit ton of organizations in high school, she didn't get a very good SAT score.  She would drive the hamburglar to her internship three times a week because she didn't have a car, tutored her in all of her classes, and was just insanely nice to her.  She was showing her the portfolio she was making, which was really awesome and thorough, and talking about how she needed this money really bad since she was essentially paying her tuition out of pocket.  The results for the scholarship came out.  The hamburglar got it.  She hadn't told my friend she had gotten nominated and she stole all of her ideas for her own portfolio.  I had never seen my friend cry before.  She had NEVER been stabbed in the back like this.

On to the next story, told in my former FWB's perspective

&gt;be me

&gt;just got out of a toxic open relationship

&gt;very depressed

&gt;pretty desperate for a ""repeat customer"" for sex

&gt;hamburglar has had the hots for me for awhile

&gt;kinda gross but she's nice enough and I'm desperate

&gt;start having sex

&gt;realize she's not very hygienic

&gt;she sweated A LOT during sex...as in it dripped on me constantly

&gt;smells like cheeseburgers

&gt;sex wasn't great but whatever

&gt;then one night

&gt;oh the humanity

&gt;she was drooling while on top of me

&gt;a loooong string of mucus-y drool

&gt;stretching longer and longer

&gt;oh no

&gt;shit! my mouth isn't closed

&gt;too late

&gt;it feel in my mouth

&gt;almost throw up

&gt;then she lies flat on top of me like a board

&gt;legs together

&gt;omg my dick

&gt;is she going to break it?!

&gt;hurts so bad

&gt;thank God, she finished

&gt;so terrible

&gt;so many rolls

&gt;I'm never eating a cheeseburger again

Finally, the name hamburglar got her name because my former FWB stopped sleeping with her.  Started ignoring her.  One night, he had a party and she showed up uninvited.  Around 3am he's super fucked up and decides to go to bed.  She follows him and steals his blanket.  He says ""Give that back.""  She says she will if he sleeps with her.  He says no.  A lot.  Doesn't matter.  She climbs on top of him.  He gives up and just says, defeated, ""Just do what you want.""  She does and leaves.  To me, this is sexual assault.  Takes advantage of him in his sleep.  Never reported it because...the cops probably wouldn't believe it.

Fucking fat bitch.  Again, sorry this is so long.  I've been wanting to get it out of my system for awhile."

Its gonna be long, but I have no one to talk to who can understand how I'm feeling...Sorry. 

I'm currently in my 3rd year of college majoring in engineering. These past 3 years have been brutal. I think I have anxiety issues and slight phases of depression because of what I've been through. As the semester comes to an end most of my friends have accepted internship offers, but not me. I have nothing. Then last week I was contacted by a recruiter to set up a phone interview for an internship in another state. I've been living in the same state my whole life and to have an opportunity to really work and be on my own... that'd be a dream come true. I was qualified for the position and the work was something that I've been looking to get into. To top that off I found out that I had a connection with the person interviewing me as he had been a friend of my college professor. I had this in the bag! I felt like I was Cinderella and I had found my slipper. I started looking for places to live and just couldn't stop thinking about how great this was going to be. **I was going to start my career. I was going to be happy.** A week had gone by with no notifications so I decided to email the recruiter. She told me that they've decided to only hire 1 intern. **I didn't get it and now I'm devastated.** I really had my heart set on this internship. I'm a man and I'm crying over this missed opportunity. Now I have to scramble and settle for other options that I simply don't have any interest or passion in. Why am I never good enough? Why couldn't things just go as planned? "

I'm a horrible person, I'm going to fail the eight grade for the second time, I can't get my drivers license till I'm 18, and I'm fucking fat. 

And the only thing I really care about anymore; my bmx, the back wheel broke and I don't have the money to replace it, so I have to wait a month till my birthday to get new one, which leaves me sitting around like a fatass on my computer. 

Shit, the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because of my family. When ever I get suicidal all I can think of is this time when my sister and I were watching the morning news and a kid my age wrecked a stolen car and killed himself, I think I mumbled ""I should do that"" or something similar, and she just looked at me and said ""Corbin, don't do that ever, I'd miss you too much."". As I'm writing I can't help but tear up.


I'm thinking I should just join the military or something. 


But, I also have some good things going I guess.

I'm supposed to talk to a guy about getting an internship at a computer store, maybe that can turn into something. 

I could also just power through online homeschool next school year and get my GED and go to college a year early.

I'm also starting to lose weight and not eat so much, thanks to BMXing. It just really helps me keep my head on right. That's why I've been so depressed since it broke. 

Either way, thanks for letting me rant. "

I'm taking honors courses and as many challenging courses as I can, and I get by with A's and B's, but no 4.0 GPA. Just a measly 3.4. This is because of any math courses I take. They are always far harder than any of my honors courses for me and I have to fight as hard as I can just to get by with a C and pray it doesn't accidentally drop to a D. I feel pretty powerless because there's nothing I can do to improve it because I am giving my full effort all of the time and it just eats at me that it isn't going well.

I don't feel exceptional. There is nothing about me that really stands out. I'm in 1 group, the state funded tech club, HyperStream. Maybe you've heard of it. I think it may be just in Iowa, though.

I graduated from UC Berkeley in June of 2012 with a degree in Integrative Biology and I got a job as a Clinical Research Assistant. I had planned on going back to school for Physical Therapy but I no longer wish to do so.  

**Current Employment:**

I am now working in the cosmetic industry as a Clinical Research Assistant and have been for ~7 months. I don't enjoy the work that I am currently doing--it is mundane and rote.


I've always had an interest in technology and would love to gain experience/employment doing computer programming or something related while I learn the ropes.


**Work History (recent to oldest):**

- Clinical Research Assistant 
- Administrative Assistant (on-campus work study)
- Administrative Assistant (on-campus work study)

- Completed the Codecademy course on Python.
- Currently working through the Udacity CS101 course.
- Currently working through LPTHW course.


**What I want to know:**

1. Are there internships available for people who are seeking to get into programming/developing without the skills yet?
2. What types of positions can I apply for that would allow me to get into the industry?
3. What other things can I do to make myself stand out, as someone with no actual programming skills/experience?

[457 Squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLUAeTdcc08), Ain't nobody got time for a 259 Bench, [551 Deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NokJkB7LWAM)

Bodyweight: 161

Total: 1267

Wilks: 417

Won the 165 weight class, second in the junior division, and fourth overall. 


**Meet Prep:**

I had a full six months to train for this meet, but unfortunately did not end up training for all of that time.  At the conclusion of my [last meet](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/12ben2/meet_report_nasa_iowa_regional_2012_1228_lbs_at/), although I did not mention it, I sustained a pretty serious back injury that prevented me from doing any of the competition lifts .  Naturally I did not go see a doctor and instead decided to rehab whatever was wrong with my lower back with fish oil, pulling a sled, and reverse hypers.  It worked out well and towards the end of November I could front squat pain free upwards of 95% of my 1RM ; however I still couldn't low bar 95lbs.  Bench pressing was also a no-go, but about a month after the incident of only doing dips I started floor pressing regularly and worked my way back up to higher intensities.  That continued until about mid December and ultimately my floor press maxed out at 260 (equal to my bench max) and front squats got up to 350.

Finally in mid December I low barred 405 on a whim fairly easily but really felt it the next day and decided it wasn't meant to be yet.  Enter the high bar squat.  Despite its inherent evils, high bar squats, along with front squats, made up the majority of my training as I pushed my high bar max up to 440, just shy of my then meet PR, through mid January.  At the same time, I found I could deadlift pain free and started ramping up the intensity until I hit a [520 deficit deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brMtF9WYXp4) and a [550 deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpe7b-lx-fQ).  At that time my back could finally handle sustained low bar squatting and competition style bench press.  

Considering how my squat had stalled prior to my injury, this go-around I decided to try out a bit of an auto-regulated block periodized training cycle for squat and bench press; deadlifts were more focused on RFD to focus on my speed off the floor to my knees which has always been lacking and used typical Westside rep schemes but without accommodating resistance which is wholly unnecessary given my strength on the lockout.  Based on how I felt that day, I would work up to a daily max (usually around 415 for squat and 235 for bench) and then do my work sets which ranged from 3-6 sets for 5-10 reps.  That may not seem like high volume for an accumulation phase, but for somebody who was used to doing singles, it was pretty freaking hard.  

That continued until about a month and a half out from competition where I then transitioned to more of an intensification cycle with a similar number of sets, but fewer reps at higher intensities to focus on pure strength and that was then followed by a transition to a realization period where I really upped the weights and hit [this sweet 465 squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWTf0MjkCn8).  Unfortunately the final two weeks before the competition really stuck it to me with exams and lab reports and I didn't lift at all the final eight days before the meet which proved to be a detriment on competition day.  On top of that, this entire semester I've been waking up at 4:30 five days a week for my internship with the S&amp;C department, so the early mornings coupled with the late nights really did a number on me that week.  On the bright side, I was down to 160 the day of weigh ins without cutting because I didn't have time to eat.  

**Meet Day:**

Definitely felt the week lay-off I took.  Everything on my back past 315 felt twice as heavy as normal, but it started to feel better the more I warmed up.  The sweet, sweet nectar of the gods, Jack3d, also helped.  Just based on my force-velocity curve for squats, everything past a certain weight looks like the same speed despite the weight.  Thus the relatively smooth looking 457 in the video, but the 468 I called for on my third going absolutely nowhere.  

408, 457, 468(X)

Bench...meh.  Volume training really didn't seem to do anything for me and it was just a so-so day but the weights felt good.

231, 248, 259

Deadlift felt freaking awesome on warm ups.  Everything was fast and strong.  I am really used to Eleiko bars though and the Texas Deadlift Bars really tore up my hands (first world problems...).  My opener felt strong as shit but it ripped a bunch of skin off my thumbs.  I taped up for my second attempt at 551 and got to about the knees before the tape ripped.  Holy mother of god, never again.  Instantly dropped it when the tape ripped without even having time to think about what I was doing.  At that point I was pretty pissed because I knew I was good for more, but didn't want to attempt something and fail and walk away with just a 496 deadlift so I called for 551 again, packed the holes in my thumbs with chalk and pulled that son of a bitch to lockout.

496, 551(X), 551

**Thoughts Going Forward:**

It would have been the bee's knees to total 1300, but I ended up being about 11lbs short on each lift, so maybe in July.  That being said, 1267 at 165 is good enough to qualify as Candidate for Master of Sport according to the Sheiko guy, so that's pretty neat.  475 on squat and 570 on deadlift are the two big training goals of this next cycle and I do think they are attainable.  I'm not sure what the plan for bench is yet, but I'll figure something out.  Given how well my squat and deadlfit both responded to the quad work I got front squatting (something I think a lot of powerlifters are lacking, myself included), this accumulation cycle is going to feature a lot of front squats, RFE split squats, and eccentric portions to really bolster my quad strength as well as a bigger focus on hamstring strength with RDLs and GHRs due to their relative weakness to my erectors.

It's bleeding over into my clinical work.  I dread the days that I have to go and see my clients, despite really enjoying my clients and feeling like we are making progress.  I find myself hoping that people don't show for appointments, and I just don't think it should be like that.

I posted a question a few weeks back about listing my shadowing experience on the application and received a few great answers (most of them suggesting that I group everything together in one slot).  However, I am still having some difficulties with this... 

I shadowed a few physicians here and there (ophthalmologist, ID internist, and soon to be Cardiologist) but I think that so far it only totals to about 20 hours.  I am planning on shadowing another internist soon and maybe another specialty if I can manage.  That alone sounds pretty minuscule and it is probably about 10% of my shadowing experience.  My other shadowing experiences occurred through my volunteer experiences...

1) About 20 physicians in a medical clinic abroad(internists, EM docs, peds, oncologist, etc. NOT in their normal setting) for about 50 hours 

2) 1 family doc and 1 N.P in a local clinic while I volunteered (hours unknown since it varied if they would allow me to go in for certain procedures and consultations)

3) Some ER docs, Radiologists, and OB/GYNS at a local hospital through my internship.  Again, my internship is not geared toward shadowing but shadowing is a reward that I get every once in awhile.  Probably totaling to 20 hours right now.

Do you guys suggest that I still try to group this all under one section or do you think I should take a sentence or two in each area to briefly mention my shadowing experience?  I am okay with taking out the ophthalmology, ID internist, and cardiology experiences if it would just be a waste to use a whole slot on this without merging everything together.  

This may seem silly but I am truly having a hard time with Work/Activities section.  My concern is that I really don't want to list out every single physician and most importantly I don't want to fall into the trap of repeating myself on the application.

Thanks so much for all your help! "

###GREG NELSON FOR SPORTS ILLUSTRATED

(1/3)

---

**PICTURE A** parking lot in a small Texas town in the early 1990s, heat curling up from the blacktop like incense from an altar, a few dozen fans watching a crew-cut assistant coach named Gregg Popovich patiently explain the rudiments of basketball. Accompanying Popovich on this annual San Antonio Spurs Caravan are a future star, Sean Elliott; a strangely coiffed center, Dwayne Schintzius; and the Spurs' mascot, called, for obvious reasons, the Coyote.

It is difficult to reconcile that man with the Popovich we know now: impatient, vibrating with energy, eager to get on with it, the Popovich whose Spurs began their 16th straight postseason appearance on Sunday with a 91-79 win over the Lakers. The late, great Schintzius's mullet alone might have prompted Popovich to start kicking cones and get in the faces of potential ticket buyers-to ""go Serbian,"" as Popovich himself describes the cyclone of anger that sometimes engulfs him. Do you hear what I'm telling you about the rocker step? Do you really want to be a season-ticket holder?

But that was a different era, before the Spurs were four-time champions, before they put up 14 straight 50-win seasons (which would be 16 if not for the labor strife of 1998-99), before they routinely sold out the 18,581-seat AT&amp;T Center, before Popovich was a two-time Coach of the Year, before he was elevated to team president as well as coach (""The buck stops with him,"" says general manager R.C. Buford) and before Pop joined Magic and Larry as one-named NBA entities.

Popovich is the sometimes snarling face of that rare Model Franchise, known for winning, consistency, brand loyalty and a penchant for keeping controversy (hell, keeping almost everything) in-house. Pop has sent forth many of his loyal flock to positions of prominence around the NBA-having been part of the Larry Brown coaching tree, Popovich now has a tree of his own-and most continue to abide at least partly by this code of omerta.

Certainly that is true of Sam Presti, who began as an intern with San Antonio and is now general manager of the Thunder, the team that knocked off the Spurs in last year's conference finals and finished two games ahead of them in the West this season. During an interview about his mentor, Presti jumped off and on the record like a guy adjusting the temperature of the shower, not because he was saying anything remotely controversial but because he didn't want Pop to think he was talking out of turn by dispensing fulsome compliments. Presti mentioned that the coach had bought a book for him recently, but after some deliberation he decided he couldn't divulge the title. ""In some way,"" says Presti, sheepish, ""I guess I'm still wearing those Spurs stripes.""

While affection for this master of mystery is hardly universal, there is a grudging respect in most quarters-including that quarter at 51st Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City. Popovich and NBA commissioner David Stern have had a couple of well-publicized battles over the coach's decision to rest key players on road trips, the last one (after Pop sent Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker home from a nationally televised TV game in Miami on Nov. 29) resulting in a $250,000 fine to the franchise. ""I have always enjoyed my personal interactions with Pop,"" says Stern. ""He brings an extraordinary worldview to the NBA.""

Parsing Stern (which, admittedly, can be treacherous), one sees intent in his choice of ""worldview."" True, a certain Belichickian atmosphere hangs over the Republic of Pop, where the Spurs consider league rules governing media access to be the most casual of suggestions and where the statement ""Tim Duncan will not be available today"" circulates on an endless loop. But one also discovers a certain charm within the Republic of Pop, stemming largely from the antic disposition of its ruler. ""I offer this with hesitation,"" says Jeff McDonald, who has been on the Spurs beat for the San Antonio Express-News for six years, ""but when you cover Pop, there's a kind of Stockholm syndrome. You start to feel affection for your captor.""

Popovich is described by all who know him well as smart, funny, compassionate and even warm. Indeed, upon revisiting with the man after a yearslong absence, it was disconcerting to be given a sincere bro-hug even as you knew he wished you were climbing on the first plane out of San Antonio International. ""If it doesn't fit the mission,"" says Hall of Fame center David Robinson, who joined the Spurs in 1989, when Popovich was one of Brown's assistants, ""Pop just doesn't care about it.""

One thing that almost never fits the mission is talking to sideline reporters during games, an NBA-mandated task for head coaches. That difficult assignment has fallen most memorably on TNT's fascinatingly coutured Craig Sager, whose give-and-take with Pop has produced much outstanding theater. ""I try to ask questions that he can't answer yes or no, "" says Sager, ""but that usually doesn't work out. 'What are your impressions of the first quarter?' I might ask, and Pop says, 'None.' Or I'll ask, 'How come you're getting outrebounded?' and he'll say, 'What do want me to do? Get rid of players during the game? Send them to the D-League?'""

On one occasion, Sager saw Pop before the game looking even more out-of-sorts than usual.  ""You look like your dog died,"" Sager said, to which Pop responded: ""Actually, that's exactly what happened."" The reporter whipped out his notebook to get details, but an alarmed Popovich stopped him. ""You mention that on the air,"" he said, ""and I'll wake up tomorrow morning with a thousand dogs on my front step.""

Still, Sager, like most people in the press, feels some level of affection for him: ""People will ask me, 'Isn't Gregg Popovich a jerk?' and I say, 'Actually, he's one of the greatest in any sport.'"" Pop knows just how far to push the jerk thing; even as he's jawing at Sager, he's liable to reach over and wipe sweat onto Sager's pocket handkerchief, which has happened on at least one occasion.

All that makes San Antonio's only major sports franchise a ""culture""-Pop Culture, if you will. ""Whenever I talk to players on other teams about certain situations,"" says Spurs guard Ginobili, ""what I end up hearing is, 'Yeah, but you're on the Spurs.' They mean, 'Okay, you'll figure it out and go on winning.'""

For 16 years now, keeping Duncan happy and healthy has been at the top of Pop's mission list. Pop and Tim: tough and steadfast, different sides of the same coin, the Auerbach and Russell of the modern NBA. Pop is one of the few subjects the Big Fundamental will talk about without looking like someone is torturing him with thumbscrews. ""Pop has always taken care of me, whether I knew it or not,"" says Duncan. ""Pop has been a mentor for me, a father figure. I know it's incredibly rare. And I know I'm lucky to have it.""

Yes, Popovich has come a long way: from the man Elliott thought was ""a typical jarhead,"" when he got a load of Pop's crew cut and his hard-charging ways on those hot afternoons in towns like Eagle Pass and Del Rio, to someone Elliott now describes as ""kind of a Renaissance man,"" his tutor on matters both cinematic and oenophilic. Back in the Caravan days, Pop and Elliott were San Antonio's version of Siskel and Ebert, debating movies on a local TV channel. While Pop recommended titles such as Francois Truffaut's 400 Blows -""He liked anything that was obscure, had subtitles and nothing happened,"" says Elliott-the player tended to go Schwarzeneggerian. ""If it had Arnold shooting a gun or somebody crashing a car,"" says Pop, ""Sean was sure to give it an A."" But as the years have rolled on, Elliott finds himself gravitating to independent films. ""Pop's influence,"" he says, shrugging his shoulders.

Pop's knowledge of wine is the best-known personal fact about him: his part ownership of the Oregon-based A to Z Wineworks, his 3,000-bottle home wine cellar, the staggering sums he has spent on wines, and the disquisitions on Brunellos and Malvasias that have fallen on deaf ears when he takes his staff out to dinner on the road, an inviolate ritual. ""I used to like all these Australians and California Cabs,"" says Elliott, ""and now I'm Old World. That's Pop again.""

His sophistication goes well beyond the grape. Popovich talks to Serbian players in their native language; reads the Russian writers Dostoyevsky, Turgenev and Lermontov (in English); has begun collecting rare first editions; counts among his friends one of the top scholars of Swedish history and politics in the U.S.; and makes his restaurant choices by, as he puts it, ""triangulating"" information in Travel + Leisure, Conde Nast Traveler, Decanter and Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report.Popovich also owns up to being a political liberal, which gives an interesting edge to conversations with his old buddies on the Air Force Academy endowment committee and with Spurs owner Peter Holt, a GOP contributor.

Oh, yes. Pop was also Larry Brown's best man."

I appreciate having different perspectives other than my own to weigh in on this.

EDIT 2: Thank you all for your input. I know I said it in the first edit, but really, I didn't expect such a response. You are all really awesome, and I'm trying to keep up with the comments. I won't be on much longer she gets out of work soon just so you all know. I will update when I get a chance after that. Thanks again..

EDIT 3: I'm going to leave my apartment and go to my campus for now to keep updating. I don't want to be home when she gets out of work. It's about a 15 minute commute. 

**UPDATE (6:47pm local time): We talked after she got out of work. She was in tears and explained to me how bad she wants me to be there and that she needs a lot of reassurance given how bad our past has been and that every time I say I'm serious I leave when things go bad. 

I told her I want to be with her and that I want to do my best, but I can't dish out reassurance if she won't accept what I can give. Example: She wanted me to drive her somewhere just now, but wouldn't get in my car until I went over to her car and shut it off and made her get in mine. I can do that, but I told her I can't when I fear being hit, or insults are being thrown around. 

Her promise is that she won't be violent with me, she just wants reassurance. Also, as a last note she said she *cannot* handle me doing my internship. I only have until Monday and she says there is no way she can feel better about it to let me do it. She doesn't think I can be with her if I'm not living with her at this time. 

Thanks for the continued support you guys, you are all really caring individuals and I really want to extend my humble thanks for all your comments.**

Hello r/relationship_advice and thank you for looking it means a lot to me. 

My girlfriend and myself are in a really difficult situation. Our relationship has been a roller-coaster ride. We have had serious problems with sex, arguing and to an extent physical violence.

Right now where we stand is that my girlfriend feels I don't value her/her feelings/her priorities. I have a really hard time with conflict. Most people either have that fight/flight response and I have more of a ""freeze"" response. I literally shut down when an argument starts and I'm unable to think clearly or what I would do if I wasn't in that situation, or in her shoes. 
  
We have talked many times about what she values, here is a brief list of her needs

* 1) Never leave during an argument
* 2) Never go to bed if we're not ok.
* 3) Never go to bed alone. 
* 4) Doing things on my own (Not asking for her help during an argument)
* 5) Don't argue her feelings, try to make her feel better.

We also have problems with where we are in our relationship; she has been ready for a more serious commitment since at least last March, while I'm not there yet. This has been a source of conflict for a long time. She feels I haven't expressed my affection in a way that is committed or lasting. My girlfriend values material things more than I thought she did when we started dating, she is bothered that I haven't gotten her many possessions over our relationship. 

All of our problems have been building and I haven't been able to be better. Now I have an internship offer that requires me to temporarily relocate and our relationship can't handle it. I have no idea how to get past our problems because I always let her down because I can't keep to her needs. 

I love her, I don't want to lose her, she is so unhappy and so am I and I have no idea what to do. I have no idea how to get past our past problems (the violence has really stuck with me) and make her happy. I feel like a bad person because she talks a lot about how other people in her life are getting married and their boyfriends don't let them down like I do. 

I don't want to make any excuses anymore, I want to be a better person. Any advice is appreciated.

tl;dr 

Me and my girlfriend are on the verge of breaking up at the moment because of a lot of built up issues and I'm offered an internship that requires me to relocate temporarily that I have to respond to by Monday. She feels her needs aren't being met and she puts herself down if she stays with me. 

Thank you for reading, I apologize if I'm disorganized I never talk to anyone about anything so I'm not sure what to say.

1d4w3z,2,2013-04-26,Recent Journalism grad about to start freelance and need some advice!,FelixFelicis04,freelanceWriters,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/1d4w3z/recent_journalism_grad_about_to_start_freelance/,"Hello,

Like the title says, I am a recent Honours BA Journalism graduate and I've been looking around for jobs the past few months and a lot of the full time jobs say I still need about 3+ years experience...meaning I haven't found many entry level positions, except internships and I've already done two of them and can't afford to be doing anymore free work. 

Anyway, I came across a job as a blogger for a company. They want me to send in samples of my work, resume and cover letter (no problem). However, they also asked for me to give my expected pay rate. I honestly have no idea what to say, as I have never done this before. I don't want to ask for too much but I also don't want to ask for too little. The blog length according to the ad says 500-750 words and I would be writing 1-2 blog posts per week and I would be getting paid per blog. The ad also says their payscale is on par with other industry blogs and bloggers.

Given my experience as a Journalism student, two internships (both had lots of writing and all online published work) and I do keep my own blog, what would be a decent asking rate?

Thank you!

1d4sn4,2,2013-04-25,"Fuck you, TBDBITL, fuck you.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1d4sn4/fuck_you_tbdbitl_fuck_you/,"First, I'd like to thank those of you who actually take the time to read this, but I know it is a long post so I understand if you don't.  There's a tl;dr provided at the bottom for your convenience.

Next, a little background: next week I'll be finishing up my 3rd year at The Ohio State University.  Every summer thus far, I've worked my ass off and auditioned for The Best Damn Band In The Land, the OSU Marching Band.  And every summer thus far, I've been cut on make-the-band night.

My first year being cut, I thought to myself, ""Hey, that's ok.  Almost everyone gets cut their first year.  I'll just come back next year and I'll make it in with no problem!""  I kept positive.  I didn't let it bother me; on the contrary I was proud to say that I auditioned for that band, and that I knew by name many of the people in it.

The next year, I just got really sad after being cut.  My girlfriend made it in for her rookie year on mellophone (also a second-time auditionee), and I felt just a tad inadequate.  But still, I got over it in time because I truly felt that there wasn't anyone that got in the band than whom I was better, plus my girlfriend was in the best damn band in the land!

Last summer, however, was a different story.  I had a veteran member (my girlfriend) close to me that I could look to for advice, and that helped a lot.  I started to get a bit braver during rehearsals and actually ask my squad leaders for advice.  During tryouts, I was absolutely kicking ass.  I'd never felt that good.  But still, come make-the-band night, my name wasn't on the list.  This time I wasn't sad.  I was *angry*.  Nobody gets cut 3 years in a row, and I knew in my heart that I was better than most of the other candidates, plus I'd auditioned on as many instruments as I could (trombone, bass trombone, baritone, and mellophone).

This angry/sad feeling remained with me for the better part of the first semester of the year.  I'd joined the university athletic band as a mellophone player to help me prepare for my audition at the Bluecoats in November, so I was constantly crossing paths with members of the marching band, many of whom knew how many times I'd been cut so it was kind of awkward passing them in the halls.  I was up late at night just crying into my pillow because I still truly believed that I should have been in that band.  At football games I would refuse to cheer them on unless it was something *really* cool or if I knew my girlfriend had a specific part so I could watch her.

And then the Bluecoats audition came.  I went up to Canton with my mellophone and music, spent the weekend in a high school gym, and had a truly fantastic time.  I learned a *ton* about playing mellophone (which I'd only just picked up last summer).  But, in the end, I was not offered a callback.  But this sat ok with me since I knew I was brand new to the instrument, and I'd be coming back for one more year next fall.  When I returned, I was suddenly cured of all of my animosity toward my school's marching band.  I was able to stand tall again: I'd just auditioned for one of the best marching music organizations in the world, and was almost good enough to get in!  The rest of the semester was wonderful; I began to socialize more in the athletic band now that it was more than a tool of preparation for the Bluecoats, and since the marching band season was coming to a close, I even had my girlfriend back.

This relative euphoria lasted pretty regularly through the winter.  Occasionally I'd see a band member walking around campus and I'd give them a subtle glare, but besides that I was generally happy again, and I didn't really have to think about the band at all.

But now it's coming back to summer time again, and I'm going to have to start preparing for this year's tryouts.  I've been getting a bit antsy about it recently, but I've generally been able to keep my mind off of it, what with classwork, my job, and looking for a local internship this summer.  Unfortunately, though, these thoughts came swelling up tonight while I was studying with my girlfriend.  The conversation went something like this:

----------------------

Me: ""You still have your band uniform?  Are you supposed to?""

GF: ""No.  I think I was supposed to take it back in January or something...""

Me: ""Sounds like my mellophone.  They haven't come after me for it, so I'm keeping it - hopefully through the summer.""

GF: ""You're going to do the 3 instrument thing again?  That didn't work last time.""

Me: ""Yeah, I know.  But I really enjoy playing mellophone, plus I want to be as proficient as I can be on it when I audition for the Bluecoats this November.""

GF: ""If you want to get into the band here first, you'll have to spend all of your time marching, and not as much playing, especially if you're as solid as you say on trombone and baritone.""

Me: ""I know for a fact that I will have free time this summer regardless of whether or not I keep learning mellophone.  I can fill that with one of two things: marching practice, or time to myself.  If I fill it with marching, great!  I'll get more practice in.  If I fill it with time to myself, well I know for another fact that I wouldn't have filled my mellophone practice time with marching either.""

GF: ""But you'll need all of the marching you can get to make it in the band.  That's been your problem for these last 3 years.""

Me: ""I realize that.  But you're forgetting one thing: I like playing mellophone.  We'll start the summer off with both trombone and baritone, and we'll see what my free time looks like.  If I don't have much and I'm not marching as much as I should be, I'll drop mello and focus entirely on marching and trombone.  Until then, I'm going to practice mellophone.""

GF: ""Just remember that it didn't work last year.""

Me: ""Yes, I know.  But I'm going to do it anyway.""

-----------------------

Looking back on it, I know she's right, but simply seeing her band uniform and noticing all of the tbdbitl merchandise and memorabilia on her walls brought back all of the feelings that I'd been able to keep locked away inside for the entire semester.  I was able to spit out a sharp ""good night"" to her before leaving.  It wasn't until I got to my car that it actually hit me that I was suddenly very angry at all things marching band.  I hate being angry.  I'm normally the happiest, most optimistic person I know, and angriness really puts a damper on that.  I thought I'd gotten (mostly) over this whole thing after the Bluecoats, but apparently not.

I don't know what to do now.  I mean, I've worked long and hard enough that there's no way in hell I'm going to give up on the marching band, but I really don't know if there's a way I'll be able to make it through the summer and maintain my sanity.  I made a post in /r/angry last August the night I got cut, but didn't find out about this subreddit until only a little while ago.  I wish I'd have know then, I feel like I would have actually gotten some feedback and felt better about myself rather than just venting to my keyboard.

TL;DR: I've been cut 3 times from the OSU marching band.  I'm unbelievably angry about it now, and I don't know what to do."

1d845g,2,2013-04-27,My [30m] relationship with [26f] of 2 years is on the rocks and I don't know what to do.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1d845g/my_30m_relationship_with_26f_of_2_years_is_on_the/,"I feel like I'm losing my mind.  We can't make it a full week without arguing about something and I love her to death but feel like I'm giving and giving without getting anything in return.

Whenever we discuss things about her life (work, school, etc) I will always try to enthusiastically support her.  In some cases she tends to be overly dramatic on the situation (I am definitely the optimist of the relationship) and when I offer a point she disagrees with it's greeted by this horrible look on her face and I'm then told that I have an ""agenda"" or that I'm trying to push her into doing something she doesn't want.

THis is completely untrue, and I've tried evaluating how I say things numerous times to see if I could come of more tame on the subject, but I honestly don't feel as though I'm being aggressive.  I feel as though I'm going crazy and I always get depressed when it happens because I feel as though we're supposed to be a team but I always feel like the enemy.

I'm also going to be supporting her as she is approaching a point in her life where she has to quit her job for an internship.  As it is now, the house I own costs $1,100 a month not including any utilities.  I am paying that, all utilities, and her phone bill and in return charging her $600 a month.  We both feel that is fair, and prior to that I only charged her $400 a month when she was down on her luck.  Now, as we talk about lowering her rent again, I'm being told that I tend to sway back and forth and I get the sense she is doubting me.

Again, her doubting me is horribly painful as I already feel like I'm being overly accomodating while being under appreciated.  I do admit there was a vacation we went on where I thought we were splitting up the hotel bill differently and I think it pissed her off which she is still holding on to resentment to.

Finally, just recently I admittadly pulled a dick move.  There's a female friend of mine that I had previously fooled around with years ago.  We remained friends ever sense but we have an emotional connection (completely platonic) due to being in similar lines of work and having similar interests.  I know this girl is threatening to my gf and I agreed not to let it be an element in our relationship.  Well I broke and started emailing her secretly and the gf found them.  They were from months ago and there was only a small handful, and nothing inappropriate was said in them, but I did lie to her in the fact I told her I wouldn't communicate with this person.  This has led to severe mistrust which hurts because I could never fathom cheating on her.  

I am completely lost and just overall feeling depressed.  Today is beautiful out and I asked her if we could just spend the day being happy together and working on things but she unfortunately had plans to see her mom and told me she'd ""play it by ear"" for later.  I feel nothing but coldness from her at the moment and I don't know what to do.

Am I being overly sensitive on all of this?  Or maybe I'm just clueless to my own actions that are pissing her off.   Either way I am unhappy and just want things to be normal.

TL;DR:  Relationships suck"
1d7s2k,1,2013-04-27,"Been reading books for 3 year, met intern who is a PUA, finally took the leap! How to advance?",gosurobber,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1d7s2k/been_reading_books_for_3_year_met_intern_who_is_a/,"Wow, I just want to say it feels so liberating and addictive. New intern came (my age too, 24 years old), and by some stroke of luck I have PM'd him a long time ago on some forum about a PUA seminar he gives.  He found out when we exchanged numbers during lunch.

So, my first guided tour was after work, and I opened 4 girls (I do have AA, but I am quite used to interviewing people due to my job).

Of course, no #-closes but it feels fantastic to finally do it instead of keep glancing at the girl while she disappears from my life.

PUA-intern wasnt free after that, so for the past 2 days I went out myself to just approach girls having watched the lessons on SimplePickup. Previously I have been reading Mystery Method and I do agree with some concepts but it seems like alot of people are recommending a direct ""you are cute"" style. 

I approached 5 girls today (could have been a few more but I had sudden AA due to distance) and I realize I suck at conversation. I opened with ""Hi, you are cute so I had to talk to you"" but after asking their name, I just totally forget how to direct the conversation. I tried to address my shortcomings during the end of today's session but I totally screwed it up.

I opened a HB7 wearing a tube giving out fliers, and (only students do this kind of job) so after introductions I made a statement that she looked like a student on a part time job. It was true but boring as shit, and initially I wanted to talk random stuff (if you are a video game character, would you choose to have better weapons or armour?) but I forgot and straight away asked her what time she knocked off and if she wants to go on a date, which she rejected. At this point, another mistake was not staying longer to chat and I bid her farewell immediately.

Another approach today was even worse, I opened a HB6 and after introductions, I just said thanks and walked off. FAIL man, fail.

Do you guys have any tips on being good at talking random stuff? And and paths of learning progress that I can take?

TLDR; Introvert dude finally takes leap. Found it addiciting but suck at conversation. He also feels slightly horrible when blown off but all is better when he recalls seeing his own experienced friends and youtube PUA getting blown off too."

I am finishing my engineering degree about 1,000 miles away from my hometown. We met while I was working for a local firm and living with my family. I made it clear to her that I was not looking for anything serious. We got along really well and ended up spending a lot of time together over the summer.  

She's never really left the state, considers herself to be an aspiring artist and works full-time (for basically min. wage) as a florist. 
I've done a fair amount for my age: took 4 years off between high school and uni to work and travel.

Despite my initial hesitation, I decided to bring her with my on my end-of-summer road/hiking trip.  The trip went amazing.  I've heard the relationship advice: ""take her in the woods for a week and see what happens. that is a true test.""  Well for someone who has never camped really, she climbed some 14,000 ft peaks like a boss. 

Anyway, the day before I'm leaving town to return to school, she asks me with teary eyes if I'll wait for her (not sleep with anyone) until Xmas.   I can't say no to that face.  I try to pretend it's what I want too but I've told her it's not.  Anyway, we make it through. 

Fast forward to present and I'm about to move to a new state to start a 3 month engineering internship. She really wants to come and live with me so that we can be together physically.  I personally think that it is a bad idea for her to quit her job and move to a new place with nothing lined up.  She has bills to pay...

I like this girl a lot but I am not in love with her.  I think she's super sweet and has such innocence.  I am somewhat of a loner and like my solitude.  Assuming she can find a job, I know that we can make the summer work and that I can show her a really enjoyable time.  However, I will be leaving again (out of country) to finish the last year of my degree and I don't really want to spend another year in a distance relationship.  I really detest distance relationships... I think we should cultivate relationships with those physically present. 

Lastly, I am the center of my own universe and when I graduate, I don't really want to have to consider anyone else but myself in determining where I go and what I do (my job prospects are good). 

Should I split up with her now to avoid breaking her heart in August???
I care about her but I think she's a lot more serious than I am..."

So I am a computer engineering major and about a month and a half ago I got this amazing internship.  I can't go into detail or anything because of NDA stuff, but I can say this: It is a small startup, I feel like I am making stuff from a sci-fi movie, and it is amazing.

So anyway, I've been working there for ~1.5 months and I've been very successful.  Today they hired another Intern to work in the same area I am working in.  My boss and some of my co-workers gave the intern was given a basic overview of the system he will be designing and gave him a recommendation of parts.  My boss then told him to go research the parts in detail, look at ones offered by competitors, and to work on fleshing out the design.  

My boss asked me to go to him at the end of the day and to look over his work.  All he had done was redraw what we gave him earlier nicely on the computer.  When I asked him for details about the chips or how parts worked, he had no idea.  He did not research any other parts, how he was going to implement the software, or anything really.  I honestly have no clue what he did all day.

And that is what I told my boss.  Based off of my observations y boss fired the intern and now I feel like a dick.  


tl;dr: Told boss a new hire wasn't doing good work when asked, he was sacked, I feel like a dick."

I have worked hard my whole life.  I came from a poor family with an abusive father, yet managed to go to college and get a degree in an area I'm passionate about.  I have worked retail jobs since 15.  Currently i work at a bakery and I enjoy my mediocre living.  I just finished an internship at a great PR company. Bf is a stoner computer geek from a well to do family. Not to say I don't appreciate him. I adore him.  He just got his A.A. and got a job at a Microsoft data center through his brother's connections.  He works hard and is well respected.  He makes a little more than me but that's not an issue.  That is where we are. Then this happens:

I just got to second round interviews with a well reputed PR agency, but didn't get the job.  He is about to have a second interview for a HUGE promotion.  It would mean this gap in our success would grow so big.  I hate to admit it, but I am so angry.  I am happy that he is doing so well, but i keep spinning my wheels and all his goals are being given to him on a platter.  

How can I support him when I am feeling so...left behind?  I want to be successful, pay off my debt, and spoil him.  But now I barely get by and all the doors are slamming in my face.  I know I should be happy, but I'm just sad.  Thanks for reading.

1d71zm,3,2013-04-26,Please help me solve my never-ending quarter life crisis.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1d71zm/please_help_me_solve_my_neverending_quarter_life/,"Ladies, I'm on the verge of having a late night career/life crisis/first world problem panic attack, and I need you to talk me down from the ledge (and possibly offer some useful advice).

I graduated about 5 years ago from an excellent (if not very top tier) liberal arts college, with a degree only slightly better than an English major, and not in anything I want to pursue for a career.

With no other plans straight out of college, I decided to move to another state to be closer to my then-boyfriend, whom I'd been dating long-distance for two years. We lived together and dated for two more before splitting up, and in that time, I worked for a coffee shop and then more long-term as an administrative assistant for a non-profit where I was very unhappy, but at least way more employed and salaried than most other people I knew who graduated into the shitstorm that was the 2008 economy. I quit that job after a little over a year, when they decided the physical office needed to be relocated to a place that would've stuck me with a ~90 minute commute each way, and after that I never found another job in that state. I did a brief stint in massage school, which I liked, but quit half way through the program because I hated living there and the relationship didn't work out. I moved back in with my parents and decided not to finish the program because in the first state, a massage license only takes 6 months, and in the state I moved home to, it takes two years. I didn't love massage enough or think the likely earnings would be worth staying in school for that long.

I've always been a writer in one way or another, so I decided to try my hand at that, working my way up through internships and eventually landing a paid part-time position as an assistant editor for a small arts newspaper. After a year and a half, the company I was getting most of my work from (the arts paper) sort of went underwater, there were NO opportunities for growth, I was making virtually nothing, and my bosses were possibly clinically insane, so when I heard about an opportunity to be a regularly paid barista, I took it. I worked my way quickly up to supervisor, and did that mostly full time for over a year. During that time, I even got a few other freelance writing gigs on the side, some of which were for well-known tabloids and paid very well, and I got a second interview at a major tabloid, but didn't get the job. I was also doing some freelance online tutoring, which paid ok but annoyed me because the volume of work was inconsistent -- it'd be dead for weeks, and then a ton of stuff would come up EXACTLY when I had the least time to get it done -- so I can still do that part-time if I want, but I've been on hiatus for a while, still in good standing with the company.

(Also I should mention that I have always filled my resume gaps with volunteer non-profit work, so there's some experience there as well, particularly with women's health and the arts. But as far as I can tell, I love volunteering at non-profits but hate the actual experience of working at them, at least in any kind of fundraising or general administrative capacity.)

After almost 5 years of being all over the place, I finally have a full time job that pays *kind* of decently and comes with overtime and benefits, and for the time being, I really like it. The stuff I see at work is VERY interesting and not something I would ever see anywhere else, so it's going to give me a lot of material when I write my memoir someday, but my talents go completely un-utilized. A sober monkey with a clean driving record could do what I do, except when the phone rings I guess, and there is absolutely no room for growth in this field unless I get a license I don't want, to do work I don't like, for not very much of a raise.

My parents are academics, and they keep saying I should just ""get a graduate degree,"" which they would pay for, but they never say in *what* and I'm SO not keen on having them support me for the next several years while I work on that. And while I know lots of people work full time and make grad school happen, that idea scares the shit out of me, especially when it's just this vague notion of going to school for I have no idea what and I'm not that excited about it. The two options that sort of stick out in my head if I DID go to school are Journalism school, which has NO guarantees, and becoming a Physical Therapist, which would take me like 5-6 years or so.

I loved working at the coffee shop, because I loved the non-stop action, being face to face and chatting with other people all the time, and I loved being on my feet and not having to constantly worry that I'd re-gain the 30 lbs I lost after my breakup. I loved working as a journalist too, but is a graduate degree in journalism really worth anything? And if not, how else does one go about finding a decent paying job in the field? Because that's another thing, the same parents putting all this pressure on me to go back to school are also the ones who raised me with a ridiculously high standard of living which I would love to maintain for myself but really have no clue how. I hate myself for being spoiled and privileged and I want to earn my own place in the world, but I don't know what to do next, and I'm closer to 30 than 20 and I want to scream.

My big fantasy is that I work another 6 months at this job so that it's an even year, then hop on a plane to Southeast Asia, wander the world for 6-12 months on the cash I've saved up this year (I'm living at home with my parents and saving a fortune), and then either I come back and everything has magically worked itself out, or I just never come back because I found my island paradise or whatever shit. This part is also hard because leaving for that long would mean leaving behind my loving current boyfriend of 2 years, who is in about the same career shape as me, except with no money or parents to fall back on. POOR ME BOO HOO WAH MY LIFE IS SO HARD.

Please help. And please don't berate me for being a poor little rich girl, because I already know and that only makes me feel more anxious and awful about myself. Just tell me what to do to feel like my life is kind of in order? That's impossible isn't it. But I mean, just try? Please?

**TL;DR: Poor little rich girl (26yo) having a panic attack about becoming an adult. Please help.**

1d6t5w,2,2013-04-26,Internship housing help!,HellooooNewman,SanJose,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/1d6t5w/internship_housing_help/,"Hello, I am posting this for my cousin in Michigan is busy with finals to look for a place to stay while he has an internship in San Jose. I have looked for the last couple of weeks and I've had a hard time finding anywhere close to viable. Any help, whether it be tips on housing, transportation, or anything that would help him would be greatly appreciated. 

Here are some points of his situation:

* Internship is in the Edenvale area of San Jose
* Bike distance &lt; 30 minutes, bus &lt;1 hr, walking &lt; 30 minutes - He won't have a car so he needs to be somewhat close to the Edenvale area
* He's ok with having roommates
* Internship start date May 21, 2013 and flying in May 13-15 and he said he'll probably be working there till December
* Contract: month to month (preferred) or 3-month
* Max rent per month: $1500 with base utilities
* Somewhat furnished would be nice, but not necessary

I realize these are pretty lofty goals when it comes to housing in that area, but he's not having any luck and it's coming down to the wire and he needs to find something as soon as possible. Hopefully since you guys know the area you may have some insight. Any info would be helpful. He may be able to live at SJSU for the summer, but will still need a place once the summer semester ends."
1dasmj,2,2013-04-28,"Day ???, Ramblings, and an ex-GF story",WhenInRome20,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1dasmj/day_ramblings_and_an_exgf_story/,"I've been thinking about posting for a long time on here but decided now was best. I have been fapping since about 15 when I first discovered online porn. I am 23 now and I have gone through some major experiences the last year which really made me re-evaluate myself. Right now I am on a streak of noFap of about 6-7 months. I didnt keep track when I first started and have lost count. I am doing what some on here call ""hard-mode"" where I'm not having sex or doing any other sexual activity. I don't ever plan on relapsing, or looking at porn again. I'm sharing this because I believe it will help myself on some level and might encourage some of you to rethink if fapping is worth it.  

**What made me take on the NoFap Challenge:**

I had a girlfriend for the past 3 years and I broke it off with her last October. She was extremely beautiful and extremely smart, the type you could settle down with. Anyway, toward the end of the last year I started to have doubts in my mind. I wasn't feeling the extreme highs of joy like I had in the past with her and with the lack of happiness I started to begin doubting our relationship and if I would be ready to commit my life to another person. I think what played a major role in this feeling was porn. I strongly believe that the chemicals that used to go off in my head when I was with her were being continously faded by the use of porn. The day I broke up with her is the day that I decided porn would not control my life or be an obstacle to my happiness.

After about 2 months I started to ""reboot"" and feel those extreme high and low sensations once again. With this new found outlook I started to realize what was going on with my addiction and how much of my life it has affected. I realized that I was fapping to deal with stress and anxiety which helped in the short term but really messed with my life in the long term. I realized what a horrible mistake I had made losing this girl and right now am dealing with losing her. The good thing about this all happening is that I have learned what I need to make myself happy. I don't rely on porn or anybody else now. 

**Some of the benefits I have seen:**      

- Increase in energy
- Increase in wanting to socialize
- The feeling of just general happiness(I hadn't felt this in a very long time)
- It felt like there was this fog or something else over my emotions and thinking which I can think clearly and feel more now.
- Increased motivation
- Many others, the above are just the main ones

**Where I am now:**

I am doing considerably better in a lot of aspects in my life since starting no fap. I had just been hired for an internship, I only have one semester left to complete my degree and I feel like I have the confidence that I can accomplish anything. Working out and getting in shape has become a staple in my daily routine. As far as the ex-GF from above I'm not sure if we will ever get back together, she has taken me out of her life, but maybe we can reconcile soon.

I had just signed up for a nofap badge so I'm going to start my counter now. I will most likely stop ""hard-mode"" when I find the right person again but I'm just focusing on other parts of my life. 

**Some stuff to help others:**

- A big problem I had always had with relapsing was getting out of the first week. You have to stop the mindset of ""well I fapped yesterday so I can just start tomorrow"" STOP NOW!

- Use porn-blockers as an assistance not as starting point. Personal motivation to stop has to come first. I had uninstalled my porn-blockers so many times to get around them.
- Don't make NoFap the center of your life. Start working out, get hobbies, get out of the house. NoFap can be one goal, but make sure it isn't the only one.

- NoFap doesn't have an end. Around the 3-4 month point I had a realization that I could never go back to the old ways. This scared the crap out of me at first. Porn had been a part of my life for the past 7 years. How could I live without it? I hope you will all reach this point eventually and know that it is all worth it.

- Don't ever edge. I watch Game of Thrones, Spartacus, and rated-R movies without worrying because I am watching for the entertainment value not to fap. I figure if my main motivation of looking at something is ""the naked chicks"" then I don't need to be watching it.

Whenever I get to a year of NoFap I will give you guys an update on everything. Thanks for letting me share all of this with you guys.

1dagon,5,2013-04-28,I am just tired of everything happening around me .I feel dying right now is far better than all the troubles i am going thru right now.,[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1dagon/i_am_just_tired_of_everything_happening_around_me/,"This is not a throwaway account ,bcuz i fucking dont care abt anything on internet. 
I was a CS grad with good gpa and internship with my dream software company . 


2 years ago , i got into a bad accident which left me in coma for good 6 months and i took me another years to get my life back to normal. I didnt go back to work because i thought i needed some time to figure where my career was going and what i should do with my future now.

I had some good contacts and thru them i got into a XXXX  grad program. I was short of money but i got an GRA to work as a programmer on their research  and it paid for my tuition along with a modest stipend . 

If anybody thought the shit ends here ,it doesn't .   There is a phd guy where i work who knows my supervisor[Prof] pretty well. Like he goes to extreme lengths in servility , like going to Prof's office at 8 AM on birthday to give the card  or sometimes even doing someone personal errands for her. 

He always feeds wrong info to my Prof.[who is also my faculty Advisor and supervisor in research]  Like last sem  , a research involved me getting some docs from him about a survey that was carried out . I had asked this guy multiple times but he never got back.
and at end of month my prof called me and scolded me for not getting the work done .The prof was not ready to believe when i told her that i never got the docs back from him. I was about to be fired from research  but the only thing that kept me there was i had good programming skills and i was delivering software apps on time and partly because department doesn't know any developers who could develop on android or IOS .

This semester i was taking an online course and this was the first time the prof. [Lets call him fuckhead]was teaching for grads.  His method of teaching  was far from perfect and i used to criticize him in the lab with my other friends and make fun of him . This PhD guy again would relay all the info back to that prof . (Both the Dickhead prof and the phd guy knwo each other pretty well ) .I was not doing well in that class and at the end of semester the prof called me and asked me about these allegations and threatened to make my life hell and give me an F.   I had to involve my Prof. as mediator to get  prof.Dickhead to calm down and i ended up with C grade.

This guy has been sitting on his PHD proposal for an year and all he does in watch YouTube videos in lab and gets away with all these things beacuse he is good at buttering up my prof.All these incidents have left a very bad impression of me on my prof.  No matter how much hard work i do ,my prof. doesnt seem to recognize it [maybe partly because she doesn't know much about programming and effort needed to deliver an app on time] . At this point i am completely lost ,while the phd guy is smugly happy that he has destroyed my impression in eyes of my professor.

I really care a lot about my career and i really try to work hard towards it. But everywhere there seems to be somebody who should be there to undermine me and fuck me over with

I really need a perspective here.

Riley and Spike both try and help but Buffy doesn't exactly need their help. Spike notices 

[**SPIKE: Oh. I saw that.**](http://i53.tinypic.com/ra3rc9.gif)

Then Spike and Riley start killing vamps, Buffy is not amused.

[**BUFFY: Why do I even bother?**](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh0mehhbUI1qgbabho1_500.gif)

 The vamps get dusted, and Buffy tells Spike to bugger off. Spike is not impressed. Spike then tastes his own bloody, which Buffy finds pretty disturbing. 

**BUFFY: Spike ... I just saw you taste your own nose blood, you know what? (Spike grins at her) I'm too grossed out to hear anything you have to say. Go home.**

**SPIKE: It's blood! It's what I do!**

And then swiftly falls into a grave. 

Buffy then heads over to the magic box to train, which Xander has amazingly transformed into a kiss ass training room. 

Meanwhile, Harmony runs to Spike because she thinks Buffy is no ""after her"". 

**HARMONY: Come on, Spike. Pretty please? I'll do anything!** 

**SPIKE: Anything, will you?** 

**HARMONY: Yeah! I said I'll do anything.**

**Spike raises his eyebrows.**

**HARMONY: Ohhhh. You mean will I have sex with you? (shrugs casually, like ""duh"") Well, yeah.**

Spike and Harmony come up with a plan to kill Buffy. 

We head over to the Summers household where Joyce is making breakfast for Dawn. Joyce suddenly stops and looks dizzy. 

**JOYCE: (confused) Oh, what is the... (looks at Dawn) Who are you?**

Joyce then collapses, smashing the plates on the floor. 

At the hospital, an intern (Ben) informs Buffy and Riley that Joyce will be fine, but the doctors aren't sure what the cause of her problems are. While this is going on, Dawn listens to Rileys heartbeat and notices that his heart is going quicker than Seabiscuit. 

Riley heads over to see a Doctor about his heart. The Doc tells him it's bad and shouldn't leave, but Riley refuses. Buffy urges Riley to stay. 

**BUFFY: What's going on? What are you doing? What if you have a heart attack?**
 
**RILEY: (puts hands on her shoulders) Listen to me. Calm down.**

**BUFFY: *Me* calm down? I'm not the one with a pulse of a hundred and fifty.** 

**RILEY: My heart's different than yours, Buffy. It works differently now, but it's okay.**

**BUFFY: But you're still a human, Riley. You could still have a heart attack.** 

**RILEY: I'm a human who was used as a lab rat for months.**

[Graham](http://images.wikia.com/buffy/images/1/19/Graham_Miller.gif) an old Initiative member ties to get Riley to come in, saying [""I'm not giving you a choice.](http://images.wikia.com/buffy/images/6/6c/504_OOMM2.jpg). 

[**RILEY: Please take me where they can make me unconcious and naked**](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7shvdw7my1qgmt5yo1_500.gif)

Riley out-muscles Graham and runs away. Buffy having no other often, tries to get Riley in herself before Riley has a massive heart attack. Buffy gives Spike info about the Doctor that can help Riley, hoping that Spike might be able to track him down and bring Riley to him. Bad idea Buff, because Spike has a new idea what the Doctor should do, help remove his chip. 

[Buff manages to track the very immature at this point, Riley down.](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh0mocmRWw1qgbabho1_500.gif) Riley is doing all the things a normal guy would, punching rocks. He tells Buffy why he is afraid of getting the surgery. 

RILEY: I go back ... let the government get whimsical with my innards again ... They could do anything that- Best-case scenario, they turn me into Joe Normal, just... (sighs) Just another guy.
 
**BUFFY: And that's not enough for you?** 

**RILEY: It's not enough for *you*.**

**BUFFY: Why would you say that?** 

**RILEY: Come on. Your last boyfriend wasn't exactly a civilian.** 

**BUFFY: So that's what this is about? You're going to die, all over some macho pissing contest.** 

**RILEY: (shakes his head) It's not about him. It's about us. (Buffy shakes her head, not understanding) You're getting stronger every day, more powerful. I can't touch you. Every day, you're just ... a little further out of my reach.**

We see again, the middle of Buffy and Riley's relationship starting to break down even further. 

Buffy finally convinces Riley to go to the hospital, but the Doc has gone. Just after the Doc has finished sewing up Spike's lovely head, Buffy and Riley arrive and some fighting goes down. Spike tries to bite Buffy, but he get's a really bad headache. Realising the operation was a trick and the Doctor was right in that he couldn't remove it, Spike and Harmony escape with Spike saying Buffy is the source of all the problems in his life. 

[**SPIKE:You don't understand. I can't get rid of her. She's everywhere. She's haunting me, Harmony!**](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh0n0gx6mr1qgbabho1_500.gif)

Riley has the operation and Graham visits him telling Riley that he no longer has a purpose on Sunnydale anymore. 

**GRAHAM: But you know you don't belong here, right? (Keeps walking and talking although Riley has stopped walking and is staring at his back) This town? I mean, you're nothin' here.**

Buffy shows up  at Spikes crypt with a stake, and you know what? Spike has had enough too. 

[**SPIKE: Just kill me**](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh0n58cIl71qgbabho1_500.gif) 

Even as a straight male, damn James, you're hot. 

Spike admits his love for Buffy. 

**SPIKE: God, I love you so much.**

Spike then wakes up, terrified at his realisation. 

[**SPIKE: Oh God no.**](http://www.sinister-attraction.net/images/dream4.jpg)

____________________________________________________________

This episode further cements the distance between Buffy and Riley at the moment. Riley no longer has a purpose, and feels inadequate to Buffy. 

This is also the last time we see the old Sunnydale High in all it's burned, crispy snake glory.

However, our apartments are about a mile/mile and a half apart... We want to be able to spend evenings together, but neither of us have a car and I'm not sure how safe I'll be walking home (or even how safe he'd be) at probably around 11pm at night. The way home is across a big outdoor mall. There are a lot of restaurants and I think there would probably be people there even late at night, which to me makes me think it would be safer? 

I've talked to another past intern and she said that the area we are living in is really safe. Am I taking a big risk walking half a mile or so alone at night in a fairly safe area? There is also a bus that sort of runs between our places, but it doesn't run very late at night especially on weekends and it only goes one direction (mine-&gt;his) not the other way around. 

The only other alternative is to rent a car but that would be like $2,000 for the summer and I really want to try and save what I can from what I earn during the internship. 

Please advise!"

But baby isn't due until the end of June and I am just afraid that I have about a snowball's chance in hell of actually getting hired because I am going to want at least 8 weeks after the birth before I go to work.

Has anyone been in this situation before? Do I really have any hope at all? I know the person I am interviewing with (worked at the location as a student intern) and she knows that I am pregnant. I know discrimination is not allowed, but if there are other qualified candidates I can't really think they would hire me over someone who could start sooner.

Is there anything I should say or avoid saying?? I am pretty nervous about the whole thing."

In my 3rd year of a 5 year Business Admin. program and I absolutely can't stand college.  I feel that I'm on course now to train how to be a slave/desk jockey.  No offense but that's not my thing.  I hate school and being told what to study.  I've had jobs from accounting internships to being a cashier and the only thing I have ever found joy in was officiating soccer matches.

I honestly don't know what to do now.  I'm paying $18,000 a year to go to a school that I hate.  On top of that, the stress is causing me a bunch of physical medical issues and I recently developed a serious allergy (autoimmune triggered) towards the common FD&amp;C food dyes in the US.  That has only put me down more-- being confined to such a strict diet sans the foods that I used to love.

I was considering moving to work or studying abroad near some friends in the UK to get away from some of the stress here.  I'd like to study, but I feel like I'd be just as lost not knowing what to do when I come back.  Working might be an option, but then again I've exhausted most of my professional references and I feel like I would be at a disadvantage if I took that path because of it.

Has anyone been in a remotely similar situation or could anyone spare some insight?

**tldr: studying business and I have absolutely come to hate it.  Issue now is that I have no clue what I want to do with my life.**"

And I have no idea what the going rate for college students is.

So, if you're doing an internship this summer - how much are you making? What should we pay you for a full-time gig? (Yes, in case you're wondering - this is literally how it's done.)

1dcwl1,5,2013-04-29,How did this happen....,ventingthrowaway11,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dcwl1/how_did_this_happen/,"Where do I even start.

I'm a 20yo white male, went to public school in a well-off town, breezed through high school, and never lived to my potential. I wanted to start this way because I'll probably be coming back to it later on.

A little while ago (may have been a couple weeks, possibly a month, I haven't been keeping track of time well lately) I had to drop out of college for the second time. I was technically only a part-time student this time, but I planned on acing my classes and having perfect evidence that I still belonged in school, that my previous academic performance was severely impeded by the fact that my world was just crashing down around me.

Let me take a step back to make things more clear. High school was a weird time for me, freshman year I got straight A's, recommended for all the AP classes, looking toward a very good GPA and plenty of extra curricular activities, exactly what colleges wanted to see. Strangely enough, this was also the year I was most bullied. I don't remember most of the details of getting bullied, like why or to what extent it happened, but I remember one of the kids in my neighborhood scared me. Like he would usually talk about shooting squirrels and blowing up CO2 canisters in his backyard, and to a straight-edge kid like me, I was worried for my own safety. Anyway, after freshman year, I didn't get any trouble from those kids, but I also had a weird revelation. Most people see straight A's and think ""that person can succeed, he has incredible potential, he's gonna go places"" but when I saw them all I could think was ""wow school is easy time to stop trying"". I got mostly B's for the rest of high school, and countless people around me asked why I didn't apply myself. I got back tests, and people around me would stare in awe. ""You got 100%? Why in the hell do you never take 2 seconds to do your homework and get an A in your classes?"" and my response was always ""I don't really care, I have better things to do"". Truth was, I didn't have better things to do. Every single time I got a progress report saying that I'm borderline failing because I don't do homework, my parents would ground me. For me, grounding basically meant no video games, because I never did much outside of school, except an occasional night at a friend's house playing Warhammer (I was an exciting guy in high school, as you can tell). The point of me telling all this is to point out that in the face of adversity, I had the potential to succeed if I just put a little effort in. But I ended up at the state university, which is basically what I wanted. My first choice of school was a state school, just 5 hours away from where I live. Parents didn't want me doing that, they knew me better than I did, they needed to be within driving distance for when something went wrong.

So I hated them for a little while (in that teenager way), usually when I had to make up a reason I had to go to our own state school (that was embarrassing for me considering my potential, especially since 2 of the people I was most often compared to are currently at MIT). Eventually I got over it, found a bunch of friends that would be going there too, and decided to make the best of it. But I never got the memo about using every ounce of potential that I had, even with something as little as keeping deadlines. Summer before freshman year, I had to fill out a form to get housing. I waited until my mom asked me about it, and by then it was a week past the last day, so I was at the mercy of the housing department at a public university. Honors housing was out of the question, I was just relieved to have a room once it was announced. I ended up in the East campus quad, which at the time meant nothing to me. I moved in, met my roommate, we were both fairly awkward so we stuck together but didn't talk much, sat in silence at a table in the corner at the dining hall. Not long after we moved in, though, a very charismatic guy introduces himself to me, asks if I wanna play frisbee with all his friends. A chance to meet people? Sign me up. As I get to know everybody, I find out that they all lived there the year before. But as time goes on, I learn even more about the history of this group. The charismatic leader, I'll call him D, was very chill in past years because he had the luxury of indulging in his love of marijuana every day (the whole dorm smelled of weed constantly, not a surprise once I found out that most of the people in the quad were basically hippies). Only issue with this was that he had switched majors, and wanted to be a police officer now, so he had to be clean. Having been kept mellow by drugs, he was starting to get very hostile. He would regularly try to wrestle with people, and over time he decided that I was the best choice of opponent. He was about 6 inches shorter than me, but was much more fit than I, and so even if I tried to resist, he would pin me easily, even violently. Unfortunately, I was very soft-spoken, and I didn't want to lose my only group of friends, so I never spoke out against his behavior to any authority figures. I just lived with it, suffered through it.

One day, what I mistook at the time to be a blessing, but learned later was just another pitfall, I met a very beautiful girl. My history with females was an interesting one; I had crushes in the past, only managed to ask one out ever, and was rejected. Still a virgin, still hadn't even as much as kissed a girl when I entered freshman year. This girl, I'll call her K, changed my life. When I first saw her, all I could think is ""wow she's really pretty, too bad she's way out of my league"". One of the friends I was with knew her from before, so we went over and started hanging out with her friends. The whole time, I couldn't stop trying to talk to her. I even attempted flirting with her the whole time, but lacking any experience with girls, I basically just tried to compliment her about every possible thing at any chance I got. At the end of the day, I went back to my room with the idea that my attempts had failed, that this was just another girl that was way too pretty to like me. However the next morning I went to my 8AM class, and came back to a note on my door from her. It said ""Hi Interns, love from K"" (D called me and my roommate his ""interns"" as we were a few of the only freshmen in the dorm). I took this opportunity to write one back to her, copying her bubble letters and rainbow color scheme, and putting it on her door that night. The next day, I found a series of hot pink post-its on my door, and although I can't remember exactly what they said, I remember they included her full name and her phone number, and this time she addressed them directly to me. So I found her on facebook, and I texted her to share my number, and I thought to myself ""what an unorthodox way of becoming friends"" because I was still too naive to understand where she wanted to go with this. In fact, we hung out one night and when we got to her room, I said good night and walked away. Not because I was playing hard to get, but because I thought we were destined to be only friends. The next night she made sure I made it into her room (she had a single), and then into her bed, and we kinda just laid there because I didn't know what came next. I innocently looked at her and asked if we were supposed to kiss, and then I leaned in and it happened. My first kiss, in the midst of having no idea where my life was headed. Less than 5 minutes later I fidgeted to readjust my...assets, if you will. She asked what was wrong, I seemed uncomfortable, I explained as my face turned bright red, and she laughed. She asked if she could see it, and who was I to tell a beautiful girl not to reach down my pants. so she goes down there to investigate, and I'm really nervous, being my first time, and all I hear is a gasp. I ask what's wrong, and she looks at me and just whispers ""it's gorgeous"". As one could imagine, this did wonders for my self esteem. She said she couldn't contain herself, and that night I lost my virginity. Same night I first kissed a girl, and all this the same night I found out we were going to be more than friends. It was pretty overwhelming. Over the next few weeks, we had an interesting relationship. She was usually busy with a ton of school work, and I was still trying to understand everything that had happened. On weekends, we played xbox together and had sex fairly regularly. Until one night, the Thursday before our week off for Thanksgiving, when I paused during sex because I heard her crying. She said she needed to be alone, and sent me back to my room with no idea what happened. The next day before she left for the week, she told me that she needed to think about everything. Being the idiot that I was, I decided not to text her while she thought about everything. Brilliant idea, don't stack the deck in your own favor, I thought I was being very mature by letting her think things through without interfering. A week later we get back to school and we talk about it. She tells me she can't handle a relationship with me, but instead of elaborating, decided to say ""we can still be friends, and maybe get back together at a later date"". This may have been in response to seeing my face, which I imagine as being puppy dog ideas to the extreme, but regardless, it gave me immense amounts of false hope. We hung out for the rest of the semester, basically nothing changed except that we no longer had sex. In fact, we hung out more when we weren't together than during the short few weeks we were.

So after winter recess, we return for another semester. I have high hopes that enough time has passed and enough stress is gone that we can finally have a relationship. First day back, I find out she had a new guy, she started talking to him at the beginning of December, about a week after we broke up. Over time, I stopped seeking her out to hang out, only hung out when she asked, because all I could think of was her boyfriend. As I saw it, he was my replacement. Eventually we stopped talking, until one day about a month later. She wanted to have lunch and catch up. Somebody had told her that I hated her and didn't want to have anything to do with her, which is why we stopped talking. I reassured her that wasn't the case, and dug deeper into this dark situation. We went back to being relatively friendly, until one day she came into the game room in our dorm building. I was there hanging out with my friend who was scheduled to work and just tended to play pool for 5 hours and get paid. She came in with one of her friends and they started playing pool. She invited me to play with them, and I obliged because my friend had started working on homework. I was much better than them at pool, so she kept trying to mess me up when it was my turn. One time she stood right in the way of my shot, so I had to put my arms around her and shoot. I didn't think anything of it at the time. Eventually her friend left, and then my friend told us he was closing but would leaving the room open because the RAs of the building were in the second half of the game room watching a movie. So she sat me down and asked if I'm okay with knowing she's dating another guy. I lied and said I was, but she could tell I wasn't. We talked for a while, until the RAs came out and said they were closing it down for the night so we had to get out. We walked back up to my room and I jokingly complained that I didn't wanna go back to my room, so she invited me to play xbox with her. This was about 11PM at this point, to give an idea of what time it was. Time flew by really fast, and next thing I knew it was 4 in the morning. She puts her controller down, looks over at me, and says ""if the RAs hadn't been in the next room, things would have gone differently down there"" and I immediately remembered the pool shot I made around her body. I couldn't focus for the next hour, and she finally sent me back to my room at 5 in the morning. I linger at her door, wishing I could do something about what she had said. When I get back to my room, I noticed she had texted me, apologizing for being a tease. I respond that I just wanted to kiss her, and asking her if I could. She responded ""...maybe"", and I was much more excited than I should have been. I jumped out of bed and made a beeline for her room, meeting her halfway. We went back to her room and she cheated on her boyfriend with me, at 5:30 in the morning. We went to the dining hall when it opened at 7, then both went to our own rooms and went to sleep. For the rest of the semester, about a month and a half if I recall correctly, we spent about 10 hours each day in the lounge of our building, on a couch in the corner, flirting while everybody else in the room tried to get homework done.

Now while all this was happening, my studies were struggling. First semester I did fine, As and Bs, but while all this crazy stuff was happening, we weren't together but spent every day like we were, I only ever went to one of my 4 classes. And it was only because a friend of mine was also in the class and wouldn't let everything that was happening get me kicked out of school. He woke me up every day for the class, did all the homework with me, even had me call the mental health department on campus and set up weekly appointments. Looking back, I see that what he tried to do was probably one of the greatest and most helpful things anybody had done for me. That semester I failed all my classes, except the one my friend made sure I kept track of. I got an A in that class.

And it went even farther downhill from here. When I went home for the summer, and my parents found out I had failed all my classes except one, they couldn't believe it. I did my best to explain the situation, but the whole thing was a fairly sensitive subject and the venom I heard in my father's voice as he asked me exactly what the fuck could have gone wrong, I couldn't bring myself to explain it all. I gave vague details, promised it wouldn't happen again. I was on academic watch, and I knew it was serious business. I found a living situation with my best friend from high school, who I hadn't really talked to much during this whole thing, but he kept me in mind when housing was an option. I was around much less toxic people, had a good working environment, and most importantly, I was across campus from K. We started the semester by hanging out once a week, catching up for a few hours, and then going on with our lives. I was getting all my work done, enjoying classes, really learning for the first time since I started school. Then I got the text. About the middle of October if memory serves, K told me that her boyfriend was planning to propose, but instead broke up with her. She spent a week at home recovering, then came back to campus and asked way more of me than was fair. But me, still holding on to ""oh we can be friends then get back together"", did everything she wanted without a second thought. I started sacrificing class time to hang out with her and keep her happy. She started getting back on her feet, but I didn't. I kept skipping class, avoiding school work, ended up with a sleep schedule that included passing out on a couch in our apartment at 4 every morning, then waking up at noon when somebody came back from class and woke me up for food. And then at the end of November, K broke the news that she had found ANOTHER new guy. By this time, there was no recovering in my classes. Over winter break I had to plead my case to the department of engineering, promise to make progress meetings throughout the semester with the dean, and meet with somebody every week to keep me on top of my work. The semester started off the same as the one before, and this time K was living at home and taking classes at the campus near where she lived, 2 hours away from the main campus. I was finally free, because it's not possible for her to keep me out of my classes from so far away, right? Sadly, that's wrong. This semester, instead of plaguing me with the weight of a breakup, asking me to be there through everything, and then finding another guy and leaving me with ""we can get back together....eventually""; instead of all that, she just flirted with me over facebook messaging. Valentine's day, she tells me she's single, and we start reminiscing about our relationship, she says she misses, blah blah blah. I say ""blah blah blah"" because I don't remember most of what it says, but it brought back the awful sleep schedule because I could never fall asleep by any means except pure exhaustion.

This time, I had already used up all my ""try again"" cards. I had lied to my adviser about what work i was getting done, I neglected to keep any appointments with the dean, and I failed most of my classes again. This was the spring semester of 2012. Summer of that year, I had to look into taking classes part-time, in an attempt to get back into school full-time. I moved my therapist from campus to one in my town, and I saw a huge difference. This therapist figured me out immediately, and she wasn't afraid to tell me the truth. She flat-out told me that I need to drop K however I can. So that summer I told her everything that went wrong in my life because of her, but being the idiot that I am, said we could stay friends as long as she doesn't flirt with me or anything. Luckily I figured it out, and within a week removed her from everything. The last thing I heard from her was the following semester, when I was part-time on the main campus, I was in class with one of her friends, who told her I was still taking classes, and she asked me about it. I ignored her, and haven't heard from her since.

Now I wish this was where my story ended. That semester (fall 2012) I had 2 part-time classes, and I had all the time to focus on them, no distractions, and because of this I excelled. Aced them both very easily. Unfortunately I missed the deadline for apply for readmission (I assumed it was between semesters, it was actually during the semester). So I signed up for more part-time classes this semester. Taking a step back one more time, over the summer I had talked to one of my good friends from high school, and found out we both enjoy League of Legends. He introduced me to an entire vent server of people who I could potentially bond with, and it seemed really fun. I balanced work and fun very well during the fall, and everybody in the group seemed to like me, it felt pretty good to have a lot of people enjoy spending time with me, and sharing something I really enjoyed.

Less than a month into the new semester, I met a girl from the group, let's call her V. She had been in the group before but she almost never talked and she was rarely on. When I first played with her, I didn't know what to expect, and I told myself that everything she said was completely sarcastic and that she didn't like me at all. The next time we played, though, she messaged me after the game asking if we had played WoW together. I hadn't played WoW, so I said no and that was that. But I was so surprised that this happened, I had to ask somebody. So I messaged my friend that brought me into the group, and he jokingly said that she doesn't know how to talk and that she must really be in love with me to message me. He would call her my girlfriend for a while whenever i freaked out to him that she was online. I was too nervous to talk to her, or to push to be friends on skype or steam or anything.

Fast forward back to this semester, less than a month in. Just a regular Friday night, I'm at home because I didn't plan to visit my friends at school that weekend. We got on vent together and she talked and talked and talked. I was so surprised, something had obviously changed since before when she was silent. She answered this fairly quickly on her own. She asked if I had ever been in love, because she had just been dumped by this guy after 3 years of dating. She was always silent on vent and rarely online because she was spending all her time with him, and he got jealous if he found out she was talking to other guys. So we start talking more and more, and I was really just there to listen to her talk through everything. I still had only experience with one girl, and it didn't really help me understand relationships at all.

This all started about 3 months ago, I think. Honestly I don't remember, time has gotten away from me. The most important part of this story is what my therapist tried to tell me. She said that I sit at my computer and wait for that little notice that said V messaged me on skype, in a way similar to people who are addicted to slot machines, pulling the lever and getting depressed until it comes back with a win, then you can't leave because of the rush of winning. At this point, I was having trouble waking up for classes, and the anxiety started to snowball to the point that missing classes and work was the reason I couldn't wake up to go to class, and that's what made me realize I had to drop out. I thought about it a lot, and I realized that every time before then, there was some thing I could do to make everything better, and regardless of whether I chose to do it, it made me feel better knowing there was a way out. It finally got to the point where I asked myself why I feel this way and the answer was ""because"". For me, a very mathematically and scientifically oriented person, it bothers me when I can't find an explanation, and it was even worse when I realized it was my own brain that was telling me I couldn't figure it out.

The last thing I did about V was tell her we couldn't talk as much as before (instead of just cutting it off completely like my therapist suggested). That lasted about a week, and it has gotten to the point where this past weekend I spent upwards of 20 hours on private skype calls with her while we play Tera. I made excuses all weekend as to why I didn't want to interact with any of my other friends.
To make things even worse, a ton of the people on our vent server come to me for advice, or just for somebody to vent to, and they all think I have my life together. People who I lie to on a daily basis about my life, my education, everything, they trust me with their issues, secrets, and value my opinion and my time. While all this is happening, I have been lying to my therapist about talking to V; I told my therapist that I cut all ties with her.

I am already planning to get into a program that is more rigorous than 1 hour of therapy a week, so this is really just to vent. I apologize if it's hard to read at some points, it took me almost 2 hours to write in total and I lost my train of thought a few times. I appreciate any responses, whether you have a question about something unclear, or you have an experience to share that I may be able to learn from."

1dbx08,2,2013-04-29,I wish to stay and work in the US for a year. A few questions...,[deleted],travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dbx08/i_wish_to_stay_and_work_in_the_us_for_a_year_a/,"A little bit about me : 
Born and raised in Canada ; currently living in France ; I have both French and Canadian citizenship. Never applied for a visa in my life, so feeling a little overwhelmed, especially with the clock ticking!

Not a student, don't have a bachelors degree or any of that jazz. However, I am a (french) certified early childhood educator assistant as well as certified environmental and outdoor educator. 


Why am I going?
I'm going to join forces with my (french) SO who is going there for his last year of university. I've found an organization who is willing to welcome me for an internship, but an unpaid one. I would really like to do this internship, since the project is right up my alley, and the experience would be beneficial to my career as an EO educator.


The obstacles :
American visas are very specific and it is difficult to be able to talk to anyone to gain some clarity (hence why I am turning to you all lovely folks!). I would like to have a working visa in order to have a part-time job while working on my internship. Trouble is, is that not only is it hard to find a job whilst overseas, but also that if I get in on my internship, I don't have the legal right to work elsewhere. Which is problematic, since I'm not getting paid for my internship and rent, groceries and bills don't pay themselves.


Some questions :
As a Canadian, I can stay as a tourist for 3 months/90 days. Is it crazy to think to ask for a working visa if I find a job during those 3 months?

How long are visa waiting times for generally?

Does anyone have any experience out staying this 3 month period? What happens?

Any other words of advice, words of encouragement, etc.?


Thanks a bunch in advance!

I've met so many wonderful people, I love my school, I'm happy with my major, and finally feel like I have some semblance of direction in my life.

But *nooooo*.

I find out that almost all of my friends, from here *and* from my last school, will be in New York this summer for really awesome internships. On top of that, I found out my ex-best friend (who I harbor a lot of hostility towards, I'll be honest) has some internship in Europe. Now I feel like a total failure. I know that I'm not, but this whole transfer process has taken so much out of me...I've had to adjust and watch as my friends configured their lives while I was just depressed and lonely. Now, everyone has fucking internships and I'll be working at an ice cream shop this summer. 

I realize that I sound really ungrateful. I'm so happy that I even *got in* to the school I go to, it's one of the top schools in the country! That makes me so proud. I'm happy that I have some source of income, however unexciting. Plus, I have a lot of really cool trips planned for this summer--London and Los Angeles! Totally cool. 

Despite all of this, I can't help but compare myself to all of my friends and feel jealous and resentful. For one, now that I'm *out* of New York, everyone moves there, *and* I just haven't found a job supplementary to my desired career field (television, which is competitive as fuck to begin with). I'm concerned that puts me at a disadvantage. Ugh, and I'm totally not looking forward to hearing about how much fun they had in NYC because I'm a bitter, angsty adolescent and I can't be happy for anyone.

I don't know. I just want to live my life on my own terms, because I do have a lot to be excited about, but I just can't seem to appreciate any of it. I'm back to wanting to cry and cut myself and listen to the Smiths all the time.

I just want to be happy but I can't for the life of me figure out how. Shit sucks, man."

Thoughts on MOS?",groundshop,army,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1dg466/have_masters_in_computer_science_considering/,"I know I'm brushing up against what's not allowed according to the sidebar (i.e., what job should I get hur-dur) but I think I'm in a somewhat unique position due to my background. I visited a recruiter recently and didn't find out a whole bunch. 

**Background:** I obtained my MS in CS at a decent research university, did an internship with a big defense contractor doing advanced UAV research, and am an excellent software developer and linux / network admin. I test well, already have a DoD clearance (from the internship), and haven't had any physical or legal problems ever.

**Question:** Is there an avenue to get into the reserves, hopefully ending up as a warrant officer or officer, doing some serious computer science sorta stuff? I'm not really interested in repairing laptops or setting up office internet connections all day. My recruiter had little/no info on what types of jobs were available at the local reserve units (in Louisiana). Frankly, in industry I can make a little under twice as much as low rank active enlisted, so if I go through all the trouble of 6-12 months of training at low pay, I want to make sure I'm doing a reserve job that I feel I can contribute to. 

**Are there any folks with signal corp, electronic warfare, air defense, intelligence or telecom MOSes that can tell me how much software development (i.e., programming) or network administration goes on in your job?**"
1dfzt7,5,2013-04-30,I'm in a bit of a bind. Anyone near Lowden ave have an off street parking spot for sale?,[deleted],Somerville,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/1dfzt7/im_in_a_bit_of_a_bind_anyone_near_lowden_ave_have/,"Short story:  I want to rent off street parking from someone within half a mile mile of [Lowden ave](https://maps.google.com/?q=Lowden%20Avenue,%20Somerville,%20MA) for $100 a month through August.

Long story: I moved in with a friend in Somerville for a 6 month internship in Boston.  Nobody told me when I moved in that out of state registered cars can't get long-term on street parking permits. (I was floored when they told me that they have no options for temporary workers)  My second 21 day pass expires at the end of the week and I cannot get another.

I bought my first car 5 months ago in preparation to live here, since where I work is not on a public transportation line.  I registered my car in my home state and got insurance through my parents.  I then drove and parked in another state where my university is for 5 months with no issues.  Nobody told me that Somerville had special parking rules, and that you cannot get a long-term parking pass in this town without registering your vehicle in MA.

So I need to register my car in MA, but there are some problems.  
1) Registration and license conversion costs $225, and I just paid to register my vehicle in another state less than 6 months ago.  
2) To register in MA, you need MA insurance.  
3) My current insurance company is going to **double** my insurance cost to $240 a month get converted to MA insurance, but If I stay on my states insurance, they have no issues with me driving in MA.  
4) I cannot switch insurance companies because other insurance companies will not sell to someone who has had insurance for less than 1 year, which I have not since I just bought my car.  
5) Since I bought my car less than 6 months ago, I will have to pay sales tax a second time to MA when I register my vehicle.  Because you know, fuck me right?

Between registration, license conversion, sales tax, and my first month of new insurance, the initial loss to me is roughly $600, plus the additional monthly $120 sting via my insurance.  I literally can't afford that loss on my intern salary, and since it is only temporary, it seems insane to register my vehicle in this state.  At this point I am almost two months into my internship, with only 4 months remaining.

The deal:
I pay you $100 a month for 4 months starting as soon as possible.  I can prepay up to two months and I will throw in $50 as a deposit/bonus or whatever.  In return I get off street parking.  I do not need a garage, I do not need a gate.  I will park on your lawn if that is what you want.  I leave for work at around 7:30 and get home sometime between 6:00-8:00pm.  My hours are somewhat flexible, so I can fanangle if you need me to.  If I get hired full time when my internship ends, I may need a 5th or 6th month while I seek a more permanent solution."

1dfydx,7,2013-04-30,How should I[21F] tell the guy[23M] I've been seeing that I don't think it's wise for us to continue?,wutplz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dfydx/how_should_i21f_tell_the_guy23m_ive_been_seeing/,"I've been seeing this guy since the first week of February this year. I met him at a party I went to, and really wasn't actively looking for a relationship when I met him. Apparently though, he had interest in me, talked to one of my friends who was also at the party, and asked if she could give him my number (I had left before he could ask me). I said sure, why not, and thus we began texting. Second week of February rolls up, we go out a few times, I don't see any reason to stop seeing him, and so throughout the semester we are basically a ""thing"". He comes to my formal, he stays over, we hold hands, I meet his brother and sister in law, basically I'm his girlfriend. 

And here's where my issues start. Until this past Saturday, we had never discussed ""us"". We didn't have a label, he never refers to me as his girlfriend (though his roommate's do, and he doesn't correct them), and I don't refer to him as my boyfriend (and I correct my friends when they refer to him as such) out of respect, since we hadn't discussed it. He is going away for the summer to another country for a research project he's been working on all summer until the end of June, and then afterward, he's going on a trip to Europe. We, in passing, talk about seeing each other in the fall semester, getting season tickets for football and going together, and he's mentioned us going to New York during the summer, since I've never been. However, I feel a little uneasy continuing this relationship type thing with him, because of his ""ex-girlfriend"". 

When I met him in February, he told me he had recently broken up with his long-distance girlfriend (~2000 miles away long distance) of 2 years, which he had met during an internship 2 years ago. I figure this means that he's *actually single*, and just toss that information aside. Later, I find out that during our spring break in March, he went to spend the week with her, where ever it is she is living (I found out before he left, his roommate's assured me that he and her were ""just friends"" and that he was ""too polite"" to say no). I don't like it, but as he had previously told me they broke up, and considering the fact that we aren't ""official"", I let it go. 

On Saturday, I met his brother and sister-in-law, and afterwards we discussed our ""relationship"". He told me that he didn't want to label anything, as he's going to be away most of the summer, which I figured was the reason anyway, and I said as much. Then, he tells me after he's done with his research project, he is going to go to Europe with this ""ex-girlfriend"" of his. He said that he was ""going to cancel it because it would be weird, but didn't because [he] found out her family would be coming, too"", which would alleviate the ""tension"". I'm not a fan of this, but, again, let it go, because he'd already bought the tickets, and additionally, he *isn't* my boyfriend, so I really have no say. 

Up until this point, this guy has been nothing but fantastic. He's nice to me, he's nice to my friends, he finds me interesting, and I him, and overall I would very much like to continue. HOWEVER. Sunday he came by, and logged into an incognito window on my computer to check his email. Fine, fine, I don't mind. We get food, catch some sleep, and he leaves early in the morning to study for his final. Last night however, I was studying for my final, and brought up a window in Chrome- with his email still logged on.

Now, don't get me wrong. I know I shouldn't have looked. It's his email, not mine, and quite frankly that is an invasion of privacy, and really, if he'd have read my email, I'd be ticked, too, even though there isn't really anything in my email for me to hide. However, I saw the ""ex-girlfriend""'s name on one of the emails, and I was curious. Why would he be getting emails from her if they're broken up? So I click on it, and she's talking about how they should get the tickets to go to Europe soon, because her parents are on her about it, yada ya, and then at the *end of the email*, she writes 

&gt;""Also, this [my name] chick sounds like a dirty pirate hooker haha :)
&gt;
&gt;Love,
&gt;[her name]

Well, THAT is certainly interesting, so I search my name in his email, which returns nothing. So I search her name. Chats and emails come up with her and him discussing their “relationship”. One comes up from about 2 weeks ago, with her saying something about having gone to this outing with this friend of hers, and then them meeting up with a married couple, so she realized this was a date, and she had to “fade this guy out”, and then she “realized something about [their] relationship”, that she would “still choose [boy I’m seeing]”, and he responds with “I’m really glad :)”. Enter multiple other messages like this, with the two of them saying “I love you”, another email with him signing off “I do still love you [girl’s name]”.  The gChats from spring break lead me to believe that they were not simply meeting up as friends, nor do I believe that he was sick during spring break like he told me he was. 

So, I realize that this needs to stop. I'm not about to play Backup Girlfriend or Temporary Girlfriend to someone who has no intentions of letting go of the girl they lied to me about not being with. I feel bad having read his emails, but on the other hand, clearly he had no intentions of telling me any of this. I guess what I'm wondering is, what do I say to him, if anything? Should I straight up tell him, yo dude, I read your email, and I'm not having any of that. You lied, goodbye. Or, should I just ice him out and not respond to any of his messages (I don't really want to do that, because I feel he should know that if he tries this with someone else, they're eventually going to find out). My first thought was to send him a text/say to him ""so I'm a dirty pirate hooker, huh?"", and see what he says, but I feel like that's slightly immature...

**TL;DR: Guy I've been seeing has lied to me about breaking up with the girl he'd been dating before me, I only found out by reading his email (which is wrong), and I am not sure what I should do/say to end this ""relationship"".**"

I am a 6th year student that has been withdrawing from m last 3 semesters due to the poor grades I was getting. I am a chemical engineering major, and my gpa dropped from a 3.8 to a 3.02 my senior year (doing 5 years). I was not satisfied with the grades I was getting and decided to withdraw 2nd senior semester. From then, it just became a habbit; if i was not getting A's I withdrew over and over again. My parents and friends think I am doing a second degree, but in reality, I am trying to finish my first degree and still have about one more year left in order to finish. 

I am supposed to graduate next week with my parents thinking they are going to see me walk, and haven't had the courage to tell them. All I have been doing is sleeping for long hours and eating a lot while trying to find a job or internship for the summer. I have gained weight just this last year alone (I used to hit the gym 3/4 times a week). 
How do I tell my parents? they have such high expectations of me that sometimes I feel like the biggest failure and thought about running my car off a cliff several times when going home from college and back. 
There is much more to the stress that accumulates, but this is my main concern. Any advice to how should i approach this problem will be greatly appreciated. 

-First time Redditor seeking help. 

Update: Reddit can sometime be like counseling. Now seeking help from the university and about to go and talk to my girlfriend about this. Thanks for the advice and support everyone!

Update 2: Told my girlfriend first: She was shocked because I told her at a store. We talked after wards and told me that she was upset that I didnt tell her that I was struggling through classes, because she could've pushed me. She said she felt guilty because I always helping her and motivating her and have high expectations for her, but she doesn't do the same for me. She said that she felt proud that I am not settling for bad grades, but to make better choices and try to do things better and to internships along the way because I haven't done any. She was supportive. 

I told my brother second: He was extremely supportive. He graduated before and just wanted to get out of college and just breezed through school. He said to stay calm and that I am not a failure because I had not quit yet. I told him I want to give it another shot and do it right. He said to take my time and come back strong, that hopefully I learned a lot from it and apply it. 

My PARENTS! I told my father first, and he was really upset that I waited till the last minute to tell them. He said that a week before would have been fine. The conversations was short, but he was upset. My mom just kept asking me why I didn't tell them before. I told her I was ashamed to, and hopefully I will fix it because I was not doing so well on my last classes. 

Summary: They were supportive, but just were upset that i waited till the last minute to tell me. You were right guys, it wasn't as bad as I imagined, and life continues on. 
Currently applying to Internships like crazy =). 

THANKS FOR ALL THE ADVISE GUYS! Really like this community after a first time user :) Cant really get anything productive out of other social media websites.

* SO and I have been close friends almost 2 years, and officially together for the last 14 months  
* For all but the first month we knew each other, we've been long-distance. During that time, I'd see her every 2-3 months at most. We Skype almost every day for at least an hour or two.
* In September, I am moving to be closer to her - 800 miles will go down to 80. 

BUT…  

* I have an internship in India this summer. I will be gone for 108 days. We discussed this before I went, and she agreed it would be crazy for me not to take it, so I did. But now we're worried.
* The time difference will make Skype/phone extremely challenging, due to her and my work schedules - one of us would have to stay up until 3 or 4am, most days.
* Even if we really work hard to Skype once or twice a week, it'll be a huge drop from what we're used to. Neither of us are great at email-writing, although we're both willing to try. 
* Selfishly, I don't want to feel ""tied down"" to having to make Skype appointments, or meet email quotas (x per week). I want to be able to take full advantage of this opportunity and not feel like I'm missing out because of her, because I know it'll breed resentment and be bad for us. But at the end of the day, I'll do whatever I need to for this to work - I don't want to lose her, more than anything.
* We've discussed maybe ""taking a break"" and she says she's fine with it, although seems a little hurt by the idea. It's probably also a selfish idea - we both love each other tremendously, but it'll be harder for her than me, as she'll be at home living normal life minus me, while I'll have lots of exciting adventures to distract me from how much I miss her. I'd only want to take a break to lower expectations on me re: keeping in touch, which seems rather mean. If we took a break, in practice, neither of us would be with anyone else during that break.

Anyone got any ideas or thoughts? Both of us want to be together come September. Think we're better off taking a break, or staying together and trying to make it work somehow? Advice? Thanks! :)"

About a month ago my department went on a whirleyball outing that she was invited to. On the car ride over there she dropped, what was in my opinion, a very obvious hint when talking about a SO. She said ""No i havent had a boyfriend in a while"" almost like she wanted someone in the car to hear it.  I have only started talking to her in the last 2 months because one of my tasks relies directly on her department . My question to Reddit: Is it worth it to ""shit where I eat"" to pursue this girl?

 A little background on my current life situation: I am working almost full time for this company and have never had a real girlfriend or any other type of romantic interaction with the opposite sex. My parents are starting to question my sexuality ( im not gay, trust me) and its making me feel like shit. I want to start dating but i am by no means in shape or a confident guy so any tips( or subreddits) would be welcomed."

I've got an internship with a company based in Boston for the Summer and I'm in need of some housing.  My checklist is as follows:

* Be within a 30-45 commute of where I will be working (which is Federal Street).  I don't have a car, but I can walk and use public transportation.
* (affordable) Grocery store nearby.
* Kitchen (&amp; fridge).  I don't need something super fancy, just a place to cook meals and store food.
* Safe &amp; quiet neighboorhood.  I don't care about the noise levels during the day, but past 11PM, I would like it to be quiet.
* I would prefer to sleep in a room with no one else.  (i.e. my own room with a bed, don't care if it's tiny, just want privacy at night)
* Internet.

Please PM me for any offers or questions.  Thanks!"

Then this girl and I started talking (she's 19, and goes to school 35~ minutes north of me). Turns out we have a lot in common and are pretty open with each other, but are both kinda socially awkward in general. I really like her, and I think she has similar feelings about me (neither of us have talked about this, but I know I've made it fairly obvious, and she hasn't said anything negative in response).

With summer coming up soon, she's going to the east coast for an internship, and I'm staying in the midwest. I want to ask her out, but for one I don't really know how, and for another, even if she says yes, we're going our own ways in a couple weeks for 3 months.

Anyone have any advice for me? Thanks~"

I have applied and have been waiting to hear back from an agency in NYC for an internship this summer. I have applied to work in strategy and I feel that my cover letter, resume, and interview all give/gave a good image of me. I also have two people at the company (a Director of Strategy and a Creative Director) vouching for me as I shadowed them last summer and assisted them on their accounts. 

I have heard from one of these directors that there are three internship slots available: one is filled by the American Association of Advertising Agencies, one is filled through a memorial scholarship fund, and the third (which is in analytics) is the one that seems to be the most open. I have a talk with Senior Analyst from the agency set up to learn more about the specifics of the field and have prepared questions for our talk.

My question to you is this: given that analytics is the field that I have the best chance of scoring an internship in, what is the best way to indicate interest in it to HR? Should I just drop my interviewer and email and let them know I had this chat and that I am interested by it or should I be more subtle? I don't want to come off as TOO pushy or as using my inside contacts to gain secret information to better my chances. Any advice at all would be appreciated!  "

So, I just started a programming internship, and I'm having trouble dealing with my manager. I work in a small office with 7 other programmers who are all male, and my manager is one of my closest friends who suggested that I apply for this job. I just started last week, but I'm having troubles dealing with him in a work environment. I understand that there is a separation between personal life and a work environment, but I feel like he is treating me differently since I am a close friend. He is really sarcastic about me towards all of the other coworkers, and it's really irritating since I have never met my other coworkers so they have this immediate negative connotation towards me. When I was first introduced to my coworkers, they asked if I was going to start working there (full-time), and my boss/friend replied that ""oh no, she's too stupid""(albeit in a joking way, but it's still really irritating when I had never met this people, and now I'm going to be working with them for x amount of hours per week). It's also really frustrating since whenever I ask him a question he makes a ""females can't code"" joke, or just gives me an answer without even hearing my question because he assumes that I have a really basic question for him. 

I know he is not normally like this to his other coworkers, and I know that he doesn't actually mean what he's saying- it's just that he's very comfortable around me that he's acting this way. I don't want to snap at him, because he is a very close friend, and I probably wouldn't have been able to get this internship otherwise since my class standing is above what they normally hire (they heavily prefer freshman/soph)

How do I approach him about this?"
