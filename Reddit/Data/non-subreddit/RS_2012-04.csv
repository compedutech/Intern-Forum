rnn4p,3,2012-04-01,Some school/career advice from seasoned veterans?,kettlestreets,animation,https://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/rnn4p/some_schoolcareer_advice_from_seasoned_veterans/,"Hey folks, I'm about to finish up a BFA in studio art and I've been accepted to Ringling and SCAD for animation - I'm looking to get trained in computer animation. I can't seem to pick between the two. They each have their pros and cons.

Ringling has a top notch reputation as being a hub for talented animators; however, I will get zero financial aid (32k per year!) and they seem to 'force' their students into working in a Pixar/Disney style. While I have no qualms about working in the mainstream style, I kind of want to do my own thing too (at least in my free time) and I'm worried about the lack of creative freedom. SCAD doesn't seem to have as good of a reputation (and the student work is not quite on par with Ringling's) but I can probably graduate in three years with 60k of debt and the chance to study abroad. I've also heard that their career services is not as good since the program is so huge. However, I have to say that I am leaning towards SCAD because of their aid package.

Are any of you guys grads of either programs? If you are, how did your job searches start out? If you are professionally working, have you got any tips for this starry-eyed student, whether it be about schools, internships or jobs?

Cheers! Thanks a bunch!"

I just turned 20, I'm a female student attending a very good college, and I've just been disowned by family. The are crazy and intent on stripping me of everything I need to have a life because they feel that I am the source of all their conflicts and don't appreciate anything, when in reality they instigate many conflicts themselves.

I don't have a permanent place to live.
I don't have a permanent job.
They are canceling my health insurance.
They REFUSE to give me info to fill out my FAFSA so I can return to school after the two years I've spent here doing amazing work.

I've found a sublet, an internship, but I don't know what else to do. I've been to my school's counseling services and they don't do anything--just listen to me talk about my problems and nod their heads. I need to find support somewhere, I have absolutely no one.

Can anyone tell me a) How to talk to irrational, childish people who have absolutely no interest in the truth or logic
or b) Any kind of social services that might be available to someone who is not a minor but still a student with no familial support?

I'm so desperate.

Everything I've worked for is being taken from me, and nobody is on my side."
rndil,2,2012-04-01,"After a week of ""no contact,"" I've gone numb...",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/rndil/after_a_week_of_no_contact_ive_gone_numb/,"This is a long one so if you're not in it for the long haul, feel free to skip to the end where the question is...

So here's the story, my ex (22F) broke up with me (24M) almost 3 months ago.  We met about 8 years ago and became friends.  We lived in different states, but her father lived near me and we would see each other when she came out to visit him around holidays and over the summers.  We had various ""flings"" over the years and maintained a lighthearted ""flirty"" friendship.  Almost 2 years ago now, I decided to fly out and visit her.  Feelings resurfaced on both sides and after a hectic summer we both admitted that we had fallen in love.  She still had a year of college left and I was now entering a phase of jumping from internship to internship until someone would hopefully hire me. Over the next year and a half we carried on our long distance relationship.  She finished school and moved to a big city where she got a ""grown-up job,"" I continued to jump from internship to internship in various states.  We would spend a few hours on the phone together everyday and we would see each other in person over varying lengths of time.  In January, while I was spending one last visit with her shortly before i moved out of state for another 3 months, she told me she couldn't handle the distance anymore and that we had to break up.  She said that ""it never felt like a real relationship,"" that she was ""growing to resent"" me, and that she couldn't keep waiting for me anymore.

After I moved away again she would still call me on her drive home from work like she always did.  She told me that she couldn't just cut me out of her life because I was her best friend.   On a couple of relatively humiliating occasions, I broke down and told her how badly I wanted to be with her again but she always replied that she had to do what was best for her and that even though it doesn't seem like it, breaking things off now was the best choice in the long run.  

She seemed to be doing fine with everything, but over the next 2 and a half months I felt worse everyday. Every time I hung up the phone, after talking to her, I was on the verge of tears.  My self-confidence (something I've always struggled with) was at an absolute all-time low.  I couldn't tell her how miserable I was because I couldn't handle hearing her say ""this is best"" again.  She was still my ""best friend"" but I couldn't tell her what was on my mind anymore.  
Eventually I decided that my last chance at getting past anything would be to go into ""no contact.""  I sent her a long winded e-mail explaining everything I was feeling.  I told her how miserable I was, how angry I was with her, and how humiliated I was.  I told her she could call me that night if she wanted, but the next morning I would be cutting all lines of communication.
She called that night and we spent a long phone call and skype conversation just kinda spilling our feeling to each other. I was surprised that she admitted that she still loved me and that she stills wants to be with me, but once again, the distance made things impossible.  She didn't want to do no contact but she accepted that it was what I wanted and that she would give me all the time I needed.

That was a week ago, so where am I now?  Honestly, I feel numb.  I feel completely emotionless.  I don't really feel sad anymore, I don't feel happy anymore either.  I am completely disinterested in the world around me.  I don't talk to people unless or leave the house I have to. There's a couple people in my life encouraging me to get out and be social again but I just don't have any will to do so. 
If I had typed this post a week ago, I wouldn't have been able to see through me tears, and now as far as my emotions are concerned, I'm writing a lab report.
And the strangest thing? Two days ago I was asked to fly out to her city for a job interview.

So my question is this: After a week of ""no contact"" I went from being a crying, miserable, wreck to a completely numb, emotionless, anti-social shell.  Is this improvement or regression?"

rn2ee,3,2012-03-31,Should I end it or keep working on it?,teersofhops,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rn2ee/should_i_end_it_or_keep_working_on_it/,"Hopefully he doesn't see this as he is also a redditor, but I don't think he comes to this subreddit. Anyway, this is a little bit lengthy, but I hope you'll read it.

Firstly, some background- I am 23(F) and he is 28. 
We first met five years ago, but only started dating about a year and 10 months ago. Our relationship moved pretty fast- we were basically living together for a while and were fairly serious. He helped through some really tough times (I had PTSD and was recovering from an assault I had faced at the hands of a peer). He has been very supportive and protective of me in the while we stayed together. We had a fairly loving relationship, and were almost playing house I guess.

-

We've been LDR for the last 8 months. I was living across the country (or continent, rather, since we're Canadian but I was down in the States) from September to December for an internship opportunity. Then, by a twist of fate, we swapped places as he went down there raise capital for his startup while I came back to school.

-


Anyway, some problems we've faced: firstly, I'm of Indian origin and he isn't. My family wouldn't mind him, except that he has been utterly disdainful of them from the beginning, and now they don't like him. In addition to this, he sees Indian culture as backwards, never wants to go there, and scoffed at my vegetarianism until recently. He said he changed his mind recently, but only after he sensed I was pulling away. 

-


Secondly, he recently decided he wasn't going to finish his undergrad until an indefinite later date. He started his undergrad at the same time I did, but was obviously about four years older than I am. We were both in a fairly specialized (&gt; 4 years) electrical engineering program when he decided to drop out, then changed faculties a bunch of times before deciding to do his startup. He is a really smart guy, but this has left me feel super disappointed, as I am almost done. The one thing big thing here is that I will likely be working abroad full time once I am done, but won't be able to sponsor him, and he may not be able to get an appropriate visa without an undergrad. I also don't really know what to say to my family, who were already not too happy that he switched out of engineering. 

-

My future earning power is also much higher than his now and because of this, he would make me spend on tickets and hotels for him to come visit me even though I couldn't afford it due to school. He later told me he just wanted to see me and keep me company, and I understand that.

-


Those are the two main problems. Others have included the fact that being with him started to become isolating. He didn't like me hanging out and drinking with my male friends (even though they were my friends out of necessity, being in engineering). He accused me of cheating a few times over the last 8 months, though I convinced him I wasn't and he believed me. He would argue with me frequently over trivial things, like using Linux over OSX (he preferred the latter) and would often tell me to get out or make me sleep on the couch. He would frequently ask me to choose between my family and him, saying if he wanted a traditional Indian girl who wanted her family, he wouldn't have dated me. He is fairly argumentative in general, and has gotten up in my friends' faces for disagreeing with him in the past (he can pull it off because he is a big guy), and would also get upset at me for telling him to stop.

-

I don't know what to do. I've been unhappy for a while, but I love him. We talked recently and he cried profusely, saying he was willing to change if I gave him a chance. He says he loves me and asked me remember all the good times we've had. His startup recently received a lot of funding (a LOT), and I think he's been using that to try and reel me back in, but I don't know. I love him so much. I really do. But this relationship stresses me out to the point that I am no longer attracted to him and I am scared that I'll be isolated from my friends and family.

What do I do? I am so scared. He comes back from the States this Thursday and I have to give him an answer.

**TL;DR** BF doesn't like my family/culture, dropped out of undergrad, does other things to stress me out. What do?"

I'm 19 years old, and went to culinary school directly after graduating high school. After an accelerated 6 month course, I worked as an intern at a one Michelin Star restaurant, and got hired after a couple months as garde manger.

I've been working at this place for a year now. The trouble is, I'm starting to realize that I don't see a future in doing this. No matter how much I love cooking and working the line, I just don't have a dream of running a kitchen of my own-- Not a real dream, anyway, if that makes sense. I realized that the want of running a kitchen as a chef was an ""expected"" dream that I sort of ran with because I figured that's what you did later on.

Don't get me wrong, I love my job. I work the station faster than anyone, can plate three station's stuff, and help out everyone else whenever I can. I'm not lazy, I bust my ass day in and day out, and don't have too much of a problem with any aspect of work as of the moment. I have a lot of passion for what I do, and always want to learn and always am excited to see new things.

It's hard though, to see myself really running a restaurant. Not because I don't want to do it, nor that I don't think I can do it a decade down the line, but just that it's not something I jump at. It's odd, and hard to explain, but... I just don't see a happy future as a chef. I've no trouble with long hours and low pay right now, but as I hear, hours only get longer and the pay doesn't get very much better later on(though money is honestly a non-issue). I guess what I'm most scared of is never seeing friends and family and regretting it later on in life.

Should I quit out while I'm ahead, go back to college for who-knows-what with the money I've saved from working, or should I push on and hope that I'll truly want to have a kitchen of my own someday, and that it'll turn out alright?

ruza4,5,2012-04-05,Day 1 ... Thank you /r/leaves for opening my eyes so I could reassess my situation,StrangeDaze17,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ruza4/day_1_thank_you_rleaves_for_opening_my_eyes_so_i/,"Hello all,

I wanted to post my story as a way to vent, and also to show my appreciation to this subreddit - which ultimately forced me to take a look at my habit and reassess my situation.

It all started freshman year of college. My dorm roommate was getting into MJ and me being the adventurous type, I figured I'll give it a try. From there I only would smoke on special occasions, most of my efforts were concentrated on getting hammered and living college life to the ""fullest"" in that respect. Despite the heavy partying, I was still able to make deans list for both semesters that year. Then sophomore year came and I moved into a house with my dorm roommate and a couple other friends from high school. EVERYONE was toking up regularly except me..because I was pre-med and I needed to get shit done. Well, needless to say that didn't last long..before I knew it I was smoking everyday, playing lots of Halo. Hell, our house was renamed ""the cave"" because it was usually dark, musty and smoky ALL the time. Each semester my grades went lower, and my motivation to succeed diminished. Also, from experience various clubs and volunteering activities I decided I did NOT want to go to med school. Im sure MJ had some influence on this, but in hindsight I am really glad I decided not to pursue med school. Anyway, this gave me the excuse to smoke more..My train of thought went from ""Med school here I come!"" to "" wellll ... As long as I graduate I'll be fine"". Luckily for me, I had enough brain power to receive passing grades w/o EVER going to class. At the end of my junior year I hit bottom..but there was light .. I scored an internship with a respected Pharma company, and I met my wife.. Because of fear of a drug test and my new romance, I was easily distracted from MJ. I quit cold turkey. I would smoke once every few months if I was around old friends but that's it -- it stayed this way for about 2 years. 

In late 2009 I got reacquainted with an old college buddy who was just getting into it. We would hangout once a week and smoke. It was not long before I convinced my fiancé that it was OK for me to do it at the house. 

Here is where it gets interesting.. I have been vaping pretty much everyday since the start of 2010 - except for several extended vacations and work travel. Weird thing is, during this time, I have really advanced my career, invested in real estate, and broadened my knowledge in Music (I play), politics, economics, and science. It's almost like MJ has reinvigorated my love for learning new things. I have not neglected relationships either..And last year I lost over 50 lbs from good eating and lots of exercise. It almost seems that 2011 was my most accomplished year..in fact a lot of friends and family look up to me as an accomplished individual..but then again, none of them know exactly HOW MUCH I smoke. 

It's weird, in my mind, it seems like a problem, but the results do not tell the same story. This subreddit has really helped me identify some issues I am having:

* I depend on it for sleep. Can't fall asleep fast without it.
* find myself in the reward loop .."" well if I do this, then I can smoke""
* I am more irritable when I do not smoke
* think about toking up a lot!
* guilty conscience sometimes when I smoke

I guess before I saw this subreddit, I had the mindset of, ""we'll MJ isn't a REAL drug, it's basically harmless."" and ""well it is better than drinking, who needs all those calories"". However, after reading some stories on here it really opened my eyes to the fact that people do really struggle with MJ addiction.

I have been thinking of taking a break or possibly giving it up for good over the past couple weeks. I stumbled upon this subreddit last night, and to my dismay discovered that, I proabably do have a problem. I immediately decided not to smoke before bed, and then I flushed what MJ I had left down the toilet this morning. 

So here I am, day 1 of an extended t-break or perhaps giving it up forever. Wish me luck! I fear that stopping this time around will be more difficult because I don't have the major distraction/replacement I had back in college.

Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and experiences, it truly is a great thing to have a community like this. Comments and questions are welcome!

rutgt,7,2012-04-05,Need some advice...,Protagoris,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/rutgt/need_some_advice/,"First, we are an American couple. My SO is a little over 20 weeks pregnant now. I'm currently in a masters program for secondary education, and frankly don't have enough time to work. Especially when my internship and student teaching starts this fall.  Currently my parents help me (because they can, and they're wonderful) to cover all the bills. My SO lives with me, and works full time at a daycare.  However, the job is an hours drive to and from every day on a toll road, and with gas prices right now she spends anywhere from 100-125 dollars in travel every week.  Also, daycare work pays about 8 dollars an hour. It's not great. So she basically pays her car payment, gas, tolls, insurance, credit cards, and student loans, and barely has anything left over.

Every day she comes home depressed and too tired to do anything. I do all the cooking, most of the cleaning. I don't mind doing all this work to take care of her. I see it as part of my duty as her SO, but she feels guilty for not being bale to help more.

She hates her job, dreads it, and cries almost every day because of it.  She's afraid of what all this stress and depression is doing to our baby, and her own health.

Her contract with the school is up late May, but every day it seems like she is about to quit. The only problem is, if she quits, she can't cover her finances. I have some savings and my parents can help for awhile, but it can only go so far. I already feel bad for not being able to just take care of her, and that I'm having to sustain us off my parents.  My SO doesn't help with rent, food costs, and I cover her phone bill. (Don't get the impression that I'm complaining. I don't mind any of this, do my best to not make her feel guilty, do everything I can to support her).

On weekends she's a completely different person. Excited, full of life, and energy.

I'm afraid of her pushing herself too much, and I worry about her being on a busy high way for two hours a day in a fairly small car. If she quits she's afraid no one else will hire her, and that she wont be able to get unemployment.

We're thinking about asking her doctor for some sort of note, but not sure on how to go about it.

Has anyone else been in this situation? Does anyone have advice?

TL;DR - My SO hates her job and it seems to ruin her mental health. Afraid of not being hired, not getting unemployment, and may ask doctor for a note. Any advice?"
rur86,8,2012-04-05,"Worried about job opportunities, upcoming senior",terrifiedundergrad,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/rur86/worried_about_job_opportunities_upcoming_senior/,"First off let me explain my situation.

I'm a junior majoring business admin, double concentrating in accounting and finance. 

I plan to have the 30 extra accounting hours and 150 total hours by the time I graduate to be completely CPA eligible (other than the working part of course). This is on my resume by the way.

My culm. GPA is mediocre/bad because I switched majors and the last one really hit me hard. My 'major' GPA is a bit above 3.2, that's counting only business classes, if I counted only accounting/finance courses it  would be a bit higher, I haven't gotten anything less than a B in these courses.

Now the problem is I can't get an internship, I have zero experience, and I have pretty much withdrawn from campus life because I'm just so anxious and insecure about my position. So my resume looks even worse. 

I'm going into my senior year next year, and I'll be finishing up the few accounting/finance courses I have left. Recruiting season is in early fall, all of the Big 4 come to recruit but do I even have a chance? Smaller firms come as well. 

I'm just dying from anxiety at this point every day. Anyone have any ideas in mind that could help?"

Soon, it will have been a year since I made a life-altering decision. A decision that I felt was right, and I will never regret fighting for what I felt was the right thing. The side effects are what hurt worst though. When I made this decision, most of my friends left me. One stayed, but a few months ago she just quit talking to me. So I do without. My family turned their back on me as well. I have a couple of siblings left and that's all. I know it all seems so petty, but I've always been about the little things. They make me happy, but when a lot of little things go wrong, they overshadow the good. I try to focus on the good, but my mind just keeps slipping away from it.

The word ""friend"" feels very hollow now. I use it sometimes, but I don't mean it in the same way. After seeing all of my ""friends"" suddenly and gradually turn on me, it's hard to build up a relationship with anyone now. I haven't had a girlfriend in a year and really haven't had the desire to be in a relationship either.
There are a lot of people who look up to me. They see the big accomplishments that I've done, and I am grateful for that. I see them too and they make me feel good, but I just break up like this sometimes. I feel like a skyscraper whose foundation is crumbling. No one sees the foundation, they just see the big accomplishments. Meanwhile, I'm deteriorating beneath.

No, I don't want to die. But my life feels useless. Hollow. I have limited relationships with the people around me. I've been working to better myself by going to college and applying for internships, public speaking, appearing on podcasts and radio shows and trying to turn my initially bad experience a year ago into something positive, but my life doesn't feel right. I have meaning in my life, don't get me wrong. I just have no connections with people. I work four days a week, play video games the rest of the days, and only interact with housemates.

I miss having a friend to talk to. A lot of people offer assistance, but it doesn't compare. I don't know them and I don't want to for some reason. I want someone I can connect with, and for now I just feel disconnected from everyone. I guess I'm done whining."

Here's my story, I got accepted for a very well paying computer science internship for this summer at a fortune 100 company, and I stopped my daily 'after 10pm' MFLB sessions of 2-3 inhales a night in preparation for the pre-employment drug test 6 weeks from now (and also for focusing on school). The weed is not a real big issue, it's inconvenient that I can't vape a little weed after ~8 hours of straight studying and going to bed with a tired out mind, but I obviously HAVE to pass this test and I know my priorities so I know with time this goes away. The thing is, is that every night since I stopped, I've been having dreams related to acid, shrooms, drug tests, hash oil, etc. I'm not used to remembering my dreams so much because I used to always fall asleep high, but it's been a common recurrence that all my dreams are related to drugs in one way or another. Last night I had a dream my drug test was supposed to happen at that very moment in time, and although I could possibly pass the weed test, I was worried about failing the amphetamines test for taking aderall the day before. Another dream I had decided to eat an eighth of shrooms, while being at my house with my parents around asking me to do chores for them, which also had me worried.

A key factor that plays a role in these dreams and something I should mention, is that a week AFTER my drug test and a week BEFORE my internship begins, there is a huge music festival I've been anticipating for a while. I plan to spend the weekend of the festival in a totally different dimension, mescaline one day, shrooms another, candyflipping the last. I've bought all this stuff in advance, and it's all tucked away in a safe 20 miles away at home. I do plan on smoking that weekend, having taken the drug test the week before, but once I begin my internship and thus beginning my future career, I can't say weed will be in my life anymore and I plan to quit for good. I don't look like a hippie, nor do I act like one, and I don't want to be doing the things I've been doing at my age for the next stage of my life, so I've come to accept it.

I'm being distracted all day thinking about this festival, and once I sleep I am literally dreaming it too. I'm not sure what I'm trying to ask you guys, other than how do I keep this off my mind."
rtv5z,2,2012-04-04,FA Summer: What should I do this Summer?,TheNoi,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/rtv5z/fa_summer_what_should_i_do_this_summer/,"**BackStory:** Previous summers my brother and I would do all sorts of adventurous things, (hiking, swimming, bouldering, fishing, etc...). Long story short, he moved out of state last year. Since he was the real motivational driver to do these things (always been a gamer myself) I find myself in a quandary as to how I could motivate myself to do these things on my own or a comparable activity to fill the void. So far I've come up with three options:

A) I could man up and go it alone. 

B) Maybe a companion, specifically a dog, who could partially take the place of my brother as adventure encouragement to get back into the wilderness (though my brother was more the leader and I the tag along). 

C) Give up and just play video games like last summer.

**What I think:**

A) Going it alone seems like the most practical solution, except that I find myself giving up and admitting defeat rather easily without some outside encouragement. I know all about the 'set your mind to it', 'man up and do it', but past experience has shown my resolve probably won't see it through.

B) Getting a dog is certainly one of my goals ever since my brother's/mine died while I was a junior in high school. They are awesome adventuring companions. The problem is that during fall and spring semesters I really don't have the time to properly care for a dog. Is it okay to get a dog, but semi abandon it for 40-60 hours of the week when school starts up again? Are there any FAers who have had a dog and not had a problem with leaving it alone for long periods of time during the week? Any tips on raising a dog not to have seperation anxiety when you aren't capable of giving it a large amount of time?


C) I don't have a problem with playing video games all summer, I rather like them. Lately they just haven't had the same draw as they use to.

I guess I just wanted to see what reddit thinks or if you guys have any additional insight in how to fill up the free time of summer? I do have some summer classes and hopefully an internship, so its unlikely I'll be able to travel (or I would go stay with my brother for the summer). 

What other options do I have?

rx0jq,7,2012-04-06,My experience as a Performer Magazine intern — F*** those guys.,[deleted],RealJournalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealJournalism/comments/rx0jq/my_experience_as_a_performer_magazine_intern_f/,"Hello Reddit,

I wanted to share this with you guys, although I'm not sure how interesting it is to people other than me. It's relevant for journalists or anyone else looking to build their resume.

I wrote music reviews and the occasional feature as an intern for Performer Magazine in 2010. There were no problems, whatsoever. My writing was printed verbatim (a bit weird in itself), and the EIC and I got along fine. It was a remote internship, as I live in Washington and Performer is an East Coast publication.

After my internship, I asked for a letter of reference (what else is an unpaid internship good for?). The Editor in Chief said he would get it to me the following week. At first I was very patient, but he never delivered. Weeks passed, possibly months before I wrote him again. He told me had, in fact, already written my letter and that he would email it to me as a .pdf after he wrapped up the current issue of Performer. I wanted to ask why he didn't just attach the letter in the email he was writing to me at the time, but I simply said ""sure,"" and waited some more. That was several months ago — the last I ever heard from them. I have called and written them numerous times to no response over the months.

My new employer, lacking a letter of reference to check after my job interview, called Performer Magazine and left a message. They never returned my employer's message. I have no idea why Performer started avoiding me, but they left me high and dry when i needed a reference.

A couple days ago, after more unanswered emails and calls, I realized I was never going to get a reference from them. So, I took to posting on their facebook page. Nothing offensive, no swearing, just kind of bugging them. I knew they weren't going to give me any letter at this point, but I also knew they couldn't do anything to me. Every time I posted a comment, Performer deleted it immediately. Stuff like ""What would you do if I actually showed up to your office? Would you hide behind the curtains until I walked away?"" or, ""I wonder how long it will take for this to be deleted?"" got removed within minutes. Pretty uneventful, sure, until...

LO AND BEHOLD, Yesterday I got a response to one of my wall posts! It went as follows: ""Kevin, our company wishes to have no further communication with you. Please stop calling, emailing and posting to our social media sites. Further attempts by you to contact us will be ignored.""

...and then they deleted that post as well. I took a screenshot this time, it's in the album.

**TL; DR: 6 MONTHS OF FREE WORK AND PERFORMER MAGAZINE WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A REFERENCE, EVEN AFTER CLAIMING THEY ALREADY WROTE IT FOR ME. THEY IGNORED ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THEM OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, AND THEY NEVER RETURNED MY PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER'S CALLS FOR A REFERENCE, EITHER.**

So, DAE want to troll Performer Magazine's facebook page? I was thinking it would be cool if everyone wrote something like ""Hey Ben, where's my reference letter?"" Or whatever tickles your fancy. If you ""Like"" Performer Magazine's facebook page, you can post on their wall. It would make my day GLORIOUS, FOR **I HATE THESE PRICKS.** *And admit it, you're bored as fuck right now.*

Yes, it is immature. But it would be really fun. And after this royal screw job, I'd say the ball's in my court.

[PROOF] For some reason, I couldn't find all the emails, but I dug up a few to show you the time span we are talking about. Also, screenshot of the facebook response they gave me.

Someone I really trusted threw me out like trash after confessing some form of love to me. It destroyed me. I trusted him so much. I relied on him more than I realized, and with him suddenly gone, I just couldn't keep it together. 

I was overwhelmed. All of my applications for study abroad and leadership positions were denied by my honors college even though I was overly qualified for all of them. My grandmother passed away. I ended up having to drop a class because I couldn't handle the stress. All of my friends began avoiding me because I was always so busy and irritable because all I could only ever think of the work that I needed to do. It was terrible.

My self confidence vanished. I didn't find myself attractive anymore. I hated my body. I hated everything about myself. I would cry myself to sleep every night feeling completely alone and heartbroken. My desire to write completely vanished, and with it, a piece of myself died. 

Now, six months later, I feel good about myself. I found out today that I didn't get the positions because of a fluke in the system, and I was invited to apply again next year with the promise that I would probably get the positions. One of the heads of the honors college admitted that she adored me and wanted me to be an active part in it. I've also become a major part of the Honors Congress, and I plan to join a committee and run for a position next semester. 

I changed my major to biology, and the department head is excited to get me on track so that I can take the classes that I want. He's working with me to get an internship at the local conservancy. I've started making new friends and actively going out of my way to greet people. It feels wonderful. 

I fall asleep every night with a smile on my face now, and I am genuinely happy. My life is really turning around, and today was the first day that I finally admitted it. After all of those months of hell, I'm better of then when it started. "
rwkqj,23,2012-04-06,"When my mother asked my therapist if he could help me work on focus &amp; follow up, he said ""That's Aspergers,"" and we should ""Probably try to get your son on disability.""",unholyprawn,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/rwkqj/when_my_mother_asked_my_therapist_if_he_could/,"Sorry in advance as this post is mostly me venting my spleen. 

For the past 4 months, I have been seeing a new therapist to help me work on my depression and my Aspergers. So far, we have gotten my depression under control and now we are working on what is for me, (and so I have heard many with AS) is a major problem and so far the largest impediment to my success; focus &amp; follow up.

In the past month I have been doing poorly at school and have not found a new job (my prior internship ended on 3 March on good terms). Because of the relatively poor direction my life is taking, my mother thought it would be wise to reach out to my therapist in order to help me work on those two issues. The therapist told her that we would try upping the dosage of the ADHD medicine, but not to expect much because ""That's Aspergers, and we really can't do much about it."" He also suggested that we (myself, my mother, him, and his assistant) should ""Try to get your son on disability.""

I honestly don't know weather to be more enraged, upset, or disappointed. To think that a professional doctor in the heart of New York City would be so defeatist stuns me. It is common knowledge that people with AS can hold very good jobs, do well in school and so much more, and that he would just dismiss me is so wrong. Making matters worse is that he and I have only met once (normally I deal with his assistant), and during that time he kept checking his watch frequently. 

I end this post with a couple of questions.

1) Does anyone else on this subreddit have difficulty with focus and followup? If so, how have you managed to overcome this?

2) Are the beliefs held by my former therapist common?

3) Does anyone have any recommendations for a psychologist/psychiatrist/neurologist in New York City who has expertise in Aspergers/Depression/Family issues? I know it may be a stretch to ask this question, but any help is appreciated. "
rw3aq,16,2012-04-06,"Going to see a psychiatrist tomorrow for adderall, considering talking about anxiety problems instead.",Oliphauntintheroom,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/rw3aq/going_to_see_a_psychiatrist_tomorrow_for_adderall/,"Over the past couple years i've come to suspect that what I thought was a mild life long depression, really could be Generalized anxiety disorder. I find myself often overcome with negative thoughts about my relationship, my future, my apparence, and my interaction with other people.

When I was in forth grade I was diagnosed and treated for OCD, after I became obsessed with the fear of my mom dying. I couldn't leave her site for almost a year, just barley got away with passing 4th grade because of it. Soon After I was treated, the OCD symptoms completely went away. My biggest fear is that someday Ill be triggered by something that will cause an extreme obsessive  thought like that to manifest again. 

After my symptoms went away, my family never mentioned it again. It was something that I hardly thought about. In high school I did a lot of worrying and stressing about my life, but it didn't really become something that drastically effected me till about my sophomore year of college. 

When I was about 20 I completely became withdrawn and depressed. I pretty much stopped leaving my apartment, and ended up being put on academic suspension for a semester because of my grades. After that I started to see a psychiatrist who put me on adderall. 

Adderall ended up really helping me for a while. In my semester off from college I worked a lot and saved money, and when I came back to school, things really turned around for me. Even though mentally I didn't feel perfect, I was able to accomplish a lot, and I was generally happier then before. After about a year on it, I decided to stop going to my psychiatrist because of money and somewhat because of my parents worry about me becoming dependent on it. 
Ever since I've always wondered if things would be better for me if I were back on it. Sometimes I buy a few here and there from friends, and I feel really great for a week.

 I'm at a very challenging time for me right now. I'm about to graduate from college, and I am in the process of applying to grad schools, getting my portfolio together (i'm a designer/copywriter), and applying for internships. I don't feel like Ive been emotionally stable enough to accomplish any of this right now, and they've been piling up and weighing on me more then anything ever has. 
I could go to the psychiatrist tomorrow and get adderall. I know it has worked for me in the past, but i'm convinced that my real problems are anxiety. Or I could try to be treated for my anxiety, and risk wasting precious time that I don't have right now figuring out what medications work for me, etc. 

Reddit, what should I do? I'm leaning toward going back on adderall till the end of the semester and bring up my anxiety problems in the summer, when Ill have time to experiment. 

I'd really appreciate peoples opinions, just found this subreddit, but it seems like a really great resource. "
rvvdf,4,2012-04-06,10 Things Every Parent Should Know About College by Michelle Crouch,voxpupil,personaleducation,https://www.reddit.com/r/personaleducation/comments/rvvdf/10_things_every_parent_should_know_about_college/,"If you’re the parent of a high-achieving high school student prepared to spend whatever it takes to send your kid to an Ivy League college, authors Claudia Dreifus and Andrew Hacker have some unlikely advice: Don’t do it.

Dreifus, a New York Times writer and an adjunct professor at Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, and Hacker, a veteran political science professor at Queens College in New York, spent three years interviewing faculty, students, and administrators and crunching statistics for their book, Higher Education? How Colleges Are Wasting Our Money and Failing Our Kids — And What We Can Do About It. Their finding? That many of America’s colleges and universities — especially the elite — aren’t worth their tuition and serve faculty over their undergrads.

More outrageous, they say, is that tuition nationwide has jumped at more than twice the rate of inflation since 1982, so many kids graduate deeply in debt. “Tuition is probably the second-largest item you’ll buy in your lifetime, after your home,” Dreifus says. Given that, the authors suggest you consider the following as you bear down on the decision of where your child will spend the next four (or more) years.

1. Beginning adulthood without debt is worth far more than a designer diploma.

The authors’ No. 1 rule for parents: Don’t let your child go into debt for college. In 2010, almost two thirds of undergraduates borrowed money, and student-loan debt outpaced credit card debt for the first time. The College Board likes to say that a typical senior graduates with “only” $24,000 in debt, but with interest, collection charges, and penalties for postponed payments, the amounts owed can exceed $100,000. If you ever default on a federal student loan (and the rate of defaults is rising), you’ll be hounded for life. Lenders can garnish your wages, intercept your tax refunds, and have your professional license revoked. You can’t work for the government or collect your social security. “People have been sold this propaganda: ‘The rates are so low; just get a loan,’ ” Dreifus says. “The long-term effect is to cripple your children.”

2. Research universities are no place for undergraduates.

Professors at big research universities are often more interested in doing research and working with graduate students than teaching your child because their prestige (and their university’s) depends on publishing. So they tend to host huge lectures and then foist undergrads off on teaching assistants who may or may not be supervised. “At Harvard, we ran into students who said they never had a professor who had enough of a relationship with them to write a recommendation for grad school,” Dreifus says. How to avoid that? Go to a school that’s completely dedicated to teaching, like a four-year liberal arts college with little to no research. “Look for seminars where 15 to 20 people sit around a table,” Dreifus says. “The big question we want parents to ask: Is this a place that’s about developing my child’s mind?”

3. Colleges are overrun by administrators.

Student-to-faculty ratios are important, of course. But it might also be wise to ask about the proportion of administrators to students. Between 1976 and 2007, that ratio has doubled at colleges nationwide, the authors say, with bureaucrats serving in such roles as “babysitting coordinator,” “dietetic internship director,” and “residential communications coordinator.” Such services may be useful, but are they really necessary? “You should ask yourself, Is this really a college, or is this a giant multiversity with a lot of extraneous functions? Because that’s going to end up costing you,” Hacker says. “It’s a big reason tuition can now run a quarter-million dollars for four years.”

4. The star professors touted in college brochures probably won’t be teaching your kid.

Universities and colleges are increasingly relying on underpaid, part-time instructors to lead undergraduate courses. Contingent teachers, including paid-by-the-course adjunct professors, now do 70 percent of college teaching, up from 43 percent in 1975. (The elites aren’t immune: At Yale, the figure is 70 percent.) Most adjuncts don’t even have an office on campus, and because they make on average only about $3,000 a course, they often teach at three or four different colleges. “It’s hard to be a great teacher and to be there for your students when you’re juggling that many jobs,” Dreifus says.

5. The college’s best professors may not even be on campus.

Though they get their summers off and breaks during the school year, tenured faculty at many universities are encouraged to take frequent sabbaticals. What will that mean for your undergrad? At Harvard, where senior professors get a sabbatical every three years, 10 of the 48 professors in the history department — more than one in five — were off doing research in 2010/2011. During a recent year at Williams College, another school with a great reputation, a third of the professors in the religion department were on leave. If you choose a school that gives its faculty a lot of time for research, your son or daughter might find that his or her senior-thesis adviser is on sabbatical in Tuscany.

6. Don’t be seduced by the luxuries they show you on the tour.

Today’s students get suites, private bathrooms, and food courts with chefs that make sushi and Dijon chicken, not to mention jumbo Jacuzzis and five-story climbing walls. It’s all part of an extravagant amenities race that’s helping to push up tuition rates. “When we sneaked in on parent/student tours across the country, we were shocked at the number of questions parents asked about amenities,” Dreifus says. “A college doesn’t have to look like Club Med. In fact, I’d say you should be suspicious if a school has a lot of amenities. When a college has every kind of plaything, that tells you something about its priorities.”

7. Your tuition may be subsidizing a college president’s $1 million-plus salary.

College presidents create a tone and a direction for an institution, so take a look at the person at the top. Does he look like an educator? Has he switched to a new college every few years? What’s his salary? A growing number of higher education leaders are making more than $1 million a year. “When a president is remunerated the same way as a CEO, that’s a sign that the school has embraced the corporate model of doing things,” says Dreifus. “This should be a public service. A university president should not make more than the president of the United States.”

8. High-powered athletic programs drain money from academics.

Only a handful of athletic departments actually pay for themselves. The rest rely on your tuition and fees to help pay for coaches, trainers, equipment, and travel and lodging expenses for the players. Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama has more football coaches (seven) than it has professors in its history department (four). “If you didn’t have football, you could hire more history professors,” Hacker says. The other problem is that once colleges get into big-time sports, corruption tends to follow. Even Princeton recently had an alumnus who paid tuition for a tennis player in violation of NCAA rules, Hacker says. (The student agreed to repay the money to charity.) He acknowledges that some teenagers love the excitement of painting their faces in team colors and cheering for the home team. “How can I argue with that?” he says. “Except to say that you should recognize the trade-off: It’s depleting the quality of your education.”

9. Going to an elite university does not guarantee success.

To prove this point, Hacker and Dreifus tracked the 900-odd students who graduated from Princeton in 1973 to see if the school was delivering on its promise “to prepare students for positions of leadership,” whether in business, public service, or the arts, which Princeton administrators claim as their goal. “We were very disappointed,” Hacker says. “There were only a handful of recognized names in that class of 900. What that tells us is simply this: In America, if you put your talents to their best use, by the age of 35 or 36, you’ll be passing people from Princeton, no matter where you went to school.” Sure, the authors acknowledge, a designer degree might help you get into medical school or law school at Harvard, Stanford, or Yale. That’s a nice bonus if you can pay the full sticker price, they say, but not enough of an edge to saddle your child with many thousands of dollars in debt.

10. Honors colleges at public universities can offer as fine an education as the Ivy League.

The honors colleges at City University of New York, Arizona State, and the University of Mississippi, to name a few, offer the intimacy of a liberal arts college at state-school prices. “These students get first pick of classes and have special classes to themselves, and at Arizona State, they have their own dorms,” Dreifus says. “We met students in those honors colleges who got into Harvard and other elite schools, but they said they didn’t want to burden their parents with that kind of expense. Now that’s a smart kid.”

rvtn7,4,2012-04-06,Thought you guys would understand,According_To_Me,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/rvtn7/thought_you_guys_would_understand/,"So I recently started an (unpaid) internship and shortly after my laptop started slowing down. To top it off I have a supervisor who is absolutely clueless about what I do (even though he was the one who hired me for the position). It has been a very stressful four weeks. I'm working very hard to prove myself, but with my laptop slowing down I haven't been able to meet a few deadlines. I saw an old coworker earlier this week, and he gave me some indica because I needed to ""calm down"". And he was right. I haven't felt relaxed when I'm sober. Any way, I just needed to rant. Toke on, friends.

EDIT: Should've mentioned earlier, my hard drive was wiped clean and reinstalled so the computer is like new, except for the software I need to reinstall. "

rvj9h,22,2012-04-05,Long overdue rant,Welcome-To-Heartbrea,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rvj9h/long_overdue_rant/,"   Ok, before I kick this off, I just wanted to let you know, this might get long. It will also probably be downvoted to oblivion, as my complaints probably are insignificant compared to other legitimate posts. It might not even be downvoted as people will probably already be moving on to the next post, seeing as how I'm rambling even here. By all means, do what you have to do. This is, after all, a self-post, and meta-Hivemind dictates we not care about karma.  

So, I have no clue where to start this off, but I guess it could be this, seeing as I just got into an argument about it. A few weeks ago, my parents left the country for a week, business on my dad's part, shopping on my mom's. My grandmother, from my mother's side of the family, stayed with me and my younger sister during that week, as to drive my sister where she needed driving, etc. Now, I never really had anything against my grandmother. She's been in a different city, a few houses away from my uncle, for almost ten years. Lost contact, and having moved to a different country for about five years on two different occasions, I just plain didn't have much to do with her. I've never even been her tech kid. I'm everyone's tech kid. (This sentence sounds dumb as shit, but what I meant to convey is, if something went up with your computer, I'd get called over to reboot it, thus fixing the problem on 99% of occasions). She would always entrust this to my cousin, her other grandson, who is two years older than me, never did too great in school, but managed to get into college after two years of trying (college is messed up here. if you're interested, look up Vestibular, it's what's used to select kids into colleges here). I did it in my first try, but I got into a much better, paid albeit, college than him. He's going to a great one too, but it's free, harder to get in, etc.     

I hope you're not going to hate me, but before this next part, I'm going to need to give you a bit more background. So, I'm a sophomore in college, studying to be an engineer. I have just started an internship in February. Like I briefly went over, I have always been a hard working student. I study my ass off, especially near midterms or finals, even more so now that I have that internship. If I fail a class, I have to retake it the following semester, and since my classes are either all in the morning or all in the afternoon, if I fail a class, that means I have to retake it in the period I have free, which I am using for the internship. So I don't allow myself to not study, especially when I know I need it. My daily schedule goes a bit like this: wake up at 5:00, get ready, go to school at 6:00, last class ends around 13:00, go to internship that starts at 14:00, ends at 18:00, arrive home at 19:30, eat and have free time from 20:00 to about 22:00, which is when I force myself to sleep. The two-hour period I told you I have free, is basically useless. I try to use it to study what I had that day, so I don't have to cram too much near finals (which always ends up happening, always), however, I'm a bit exhausted around that time, and often go to bed then.   


Ok, back to when she was staying over; she stays on my case for the duration of the first day, just telling me over and over how I should be balancing my life. Mind you that this is two weeks prior to my midterms, and I'm beginning my crazy study schedule. This means I study about everyday for as long as I can, without that interfering with my sleep schedules though. No one fucks with my sleep. So, she's telling me, hey, Welcome-To-Heartbrea (fuck, I just noticed I missed a ""t""), why don't you go to a bar with your friends or something? Why don't you have more friends? Why do you just stay in all the time? (By now, I fully expect you to all be on her side, because I'm coming off as an extremely spoiled brat with an awesome grandma. Well, you're probably right...) I tell her calmly why I have to study so hard these weeks, and that I understand her point. That would have been great had it stayed like that, except for the fact it carried on for the whole week.   And one day, she's talking to me about how she ran into a distant family member I've never met, and I tell her I don't know who she's talking about. She randomly gets ticked off and starts calling me anti-social. For not knowing someone. Right. I get pissed, talk back, and that was about the last time I talked to her for that week, until today, which is when I get the news I'm visiting her this weekend, even though I hadn't been consulted about this, and this is my first weekend after midterms and was really looking forward to relaxing, etc. I didn't take this too kindly with my mother, and asked why I hadn't been consulted, and that I'm not sure I want to go. Discussion ensues.  

So, here's part two:  
I am numb. Numb in the sense I shut off some emotions. My life's been a mix of two songs lately: ""[Cat's in the Cradle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwjNBjqR-c)"", by Harry Chapin, and ""[Welcome to Heartbreak](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMH0e8kIZtE)"", by Kanye West. If you know them at all, you know what I mean. If you don't, take a second to listen to them, both are great songs. If you don't feel like it, but for some odd reason, want to hear what I have to say about it, well, here goes: I strive to succeed. What does that mean? Shit, you got me. I used to know. I used to think it was all about being the boss-man at the end of the day. Heck, I still think that. But then again, I never thought that, and I still don't. I knew way back then that the most successful person was usually the one working his ass off the most, and not having a family, a proper weekend, a life. The one with the average salary, on the other hand, had a proper life, with friends and everything's all giddy like According to Jim. You've got a banging wife and friend to keep you company.  

I honestly don't know anymore what I want to be. I see myself not having 10% of the day to myself, and out of every 10 weekends, taking 6-7 to study the whole time.  
I have grown apart from my closes high-school friends. I have moved countries back and forth and I just don't have a sense of belonging. I grow attached to a place, I get it taken from me. I hate change. I finally adapt after a year at that new high school of not having any friends, get friends, get separated from them. I've lost track of how many times I've had to shed friends. And I hate that. Ever read that one text from Mary Schmich, [Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column,0,4054576.column), also known as 'Wear Sunscreen'? There's a bit that says ""friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on"". That few has come down to one person, and I thank whatever there is to thank that I'm still friends with him. Awesome friend, but we haven't been talking as much, since we graduated.  
And the numbness I refer to is my love-life, or rather, the lack thereof.  
I've never had a girlfriend. Never kissed, never touched, never had a romantic moment, never asked out, never went beyond just staring her and hoping she'd magically walk over and kiss me, we'd start dating, she'd be the one, and we'd get married and life happily ever after. But fuck, I want that to change. And I know I'm smart enough to give myself all the advice on how to succeed. Everything that gets posted to r/GetMotivated, for example, is stuff my brain could come up with all the time, and I'm never willing to listen to it. After getting into college, this being an engineering-only college, there are close to no girls in it, but last year, I managed to somehow become friends with this nice girl that I quickly became interested in. She was, however, dating, and was deeply in love with this fucker. I'd give up my free time, after I'd already passed the test and had been on vacation, to get on skype and help her with her questions, all the while she would make out with her boyfriend on the other end of the call. There were also occasions in which she blew me off when she arranged something, treated me like I was just any one else, and that was great, because I got to realizing she wasn't that awesome as I had made her out to be in my head. Really, I just don't get much talk or get to know any girls, so when one comes along, I hold on for my dear life. The girl is now single, has been for some months. I could pathetically attempt to make a move, but now that she's single, obviously, I'm not interested anymore. Fucking brain.   

Truth is, I have everything in life I could ask for. I have nice parents who provide, and extremely well, for me. They are not abusive, and if I say so myself, did a great job of raising me. I am, however, surrounded by money. They never spoiled me, but always gave me the means to spoil myself. And so I did. I surrounded myself with an Xbox, a smart phone and a computer. What else do I need to numb the wounds?  Heck, I'm even with a foot in the industry, and pretty much have a guaranteed job after I graduate (note: this is because my country really lacks engineers, not because I consider myself an apostle, or some shit). I have that one friendship at least that I'll cherish for a long time, the money to keep me entertained and well fed, a new career. But then, I realize my grandma wasn't so wrong after all. Where's the balance? What's this all about if I can't share this journey with someone?   

That's all I can remember for now. If you've stuck around, I'm glad, I suppose. "
rydo1,3,2012-04-07,I think I'm losing it,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rydo1/i_think_im_losing_it/,"I've had depression since I was 11 or so, much of it due to abuse as a child. I'm 22 in a few weeks and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I was going to attempt suicide in the 10th grade, but someone found out and reported it. Went to a counselor, but I lied and said everything was ok. They don't really care about anything so long as you can pay. 

I've lost interest in everything. I'm a runner, but I hate it now. I can't get myself to go run, go to the gym, or even draw anymore. All the things I enjoyed over the years - I've just lost interest as time went on. Now, I'm just angry. Angry at myself. I hear voices and I can't help but get pissed off. I can't keep a train of thought going. I can't remember things that happened 30 minutes ago...and I used to have photographic memory. I can't stand being around people, even my own family. I've come to hate people's voices. It annoys me to no end when I hear people talking and I want to tell them to shut the hell up. I don't know anything but anger, though I wouldn't hurt a fly. Hell, I can't even cry anymore.

By no means am I unsuccessful. Maybe I'm stupid and selfish for feeling this way as I graduated college a year early despite failing my first year. My internship was no more - they offered me a full time position instead. These things would make anyone happy, but not me. Then we have the whole 'I've never had a gf, kiss, etc.' ordeal. I went on a date last week, though, and thought things would actually change. I gave her a hug upon meeting her and we had a blast that afternoon. I can honestly say it was the happiest day of my life. I went home happier than I had ever been. Happier than when I got the job or when I graduated college. But it was all a joke. Now she's pulling strings and playing games. At least that's what I feel like is happening.

This week has been especially bad for me. I haven't been able to sleep properly. I've had gruesome nightmares, and I've lost weight (as if I wasn't slim enough). My desire to cease existing has never been stronger. I'm not strong enough to go through with it, though. I'm a coward like that. 

I wish I had friends, *real* friends who I could go out with. My mom keeps telling me I should go join some sports club or something at the Y. Easy for her to say when after paying some of their bills every month on top of my car and everything else, I don't exactly have a ton to spend. 

I feel like the only thing that can make me genuinely happy is to be in a relationship and having genuine people in my life. But I know it's not going to happen. I've come to terms with it, though it's difficult to deal with. I wish the voices would stop. I wish I weren't so angry and didn't feel like this all the time. I don't intend on seeing a counselor. I'm not paying $200+ a session for someone to pretend to care. I can't believe this is going to be me for the rest of my life. I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm sure this was all poorly structured, etc., but I just can't focus on any one thing anymore. My head is constantly hurting and...I just don't know."

I'm hoping some input from actual GW students will help convince my parents that the extra cost is worth it. 

1. How available are internships/job opportunities in DC for poli sci majors? Is it tough to find/secure those internships?

2. In your opinion, is GW worth anywhere from 5-10k more per year than another university because of the location? 

3. What are the job prospects like for poli sci grads? Do most go on to grad school or do they try to find jobs in DC? 

4. How intense is the coursework? Is double majoring feasible?

I’m more curious if I can pull myself out.


Back story made short – I dated a girl for 7 years, and the last 6 months of that we were engaged.  Then she left me for some really shitty reasons.  That’s a whole other story.


Shortly after my S.O. left me, I was chatting up this girl I was friends with and see often (We’ll call her Allie, not her real name).  She’s a bit younger than me, but not creepy younger, less than 10 years younger.  Or at least I feel that’s less than creepy.  Anywho, through an internship I get free tickets to orchestra concerts and the other stuff affiliated with the orchestra.  There was a big band concert close to Valentines Day and my BFF who was supposed to join me bailed.  So I asked Allie if she would like to go.  I was completely oblivious to Valentines Day or the fact it was a Valentines themed big band concert, and she took this as me asking her out/wanting a rebound.  She has been a rebound girl before, so all the shits were flipped.  I was in no mood to date or anything, so my intentions were nothing of the sort.  We had a chat; I explained I was not trying to ask her out, just a dumb ass with no concept of calendar dates at the time.  I went on to say that yes, I found her attractive and fun, but obviously it wouldn’t be very fair to her or myself if anything like that were to happen.  I wanted a friend who wasn’t treating me like a fragile doll, and she was doing it, so I just wanted company at a concert, and wanted to keep our friendship where it was.  (We banter like House and Cuddy due to two very sarcastic attitudes towards life.)


So now we’ve hung out more.  I have really started to dig her.  But I am obviously in the hardcore friend zone place, and put there by my own actions.  What’s more annoying is her inherent distrust of men in general because all the ones she wants ignore her and anyone actively trying to flirt with her is instantly treated like shit.  I joke about flirting with her sometimes and get a stern glare.  Using the word “date” freaks her out, but twice she’s come over to my apartment alone and I have made her dinner.  No moves were made because I don’t feel like getting punched in the balls.


I don’t want to ruin a friendship, because honestly I believe going on one or two dates to “test out waters” (I don’t mean sex, I mean personality compatibility) shouldn’t mean we can’t be friends.  But I’m afraid that 1) the simple act of asking is going to kill the friendship and 2) she’s young enough to think that dating does mean if it isn’t going to work, we can’t be friends at the end regardless.  Do I have any hope, or did I ruin this chance a while back?

ryoiq,2,2012-04-07,I am giving up.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ryoiq/i_am_giving_up/,"I quit my job in the middle of march. I had just graduated college exactly one year ago and got a high paying job as a programmer. It was all planned out very well by myself. I had the internships, decent grades, independence from my parents and everything. I even had a girlfriend I was in love with. I moved into a beautiful apartment and was honestly making a bonafide name for myself... 


--Then I dumped my girlfriend because I was so paranoid and distrusting. I know it was my fault. She was going to move in etc... It broke her heart and mine too, because deep down I thought I really loved her and she thought she really loved me. That might very well be true but I'm not sure, it is too late anyway.







--Then, I quit my job because the stress it was causing me was literally out of my control. The day I quit, I couldn't control myself walking out the door, I just *knew* I had too. It was a confusing and depressing work environment. I don't think quitting was totally my fault, I think it is something I was forced to do.





--Then I moved back in with my parents and dissolved the entire life I had created for myself. I only vaguely know what is *actually* going on with my life right now.



--I have been a pretty steady substance abuser since I was in middle school. I've never been caught (beside some close scrapes with death, and a brief chat with my parents [they are abusers too]) and I have always been able to function pretty well in society with my problem. It got in the way of my grades but I've been able to complete tasks outside of my field of work well... And I was definitely at the top of my class when it came to programming abilities. Anyway... I'm totally clean now. But who knows for how long.



..


-- I threw it all out. I don't even know why. I am so confused and extremely Jaded as to what exactly happen. My confusion doesn't totally stem from the substance usage either, but that was definitely a part of it. I will admit that.




..


-- So I am a officially giving up. I *really* dont give a fuck anymore. I've always pushed myself to care about shit but it was all fabricated in my head so I wouldn't be a ""loser"" or let my parents down, but I can't do it anymore. And I don't care because I am not sure why I should care. Poverty and an uninsured lifestyle doesn't sound too bad to me. Living as a bum feels like its a option right now. I hate living with my parents. I hate my situation. Once upon a time I wanted to work for the government or serve in the military. I can't do that for some unknown reason. And I am classified as 'self-destructive'... Screw it. Fuck em'."
s14ph,6,2012-04-09,"Incoming noob - 5'7"" female at 275 lbs with PCOS",itsthatchick,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/s14ph/incoming_noob_57_female_at_275_lbs_with_pcos/,"Hi all, I've been a lurker on r/lose it for a little bit now and some of the stories here are just amazing.  I've always been that fat girl ever since I was young.  When I hit high school all I ever did was eat and drink junk and that made me balloon up quickly. I never really cared what I really looked like, my excuse was I'd lose it later once I'm done with school. 

Well now I'm a junior in college and I have an office job in a corporation, things probably aren't going to get more stable for me aside from just finishing up school and focusing on work.  Lately I've just been feeling insanely depressed about my looks and I just really want to make a total lifestyle change.

I've been diagnosed with PCOS and because of that I actually have acanthosis nigricans.  The only ""treatment"" for these is to lose weight, and even then there is a small chance that it won't help since there are even slim women with PCOS. 

I was raised on the whole ""finish your plate"" mentality, so this basically made me over eat.  I over eat all the time because my eyes are way too big for my stomach, and I just don't want to deal with left overs.  I've just been stupidly lazy in taking care of myself and I've been yo-yo dieting in the past.  I even did stupid stuff such as the master cleanse that took me down to 245 lbs, but I eventually gave in and started eating out again. 

I'm not huge on cardio, because I have osgood slaughter in one of my knees that easily flares up since it's carrying so much damn weight, but unlike a lot of women, I love to lift and weight train.  I don't want to be one of those women that always needs a man to help lift stuff or open jars, but I don't want to be a shredded woman that looks like she's on roids.  But I recently started jumping on the elliptical and bike since it doesn't hurt my knee so much.

I've been looking online and there are people that state the the south beach diet helps a lot with women diagnosed with PCOS, I just signed up for it online today.

My main issue is having food readily available...  I'm studying to be a computer engineer and I currently work at a huge company as an intern, this alone doesn't give me a lot of time to spend shopping for and making meals for myself.  It would probably go better if I actually knew how to cook.  Right now I'm just steaming broccoli and eating canned tuna... It also doesn't help when my roommate cooks huge amounts of delicious and fatty asian foods...

I currently hate how i feel and how I look right now and I want to be healthy target weight for myself is probably 150 lbs.  I definitely am hoping to drive my self forward, but figured I would start in r/loseit to see if anyone else is in my shoes, if anyone knows of any easy recipes I can make fast and eat on the go, stories of your weight loss journey, any words of wisdom/encouragement.

TL;DR: I'm new, I have PCOS, I hate how i look/feel, I'm starting the South Beach diet, hoping to drop to 150 lbs. "

Can we help?,ZeusMcGoose,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/s139z/girl_gets_hit_by_drunk_driver_on_her_way_to_pick/,"Ada and I were friends in high school.  We were on the gymnastics team together almost ten years ago.  Although we were never particularly close, I was deeply saddened when I heard the news of her accident five years ago.  And I've always kind of felt guilty for not visiting her in the hospital, or even now at her parents' home...  I guess I felt like it would be awkward, just simply because of the fact that we weren't really close friends.  Or maybe just thought that she might not even recognize me after all these years...

She was a quiet and soft spoken girl, but always friendly and kind to anyone.  The one memory that stands out to me of her, is the time when she decided to try a butterfly leap at gymnastics practice.  She had apparently seen it on TV the night before.  So she just went for it!  And then ended up breaking her wrist.  We all laughed about it afterwards, but she really surprised me that day how spontaneous she was.  And from all of the stories I've heard about her time at the hospital, I know that she probably surprised many other people with her kindness, her empathy, her charm, or her spontaneity because I heard that her recovery room was always brimming with people.  She had many friends, of many backgrounds, from all over the world.  She was just a beautiful person, inside and out.  

I check her mother's blog about once a week to check on her progress.  She's now able to move around on her own (with assistance) and is communicating through the use of an iPad!  But I know that her family has been struggling financially for sometime from the medical bills and aftercare costs.  I try to make donations when I am able, but I've been living on a tight budget as well and can't give as much as I'd like.  I imagine that donations have also stopped coming in as frequently since it's now been some time since the accident.

So today I've decided to solicit the Reddit community for help.  I feel like one of those kids walking around the parking lot with boxes of chocolate caramel turtles asking to help me pay for my summer internship program...  But hey, it can't hurt, right?  If you have a dollar, or 5, or 10 to spare today, could you please make a donation [at her mom's page](http://dearada.blogspot.com/)?  

Thanks for reading.  I hope this can help get the word out about Ada and her family to more people out there."

Lets make this a discussion: have you picked a school yet? If so, what swayed you? If not, which schools are you still considering? What other information are you currently looking for? Make your posts as broad or specific as you'd like.

Have nothing objective to add? Just feel like blurting out your acceptance story and/or ranting about admissions? Go ahead!

I'll start:

I'm a Californian and I'm currently deciding between UC Davis and UC San Diego. I'm a chem major who's interested in research and lab work, and so both schools are quite strong in that regard. My sister goes to Davis, so I've visited there a good bit and appreciate the homely feel that it has (which may be a factor of me visiting often). I recently came back from Triton Day at UCSD and it felt distinctly less ""comfortable"" there, but I feel that it might have more to offer academically (San Diego is a hotspot for biotechnology, so internships would be easier to get). I'm considering going back to San Diego to get another look at the campus, but I'm torn in the middle at this point. I have no doubt that I would be happy at both schools, but Davis feels more like home (not to say UCSD feels **un**homely), while San Diego has a better academic reputation (both are top ranked research universities, however). I want to have new experiences (San Diego is farther away and culturally more different than Davis), but that sacrifices the ""home"" feel of the other school. "

I just want to put it away in the right place, with reasonable compounded interest and as tax-free as possible.

I'm leaning towards a Roth IRA at the moment, but I would really like to know what's out there before I commit. Both suggestions and additional resources are welcome.

EDIT: Thank you all who responded, I think I'll choose the Roth IRA based on the information you have given me. I'm still undecided about if I should rush to open up an account before the filing deadline on April 17th, or if I should wait, acquire more money, and open an account within the upcoming year. So additional advice on that would be helpful as well."

s27hg,1,2012-04-10,Time to be a grown up...but how?,walledin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/s27hg/time_to_be_a_grown_upbut_how/,"My mind feels like it's at the bursting point, and I really need to review the facts and marshal my thoughts. Something tells me this could take a while...

The paralysis in my stomach began when I was 18, but it took three years before my increasingly numerous doctors had any idea what was wrong, time I spent in a gradual but steady decline. Soon I was almost always ill. About five minutes after eating anything I'd feel like I'd swallowed live scorpions and would be incapacitated by pain. All of the money I'd saved for an apartment was quickly spent on diagnostic tests that all came back negative. Finally, my attendance at school suffered to the point there was no mathematical possibility to save my grades, so I left school. I thought I'd focus on figuring out what was wrong with me and getting better and try again.

After another year of scans, I still had no answers. I grew increasingly afraid that whatever I had was killing me by slow degrees, and no one would no why until the autopsy. I resolved to go back to school, and came up with a game plan. Skip breakfast and lunch and drink a great deal of Pepto during the school day, do my homework, then eat a meal with enough calories to keep from losing more weight and endure the pain until morning. I was maintaining good grades, but then I got extremely sick just before finals. I missed them, which meant an automatic F in every class. 

The silver lining was that I'd gotten bad enough to be diagnosed from one of the dozens of scans the doctors ordered. It took a long time, but I learned to mostly manage my condition. Still, every few months, I'll have a week and a half where the pain, nausea and exhaustion are incapacitating. 

When I went back to college yet again, I tried to get a case manager from the Center for the Disabled to review my case, but it was months before she could see me. When she did, she told me it was a shame I couldn't get in earlier, because she would have advised me to take online classes instead of coming to campus. Well, shit, why didn't that occur to me at the time? Same old story--I do well in all of my classes until my symptoms strike me down for two full weeks. The attendance policy being what it is, I'm once again forced to drop out.

Now here's the big problem--through all of this time, I've been paying for these classes from savings bonds given to me by a relative in my childhood and my parents have helped pay my outrageous medical expenses. I haven't been able to work for the same reason school hasn't panned out--I figure no employer would keep me if I might be out of commission for two weeks at a time, even if they ignored my years of unemployment.

Today I found out that my parents are having serious financial troubles of their own. I feel awful--they have their own medical bills and a mortgage to content with and here they've been giving me room, board, and paying for my medical expenses--there's no way I can keep gobbling up their resources knowing they're in trouble, and furthermore I'm 23 and want very much to be independent--I have to move out and get some sort of job, yesterday if possible. My case manager thinks I'd qualify for money from Social Security, but that process can take years and a lawyer's help to wade through. I have about $4,000 left from the bonds, so I'd have enough to pay for rent and other expenses for a little while, but how long? And won't prospective landlords care that I'm jobless? 

I'm (trying to be) a writing major, but I haven't gotten to any of the classes in freelance writing or preparing fiction for publication, and I feel lost when I think about embarking on my career at this stage. Thinking about how much I don't know makes me feel dizzy. How does one get into freelancing? Write a few dozen articles and send them out until someone bites? What format should I use for submitting them? What price do I charge per word? 

I can learn these things on my own and through trial and error, but how long will that take? With as little money as my parents have left, I don't want to stay any longer than I absolutely have to. And I don't dare assume writing can support me, certainly not at first. Unfortunately, it's my lone marketable skill. Should I take a job I can do from home, so I don't get fired the first time I get really sick? That would be ideal, but so many of them are scams... Data entry? The best my resume could possibly offer in that area is that Mavis Beacon seemed impressed with my typing speed in the high school computer lab. Actually, with how long I've been out of work, few places would think I'm a good prospect. And that's if they don't figure out I'm a touch sickly. I look healthy, just tired, so I might get away with omitting that fact for a little while. 

I can get back into volunteering to bolster my resume, which I've been itching to do for a while, but people rightfully want to know you a little before vouching for you to an employer, and enough years have passed that I might not be remembered by those I worked with in the past.

Maybe I can get work study, but that can't start until Summer semester (yes, I'm going back yet again, with online classes this time. I don't give half a damn if it takes fifty years and beggars me for life, I value education for its own sake, and I will never, ever stop trying) and work study positions are in huge demand. I want to have moved out by then to avoid any financial aid confusion and spare my parents' wallets, anyway.

I've heard some nasty stories about the local temp agency, but would that be an option? I don't need a good job right now, I just need any job. And if I get fired from whatever job I somehow land? Well, I'll get another one. I'll muddle along. It's more than time I learned to stand on my own two feet. 

An internship could work for as long as I can keep my attendance steady. They're in high demand, but it's worth a shot. Should I focus on getting a job first and go back to school in the fall? But I've wasted so much time being sick already, that doesn't seem like a viable solution either...

At this point I feel like I'm playing a game of pin the tail on the life altering decision. "

First off, thanks to everybody that reads this. It means a lot. Here's my situation: I'm a senior undergraduate, about to graduate with a degree in Biology. I'm taking a year off before starting grad school, so I've been trying to find some internships or short-term jobs. I've applied to a bunch of places relevant to my field, but haven't heard back from any of them yet...of course, if I do hear from any of them, it's almost certain that I'd have to consent to a drug test.

On the other hand, I do have a job interview tomorrow for a job that's not related to my field. It would be good to have a source of income, but it would look better to graduate admission panels if I get a job related to my field; thus, if another opportunity arises from one of the jobs related to my field, I'm going to apply for them.

This leaves me in a strange position - I'll almost certainly get the job that I have an interview for tomorrow (one that doesn't drug test), but if I happen to hear back from any of the jobs that do drug test, I'll go for them and definitely need to be clean for potential drug tests. It's a shitty situation, because I haven't been smoking for about a week now and really want to (I have minor depression issues and weed helps a bunch). Thus, I'm not smoking for an indefinite amount of time, and I'm really disliking it.

Could somebody give me some advice, or offer any insight? I'm trying to tell myself that it's for the best and that if I get an interview for a bio-related job then I'll be clean. On the other hand, I hate not smoking just because there's a chance that I may get one of those interviews.

**TL;DR: Can't smoke weed on the off-chance that I'll get a job interview that drug tests. Have minor depression issues and weed helps. Looking for a compromise.**"

Coming Home


I landed in PDX in my fancied suit smelling of day old sex, cigarettes, and a hangover. My mother was waiting for me in the arrivals terminal to hug and kiss my cheek. My father would’ve been there as well, but he passed nearly 3 years ago. I still think about him every now and again, sometimes when it feels it’s been too long since I have. Other times simply to ground and remind myself. It had been a long flight since I’d left Edinburgh. The French were on strike for some odd reason and I got stuck in Charles de Gaulle, more mad that I couldn’t have a smoke or continue drinking now that it was 8 or 9 am than being delayed really. It sounds like something they’d do anyways. They questioned why my growler smelt of alcohol. I wanted to say it’s because I forgot to wash it after polishing it off in the taxi around 4 am that morning in Edinburgh, but with my french I could only lie and say it was water. The ensuing pat down was firmer than the norm. 

I’d been drinking since 4 or 5 the day before, strategically filling up my growler from Brewdog earlier in the afternoon, I think it was the Trashy Blonde that day or maybe the Punk IPA, and saved it for the time between when the bars close and my taxi ride departs. I’d gone out with the remaining interns, only two or so at that point, and my Scottish coworkers. I skipped work that day, my last, wasn’t much going on in the Parliament on a Monday to be honest anyway and met up with Paul and Iain up the Royal Mile, a song or two away from my flat for the last night out. 

We sat and drank the first of many pints in a shadowy pub called the World’s End. As soon as I arrived Paul roared into a story of how Iain and another American intern, a breezy and aloof blonde from Utah, had hooked up last Friday night, Hannah’s last night here. Iain brought her back to his new flat to crash and they ended up making out and getting into it, as you do. It gets hot and he ends up inside her slowly penetrating her for a good thirty seconds until she gets flustered and admits that she’s a virgin and doesn’t know if she can continue. She heads into this minute or so monologue about whether she should or shouldn’t have sex, meanwhile Iain is plowing away at a soft and steady rate throughout the whole thing. She inevitably tells him she can’t, and he pulls out, and we all have a laugh at how many times she’s been in this situation still thinking she’s a virgin. The last of the interns Yassef arrives at the pub having missed the story and we number five now, Paul launches into the story once more for Yassef’s ears breaking for a smoke and a call from his girlfriend, a californian blonde who’d left two days before. I smoke one and we chat for a second about goodbyes and past lovers outside after the call. It’s wet, the cold december rain riding in on sharp breezes in stacatto-like fashion, but the pub is warm and inviting, the story continues. After pulling out, they make out and she starts to jerk him off. He’s about to finish and, in her grace, she apparently thinks it a brilliant one to shove a finger up his arse. He freaks out and comes all at once. The table cracks up and cheers to that non-mormon Utah girl long gone by now, Iain’s joyful smirk following the story was priceless. 

We move up the mile to the Tron tavern, smokes in hand, and we enjoy the first buzzes of our night, the nicotine hits like a missing drumbeat, the age old cobblestone beneath our feet encouraging us, the whole lot buzzing. Pints and food are ordered, WC’s visited, seats taken, and we proceed with jovial conversations and laughs. More friends join, the Seattle girl from my office and a cute Manchester girl, Tony the Scottish-Italian gay coworker who fancied me at first, Stuart a coworker and Yassef’s lover at some point, and I finally start to realize it’s my last night here. I text Camilla, a barmaid I’d asked out and gone out with for bottles of prosecco the night before, and drop a line.

To be continued...I'm too drunk and I have class in the morning, can't continue this chapter or what have you currently."
s21nv,3,2012-04-10,No reason for feeling like this,takeiteasyonme,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/s21nv/no_reason_for_feeling_like_this/,"Where the hell do I begin?  I might get off subject and rant a bit but I'd appreciate your attention throughout. I'm a student at my second choice college, in my 4th year(will be staying for a 5th) in my dream internship working for my colleges football team.  After next year, I'm going to try getting a graduate assistant job to help pay for grad school and everything on the outside for me looks all good and well.  I was raised in a bible belt home by two strong christian parents and my entire childhood up until I was 18 leaves me with no choice but to believe in a higher power.  Fast forward 4 years later, I've gotten away from the church and have come to the conclusion that there is no God and that us as humans are incredibly ignorant to believe that from our small world surrounded by so much we know so little about, that we know exactly how we all got here.  This change has affected my whole outlook on life.  I now concentrate solely on being as good of a person as I can to anyone and everyone I meet.  If there is a God, I hope he sees that I did my best to be the best person I could be.  I think it's hypocritical to think we must be perfect in an imperfect world for the ultimate result in heaven.  I'm already ranting and this is branching off into other conversations for other threads so sorry about this.  I've dated two girls my whole life, both of them while I've been in college.  I was mr. popular in high school but i was never interested in dating, partly because no girls every really came across me as being interested in dating me.  The first girl I dated, we lost both of our virginities to each other and she fell head over heels for me.  A year into our relationship, I felt since I was young and had two more years ahead of me that my best years were yet to come.  This was also before I started this job with the football team in which all my time became dedicated to football.  Regardless, I didn't have the feelings for her that she had for me and there didn't seem there was a way to change that, so I broke up with her, ultimately breaking her heart.  Something I later apologized for as I was a real dick about the whole process.  A year and a half later, I met another girl, who went to my high school.  We'll call her ""B"".  What began as summer love turned into strong feelings for me, which I never felt before, even in the year I was dating the first girl.  She was younger than me and went to community college back home, forcing us into a long distance relationship.  After 3 months of skypeing every night, I finally asked her out and we dated for another 3 months.  I'd always been the type of person to poke fun at people who were in love so fast after beginning dating.  I was in my first season of my internship and wasn't traveling with the team, therefore anytime I got a weekend off, I was making my way back home to be with her.  By the third month, I knew my feelings were unlike anything i'd ever felt before so I automatically assumed I was in love.  For the whole year I dated the first girl, ""I Love You"" only came out when we were drunk and usually I realized what I said and would take it back.  I thought it was such a big step in saying something like that because I wanted it to be for real.  During Christmas break with B, I was laying down with her telling her everything I loved about her and eventually I said it, that I loved her.  It felt so right saying it because I knew the feelings I had inside me.  She said she loved me too and for the first time, I was the happy with every single aspect of my life, minus the fact she was still 200 miles away and i couldn't see her everyday, but just talk.  Eventually, she began getting the feelings I had for the first girl and broke up with me one weekend I came home to spend the weekend with just her.  It was literally the weekend before my 21st birthday.  The weekend of my 21st while celebrating my birthday, at some point while I was blacked out called her crying begging her back.  I have no recollection of the phone call but it almost certainly put the nail in our relationships coffin so to speak. It absolutely broke my heart and I had no clue how to handle it.  I begged her to come back almost to the point now looking back, I was boarderline crazy.  The week after my birthday was valentines day so I automatically felt jaded at the day, only to find out that same day that she had evidently been hanging out with her ex boyfriend who in the beginning tried to get her away from me, bringing me down even more.  Months passed and some things were forgiven and forgotten, we had our ups and downs, and summer finally came around which gave me a chance to go back home and rebuild our relationship once more.  I went to the first session of summer school and 3 days before I came back home, i caught wind that she had been hanging out with my then best friend.  By reading ""then best friend"", i'm assuming you can put 2 and 2 together.  The whole time she was talking to me, she was also talking to my best friend.  I asked both of them about it which they both of course denied so I had no choice but to let it go.  3 weeks after I come home, I'm at a party with my friend where he's talking to a girl about how he's found a new girl, yada yada, and then her name pops up.  He was talking about how he was talking to her and liking her literally 3 feet away from me.  This is all after he'd been telling me the whole time i needed to get over her.  Fuck him.  I called him out and he went off into a tangent about how he made me and I wouldn't have been popular without him.  Mind you, I didn't even start hanging out with the guy until my last semester of high school.  I'll say it again.  Fuck him.  Two days later, I packed my bags and came back to college just to get away from the drama.  For a little while things were getting back to normal and both of those people left my life.  Like that, I lost the girl I loved and my best friend all for a stupid reason.  The hurt and anger I had built up was numbed by my friends back at school.  Here I am, a year and a half after the breakup and approaching a year after all the drama.  I'm on the verge of completing this semester finally after a shit ton of work and I couldn't be more excited.  Truth is, deep down, I'm still hurt.  I'm over both of them and haven't really spoken to them except to close out everything (a kind way of me telling them fuck you).  Since then, I haven't really tried talking to any girls.  Again, no girls have really come across as being interested in me.  I'm the type of person that would rather have a girl come after me than I go after them.  It's so much more of a turn on to me to be wanted and for it to be so apparent it slaps me in the face.  I've never been the ""player type"" and usually end up coming back home from bars with my friends and just them.  I don't pull numbers, I don't really pull girls, but I'm still incredibly social with them.  There's the gap between acquaintences and fuck buddies or even getting to the relationship aspect I still don't understand.  I hate putting myself out there only to be rejected so i avoid the confrontation all together.  This strategy hasn't helped me either, hence me writing this to you.  I have so much frustration and hurt and anger built up inside and I don't really let anyone, not even my friends here know about it.  I'm at peace on the football field, but it seems the second I'm anywhere else, these feelings come back.  I feel like I'm wasting my life here and that I'm miserable.  I have so much fear for growing up and getting a real job if I can't stay in school as a graduate assistant.  More than anything, I just want someone here to care for and to come home to.  I have a great respect for women as I had two sisters growing up to show me how to be a man.  None of the things they told me really made sense until recently.  Like I said, I'm no player and I just want to give a girl what any girl deserves, just someone who will care for them.  I have so many friends who are girls who traditionally bitch and moan and complain about other guys that did them wrong and I'm too afraid to make an attempt to resurrect their faith in the male population.  I feel so different from anyone else because of the fact that I don't ""spit game"".  That's such a childish and immature thought process to refer to women as game as if they're a fucking deer I have to shoot at.  Again regardless of the fact, it never fails that the prettiest and most deserving girls end up with the biggest douches and wonder why they keep getting hurt, meanwhile, i'm on the sidelines with my helmet just waiting patiently to get in the game.  I feel like because I don't feel this way, that it's set me behind in social skills as well.  I don't always have the cool thing to say, and sometimes, I feel no urge to say anything at all.  I hate small talk which doesn't help either so just meeting and getting to know girls at social events is a marathon itself for me.  I'm not much of the hey i got your number from a friend lets have a full blown converstion despite the fact ive been to about 5 parties with you.  I've googled how to talk to girls and all that crap and it's all the same cliche ""be yourself"" bullshit.  Sorry internet, that doesn't help at all.  Like I said, I have a dream life and I wouldn't trade anything for it, but I want to get rid of this frustration.  I want to scream as loud as I can to get it all out but I know it won't be enough.  I'm so mad at the world for being the way it is.  I'm mad at things I have no way of controlling.  I have thoughts I shouldn't have.  I think to myself I'm of no use to the world and that I'm not meant to live in this time.  My family and friends keep me alive.  If I knew they wouldn't be effected at all, I would have ended myself a long time ago.  I think about suicide from time to time, nothing too serious though.  Just thoughts like well I wouldn't have to worry about whatever it is i'm worried about anymore. I know my life is of much importance and the entire scenario of my suicide would crush many people that are dear to my life so that takes it completely out of the question.  I just want relief.  The world despite how small in retrospect to everything else is still big to me and I don't have the first clue on how to live in it.  I want to get over the hump of being a good friend to everyone.  I want girls to want to be with me.  I feel like i'm an average looking guy, but regardless shouldn't have that hard of a time finding a good girl.  I know I'm young and have absolutely no business feeling like this.  I know this whole thing comes off as a frustration towards girls but in all honesty, there's a lot more behind my frustration.  Like I said earlier, I hate the way the world is today.  I feel like people are incredibly hypocritical which pisses me off more than anything.  I blame this fact alone for most of the feelings I have.  A few months ago, in conversation with a friend, I said I'd lost hope in humanity, something i never thought I'd say.  I'd like to think there's still hope but at the same time, there will always be dumbasses put on this earth solely to fuck with other people.  I'm hoping you're still reading this and for some of you, I hope we share the same unfortunate feelings.  I want to tell you just as I'm sure I will be told to keep your head up and that things will get better.  I dunno, maybe this is just a terrible case of the monday's and i'm just feeling sorry for myself."
s1vxm,1,2012-04-09,"Temporarily not smoking because of potential job interviews, could use some insight",[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/s1vxm/temporarily_not_smoking_because_of_potential_job/,"Hey all,

First off, thanks to everybody that reads this. It means a lot. Here's my situation: I'm a senior undergraduate, about to graduate with a degree in Biology. I'm taking a year off before starting grad school, so I've been trying to find some internships or short-term jobs. I've applied to a bunch of places relevant to my field, but haven't heard back from any of them yet...of course, if I do hear from any of them, it's almost certain that I'd have to consent to a drug test.

On the other hand, I do have a job interview tomorrow for a job that's not related to my field. It would be good to have a source of income, but it would look better to graduate admission panels if I get a job related to my field; thus, if another opportunity arises from one of the jobs related to my field, I'm going to apply for them.

This leaves me in a strange position - I'll almost certainly get the job that I have an interview for tomorrow (one that doesn't drug test), but if I happen to hear back from any of the jobs that do drug test, I'll go for them and definitely need to be clean for potential drug tests. It's a shitty situation, because I haven't been smoking for about a week now and really want to (I have minor depression issues and weed helps a bunch). Thus, I'm not smoking for an indefinite amount of time, and I'm really disliking it.

Could somebody give me some advice, or offer any insight? I'm trying to tell myself that it's for the best and that if I get an interview for a bio-related job then I'll be clean. On the other hand, I hate not smoking just because there's a chance that I may get one of those interviews.

**TL;DR: Can't smoke weed on the off-chance that I'll get a job interview that drug tests. Have minor depression issues and weed helps.**"
s5839,5,2012-04-11,Want to break up with boyfriend; Moving into a house next week.,MsThrowAway404,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s5839/want_to_break_up_with_boyfriend_moving_into_a/,"That must sound horrible at first glance.

So, currently I'm in college. I'm entering my second year. I've landed a cool internship related directly to my major (Computer Science), working in a network admin's office. They pay very well, I love the job, and they have offered me to stay and work over the summer, 40 hours a week. When the summer is over, I will likely be promoted and get a decent pay raise.

My boyfriend of three years and I are planning to get a house or apartment with another couple we know very well. The other couple is very stable and well-off. We'll likely only be staying in the place for the summer, then we will all probably move to the on-campus housing. My current boyfriend has a decent amount saved up from his last job, PLENTY enough to pay for his share of rent.  He has already agreed to it, and said he'll do whatever it takes to stay with me.

Problem is, things aren't working between me and him anymore. I can't stand him sometimes. He annoys me. He pushes me around and hits me sometimes. He yells. He disrespects me, and is extremely immature and childish. Being around him feels like babysitting, because I have to monitor his behavior in public. He doesn't know what he's doing for his major, and he's used to his mother paying for all of his bills. He throws a hissy fit when people make him do things he doesn't want to do. When I bring these things up, he also throws a fit.
Overall, he's not who I want to be with long term.

He has also told me he really hates the house we're moving into and doesn't want to spend his savings on it. He'd rather go back home and live there with his mom for free, but he's renting this place with me and the other couple to stay with me.

We are due to sign the lease in a week or two. If I break up with him, he'll be out of the lease and we likely won't be able to afford the place comfortably. The other couple who is entering into the lease with us will likely also be very angry with me/us.
         
           
           
      

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I supposed to be renting a house with other couple. Want to break up with boyfriend for several reasons. See above.

Reddit, I really need your advice right now. You've helped me through a lot before, and I really need some input on this. What should I do? :[


EDIT: I understand I need to leave him. I just don't know when//how will be most convenient and cause the least amount of shit for everyone else. I don't want to screw up everything for everyone else, if there's another option. If I could tough it out for the summer, etc. I'm looking for ways to go about this, I already know what needs to be done.

Also, thank you all for all your concern &lt;3 Reddit is full of such amazing people. "

If so, why doesn't she just say it?",genuinelydontknow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s4fx3/are_we_broken_up_if_so_why_doesnt_she_just_say_it/,"I'm 24, she's a year older. She lives in another country but we met about 2 years ago when we both lived in the same country.  
  
Things have gone through a rocky rollercoaster ostensibly because her circumstances in her country are changing and she's trying to find work and not having much luck. Throughout this period she's gone from brief phases of affection calling me her rock as she deals with her troubles and other times she's considering me a nuisance she needs to deal with on top of her other problems.  
  
This situation wasn't the best, but honestly, we were still keeping the semblance of a relationship, even if just by the phone. Unsatisfying though that can be I was still glad to be with her. But then she got an internship which she hoped would lead to a job, it was very intense and stressful and during that time we spoke often, but less so and she was sad, stressed, angry and far too preoccupied to be particularly interested in me. The internship ended and it didn't lead to work, she went to spend some time with her parents and that's when she started not answering her phone.  
  
She'd wait a few hours after I tried to call to send me a message with an obviously spurious excuse why she couldn't talk every time. I confronted her about it and she said that when she went back home from visiting her parents things would be different, that she was just preoccupied and trying to enjoy being back with her family.  
  
She's back but she still doesn't talk ever. Thing is, I know I'm representing myself here as just letting things happen, and being passive in the situation and I guess I am, part of me just wants to be patient with her and give her what she needs if she genuinely needs not to talk to me but I guess another part just doesn't want to hear that she's lost interest. I have however actually gathered the courage to ask the simplest questions: what do you want? Am I still in a relationship with you? Why don't you want to talk to me anymore? But she just reassures me, says she still wants me as her boyfriend, that we're still together as far as she knows and that she's just been busy.  
  
But something is very obviously wrong and has very obviously changed, she recently lost an opportunity to visit me in my country this year and when I said I'd go to hers instead she said she'd be too busy trying to find work. 
  
She doesn't want to talk to me, she doesn't want to come see me, she doesn't want me to go and see her frankly I'm not really sure what the difference would be between us breaking up and us continuing in this 'relationship'. 
  
What I really don't understand and am asking advice about is this, I can see from the signs it's probably over, that she's for whatever reason ceased to be interested in me. I could end things myself, but frankly I'm still stubbornly holding on to hope for a resolution because I do still care for her despite it all.
  
Why then, if she doesn't want me, never sees me and doesn't like talking to me, would she say she still wants to be in a relationship with me? What's she getting out of this? Is she being sincere?

UPDATE: Oh god. It was once something so sweet, it kills me to see where we've ended up. I can't imagine how I'm going to tell her I can't keep doing this but I really can't. Fucking long distance, maybe this would have happened anyway, but maybe not. If only we'd never had to move. She used to love me so much and I've always loved her. Thank you for your help agony redditors even you Nuitaqui, that's some dedicated trolling of r/relationships. I guess I'm going to have to contact her somehow and tell her the score. I wish I could go back to 2 years ago things seemed a whole lot nicer then."

Her, 23

Dating/living together 8 months
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I come to you, fellow redditors, in my hour of need. As the title states, I am absolutely desperate to save my relationship. I know this sounds cliché, but this girl is the love of my life, and the thought of losing her is more than I can bear. I am going to start at the beginning, and this will surely be a long post, but your viewership/input will be more helpful than you can ever imagine. 

A year ago I graduated college. At the time I was still in a 3-year LTR with my now ex-girlfriend. About two months after college I took an internship over 1,000 miles away. It was there, in this new city, where I met my current girlfriend. 

Once again, you'll have to pardon my clichés, but it was love at first sight. She was everything I'd ever hoped to meet in a woman. Fiercely intelligent, gorgeous, funny- I could go on forever. I courted her and when it became apparent we were falling for each other, I broke up with my ex. After that, my new girlfriend and I were inseparable: we did everything together and never got bored of each other's company. I couldn't imagine ever being with anyone else, and each day seemed like a gift.

We'd stay up at night - after mind-blowing sex - and discuss our future together. She'd tell me I was the one she'd been waiting for her entire life, I'd tell her the same. She'd say she felt complete, never felt like this before, etc., etc. It was, without a doubt, the best thing that has ever happened to me.

For five months we lived in this bliss. It was absolutely wonderful. In December we decided to move to a new city to start our life together with new jobs, new people, etc. Truthfully, I convinced her this is what would be for the best. At the time I honestly believed it, but now I'm not so certain it was the best decision.

Flash forward the last 3 months. Things have been lopsided. She has a job and is successful. She makes all the money and has been supporting us by herself, much to my shame. Fortune has not been so kind to me: the job I moved here for folded, I am unemployed, and spend my days writing cover letters and filling out applications.  I feel like I could go on an Occupy-themed/Millennial-unfairness rant here, but I won't. Simply put, I've been having difficulties financially.

This, as you can imagine, has impacted everything... although perhaps not as much as you would think. Until April things between her and I were still going well, if a little stressed because of my unemployment. She makes enough money to support us, and although I objected and floated the idea of going back to my home state to find work (I believe I have a job waiting there), she told me she'd rather have me stay here than be alone. Because this woman does not sugarcoat at all, I took her at her word. Perhaps this, too, was a mistake.

These last two weeks, however, have been particularly rough. A trifecta of issues has appeared, one after the other: her mother injured herself somewhat severely and had to undergo surgery to fix a broken bone, her job is *incredibly* intense right now (financial work, quarterly yearly report time) requiring long hours, and I - also much to my shame - did not get into my the type of law schools that I wanted (should have mentioned I was applying for law school earlier, sorry). In addition to this, parts of our relationship have become sadly routine: we wake up, she goes to work, I look for jobs, rinse, wash, repeat. 

All these issues culminated last weekend. We had an argument on Thursday of last week, during which she said she hadn't been happy for 3 months (which I really hope was not the truth). I stupidly lost my temper and yelled at her, something I have never done before and completely regret. She went home to be with her mother. I sat in our apartment, alone, looking for jobs/playing video games. When she came back I knew something was wrong. But I still wasn't ready for what was coming.

Monday, Monday, Monday. Is there a more despicable day of the week? Even unemployed I still despise it, and now I have more reason to than ever before. When she came home Monday night she told me the worst news I've ever heard: she wants to break up, she doesn't love me anymore, she wants me to move out (and by extension, move back home with my parents). I was (am) completely crushed. I knew things hadn't been perfect between us lately, but I still am in a state of despair and disbelief. The worst part of it was when she said she didn't view me as a partner anymore, and felt like my mother. Soul = demolished.

I told her I was the same person she fell in love with. I begged her not to give up on me yet. I know how important stability and ambition are to her, and these last 3 months have not been my best in that regard. But I have had a job interview this week and things are finally starting to look up; I was also able to sell my old car for a couple thousand dollars to help pay the rent for the immediate future. I used my gift of gab to talk her into giving me a stay of execution, if you will. I told her by the end of April I was going to be the man she wanted me to be, that the man she loved no longer wasn't me but an awful figment of my true potential. She said okay. But she still claims she doesn't know if she loves me anymore; that knowledge alone has caused me to be unable to eat or sleep for the last two days and is destroying me with every second that ticks by. Melodramatic, I know, but it's how I feel.

I guess the worst part is that I have always viewed love as bound by Newton's first law of motion. I don't believe she could just stop loving me; there had to be a force there to cause the love of my life - whom a month ago told me she wanted to get married someday, 6 months ago told me she couldn't live without me - to ask me to pack my things two days ago. I have nominated my unemployment/bum-like state these past 3 months as the obvious culprit, as I know it has been awful for both her and I... this makes the situation all the more agonizing, as I am finally starting to see the light in this regard. I feel I am on the very cusp of being financially independent and able to support her and give her the life she deserves, but she has given up on me. It is a terrible, terrible feeling.

Last night I tried to show her I was the same man she fell in love with. After my job interview (which went really well, fingers-crossed!) I took her to dinner. We stopped by the river where I recited a love poem that I know means a lot to her (cheesy, I know) and tried to convince her this moment was the darkest hour before the dawn, that if she just believed in me for a little longer we could go back to the way things used to be. She seemed to be feeling it, and I was overjoyed to think I was saving this relationship. We went home and slept together (literally, slept) in the same bed. I was happy.

Then came this morning.

Mornings are the hardest because I can tell she doesn't want to talk about her feelings as she's preparing for a grueling day at work. I've respected this, as much I can, but right before she walked out the door I slipped. She kissed me, which I thought was a good sign, so I asked her what she was feeling. 

**""Nothing. Perhaps I just need more time?""**

God, it hurts. 

So here I am, writing this to you fine people and hoping against hope that you can provide me some sort of viable strategy to save this relationship. I love this woman with all of my heart, and I feel like I am *this* close to being able to provide the financial stability she needs to feel happy. How can I rekindle our love and prove to her I am not a loser? I know landing this job would really help, but I need other solutions, too. I did cut her a check for my half of the rent today, something I'd been unable to do until now, so I am hoping that helps... but I know I can't ""buy"" my way back in, even if finances are at the crux of the matter. I have to make her see me as she used to, I think, and I really could use some help with that.

I can't imagine my future without her in my life. Moving back home and living in my mom's basement or having to find another living situation here, hundreds of miles away from anyone I know besides her, both seem unimaginable right now. And I would have lost the one person I love more than anything in the entire world. I can't face it. Please help me.

**TL;DR Love of my life is disappointed with my recent inability to be financially independent and doesn't know if she loves me anymore. Wants me to move out of our shared apartment. Please help me show her I can be the same person she fell in love with originally.**

I apologize in advance for the lengthy post **(will include a TL;DR)**, but I want to include the full context and honestly also really need to get it all out.


**I am currently 20 years old and my boyfriend is 24.  We have been together for 2-3 years, since I was 17 and he was 21.**


 My teenage years were rocky to say the least.  When I met my boyfriend, I was in a bit of a hopeless position.  I had been kicked out as a teenager, and with no real friends left at this point I didn’t have many places to go.  I was a recovering drug addict and made the stupid decision to give up and relapse because it seemed easier at the time.  I had been renting a room in a drug-trafficking house full of meth addicts for about six months.  I had just lost my job and although there was a part of me that really wanted to get sober and escape, it seemed very difficult at the time with my parents unwilling to take me back and having absolutely nothing to my name, and also still being a minor.  I had been a very bright young woman before, but had spiraled to an all-time rock-bottom.  


He came to the house through a mutual friend, not knowing what type of place it was.  We met but didn’t talk much that night, but he came back and we were basically inseparable after that.  He knew I wanted to get sober and get out, and stayed by my side for a few weeks until he brought me to my parents to talk it through and find a solution.  He brought me to my residence to pack all of my belongings and drop them off at my parents.  I stayed with extended family a few hours away for about a week until he found us an apartment to move into, then picked me up and brought me to the apartment to have a fresh start.


Since then, I have gotten my high school diploma, completed an internship, started as a data analyst at a great company and have went back to college.  I have been sober from meth since we packed my bags and left that house over two years ago.  To say the least, he has helped me become a better version of who I was and to rebuild my life and self-esteem.


Other than that, we have worked through various other issues.  He was an opiate addict (oxycontin) and when we met he was occasionally using.  I also tried it for the first time and would occasionally use as well.  Throughout the first year or so of our relationship, he and I worked on the issues with opiates and went through a relatively long stint of sobriety.  When heroin started becoming popular with his old friends/the town, we both tried it.  I won’t go through extreme detail, but it soon escalated to regular use, and we were both so far into it that we would become deathly ill if we went without it.  It was a little easier for me mentally to quit, and a bit harder for him.


After about six months of this going on, he entered methadone maintenance treatment with counseling to kick the heroin habit and I got a prescription to suboxone (both methadone and suboxone are drugs to stop withdrawals from heroin).  He has had his rough patches, but we have both been clean now for a long time.  Some months after kicking the habit, his best friend (and a good friend of mine) died of a heroin overdose (in November).  It was really rough for both of us, but it strengthened our resolve to stay clean.


Last summer, we were going through a really rough time in our relationship.  There were some issues with staying clean, and it was putting a major strain on our relationship.  There were a few times where we would consider breaking up and our fights got really bad, and things just weren’t healthy between us.  Neither of us were treating each other with the respect or love that we should have.


I just found out in February that he cheated on me last summer.  It confirmed the worst of my insecurities and fears.  He cheated on me with the girl that at the time was my best friend.  I had known her in high school, but became friends with her after hanging out a few times when she was dating my boyfriend’s good friend.  Her and his friend only dated for a couple of months, but our friendship continued after they broke up.  She was my best and only friend for a long time, until she also started using heroin and it ruined our friendship.  When he cheated on me with her, we were still friends, but I was well aware of the damage drugs had done to our friendship.


What had happened was she would start texting him and flirting with him, and would always ask him for drugs (**pretty** much saying she would do *anything* for it).  He eventually responded and when she came over to pick up one day, they made out and they used together.  The texting continued and a couple days later she came over again and again they started getting heavy.  They hung out a third time and they started to have sex, and they quit, because apparently *it wouldn’t fit* (which just makes me feel terrible).  He gave her drugs afterward.  After this meeting, he responded to her texts for a few more days, afraid that she would tell me right away, but would not meet up with her.  After another couple days went by, he just stopped responding to her texts at all.  This was all over about the course of a week, a week where he wasn’t sure we would make it through the week (because things were not going well **at all** between us at that time, I also remember the time not thinking we would make it through either).


This came out after trying to reconcile the friendship with the before-mentioned friend, as I knew she had gotten clean a few months ago.  She told me and tried to apologize, and gave her side of the story.  I was completely blind-sided.  I immediately texted my boyfriend saying that he was a pig, I was disgusted, etc.  He was supposed to pick me up shortly from work.  He at first denied it, and said he was upset I would believe something like that and got angry with me and said that we were done. 


 He ended up picking me up in the end, and after a long drive and a lot of crying on my part, we got home.  Initially he said he was going to get some things and leave, but shortly after we got home said he was really sorry but he needed to talk it through with me and explain everything and put everything in the open regardless of what happened.  He proceeded to tell me everything about the situation, what happened, etc.  His story matched up with my friends, and although it still hurt very, very badly, he told all of the truth. 


When I asked why he hadn’t told me in the six months since it had happened, he said at first he wasn’t sure we would make it through, and then once things started to go well, he didn’t want to reverse everything by revealing his wrong-doings.  He said that he planned to discuss it with me when we were both in a little better position mentally and emotionally, and that he knew it was a mistake but wasn’t sure how to handle it and he was selfishly afraid.  He said that he thought it would maybe be better to end things, but after having a discussion I said that I wanted to at least see how things could go and if I could forgive him.  We had been doing very well, and I knew we had both made our mistakes in the relationship, so perhaps this was another major obstacle we could overcome.


Since this came out, it has been a bit hard for me to cope, but he has been willing to talk about it openly with me and has been very sensitive about how I feel and when I may be struggling with it but not admitting it openly.  Our relationship honestly has never been much better and we are both at a good place mentally/emotionally and in life.  I often find myself wondering though, if I will ever be able to let go of it completely and trust him again if he earns it.  I do understand the reasons behind why he did what he did, as I have went through some of the same emotions when our relationship was very rough.  The thing that has been the most difficult for me is the fact that it was with my best friend and that to me, he essentially paid her to have sex with him, even if they didn’t follow through and that’s not the way he sees it.




 **My question is this:** am I insane for wanting to stay in the relationship?  Does it seem like this can work and we will be able to have a future together?  Everywhere I see people asking for advice regarding cheating, people say that it’s something that can never be overcome and that somewhere down the line it will result in a breakup and wasted time.  I know we love each other very much, and we want it to work, but I don’t want to continue if it’s really not healthy or if we can never restore trust.  He did something horrible, and not just once, but at the same time I feel like he’s being genuine and he would have eventually come clean.  We have been through a lot together, and with open communication I am hoping we can work through it.



 I’ve came across some texts he sent to his friend since it came out saying that even though it wasn’t a good decision, the mistake he made proved to him that freedom isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and that he doesn’t want to stray from me or be with other women.  He said something along the lines of it took being with another woman to really realize that it wasn’t at all what he wanted.  Part of me almost thinks that’s why our relationship turned around after it happened (or it very well could be that he quit talking to her because our relationship was turning around, since he saw her a few times until it was over).




**I AM LOST; PLEASE BE FRANK AND OFFER YOUR TWO CENTS.**



**TL;DR**: I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 2-3 years.  We have went through a lot together, and at the moment are doing very well and have grown a lot throughout the past few years.  I recently discovered that he cheated on me about six months ago – is this something that can be forgivable, and am I crazy for wanting to stay in the relationship?

In the beginning we meet a really psychotic, sociopathic Dexter. We also meet Dexter's brother. 

This past season, Brian comes back, Deb finds out. 

Dexter's world has been crashing down since we met him, and it (I predict) will come full circle with Brian (via the intern) in season 8. 

It is like a Kurt Vonnegut novel, starting as close to the end as you can. 

I must say, I've loved the ride of watching Dexter go from a true pyscho to a really disturbed individual who struggles with good and evil every day and hopefully one or the other will win.

I am taking 40 days off just to be safe, I know this seems like a short-term goal to many but after smoking for ~3.5 years regularly it is very difficult for me.

I am still craving the green regularly and my headaches are still present thus far, but my appetite and sleeping habits are beginning to come back to normal (or so I think).

Obviously my motivation is getting a job in the end and also to avoid an embarrassing conversation with my family about how I fucked up the first job offer I have ever received. But I have also been considering others that deal with much more addicting substances (coke, cigs, meth, etc.) and how they battle day-in and day-out. I think to myself if they can do it then there is no reason I should fail, is this a rational way of thinking? Or is this comparing apples to oranges?

Also note that I am not completely sure about returning to the habit after my 40 days, I may consider quitting but only time will tell.

Edit: I will continue to check in to let others know about my progress every 2 or 3 days. I am glad to help anybody out that needs advice for a similar situation. 

Edit 2: I also keep myself going by realizing how completely pissed I would be at myself for fucking up this opportunity, and end up looking back on the last 40 days asking why did I smoke????

s5kgl,6,2012-04-11,"31, and we haven't made sexytime for almost a year.  Maybe other problems, too.",dunno_wha_do,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/s5kgl/31_and_we_havent_made_sexytime_for_almost_a_year/,"Ok folks, I don't even know where to begin, I hope someone can help.  My wife and I have been married for almost 8 years now, and we were dating/living together for 4 years before that (college).  I love her very much, but we haven't had sex for almost a year now.  This is a long one, I apologize in advance!  Also, as I write this, I cannot express how uncomfortable I feel discussing sexytime in a serious way on the internet.  Please don't judge too harshly!

I would like to think that it's not all my fault, but I don't know how true this is.  Here are the issues as I see them:

*  Weight/physical attractiveness.  I don't expect my wife to look like she did when I first met her, time passes and all of that.  She has, however, put on quite a lot of weight since then, and this has affected my attraction to her sexually. However, I feel like there's no way to bring this up without grievously hurting her.  Once, earlier in our relationship, she asked if her weight was a problem, and I answered truthfully ""yes"".  Before I could clarify or expound, she locked herself in the bedroom, and didn't speak to me for two days (last words were ""Don't talk to me!"").  To add to the fun, in high school, she was borderline anorexic, due to stress from her parents divorce and subsequent remarriage.  So, I feel like I have no way to express one of the things that's holding me back.  Recently, I would like to add, she has initiated a workout plan, gym 3x a week, personal trainer, cutting some of the crap out of her diet.  I am so proud and happy for her to be doing this!

*  Touching again on her parent's divorce:  I feel like this is a constant cloud over her view of our marriage, that it's doomed to failure every time we have a fight.  I guess my philosophy is that there are going to be occasional fights, but you try to do better and you keep working at it.

* She's also very insecure about her general appearance.  I am constantly having to defend my opinion when I get the question ""do I look nice/pretty."", she complains of hair going grey, wrinkles,  etc., honestly I tire of it (because it's unwarranted!).  For the record, although I think she needs to loose weight, I think she's **very** pretty, and I tell her all the time!  It's like she doesn't even hear it.

*  The other side of this insecurity is she's very worried that another woman will sweep in and try to steal me.  I'm at my flabbiest now, 6' and 195 lbs.  She says girls think I'm hot, but that certainly wasn't my experience growing up (will discuss this further down).  She doesn't have anything to worry about, infidelity is NOT my way.

*  Time.  We both work, she's getting her master's degree.  The bigger issue, however, is that she's an ""A"" person (morning), and I'm a ""B"" person (nite owl).  I have no desire to go to bed at 9pm, and she seems unwilling to consider sexytimes at any other time of day but bedtime.  Some of this is her body insecurity, I think.  For some reason, I'm at my randiest in the morning (when she doesn't want to go to pound town), and right after getting home from work.

*  Depression.  We've both got it in the clinical sense.  Lately, it seems one of us gets over a bout right in time for the next one to sink in.  While this at least lets us keep the house going, and one of us is able to cheer up the other, it's difficult to work up the desire to wrestle when your neurotransmitters are actively trying to eff you in the a.

*  Sexytime ""style"".  I'm not against foreplay, but sometimes I just want to casually go at it!  She doesn't seem to be in this camp anymore, is it so wrong to just want to bang my wife on the couch every once in a while?  In other ways we are generally compatible, I really like doggy style, she doesn't care for it much, but humors me (and I always emphasize my appreciation).  I think it would be very hot to blow my load on her face or boobs, she's definitely not into that, and I can understand how that could be, and I'm ok with it!

*  In addition, it seems like we're at an impasse when it comes to initiating an encounter.  I think we're equally to blame here, because we both want the other to initiate.  I need to do better about this, but goddammit, so does she.  One quick kiss in the kitchen isn't enough of a signal for me sometimes, is it asking to much to just take me by the hand and tell me ""we're doing this now""?

*  Kissing.  I'm not a big kisser, I guess.  She is.  I try to kiss her often, lately it seems that when I do, all I get is complaints that ""I don't kiss long enough"".  Actually, now that I think of it, that complaint has been going on since the beginning, despite my efforts to improve.  How do I make her understand that when I kiss her and she complains, it makes me *less* likely to want to kiss her, not *more*?

*  My own inexperience.  I was a social recluse in elementary/middle/high school.  It was a **very** clique-y place, and I didn't fit into the athlete/pop culture mold.  Consequently, I never had a date in high school.  My wife was my first girlfriend, first sexual experience, you name it!  I don't regret this (well, a tiny bit, but honestly not a big deal), but it does make me wonder how I would deal with these problems if I had more experience dealing with the opposite sex.  I see this as a big problem, because I just don't have that much experience dealing with the female mindset, I have to learn it all with her.  I see the ""crazy"" in some of our friends' relationships, but I don't know what it looks like from the inside, other than what I'm seeing now, if that even counts.  This is very frustrating.

*  Babies.  She want's one.  I finally feel like I'm adult enough to have one, and once we get her a little more stable in her career (read: out of grad school, and a full time job as opposed to internship), we will be ready to make it happen.  I think she sees that this is the *logical* way to plan, but I also think she's a little ""baby crazy"", especially as our friends are all having kids right now.  I'm just not willing to have a kid and figure out the details later, and that's one of the few things in our marriage I'm not willing to budge on.  

*  She also had to have a cyst removed from one of her ovaries, and she still gets pain from time to time.  These times have managed to ""cockblock"" me on several occasions (especially the 6 months before surgery, when the diagnosis had yet to be made), I don't blame her at all for that, just sayin' it don't make it any easier.  

I hate hurting my wife's feelings.  I want to be a good husband.  I want her to be happy.  But I don't want to get steamrolled in the process.  I still need to be me, I need to be happy too.  What can I do?  What should she do?"
s8g27,93,2012-04-13,"If your question is ""Should I get into graphic design?"" then the answer is probably ""No."" If you are meant to be a designer, you will know.",sealiontamer,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/s8g27/if_your_question_is_should_i_get_into_graphic/,"I've seen/heard this question too many damn times and wanted to offer my take on it. 

If you don't have a passion for design in your heart you should NOT become a designer. ""I like to doodle"" and ""I have used photoshop"" are NOT good reasons to become a designer. I graduated with a bunch of people like this, people who chose design because they thought it was going to be an easy major and they fancied themselves ""artistic, creative free spirits"". The majority of those people are now servers, retail employees, and realtors.

Design is NOT easy, and it is by and large NOT an artistic pursuit. (Unless you consider a page from a picture-less novel ""art"") 

You will be getting paid to deliver brand messages and hawk product. You will be producing banner ads that no one will ever see/click. You are not painting Guernica or even drawing Garfield. 

You will be busting your ass to sell your ideas to dimwit clients who typically don't know shit about design and don't place ANY value on you or your skillset. 

You will be working with and taking direction people who get to positions of power by brown-nosing, being tall, and having a nice haircut.

You will be focusing primarily on typography and content organization, and typically only dabbling in what you might call art — color, image, illustration, icons, etc. (about 90%/10%)

Unless you truly enjoy all the anal, tedious minutiae that comes along with ""designing"" - (and by that i mean typography, kerning, leading, grids and guides, stock image/footage searching, color correcting, clipping paths, endless revisions — NOT crosshatching a portrait of your cat wearing a beret), you are guaranteed going to hate your existence and be one of many simply adding noise to a landscape already overflowing with bad-to-mediocre design.
___

Yes I realize I am an asshole and that this post is rife with potentially-unfair generalizations... if you disagree, please share why!

**Update:** I was always a lefty, artsy kid who enjoyed all creative pursuits — drawing, crafts, acting, music, etc. They were all hobbies and I never took any of them seriously and was never the best artist in class. I sucked at sports and had a passing interest in most other studies — enough to get decent grades but I never really considered a career in math, science, or ""business"". I always knew I wanted to be an ""artist"" of some kind, but didn't even have a concept of ""graphic design"" until I was in high school. I image most designers or people who consider getting into design fit this bill.

But I also clearly remember being impressed with certain logos as a kid and considering how the creators managed to create such recognizable images with such few shapes. being blown away by album artwork and t-shirt designs and silkscreen rock posters and wishing so badly that one day I could make something as awesome as the stuff I found cool.

I went to college for photography at 18 (but took the general art curriculum, including intro to GD) and dropped out after a semester. Then to a trade school for audio engineering — did that ""professionally"" for a few years. Went back to school for Graphic Design at 23. I became a paid design intern at 25 and am now an ACD at 31.

Lots of creative people are drawn to the idea of design because it's one of the few ways to actually make a living doing something ""creative"" — where less than 3% of painters, sculptors, actors, musicians, etc will ever make enough money to support themselves, there's a lot of money being thrown around in design and advertising — enough to feed many a family. That said, I know a lot of folks (some who are ex-designers) who make a respectable salary via other less traditional creative pursuits — baking, crafts, jewelry, custom murals. The world needs these creative people too!

The title of this rant is perhaps a bit much. As a few of you have said, people (creative or otherwise) should dabble in lots of different things before committing themselves to one specific career path (especially with the cost of quality education/software/hardware/etc). Exploring on your own (via the internet, self-initiated projects, libraries) over time is the only way to see if something really interests you enough to make a career of it. "

s85m2,6,2012-04-13,In Chile for June and July...,OnLakeOntario,chile,https://www.reddit.com/r/chile/comments/s85m2/in_chile_for_june_and_july/,"Well, I'm actually arriving the 26th of May, but small technicality.

I'm staying in a hostel in Bellavista. As I understand, this is a good area for clubbing and what not, but I'm also in Chile for an (unpaid) internship and to learn some Spanish.

So, questions...

1. I'm a fashion management major at my college in Toronto... As such, though my internship is based around journalism, I want to discover the Chilean fashion scene (street fashion, high end Vitacura fashion, everything). What would be the best place to start?

2. Phones... I read in another thread that it's apparently near impossible to get prepaid voice and internet... Not a problem. However, which company is going to rape me the least on prepaid data? 

3. Learning Spanish... I don't want to pay for a school. They're expensive and not worth it from what I've heard. What's the best way to go about getting a Spanish tutor and how much should I expect to spend? I'm also a pretty awesome cook, so bartering would be awesome as well.

4. Football/soccer... La U is doing rather well in the Copa Libertadores, and I must see Colo-Colo play. How do you buy tickets to these events?

5. Another soccer related question... Speciality stores. I want the jersey Colo-Colo wore for the last Copa Libertadores with their anthem in the background. As it's not current, I imagine I'll have to go to a speciality store or the Museo de Colo-Colo. Any that you would recommend?

6. Safety... Is a money belt necessary? I'm already picking up a small netbook so I don't have to lug my giant 17 inch laptop around (and it's a Mac... Even more encouraging for snatch and grabbers), but are pick pockets that bad? I'm avoiding this topic on expat forums as they blow everything out of proportion.

Hopefully I can meet up with some Redditors on my 1st &amp; 2nd days there, and get acclimated a bit. The main point of this trip is to gauge if Chile is the kind of place I could live once I get my degree (and to go to a wedding...), so anything else you can recommend I'd love to hear."

Hey LoseIt,

First of all, I just wanted to thank all of the wonderful people in this community who have helped me make this possible. The advice, support, and motivation I find here is indescribably amazing.

Here's a bit of background on me and how I changed my life for the better:

I graduated from college back in May of 2011. Right after graduation, I continued working as a finance intern for a technology company -- long, sedentary hours which left me mentally exhausted at the end of the day. The fatigue was usually so bad that I would just end up eating something frozen or delivered for dinner because I was too burnt out to actually cook something decent for myself. 

That summer is when I discovered r/LoseIt. Seeing all of the wonderful advice being exchanged inspired me to make my first post. At the advice of some amazing Redditors, I began to keep a simple daily log of my weight and everything I was eating. I also started to cook a week's worth of food on the weekend and portion them out into individual meals for the week so that I would have no excuses to eat poorly at the end of the workday. My go-to meal was oven-roasted chicken breast with a heaping helping of mixed vegetables and a small side of quinoa. Lunches usually consisted of salads or homemade chicken/tuna wraps. Also, I ditched my morning bowl of cereal for eggs and vegetables -- kept me so much happier and more satisfied during the day. The difference I saw in my weight, mood, and energy levels even after just one month of eating better was phenomenal. But there was still the pesky matter of exercise -- I was still very out of shape.

Now, exercise and I have a long and tumultuous history (middle school and high school PE, anyone?) I was wracking my brain over the options I had -- gym membership? Yoga? Spin? I didn't know what the hell I was going to do. I then received an e-mail that made it perfectly clear. Groupon -- $39 for 6-weeks of fitness boot camp:

The offer promised highly rigorous 30-minute workouts at 7:00am three to four times per week. I signed myself up and eagerly awaited orientation. When orientation day came (on a Saturday, with class to start on the following Monday), I found myself sitting in a fitness studio with a few dozen fellow Groupon'ers, absolutely befuddled and wondering about this huge mistake I was about to make. I thought to myself, ""In my 4 years at college, I can count the number of times I went to the campus gym on one hand, and I'm about to start something called 'boot camp'?! What the hell am I thinking?"" I spent the rest of that weekend ruminating and trying to think of excuses not to go.

Fast forward to Monday, August 1st. Alarm clock goes off at 5:30am -- thankfully, I'm very much a morning person. I fix myself two eggs and a 1/2 cup of rice, and pack a gym bag for the first time. The ""before"" picture above was taken in the morning right before my first boot camp session.

Now, this particular gym facility is over 5 driving miles from my apartment -- any San Franciscan will tell you that 5 city miles is a voyage. I get to the facility early as instructed, only to see the pained faces of the brave souls from the 6:15am class as they finished their last set of lord-knows-what. I was literally shaking in my gym shorts.

After they finished their warm-down stretches, it was my turn to hit the floor. After a bit of group stretching, it was finally time to begin circuit #1. I'd be damned if I even remember what we did in our very first circuit, because 30 minutes later, I found myself in the bathroom, on the verge of throwing up. It was then that I realized just how out of shape I was.

I managed to get myself over to work and into the showers in our building. I got dressed and headed up to my desk, and fought to stay awake for the rest of the morning. I returned home from work that day absolutely exhausted and wondering if I was gonna make it to another session. I spent all of the next day intermittently popping ibuprofen and trying not to move too much. As much as I was hurting, I was determined to make it on Wednesday morning.

And make it I did. And on Friday. And all three days the next week. And every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 4 weeks afterwards. Each time, the workouts became easier, and I found myself getting less and less winded after each one. Soon, I was feeling more energetic during the day -- no more 2:30 crash at work. But the good changes didn't stop there. My clothes began to feel more like blankets. I went through each item in my closet individually, and had to say goodbye to so many clothes that had served me well in the past.

Although I loved the boot camp immensely, it was too expensive to continue at a non-discount price. Since then, I made the resolution to be more active in general, and to capitalize on my alumni membership discount for my old campus gym.

While I had slimmed down considerably during 2011, I neglected the importance of strength training, and ended up in the awkward ""skinny-fat"" category. That's when I decided that it was time. for me to hit the weight room. At the recommendation of a friend (who happens to be a personal trainer), I picked up the book [The New Rules of Lifting](http://www.thenewrulesoflifting.com/), and I'm glad that I did. Armed with the knowledge and confidence to hit the weight room for the first time, I started right after the new year. The energy, confidence, and muscle I've built from a few short months of lifting weights has been nothing short of incredible, and I can't stress the importance of strength training enough.

Now that I have lost all the weight I wanted to lose for medical and health reasons, I am now focused on improving my general fitness and physical appearance (as vain as that may be :P). I have shifted my diet to a high-protein, low-fat, adequate-carb approach, maintaining a sufficient caloric deficit in order to further reduce my body fat percentage. My eventual (but lofty) goal is to have visible abs at some point, and I'm determined to get there one way or another.

I am also ridiculously excited to be participating in my first mini-triathlon in two weeks! Something I never thought possible months ago is now the main focus of my efforts.

Lastly, for anyone who is looking to lose weight or get healthy, just remember this: **there is no magic pill, shake, or gizmo that will take the place of clean eating and personal diligence**. It is remarkable to me how quickly the weight came off once I took control over what I was eating. At no point in this journey did I feel starving or deprived -- when you're full on tasty, nutritious, wholesome foods, your body no longer craves the processed junk anymore. Losing the weight and getting fit has simultaneously been the easiest and most difficult thing I've ever done; the diet and exercise is easy, but casting aside all of the self-doubt and excuses was definitely the challenging part. 

Sorry this ended up being such a long post -- I just felt that there was so much to share! I am so honored to be a part of this wonderful community, and I look forward to reading about all of your trials, tribulations, and SUCCESSES!

Cheers,
Dave 

[TL;DR -- Started cooking for myself, eating more nutritious wholesome foods, and became active for the first time of my life. More protein, less starches. Weight came off so easily it's almost ridiculous.]"

My partner recently got accepted for an internship at MIT. This is a dream come true for her (and for me, because I'm very proud of her), but now that the excitement is 'wearing off', reality is kicking in.

She's going to stay in Massachusetts for about 3 months. She's never been to the States for this long (we're both European) and the thought of going somewhere new, where she doesn't know anybody, is pretty scary.

Do you guys have any tips for great places where she can socialise and hopefully not feel alone? Bars, cinema's, parks, etc...

Also, since she will be an intern, she can not get a room at the MIT campus (sup with that? ;p). What would be a great way to find a place to stay? We know of craigslist and /r/bostonhousing, but maybe you guys have some interesting tips. As you can imagine, going to a different continent and moving in with someone you haven't met before is kind of scary.

Thanks in advance!"

Currently I am in my second year, and will be graduating next year. I am 19 years old

Right now I am very worried because my problem is that I do not have any experience and am not very confident.I have no networks whatsoever. The Big 4 does internships during the summer for students on their second last year of university such as myself. However I did not apply for it this year.

On the side, I am also studying to receive a Japanese diploma. 

My main question is, when I graduate I am thinking of not jumping straight into the accounting field, but instead take a year to teach in Japan as part of a program. 

When this is over, I feel like I will feel more confident and ready to enter into the business world.

Is this a good idea? And will such an experience help me get a job in accounting in the future when I, or will it be too late, as I hear that companies such as the Big 4 like to recruit graduates straight out of university? 
Though i am not saying I Big 4 is my only option, but would working for other firms, e.g. a bank or other companies as an accountant be as good? 

Thank you, I am very inexperienced but very ambitious, so would appreciate any responses!"

s758i,0,2012-04-12,Help me choose a school clinic this summer,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/s758i/help_me_choose_a_school_clinic_this_summer/,"All of the 2L summer internships I got this summer were unpaid, can't get school credit for them, and don't have a reputation for hiring interns after graduation, so I'm leaning towards doing a school clinic for credit this summer. It's close to my home and I get credit towards graduation for doing so. I'll also be able to research for a professor on the side for pocket money. 

The only thing is, I can't decide between two of the clinics. The first is a general practice clinic for indigent clients. Some characteristics of this clinic:
| It is a 45 minute drive away, but my school compensates me for gas AND something like $0.75 per mile for wear on the car.
| General practice, but most covers family issues (divorce, custody, protection from abuse, dependency, etc.)

The other option is an environmental law clinic. 
| Close distance, on campus, about 1 hour walking or 20 minutes by bus.
| Covers land use issues, clean water act cases, etc.

Here's the thing, though. I'm already enrolled in the Environmental clinic for the fall and spring semesters anyways (It's a year long commitment during the academic year). 

So the concerns running through my mind are these: will doing the general clinic (with the Enviro clinic during the year) make me stand out more to employers than committing to three semesters of the Environmental clinic? Would an extra semester of the Enviro not really do much for me in terms of attractiveness or can a case be made that it shows my dedication to that cause?

If the answer to my first question is yes, would the benefit of the general clinic alongside my environmental clinic be worth driving 45 minutes each way and sitting in traffic and all that? 

Should I consider the possibility that I will hate the Enviro clinic, and after a summer in it, will want to drop out for the year, saving me a year of trouble? 

What do you all think? Is there anything else I should be asking myself for making this decision? For what it's worth, if I had my choice, I would love to work in environmental law, but would be happy working in any public interest/non-profit area, and would take anything I can get in any of those fields after graduation. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!"

I am open to males or females. I work at SIS as an intern IT (the only IT they have &gt;.&gt;) and have online classes at Strayer. I have a girlfriend that I have been dating for a little over a year but she lives 2 hours away now so she won't be living with us. I am an avid gamer (mainly Call of Duty recently) and I am quite competetive, in a healthy way of course. NES and SNES bring me back to my favorite classics though. I own the following: Xbox 360, PS3, 3DS, Sega Dreamcast. I play anything and everything. I really love to go bowling or go out and play basketball or something but I don't do much of that because I don't have many friends in the area. I don't smoke or drink at all and I don't want to be around it.

.

I am Agnostic (Christian for about 16 years and now I lean more towards Atheism but I can't rule anything out) and I am very knowledgeable in both views so I can fit in and respect your views. I don't talk about it a lot. I do have fairly high morals that I have kept from the religious background but I have always listened to heavier music and cursed and everything. I am a very calm and laid back type of guy.

.

I have been living in the area for almost a year now. I only have 3 friends that I really talk to anymore and none of them are able to get an apartment right now. I had 2 apartment situations that I got out of and I am now living with my cousins. I don't like living here because they are raising a family and I often feel like I'm intruding.

.

First off I'll explain to you what was up with my apartment situations. I was attending school at DeVry and I got the apartments through them. In the first apartment I had roommates that were pretty douchebaggish. I was able to stand it for a while but then they started smoking weed and getting drunk everyday and the were worse while they were in these conditions. I don't approve of either of those and I couldn't handle living with them so I asked to be moved to a different apartment.

.

In the second apartment everything was fine for a while until I started noticing things coming up missing. It started with small things like a 16 GB SD card that I might not notice. That turned into $50 Christmas week (I had to have a friend give me gas so I could drive home for Christmas...), my class ring, and a laptop. Needless to say I got out of there the week after Christmas when I came back missing those things as well.

.

I was pointed to a set of apartments by another redditor. The price is $395 for a 1 BR and $495 for a 2 BR. The person who linked me there said they pay around $120 a month for utilities. They are about average sized and seem to be pretty nice. I personally have a lot of things that you need in an apartment, all the kitchenware, a bed, a kitchen table/chairs. I have a mini-fridge for the living room and several TVs. I think I can supply a Futon or couch from a family member as well. If you want to check out the listing for the apartment, [click here!](http://www.apartmentfinder.com/Ohio/Columbus-Apartments/Colonial-East-Apartments)

If you are interested shoot me a message. I am actually available to move in any time pretty much."

2. My sister said something to me at her wedding. ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""

Lemme list some things about him that may be it..

- He's quiet.
- According to some of the female nurses, some think he looks good.
- He can be sarcastic and cynical at times, but its rather funny. (I happen to be the same way.)
- He smiles a lot.
- He may not have any self esteem or be socially awkward. (Im not sure because he is never down on himself nor acts like he is confident.)
- He seems tired all of the time and sometimes comes across lazy.
- He seems like he doesnt like to talk to people because its a waste of time. Either that or hes not comfortable with it.
- Hes really nice.. always willing to scrub in on mundane slice and dices.

Really.. the list goes on and on.. but I think he may be super average. Doesnt stand out.

Below is the beginning of a short story I'm working on. I've recently become interested in writing as a creative outlet since I get no such satisfaction from my work. I'm looking for any feedback. Since I'm just getting into this I would like to avoid getting in to any bad habits. The story is about a man who can dig into and influence peoples minds. He sells this talent/service to individuals looking to influence politics. 

---------------------------------------------

The guy in front of me stepped away and the security guard suspiciously looked me over.  I got a little nervous.  It happens every time.  Are they going to see through my phony invite and identification?  Then the real questions would start.  The who’s, what’s, when’s, where’s and why’s.  None of which I felt inclined to answer.

I took a cautious step forward and presented my invite.  The guard grabbed it and looked it over.  It was painfully obvious he was looking close, but more so concerned with the appearance of it.  I smiled and took it back when he handed it to me.  What a clown.

The guard told me to raise my arms and spread my feet and proceeded to pat me down.  My palms were sweating a little.  I never carry anything on me, but getting through security is always the toughest part of the job.  When you’re up to no good you think everybody around you has some kind of sixth sense about it.  All this time and I still succumb to a little paranoia here and there.  When he finished I shook his hand and thanked him for good measure.  Contact made, his mind was open and I peaked inside. It was cluttered and unfocused, the connections were a mess, but I found what I was looking for.  No issue, all he cared about was when he got off shift.  He probably forgot my face as soon as the next guy stepped forward and handed him their credentials.

The guard waved me on and I left my anxiety behind at the checkpoint.  I stepped through the open double doors into the foyer and the party was in full swing.  I smiled again.  It seemed so cliché, waiters in tuxedos carrying glasses of expensive wine on a silver platter.  Those people do love their opulence, don’t they?  I grabbed a glass as a waiter floated by.  No sense in being the only person in the room without a drink, right?

I surveyed the crowd.  The sooner I spotted my target the sooner I could make an exit.  The mansion was big, but I had a feeling it wouldn't be too hard to locate my target.  Off the foyer to my left was a large sitting area filled with couches, chairs and other butt-holding instruments.  Directly in front of me was a staircase with an ornate banister, gold trimmed and spared no detail.  To my right was the busiest room in the house.  The bar was packed from wall to wall and the bartenders moved with speed and grace to fill orders as fast as they could.

I decided to head left into the sitting area.  I imagined that my target would be just as enthusiastic as I was about the prospect of pushing my way into the crowd at the bar.  Besides, he probably had some lacky intern at his beck and call to fetch his drinks for him.  The guests adorning the furniture were contributing to a dull roar.  It was hard to make out any specifics, only words plucked from the air here and there.  As I moved deeper into enemy territory I could hear the soft call of piano music.  It was slow, but melodic, carrying a deep sense of emotion.  My curiosity peaked and I sought to discover the source.

I turned the corner and spotted my target.  The Senator sat, dressed in a black business suit, behind the piano.  Surrounded by an awestruck crowd the room was still, his practiced movements the only source of motion.  I took a spot in the back of the room. I would have to wait until this performance was finished before I could get in close and make contact.  

As the song began to display the tell-tale signs of winding to a close I began to plan contact.  Some targets in the past have been easier than others.  Sometimes, though rare, they have taken steps to limit physical contact.  This presents a unique challenge, one that often involves one of those ""Oh, I tripped. Thanks for catching me.""-type moments.  If I was lucky the Senator would be in full politician-mode, schmoozing, meeting and greeting to the fullest extent.  The music had stopped; I would soon find out.

The Senator rose from the bench to raucous applause and gave a small bow.  His mouth was forming ""thank you's"", but I couldn't hear them.  He moved into the crowd and began shaking hands, this was my chance.  I repositioned myself into his path and acted the part of an admiring constituent.  

""Senator,"" I said. ""That was beautiful""

The Senator shuffled near with his hand out and I grabbed it.  He felt my grip and turned to lock eyes with me, his mouth smiling, but his eyes calm and unaffected.  There it was!  My mind flooded with foreign images, memories and thoughts of a man well exceeding me in age.  It was overwhelming at first, as it sometimes is.  His mind was so much more structured and disciplined than the security guard, the difference was as stark as day and night.

sbhjn,26,2012-04-15,Any advice for asking for a raise when the company is in a down time?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/sbhjn/any_advice_for_asking_for_a_raise_when_the/,"Here is my history with my company, followed by the **TL;DR;**

I can’t think of a better subreddit to post this in, if there is one please let me know.

I went to school for web design and got a job at a marketing/design firm while I was still in school. The position has evolved into more of a web developer position, and I love it.

I started as a paid intern at $10 an hour doing design as I taught myself how to build websites, they had been using a company from out of state to build all of their websites and I made myself the goal of replacing that company. Within six months I had reached that goal and they hired me on as a salaried employee at 25k a year.

During this time the company was doing extremely well. It's a relatively new startup, and they were going into their fourth year. At our Christmas party they said that because we were doing so well that they started a profit sharing program, and we all receive bonus checks. My boss took me aside and said that they had hired a consultant to help with the company’s growth, and that part of that was going to be a salary review in order to insure that we were making fair market wages. 

He said that they knew that I was being underpaid but wasn’t sure by how much, but that it would be a few months before they finished the review process. They gave me a raise to 30k that night, and said that I could expect another one when the review process was finished. A few months later I received another raise that put me at 45k.

This was about 14 months ago, and my 2 year review is coming up in June.

I actually never really planned on at staying in this city, and had planned on moving when I graduated college. But in the time I’ve been here I’ve really fallen in love with my job. 

I want to ask for a raise, and a fairly substantial one. My goal is to make 55k, which would be about 20% more than I make now. The problem is we’re not raking in the money like we were before. We’re going through some growing pains and the owner mentioned about a month ago that we had been living payroll to payroll. 

But even knowing that I’m honestly not that worried. We landed a few biggish contracts and are hiring for 2 more positions (going from 9 to 11 employees). I think we’re all really excited about making the next year a good one. 

(On a side note, I have been saving up an emergency fund just in case, but honestly the unknown is part of why I love this job)

We are in a small town, and we are the only company of its kind here. If I ever need to find a new job it will involve moving away, which would be fine with me. The closest town and most likely destination would be Ft Collins CO, and according to indeed.com the [average salary for web developers is 68k](http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Web-Developer-l-Fort-Collins,-CO.html).

The other piece of  information that I have which I probably shouldn't share with them is that I talked to the only other web developer we've ever hired, and he was making 62k. He was fired for poor performance, but he had a lot more experience than I do. I am a much better developer/designer than he was.

I feel like I’m in a good position to ask for a raise, except for the slow business. 

So here is my idea. I thinking about in the review telling them that I want a raise, and backing it up with the 68k theoretically available in the next town over. The honest truth is that if they say no I’ll still want to continue working here. The raise would make life a shit-ton easier, but I’d rather work somewhere that I love and make less than make more and be stuck in a cubicle somewhere. 

I’m going to collect my thoughts and arguments and write them down, and in my review tell them the salary I want. I’m going to ask them what I would need to do in order to earn the 55k, and give myself 6 months or a year to reach those goals.

Is there any advice you guys can offer me? This will be the first time I’ve ever asked for a raise. I think the fact that I wouldn’t quit if they said no might be apprenant, which probably isn’t ideal. And there is the concern about the tight budget we’ve been working on the past few months. But that’s why I’m going to propose either the 6 month or 1 year timeline. 

**tl;dr;**

I want a big raise, not willing to leave my job if I don't get it, I believe I've earned it, and I'm willing to prove that I can earn it. I'm planning on asking in June, so I have time to prepare. But I want to know what I should bring to the table in order to make my case."
sbawi,3,2012-04-15,Don't know how to move on.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/sbawi/dont_know_how_to_move_on/,"I have come to a point in my life where I don´t know how to continue anymore.
 4 years ago I met a girl, I was (and still am) totally in love with her. From the very beginning her parents have been against it, I was too low educated and I couldn't take care of her they said. 
She had been cutting herself for quite some time at that point, and I took care of her, I was 15 at the time.
But since then we have been together on and off, I have had another relationship in between for 13 months.
 But I kept coming back to her, because I was worried what happened to her and what she was going through. 
After my 13 month relationship I went back to her and we got together for quite some time, but everything as always had to be secret because her parents were still against me.
 We had intercourse once, and that was the last time I had seen her for half a year ( I didn't want to abandon her, she didn't contact me, I didn't have the time because of my internship).
But now she has found a new guy she is dating.
And he is accepted by her parents and is welcome there and they see each other often.
I still like her, and I am eaten by this feeling of them having the opportunity to be together.
Why didn't I have that when we were together.
Why did I have to go through all this shit for some other guy to just walk in and have none of those problems.
I asked her if I would have asked her for another shot at a relationship after we last saw each other before my internship she would have said yes.

If only I would have followed my heart we would have been together she would never had met the other guy and I would have been happy. Why is life doing this to me, she was the girl I loved for so long who I held most dear and who I have taken care for for al those years. The fact that a new guy comes in and has all these things I didn't have with het is just something that eats me from the inside.
And she gives me all these signals I don't get, one time she is very friendly and almost affectionet (sorry for the lousy grammar) and the other moment she is saying it isn't going to be anyting.
I don't know it anymore, I don't know how I can block the feelings and thoughts of thinking about what she and that new guy are doing together and why I'm still alone. Have I done anything to deserve this, I don't know.

It feels so unfair and I don't know what to do anymore and what to say and how to feel and to proceed. We still have contact and we still speak each other over msn, and I have tried blocking every contact with her.

But that resulted in me being depressed and almost hanging myself...

Sorry for this super long rant, but I don't know what to do anymore.
Is this worth waiting for, because I have the feeling she is the one for me, but I don't know if i need to follow my heart, because it's killing me.

What kind of advice would you all have for an incoming grad student?
 
What would you have done differently if you could go back?

Are there particular things that most programs don't cover, but I should learn? 

How can I prep myself to be as employable as possible after I graduate? Where would be a good place to look for relevant internships? 

Obviously, I plan on talking to my advisers about all of this, but I'd really like to hear your all's opinions/experiences/advice.

4 years ago I met a girl, I was (and still am) totally in love with her.
From the very beginning her parents have been against it, I was too low educated and I couldn't take care of her they said.
She had been cutting herself for quite some time at that point, and I took care of her, I was 15 at the time.

But since then we have been together on and off, I have had another relationship in between for 13 months.
But I kept coming back to her, because I was worried what happened to her and what she was going through.
After my 13 month relationship I went back to her and we got together for quite some time, but everything as always had to be secret because her parents were still against me.
We had intercourse once, and that was the last time I had seen her for half a year ( I didn't want to abandon her, she didn't contact me, I didn't have the time because of my internship).

But now she has found a new guy she is dating.
And he is accepted by her parents and is welcome there and they see each other often.
I still like her, and I am eaten by this feeling of them having the opportunity to be together.

Why didn't I have that when we were together.
Why did I have to go through all this shit for some other guy to just walk in and have none of those problems.
I asked her if I would have asked her for another shot at a relationship after we last saw each other before my internship she would have said yes.

If only I would have followed my heart we would have been together she would never had met the other guy and I would have been happy.
Why is life doing this to me, she was the girl I loved for so long who I held most dear and who I have taken care for for al those years.
The fact that a new guy comes in and has all these things I didn't have with het is just something that eats me from the inside.


And she gives me all these signals I don't get, one time she is very friendly and almost affectionet (sorry for the lousy grammar) and the other moment she is saying it isn't going to be anyting.

I don't know it anymore, I don't know how I can block the feelings and thoughts of thinking about what she and that new guy are doing together and why I'm still alone.
Have I done anything to deserve this, I don't know.

It feels so unfair and I don't know what to do anymore and what to say and how to feel and to proceed.
We still have contact and we still speak each other over msn, and I have tried blocking every contact with her.

But that resulted in me being depressed and almost hanging myself...

Sorry for this super long rant, but I don't know what to do anymore."

I live out in Sun Prairie so I tend not to get downtown to often and really don't know my way around. 
I've thought of taking a bus, but I have to continue working my full time job so I just really don't have the time to sit and wait around for a bus. Any ideas on what I can do? Any places close by that I could possibly park and maybe bike in? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated."

Now it's been two years, and last Friday she went off to her farm internship (estimated to last 5-8 months).

I didn't treat her like the amazing person that she was, and at times I got real bitter that she was leaving for this adventure. It was selfish of me, but I owned up and we had a very sorrowful goodbye the morning of her departure.

She kept assuring me before she left that it would be hard, but we could get through it. Fast forward not even a week, we've been texting, etc, but I notice it's steadily become less and less. Talk to her on Thursday and everything seemed to be alright, Friday the 13th, I text the usual ""I love you, good morning.""

This is the beginning of the end, she replies cheerfully, but doesn't reciprocate an ""I love you."" Eventually, after some more texts, I realize that she isn't saying it at all, so I call her. 

It's over, apparently she had been putting a lot thought into it over a couple of days, and it was too far and too long for us to be together. And ultimately, ""it shouldn't be this hard to date someone.""

One thing I noticed, she would always browse this subreddit and I'd ask her if she was reading it because she was troubled, she just liked to read the stories. I don't know if that was true, but this is just a tangent.

I asked her if we could ever be together again, she said she didn't know, but maybe when she got back. Was this her just saying that to let me down easy, she did say she had already hurt me enough.

I logged out of her facebook, erased the saved password. I still live in our room, but am moving out when I graduate college (2 months left). I'm shattered. 

It seems though, from her sisters and family friends that I've spoken to, she's alright. She didn't cry nearly as much as me through out this. She even seemed a lot stronger about leaving then I did, before she left.

Do I have any hope? "
sagin,3,2012-04-15,"IT Guy Looking For Job (I know this isn't a job board, but please read)",TheChrisHill,Charleston,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charleston/comments/sagin/it_guy_looking_for_job_i_know_this_isnt_a_job/,"Hi, my name's Chris. I'm a 25 year old hard worker who moved down to this area about 6 months ago. I'm getting married in June, living with my in-laws, and looking for a career path slightly different to the one I'm on now.

Currently I'm working as a Certified Technician at Staples. While I'm very good at my job, sadly it's about 90% focused on selling. I was told I would be selling every now and then, but it's become a big part of this job. I like it, because it's a job, and it helps pay my bills and helps me treat my fiance (who is working as an unpaid intern) to a weekly date night, but I don't like it in the sense that the pay is embarrassingly low for a Computer Technician.

Previous to this job I worked at an independent gaming store in Columbia, SC and developed my own process to repair gaming consoles. It was very hardware related, and I really took pride in it. I worked there for a year until I realized I needed to get out of that city (seriously, it's crazy up there). Previous to that job, I operated my own business repairing game consoles out of my home. I did this job for a year also.

I don't have any formal training other than being a Staples Certified Technician, but I *have* gone to The University of South Carolina, University of South Carolina - Lancaster, and Midlands Technical College. I basically just do not have the money to finish the last 1.5-2 years of schooling for a degree, but I DO plan on finishing it out, whether it's taking online classes when I find a decent paying job, or joining the Air Force.

I can also provide a resume and cover letter to any employers who may be reading this.

Even though this may get lost in the depths of Reddit, it's worth a shot. If anybody knows anybody who is hiring, please let me know, any help would be appreciated.

I can answer any further questions also. Thanks [/r/Charleston](/r/Charleston) !"

sda7t,0,2012-04-16,The Benefits of Personal Networking:  How Chalcedon Got Really Drunk and Got to Play with a Professional Laser-Effects System,Chalcedon,ChalcedonsTestZone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChalcedonsTestZone/comments/sda7t/the_benefits_of_personal_networking_how_chalcedon/,"*I actually emailed this story to my brother a day ago, and I've rewritten it for here (names obscured, mostly, some details added for background).  It's the story of how a good friend of mine roped me into going to a furcon, then introduced me to a really neat person while I was hammered.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kEjHgFlJ9c) is the best clip I could find of the system I got to mess with, but it really only shows off 1 pattern of the 30 it was capable of, which is a shame.  It's kind of a long ramble, but I've tried to make it funny.*

It started inauspiciously.  After much gnashing of teeth and a bit of panic, I obtained a job for this summer in Farmington Hills, Michigan (basically Detroit).  The job itself was excellent, having a competitive salary and a generous housing stipend that was to cover the majority of a furnished apartment for myself and the two other interns I was to be rooming with.  The company I was interning with had recommended two apartment complexes to stay in.

I had resolved to go up to the Detroit area to see the apartments for myself before making any choices about where I was staying.  Enter one of my best friends, who I'll call Aestuo.  Aestuo, before transferring to a different college midway through Sophomore year, was my roommate.  After he found out I was going to Detroit, he immediately perked up and suggested a weekend.  When asked why, he simply said ""Oh, a group of us are going to a furcon up there.""

Now, while I love Aestuo to death, and after living with him for a year and a half am no stranger to the furry community, I had no intention of going to a furcon.  However, he won me over with a few simple concessions:

1)  The group would pay for my gas

2)  Staying with the group would drastically cut my hotel cost

3)  He'd pay for my badge

4)  FCN, the con we'd be attending, was well known for the quality of its Saturday night rave and light show

and most importantly 5)  The group would pay for any libations I desired that weekend.

At this point, despite my initial reluctance, what essentially amounted to a weekend in Detroit for $30+food and getting to chill with a good friend that I get to see maybe twice a year was enough to win me over.  I acquiesced and arranged my weekend plans around this con I was now going to.

I'll leave the details of the con itself to the imagination.  Let it simply be known that it was one of the more surreal experiences of my life and that some things, once seen, cannot be unseen. It wasn't a bad time overall, just... a strange one.  But I digress.

Saturday night began as expected.  For those unaware of general con culture, during 3-day cons Saturday tends to be the night things get a hair crazy, when any parties that might happen will happen.  I had begun my Saturday night in grand fashion:  After splitting a bottle of gin with another member of the con group I was with, we traveled over to the main con hotel and proceeded to make our way to a room party.

The room party did not excite... That is, until I found one of the most beautiful sights I have ever laid eyes on:  The was bathtub filled with ice and Killian's Irish Red.  I immediately set up camp and began my grim duty of emptying most of the tub.  About thirty minutes and an indeterminate but gratuitous amount of Killian's later, Aestuo, who is forever sober, came up to me and nudged me:  ""Chalc, we've gotta go.""

I had no intention of leaving this *gorgeous* monument to debauchery.  However, my somewhat-slurred objections died on my lips as he pointed out a rather irritated looking guy standing in the corner and whispered: ""That's the host.""  Said guy was giving me a glare which very clearly translated to:  ""You have 10 seconds to excuse yourself or be forcibly excused.""  After looking from him to the impressive collection of bottles I had created, I took the hint and abandoned ship with Aestuo.

Feeling a bit sheepish, a bit like an ass, and a bit too hammered to really continue drinking anyway, I quickly realized that I was being led to the elevators by Aestuo.  Upon inquiring where we were going, he simply responded ""We're going to meet Fizz.""

Over the course of the weekend, I had discovered something:  Aestuo spent most of his time at cons attempting to meet people he found interesting, or that were in senior positions at the con.  It was why he was able to get me into the con on the cheap (in with the administration), why he was on a first-name basis with Kage (who is apparently a big deal among furries), and why he was able to introduce me to ""Fizz,"" who was apparently in charge of lighting and effects for the rave currently thumping along in the main ballroom.  Fizz also apparently built custom laser and lighting show systems for places like Disney's park in California.

Down on the main floor, I was taken to the bar and lead to a built man with a blonde mohawk, who turned, cordially greeted Aestuo, and introduced himself to me as Fizz.  As we began talking, I quickly remembered two things about myself:  I really, REALLY like talking about things in my field, and alcohol makes me extremely chatty.  These two things combined led Fizz and I on a winding conversation covering topics from Fast Fourier Transforms of laser waveforms, efficient assembly for TI C6000 series DSPs, using Bezier curves to track paths for individual lasers in systems to follow, and all manner of technical jargon relevant to the design of the circuits and programs that comprise lighting systems.  I was actually fascinated that I was able to lucidly discuss things I hadn't dealt with in years while occasionally shaking my head to keep Fizz from completing the mitosis he appeared to be attempting.

After something around forty minutes, Fizz leaned in kind of close and said:  ""Do you want to go to the booth?""  My heart skipped a few beats:  ""What booth?""  Fizz leaned in a little closer:  ""The booth where laser system's control panel is.""  At this point, I held in a bieber-fan-esque squeal of joy and just nodded dumbly.  I was beginning to sober up, and as we wandered towards the sound of pumping bass it was difficult to suppress my mounting excitement.

Once inside, we quickly arrived at a simple control setup:  There was a touchscreen with about 30 different patterns displayed, and a basic control board with 8 sliders and a number of buttons.  Fizz explained that this was the previous version of the control software and upcoming versions would look better.  He then sat down and showed me how it worked:  Select a pattern, and the sliders automatically move to default locations on the board.  You could then modify things such as pattern size, speed, color, and intensity with the sliders, and using one specific button you could pause a pattern for effect.  After explaining the system and letting us watch him work, Fizz looked at me and said:  ""Hey, the next set is an Electro-House set.  I'm going to go back to the bar.  Do you want to take the system for it?""

My jaw dropped.  Yes.  Yes I did want to take the system.  I had sobered up enough to grasp it adequately, and as the set started, I settled in for what would become one of the best hours of my life.  I was pretty awful for about the first ten minutes, but I quickly got in the groove and made some effects I was extremely proud of.

As the set wore down, another person who was *actually* on the AV staff came and replaced me.  I wandered back to the bar where Fizz was, thanked him, found Aestuo, and retired back to my room.  Sunday rolled around, and after I felt well enough to be vertical I made sure to track down and thank Fizz while sober.  We had a short conversation involving swaps of contact information, then went our separate ways.

The rest of the weekend went down as expected:  I had to leave early and drag a few unwilling people from the con group to my car to leave.  I drove the 4 hours to drop them off, and then the 3 hours to get back home in time to make a meeting with a project group and client.

I don't really think I'll be able to top this past Saturday for a while.  It was an absolute ball.  Either way, that's the story of how a buddy of mine knew some people and got me an in to do some really cool stuff.

sd0rx,2,2012-04-16,"20, F, College is becoming more and more stressful, and it's hard to handle.",fmlaccount,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/sd0rx/20_f_college_is_becoming_more_and_more_stressful/,"I'm currently a sophomore computer science major at a somewhat prestigious (but not Ivy) university. The first year while I was undecided and messing around with courses in the college of arts and sciences, I ended with a 3.86 GPA. 

Now that I'm in the engineering college pursuing a major in CS, I've been doing terribly. Last semester I dropped one of my two math courses, then got a D in the other. I also got a C in another class, dragging my GPA down to a 3.33. 

This semester it looks like I'm going to get a D in the CS weed-out class for my major (I need a C- to pass), and I'll probably have another C.

This is all so stressful and I don't know what to do. Currently I'm looking at having to take 5 classes per semester, and since I will most likely fail a class this semester, I'll have to take that one again (it will be with another professor who is really easy). 

I don't really want to switch majors. I *like* my major, and it's really the only thing I can say interest me, but it's just so damn hard. It's given me so many opportunities to travel, plus the program has 100% job placement rate. I'm just worried about graduating withing my 4 years. I can take this class I'm failing over the summer, but it costs money I really don't have. I'm already going to be spending thousands on going to Europe for an internship and taking the math course I got a D in once I get back. I was thinking, ""Well, my parents are going to kill me, but *maybe* I can convince them to let me dish out another $2440 to take another class this summer. Even with that I got screwed over. The class meets 4x a week, and one of the meeting times would interfere with the math class. 

I really don't know what to do. I can't take 6 classes one semester. It'd kill me. I can barely handle 5. I become so sleep deprived and lately have felt physically ill very often. I get frequent headaches, and this is just making it so much worse. I get so upset over my courses that I begin to feel nauseous. I've briefly considered staying one extra semester to lighten the load, but I really don't have that kind of cash. 

I was the perfect A+ student in high school and I feel like since being in college, and switching colleges (within my university), I'm slipping.

Note: I talk to my professors. In the class I think I'm going to fail, the professor told me today I need to get an 80% on the final to be on the border of a D+ and C-. I could study extremely hard, but realistically I doubt I'll near an 80% (I'd have to practically double my performance based on the past 2 exams) , especially since I'll have two other exams to study for before this one.

I don't really know what you can do. I don't know if anyone can really give me any guidance, or just a cheerful thought. I got back my exam grade today, so the reality is sinking in that I'll have to take this class again and I really don't have the time for it. I'll have to plan the rest of my college life (again, as far as my schedule goes), even though I did this already and said, ""Ok, but this will only work if I never fail a class.""

Tl;dr: I'm not doing great in college and it's becoming both physically and mentally exhausting."

Today I really didn't want to go to school because everything seemed so meaningless. The thought of cutting my veins kept occurring to me. I learned from an online post long ago that cutting your veins and soaking in a bathtub with warm water is the least painful way to die. I wish I do not need to live with the guilt and unbearable pain of loss. I wish death is the easy escape. However, I still managed to go to school with 15 min late, because I needed to turn in a take home exam; because I needed to get good grades from my class; because I needed good grades to get a good job; because I needed the money from the job to repay the tens of thousands of dollars my parents paid for my college, and make them happy the rest of their life. I still cannot let down the people that still love me.

 

But with the unbearable pain that I was afraid I was not the girl they thought I was. Yesterday I told my mom that my boyfriend proposed to me, my mom and I were both so excited and thrilled. From my mom's loving and happy expression, I suddenly felt I grew up and I was no longer a little girl, and I was a whole new fully matured woman capable to take responsibility in life. Yesterday at this moment I felt like the happiest woman in the world with my boyfriend getting me the perfect ring I wanted. It was like I finally found the meaning of life.

 

My boyfriend is the nicest guy in the world, even though at the beginning he was flaky; but later on, he fully devoted himself, and I never felt so good with a man. It was like my dream from my childhood came true. I was his princess and he was my prince. I never felt so secure and right with a man, and we could see our future together.

 

Forgive me for not being able to describe in full what happened that made me realize how sinful I was. Last night he checked my cellphone messages and found out I cheated on him when our relationship barely started.

 

I was different at that time and I had my dark side. When I felt depressed about relationships, I looked for attentions from some other guy, even it was just purely physical attention from the person. I was not confident about our relationship at that time, and I thought cheating without emotions involved did not count. Of course, it was just my own utilitarianism to justify my actions at that time. The worst part was not about cheating but lying. Later on in our relationship, he did ask me once if I ever slept with any other guy after we started sleeping together, and I gave him an affirmed ""no"". And I believed all my action convinced him that I would never cheat on him, because I never acted I was guilty. Yes, I never felt guilty about the short-lived affair, because I justified myself that I wholeheartedly loved him, and I was just being insecure at the beginning.

 

Life is so ironic that he found this out the day he gave me a ring. I realized how horrible I was at the beginning. I was not being sincere and I pretended I was someone more mature than I was at the moment. In reality, I was a childish and selfish bitch. Even though he was acting flaky and uncertain about us at the beginning, he was sincere to me and his feeling. However, I was not. I pretended to be the person I wanted to be and allowed myself to have the dark side. The worst, I lied. I was so afraid I would lose him so I lied. Now I realized being afraid of losing him was still a selfish reason to lie, because I was only considering my own feeling that I would lose him. 

I felt my sin. I felt my soul was contaminated. The worst, I never noticed this until now. When I was sitting in class, part of me tried to understand what the professor was talking about; and part of me felt so shameful that I should not even sit in here. I felt I did not deserve anything good in my life, such as my parents, my best-friends, my school, my internship, and of course my loving boyfriend and fiancé-going-to-be. I was too shameful and sinful to tell them I was a cheater and a liar. The easy way out of this mess was so tempting. So I was in class, picturing out the wounds and red streams in the water; somehow, I felt this was alleviating my sin. If I chose the extreme way to show my apology, would it purify my soul? I needed the compatible pain to purify my sin.

 

Then I thought about if I should leave a note and tell my parents and my boyfriend that I love them one more time, but then I could not picture them reading my note. I was already a damned soul and how I dared to add more pain to them? 

 

I should suck my pain up, and do more good in the world as I could. Not as if doing good is a way to wash off my sin, but as if a damned soul just wants to do good in rest of its damned life. How dare I to even think about purifying myself? Suicide was the wrong easy way out. Suicide would be as bad as cheating and lying. They are all the same easy routes that do not go anywhere. I really want to do something good to my boyfriend. But I do not know how. Maybe my disappearance in his life is better for him. Maybe he would take another chance to love me again. If he would, I would do as much as good to him. To love him as much as I can in the best way and the right way as a human can. Not for his forgiveness, but just because this is the thing what I wanted to do the most in the world to make things right. His forgiveness and acceptance would be too much luxury for a person who could never change the past and who could not undo his pain. 

 

I already told him that we could take a break and he could decide what would be the best for him. That was the only thing I could do.

 

Maybe I can start doing good to the other people that love me. My parents. I know that loving myself and being a decent person is the best way to make them happy. I pretended I was. I neither loved myself or being decent. I still do not know if I should tell my parents what happened. I would definitely upset them, and I do not know asking for their acceptance do any good to them.

 

I probably do not need my parents to go through this, because I already accepted myself. I accepted my past wrong-doing. What has been done has been done.  It is true that my own forgiveness was my ultimate reason not to kill myself. I should not punish myself for what was in the past and could not be redone. However, I do not ask for relive from my suffering. Maybe there is no relive. Now I see my suffering as a way to straight things up and being a noble person in the future. Because if I can live with my suffering and do things right, I live through it like a triumph. This is the meaning of my suffering.

 

""We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation--just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer--we are challenged to change ourselves."" - Victor Frankl



This is from the book my wonderful boyfriend let me read not long ago, because he noticed the saddes and depression and anger that happened to me sometime, which I tried really hard to manage. I never found a book so enlightening, and I believed it cured my depression where the psychologists did no help. This is just one of the numerous things I so deeply appreciate my boyfriend. I cannot find a reason not to love boyfriend now. Yes, even after what happened, even if I was damned."

sc4da,4,2012-04-16,Should I stay an extra year? ,anonymousperson12345,SBU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/sc4da/should_i_stay_an_extra_year/,"Okay so I am approaching the time when I have to decide what to do for the rest of my undergraduate time. I have the requirements to enroll in the health science program, which is necessary to complete my major. However, the conditions of getting into the program is that I have to graduate right after I complete the program. I cannot stay an extra semester (for this undergraduate degree) to take any more classes - that means no additional minors, majors, anything. (This is what the academic adviser told me. Correct me if I am wrong.) So now I have to think about whether I should delay my graduation for an entire year since the program begins in fall only. I just do not know if it is worth staying an entire year to finish recommended requirements for graduate school which I do not know if I even want to attend in the first place. However, I also feel like I am not emotionally prepared for graduation. On a professional level, I lack internships and job experience. On a personal level, I felt like I never got to truly enjoy college. I am a transfer student so my experience had been mostly stressful, from disliking my old school, the process of transferring schools, and the adjustment period to Stony Brook. Perhaps an additional year could give me some time to actually enjoy college. So in summary, the pros/cons list I came up with for staying an extra year is: 

pros 
- more time for internships/jobs 
- more time to enjoy college
- take the classes I possibly need for graduate school and maybe some other classes I want to take for myself 
- will be much more ready for graduation and the future in general
- can complete a minor

cons 
- $ (The financial aid adviser said I would qualify for a pell grant in my 5th year. However, I am not in EOP so I will not get TAP for my fifth year. I do have plans however to maybe find a place to live off-campus and of course, to get a job.)

sc0er,0,2012-04-16,LF A place for a couple to stay for the summer ($1800/month max OR us and a roommate friend for $3600/month),[deleted],NYCapartments,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/sc0er/lf_a_place_for_a_couple_to_stay_for_the_summer/,"My wife and I are looking for a place to stay for the summer from April 27th (we fly in that evening but we can crash somewhere until May 1st if needed) until about August 24th (we'd be willing to pay for all of August) for some summer internships we got.

We should be able to pay to entire 4 months rent up front and we're hoping to find a place that is either in Manhattan or in Brooklyn (with a relatively fast (30 mins or so) commute to Manhattan (Chelsea area).

If it's just for us, we'd prefer our own place (not sharing) and 1br is fine.

We'd be interested in a place for 3 people since we have a friend moving out for the same duration as us who we'd like to room with. 2br would the minimum in that case, otherwise, everything is the same.

I'd love to have any kind of contact, we're starting to get desperate.

Thanks Reddit."

sepxq,14,2012-04-17,The Benefits of Personal Networking:  How I Got to Play with a Professional Laser-Effects System While Drunk,Chalcedon,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/sepxq/the_benefits_of_personal_networking_how_i_got_to/,"*I actually emailed this story to my brother a day ago, and I've rewritten it for here (names obscured, mostly, some details added for background).  It's the story of how a good friend of mine roped me into going to a furcon, then introduced me to a really neat person while I was hammered.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kEjHgFlJ9c) is the best clip I could find of the system I got to mess with, but it really only shows off 1 pattern of the 30 it was capable of, which is a shame.  It's kind of a long ramble, but I've tried to make it funny.  It's also a solid example of:  ""It's all in who you know.""*

It started inauspiciously.  After much gnashing of teeth and a bit of panic, I obtained a job for this summer in Farmington Hills, Michigan (basically Detroit).  The job itself was excellent, having a competitive salary and a generous housing stipend that was to cover the majority of a furnished apartment for myself and the two other interns I was to be rooming with.  The company I was interning with had recommended two apartment complexes to stay in.

I had resolved to go up to the Detroit area to see the apartments for myself before making any choices about where I was staying.  Enter one of my best friends, who I'll call Aestuo.  Aestuo, before transferring to a different college midway through Sophomore year, was my roommate.  After he found out I was going to Detroit, he immediately perked up and suggested a weekend.  When asked why, he simply said ""Oh, a group of us are going to a furcon up there.""

Now, while I love Aestuo to death, and after living with him for a year and a half am no stranger to the furry community, I had no intention of going to a furcon.  However, he won me over with a few simple concessions:

1)  The group would pay for my gas

2)  Staying with the group would drastically cut my hotel cost

3)  He'd pay for my badge

4)  FCN, the con we'd be attending, was well known for the quality of its Saturday night rave and light show

and most importantly 5)  The group would pay for any libations I desired that weekend.

At this point, despite my initial reluctance, what essentially amounted to a weekend in Detroit for $30+food and getting to chill with a good friend that I get to see maybe twice a year was enough to win me over.  I acquiesced and arranged my weekend plans around this con I was now going to.

I'll leave the details of the con itself to the imagination.  Let it simply be known that it was one of the more surreal experiences of my life and that some things, once seen, cannot be unseen. It wasn't a bad time overall, just... a strange one.  But I digress.

Saturday night began as expected.  For those unaware of general con culture, during 3-day cons Saturday tends to be the night things get a hair crazy, when any parties that might happen will happen.  I had begun my Saturday night in grand fashion:  After splitting a bottle of gin with another member of the con group I was with, we traveled over to the main con hotel and proceeded to make our way to a room party.

The room party did not excite... That is, until I found one of the most beautiful sights I have ever laid eyes on:  The was bathtub filled with ice and Killian's Irish Red.  I immediately set up camp and began my grim duty of emptying most of the tub.  About thirty minutes and an indeterminate but gratuitous amount of Killian's later, Aestuo, who is forever sober, came up to me and nudged me:  ""Chalc, we've gotta go.""

I had no intention of leaving this *gorgeous* monument to debauchery.  However, my somewhat-slurred objections died on my lips as he pointed out a rather irritated looking guy standing in the corner and whispered: ""That's the host.""  Said guy was giving me a glare which very clearly translated to:  ""You have 10 seconds to excuse yourself or be forcibly excused.""  After looking from him to the impressive collection of bottles I had created, I took the hint and abandoned ship with Aestuo.

Feeling a bit sheepish, a bit like an ass, and a bit too hammered to really continue drinking anyway, I quickly realized that I was being led to the elevators by Aestuo.  Upon inquiring where we were going, he simply responded ""We're going to meet Fizz.""

Over the course of the weekend, I had discovered something:  Aestuo spent most of his time at cons attempting to meet people he found interesting, or that were in senior positions at the con.  It was why he was able to get me into the con on the cheap (in with the administration), why he was on a first-name basis with Kage (who is apparently a big deal among furries), and why he was able to introduce me to ""Fizz,"" who was apparently in charge of lighting and effects for the rave currently thumping along in the main ballroom.  Fizz also apparently built custom laser and lighting show systems for places like Disney's park in California.

Down on the main floor, I was taken to the bar and lead to a built man with a blonde mohawk, who turned, cordially greeted Aestuo, and introduced himself to me as Fizz.  As we began talking, I quickly remembered two things about myself:  I really, REALLY like talking about things in my field, and alcohol makes me extremely chatty.  These two things combined led Fizz and I on a winding conversation covering topics from Fast Fourier Transforms of laser waveforms, efficient assembly for TI C6000 series DSPs, using Bezier curves to track paths for individual lasers in systems to follow, and all manner of technical jargon relevant to the design of the circuits and programs that comprise lighting systems.  I was actually fascinated that I was able to lucidly discuss things I hadn't dealt with in years while occasionally shaking my head to keep Fizz from completing the mitosis he appeared to be attempting.

After something around forty minutes, Fizz leaned in kind of close and said:  ""Do you want to go to the booth?""  My heart skipped a few beats:  ""What booth?""  Fizz leaned in a little closer:  ""The booth where laser system's control panel is.""  At this point, I held in a bieber-fan-esque squeal of joy and just nodded dumbly.  I was beginning to sober up, and as we wandered towards the sound of pumping bass it was difficult to suppress my mounting excitement.

Once inside, we quickly arrived at a simple control setup:  There was a touchscreen with about 30 different patterns displayed, and a basic control board with 8 sliders and a number of buttons.  Fizz explained that this was the previous version of the control software and upcoming versions would look better.  He then sat down and showed me how it worked:  Select a pattern, and the sliders automatically move to default locations on the board.  You could then modify things such as pattern size, speed, color, and intensity with the sliders, and using one specific button you could pause a pattern for effect.  After explaining the system and letting us watch him work, Fizz looked at me and said:  ""Hey, the next set is an Electro-House set.  I'm going to go back to the bar.  Do you want to take the system for it?""

My jaw dropped.  Yes.  Yes I did want to take the system.  I had sobered up enough to grasp it adequately, and as the set started, I settled in for what would become one of the best hours of my life.  I was pretty awful for about the first ten minutes, but I quickly got in the groove and made some effects I was extremely proud of.

As the set wore down, another person who was *actually* on the AV staff came and replaced me.  I wandered back to the bar where Fizz was, thanked him, found Aestuo, and retired back to my room.  Sunday rolled around, and after I felt well enough to be vertical I made sure to track down and thank Fizz while sober.  We had a short conversation involving swaps of contact information, then went our separate ways.

The rest of the weekend went down as expected:  I had to leave early and drag a few unwilling people from the con group to my car to leave.  I drove the 4 hours to drop them off, and then the 3 hours to get back home in time to make a meeting with a project group and client.

I don't really think I'll be able to top this past Saturday for a while.  It was an absolute ball.  Either way, that's the story of how a buddy of mine knew some people and got me an in to do some really cool stuff.

I used to work for Universal Studios in Orlando.  I lost my job for doing something stupid that was entirely my fault, and I hate myself for it.  I wish I could remove the happy memories from my mind, because all they do is mock me now.  My childhood was terrible, abuse at home and abuse at school.  My Dad used to beat the shit out of my mom, and my mom would passively take it out on me.  At school, I don't know why the other kids hated me.  I still don't know. Those that didn't didn't bully or ridicule me ignored me, which is just as cruel.  Teachers and Principals didn't do shit to help either.  If I told my parents, my mom would come to the school and raise hell, but that only saved me for a few days.  The teachers would lecture or punish my abusers for a few days, but in the end they always went back to their apathy to my problems.  My classmates' cruelty knew no bounds and when my father died of cancer, they smelled blood and tore into the fresh emotional wound like piranhas.  

  All I've ever wanted is to be accepted, to feel loved.  It hurts bad, real bad.  

All my life I've been obsessed with theme parks.  My childhood dream was to design attractions for Disney or Universal.  As soon as I got out of high school, I signed up for an internship program at Walt Disney World in Orlando.  It included housing.  I thought I was beginning a new life and leaving the pain of my childhood behind.  The pain only continued.  I was terrible at my job, because it relied on social skills, which I severely lack.  Being bullied and abused for 20 years will do that to you.

  I was a driver at Kilimanjaro Safaris at Animal Kingdom. I loved that job dearly, and found that ""theming"", a form of acting that theme park workers use to immerse guests in the story of the attraction was something I was good at.  It gave me confidence, but it had a side effect.  I loved that job, but I took it too seriously for my co-workers tastes.  I was obsessed with it and felt like my co-workers were half-assing it.  It was the only thing that mattered to me, and that combined with my lack of social skills drove a wedge between my them and I.  I excelled at driving the truck and acting, but as far as actual customer service went, I was pathetic.  I couldn't deal with conflict at all and stressed out easily.  I made it most of the six months, but I was fired with a week to go over a verbal altercation with another employee.  It wasn't my first.  I have re-applied several times, but I'm pretty sure my managers have made sure that I'll never work for Disney again.  My first adult taste of rejection and the heartbreak that comes with it.  I went back to live with my family in Tampa a broken man.

Fast forward three years to the summer of 2009.  I landed another ""dream"" gig in Orlando at Universal Studios.  I started as a Halloween Horror Nights actor, something I had dreamed of doing since childhood.  Again, a wedge formed between my co-workers and I as I took my job too seriously for their tastes.  I gave it 100% every minute I was doing my job, and felt again that my co-workers didn't put in half the effort I was.  A few even tried explaining it to me, saying that to them it was just a job and that they didn't feel like trying so hard.  To me, that was akin to blasphemy.  My superiors were always glowing in their reviews of my performance, but ""Actor of the Year"" went to one of the social butterflies that had tried to convince me to ""tone it down"".  I was livid, but held my tongue.  

   I then applied for transfer to Jaws, as it was an acting role that I felt was well suited to my talents.  I had already found kindred spirits at the attraction, people that had the same level of enthusiasm for the job as I.  Unfortunately, I wound up as far as I could get from my beloved Jaws filling an HR quota at Jurassic Park River Adventure. 

  I once again gave it my all, as I'd been a fan of the movies and books.  There though, I again was met by co-workers that didn't care about their jobs.  They just stood there and barely put any enthusiasm into it.  I gave it my heart and soul, just like I'd done so many times before.  It took a few months, but they eventually started to like me there.  I was regarded as quirky and while I had a few detractors, I found a niche and was regarded as a member of the team.  They accepted me, and I accepted them.  I learned to do my job at my level, and made great strides in the social skills department as well.  My customer service was regarded as some of the best even.  I figured I had finally put the demons of my past behind me.  

   One of my co-workers shared my passion for ""the industry"", as we called it.  We eventually became roommates.  As he was popular with the staff of our ride, that made me popular too.  I was invited to parties.  I had dates.  I was socializing normally for the first time in my life.  Life was good, but it caught up to me.  

   One day, after a night of partying I took my roommie's morning shift on my day off as he had a hangover.  I was generally hangover proof, but I hadn't gotten hardly any sleep.  I was assigned an observation post.  Basically, I was to sit there and watch the ride.  I fell asleep.

   A manager caught me, and that was that.  My beloved job was gone.  I fell into back into a suicidal depression that had been plaguing me since before I can remember, at least childhood.  The only times that depression has gone away was while I was at Disney and while I was at Universal, as my job was equal parts demanding and satisfying.  Once I had a social life I forgot all about it, and thought that I had beat it. I fell into abusing drugs as a coping mechanism.  Nothing hard, just weed, but it didn't help matters. I lived off my savings for three months.  My roommates were understanding as long as I had money for the bills.  They must have seen the handwriting on the wall, but said nothing.  The party invites stopped coming.  I isolated myself as my roommates went on with their lives.  Instead of job hunting, I'd get high solo and play video games.  Eventually, the money ran out.  My roommates gave me a month to get things going, but by then I was so depressed and suicidal that I was going days without leaving my room.  They did what they had to do, and I moved back to Tampa with some old friends.  I got a job and got back on my feet.  I was doing fine until the 7-11 I was working at laid me off when a franchisee bought the store.  It also didn't help that a longtime friend who was also struggling with depression committed suicide.  My depression doubled on itself, as the job hunt, which I threw myself at failed.  After three weeks, I was back to getting stoned in my room and the video games.  One night I came clean to my mother that I was suicidal.  She took me to the hospital straight away.

Psych Units aren't anything like what they show on TV.  It was a rather therapeutic experience, and a revealing one.  I was unable to forgive myself for losing my job.  I still can't.  Even with nifty new anti-depressants, I still can't get over it, which is why I'm posting here.  My few friends have been distant, since they found out where I spent a week and a half.  I now live in a house my mom owns with a pair of alcoholics for roommates.  I am again isolating myself, as I can't stand their behavior.  I'm still unemployed.  I'm not suicidal anymore, but the depression is still pretty nasty.  I sleep a lot and I don't get out much.  Now and then I go back to my happy memories of my experiences and the friends I met along the way, but tonight they've been mocking me like demons.

If you read all this, thanks you.  It does feel good to get things off my chest, but my life still hurts.

Thanks guys for all the inspiration!,jerseyshorehater,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sdim0/30lbsmale_since_may_2011_thanks_guys_for_all_the/,"So I'm a terrible writer, but here goes... Ever since I can remember I've had trouble with my weight. Even when I look back at photos of when I was 6-8 years old, i've always been round. I live in Florida, so body image is something i really was conscious about, and was really embarrassed. In HS I always got by b/c of my good grades and I never showed in public that the jokes actually effected me, but they did. Anyways, when I got to college, I decided to get fit and go the gym. Everything was going great my first year, but then i had hand surgery and ballooned to my worst shape ever as in the picture below. The combo of pain meds, terrible diet, depression from losing results i had worked so hard to achieve, on top of the stress of class and funding my education became overwhelming. 

What really changed it all was when I got a summer internship in Charlotte, NC, last summer. I was fed up! I hated the way I looked, the way I felt, and thought THIS would be the perfect opportunity to start fresh: new friends, new coworkers, new opportunities! I worked downtown and found a gym literally 50 feet form work where all the people at my company went to. I buckled down, created a diet for myself, and went to the gym almost religiously. After a great summer I went from 195 to 175 and felt AMAZING!!! I had so much confidence, bought new clothes and was on a whole different level. 

I cam back to school for my senior year of college and unfortunately fell into some bad habits including going out for dinner and drinks with friends, and wasn't as motivated to go the gym. Fall semester I put back on about 5 lbs. Once I saw results fading again, I was infuriated with myself. NO WAY I WAS GOING TO LET THIS HAPPEN! During winter break I signed up at a local gym and since December have lost another 15 lbs, down to 165. 

Just wanted to say that reading /r/loseit and /r/fitness has been all the inspiration in the world and I wanted to say thank you!

We need to talk about shill intern spam. We have had a few discussions about the ""adventures in poor taste"" network and divvvy/fappytaffy, both of which get spammed by shill marketing interns. Personally, I find people ""gaming"" reddit to be disgusting and infuriating, so I am writing this post.

Recently we had a x-post from r/hotties. If you check out r/hotties you will see that it is a small new subreddit with 6 moderators. If you follow the histories of them, the majority of the links you will find posted lead to the AIPT network or divvvy/fappytaffy or some other cable-outlet web site like MTV. They link to the ""other subreddits we enjoy"", a single link going to r/popcult, a subreddit with almost the same moderator crew and less than 300 readers. It is my unsubstantiated theory that the accounts associated with these reddits are being run by a single user. 

You may recognize some of the mods in question:

terrayze (banned from nsfwoutfits for spam)

kellenwelker (banned from nsfwoutfits for spam)

winback099 (banned from nsfwoutfits for spam)

**In other words, the entire r/hotties subreddit is a shill link farm.**

I will not allow x-posts to them. Furthermore, I am posting this to inform the subscribers of this subreddit (some of whom visit or moderate similar subs) that this is happening. I have x-linked this post to r/reportthespammers. I really love what reddit can be, and the communities it allows us to build. Spamming links for off-site ad ridden content breaks reddit. 

Thanks for listening to my rant.

TL;DR: I think r/hotties and r/popcult are shill link farm subreddits, being run by a moderator ""crew"" that links primarily to (stolen content on) their own sites. Your feedback is appreciated. "

So, a few months ago I asked here about how to do a ponytail for my shoulder length, curly hair. Keep in mind that I am a guy, so I had no idea what I was doing...

Anyway, fast forward a few months and I'm wearing it almost ever day, not just when I have to wear it for my internship, and now, I've noticed something. My scalp is looking pretty red in the mornings after I've put up my hair into a ponytail. I haven't changed shampoos or anything, nor have I gotten a lot of sun recently for a sunburn. 

Also, when I do have my ponytail up, it feels very, very heavy. So when I tilt my head forward, lets say too look at a test on my desk, I can feel the ponytail dragging me down, almost as if its pulling my hair out, and it is a very uncomfortable sensation.

So, what I really want to know is, how can i prevent my ponytail from hurting me? I enjoy the style and people have complimented me on how I look with it, but I don't want to keep doing this if it hurts this bad.

**TL;DR** - Ponytail hurts after I put it up in the morning and my scalp is becoming increasingly red in color.

Brief Background about Myself: I was initially pursuing art/design, but couldn't leave my interest in Computer Science alone. I want to pursue an education in Computer Science while I'm younger and spend the rest of my years applying my CS degree to a more artistic direction e.g. Front End Development, Game Design/Programming, UX/UI, or Human Computer Interaction. I might even do grad school in such fields.

I'm currently a community college student, and I've been accepted into two state schools.

School A known for its Computer Science program than School B. With that in mind, School A requires more Math and Physics classes, which will take me a longer time to finish my degree. I'm certain about this extended amount of time because I struggle in math and science which tends to lead me to retake classes. I wouldn't say my struggle isn't a stress free experience--I work hard to pass my classes, but it does affect my social life and my free time, which I could be using to have a part time job/internship. (Although I must admit, that I do use my free time to learn web development, SEO strategies, and web design.)

I'm at a point right now where I want to graduate and apply CS in an artistic way. I see School A the benefits School A will give me in terms of internships, connections, ""name branding"", but I see how School B gives me the benefit of time. I would finish my degree quickly in comparison of School A, test the waters in the job world, and then pursue further schooling if I still want it--oh, can't forget less debt as well.

What do you guys think? Is it worth spending maybe 5-6 more years at School A or to finish my degree at School B within 3 years?

8th grade-terrible story gets out about me for no good reason, people I thought were my friends turned against me, mocking and bullying carried on until around junior year, I still carry the emotional scars, another nervous breakdown and diagnosed with OCD.

9th grade- I've pretty much intentionally blacked this year out of my memory due to intense bullying.

10th grade- bullying starts going away, start making more friends, get involved in theater, I was given charge of the school's comedy team, things start lightening up.

11th grade- to date, best year of my life. I had a quasi-girlfriend (we never really made it official and to date my only ""real relationship""), I was the lead in the musical with my best friends. The comedy team was made fun of a lot, though, which hurt.

12th grade- apply to and get accepted at my dream college, which at times I feel like I only attended to give the finger to my family, I get an offer to apply for an internship at College Humor (as a senior!), and then my grandfather, who was the single largest influence of my life, gets diagnosed with cancer, given 6 months to a year. He sees me graduate, and dies two weeks before I move out. I'm left with almost no friends from high school and a bleak future for college.

Freshman year of college: Still reeling from my grandfather's death, I stay in my room almost all year. I try out for and fail at every audition I come across for various comedy teams and singing groups, even though I assumed that my comedy and theatrical experience is what got me into the school in the first place. My radio show flops horribly, so I jump onto another and save it from sinking. Grades are alright, but I have absolutely no friends. Also, on the home front, ugliness stirs up in my church about forcing our pastor, whom my family is very close to, out of his job.

Sophomore year (present): Again, fail at every comedy/singing audition I come across, and now my current radio show is getting stuck in a rut as my character is being dramatically reduced. Still know no one I would consider a friend. My pastor resigns under duress (he did nothing wrong, just very petty people wanted him gone), throwing my church community into a mess. I get into one show, which goes alright, but now my grades are plummeting and currently in freefall as I don't know how to save them.

I'm applying for College Humor again, but that's still very up in the air. The internship process is very long and confusing even if I do get in. And if I do, I'll probably be forced to pass up a once-in-a-lifetime family trip.

I have no friends, my grades are failing, I'm possibly going to lose two great opportunities (one for the third time), and my family has enough of their own problems to deal with without me adding to the pile. I'm just tired of every good thing in my life being met with equal or greater negativity. Will I ever have a moment in my life where things will go well? Will I ever find friends? Lovers? Will I ever get a job? Will the things that go badly for me finally stop being more frequent than the good things?

As I'm typing this, I realize a lot of this may seem quite petty and childish, but it does weigh very heavily on me. I still carry a great deal of shame, sadness, and fears from being bullied so much as a kid that my self-confidence has never really come back. I'm sorry to have taken up so much of your time. I'm sure you have more important things to attend to."
sf79v,0,2012-04-17,[Short Story] She Once Had Me,Glussell,LitWorkshop,https://www.reddit.com/r/LitWorkshop/comments/sf79v/short_story_she_once_had_me/,"I hate this song, really I do.  It sends me to a dark, naive place. I really should have known better.

“*...my belle.  Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble.  Très bien ensemble.*”  sings the unmistakable voice of Paul McCartney as I sink lower and lower into my chair.

It didn't always used to be like this.  It used to be my favourite song.  Now I just pretend. 

“*That's all I want to say.  Until I find a way*”  the radio continues to torture me.

Let's see, where do I start?

As Claire and I walked through the night the crisp autumn air exuded from our lungs with every laugh.  I think that we both knew where this was heading.  For most people it was a night not unlike any other.  At least I suppose it was.  

My apologies.  This must be too much for you.  I forget how little you know of this.  Allow me to back up just a little bit.

She first appeared in my life one September.  She was introduced to the whole staff at my office as our new intern.  She was wearing a skirt that came part way up her thigh.  She had her blonde hair clipped back in a professional yet innocent way.  She awkwardly stood up as the boss went on about her role in our company.  She let her eyes meet mine.  She seemed to calm ever so slightly.  She went on about how much she loved and respected what we were doing.  She was so eager to make a difference.  She had all the energy that we imagine ourselves possessing in the forgotten years of our youth.

I knew that I had to meet her.  I pushed passed my colleagues to get to her first.  I extended my right hand and told her my name and she told me hers.  I laughed when she said that all of her friends called her Claire Bear.  I think that my voice cracked a bit when I told her that she could ask me if she ever needed help.  I know that my mind raced when she said that she would take me up on that offer.  I felt so excited.  I felt so awkward.  I felt like I remembered feeling when I was her age.

There were countless moments that took place over the next few weeks between Claire and I.  The lingering smiles, the coincidental lunch breaks, the accidental contacts, the perplexing flirtations.  I could go on about each one forever.  But I doubt that you have time for that.

One day while I was sitting down with a friend from work.  Somehow, we got to talking about Claire.  I am sure that I brought her up.  

“You two seem to be spending a lot of time together.”  He commented.  He was probably right.  “She's cute.  But what about...”

“But nothing.  Her and I are just friends.  Besides she's too young.”  I interrupted.

“She's not much younger than you are.  She's 21.  That's only eight years younger than you are.”

I wish he had never said that.

After I  passed into my late-twenties I seem to forget how young I actually am.  I have somehow become both ignorant of my age and self-conscious of it.  Somehow though Claire seemed young to me.  Was she full of exuberance or was I lacking in it?  Am I old enough to have been crushed by the weight of the world?

Or maybe it is just that the past four years of my life have been very eventful.  But I guess you know all about that.

Sorry, I digress.  To the point.

Our office was having a party some Friday night.  I can't remember what it was for.  Was it someone's birthday?  Or retirement?  Honestly, it doesn't matter.

Naturally I got talking to Claire.  I don't remember about what really.  Honestly, it doesn't matter.

At an infrequent pause in our conversation the music caught our attention.  A song by The Beatles came on.  Was it “Twist and Shout”?  Or was it “Day Tripper”?  Honestly, it doesn't matter.

“I love The Beatles” she said.

“Oh yeah, what's your favourite song?” I asked.  Had it been anyone else I probably would have said “Who doesn't?”.

“Norwegian Wood” she answered without an ounce of hesitation.

“Very good.”  I responded “I love Rubber Soul, I think it's their best work.  I think that my favourite song is 'Michelle'”

I didn't tell her why.  Oh how I should have.

The rest of the night we were glued together, talking about everything we could think of, but especially music.  As the night began to end, she cracked up some excuse to invite me to her place.  I think it was so she could show me her CD collection.  I didn't think to just ask to look at her iPod.

As Claire and I walked through the night the crisp autumn air exuded from our lungs with every laugh.  I think that we both knew where this was heading.  For most people it was a night not unlike any other.  At least I suppose it was.  

When we arrived at her place, naturally we put on Rubber Soul.  I fiddled with my left hand while we talked through “Drive My Car”.  Then during “Norwegian Wood” she leaned in and kissed me.  I let her.  I let her all through “You Won't See Me”.  She continued as “Nowhere Man” played.  It got heavier during “Think for Yourself”.  I don't even remember “The Word” it was so intense.  

Then, it came to “Michelle” my darling of a song.

“*Michelle, my belle.  These are words that go together well*” I ached

Each note made me want to leave.  Each note made me want to stay.

“*My Michelle*”   sang the last line as the guitar played it's beautifully sweet outro.

I felt a sigh of relief come over me.  I eagerly anticipated “What Goes On”.

“*Michelle, my belle.  These are words that go together well*” my shocked ears hear. 

The song played a few more times before we finished our passionate moment.

“Good thing it's your favourite song” she said and proceeded to fall asleep in my arms.

“*I love you, I love you, I love you.  That's all I want to say.  Until I find a way, I will say the only words I know that you'll understand*” I heard time and time again.

I lost count of how many times it played.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I slunk out from underneath Claire's arm.  I gathered my things and opened the door.  I paused for a moment to see her perfect figure bask in the moonlight.  I hurried into the night.  I made my way back to my apartment.  I was exhausted from the walk and the thought.  I opened my door.  I walked into my bedroom.  I crawled underneath my blankets.  I was still shivering.  

“Hey, you're home late” she said to me as I pressed my cold body against her warmth.

“Sorry, it was a wild night” I responded to her.

She nuzzled up into me.

“I love you Michelle” I said as she drifted off to sleep.

Any ideas on what I could still do in Houston for the summer?,MyHonestThoughts,houston,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/sipd4/summer_plans_fell_through_any_ideas_on_what_i/,"Currently a Rice student. I've never stayed in Houston for the summer and I'd like to do that for once. Plus my girlfriend lives here and I'd like to be able to spend the summer at least in the same city as her. My previous plans for the summer fell through so I'm scrambling to find something to do. 

I'm a math major with a good deal of programming experience. I've done two REUs in the past (in mathematics). Ideally I'd like to find some companies (software firms?) still looking for summer interns, but I realize that is unlikely at this point. I checked out Google Summer of Code and it looks like I've missed the deadlines.

Failing all else, I could just take a summer class and pick up a random job--I have no issues doing that--but I want to see what all my options are first. I'd greatly appreciate any and all ideas! Even if they are not internship-related! THANKS!"
sinbn,2,2012-04-19,"Failed once, too scared to try again now",Cantbreakaheart,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/sinbn/failed_once_too_scared_to_try_again_now/,"So I met this girl about 3 months ago during an internship I'm currently in, and never once thought we would get as close as we have today. At the time I was still with my ex, and she had a boyfriend that she had been with for a month or two. About a week later I broke up with my girlfriend for pre-existing reasons. We quickly became friends and soon became really close. We would hold hands, cuddle and watch movies, and she would sit on my lap or lay between my legs on the floor. Well turns out her boyfriend was cheating on her and was a complete asshole, so after a few weeks of them fighting, she broke up with him. A couple weeks later we were watching a movie together with her sitting on my lap and she started to hug me and pull me close. i hugged her back and then turned my head and decided to kiss her. She just turned away a little and i ended up kissing her chin, it was a little awkward, but a few minutes later she made a joke about the movie we were watching and we acted like it never happened.

A couple of days later we got into an argument, started by me about what was going on between us, and if she had feelings for me or was just leading me on the whole time for some reason, and she admitted to liking me but she was afraid to get too involved because in a few months we would be leaving to go back home in different parts of the country and she didnt want to deal with that kind of relationship. So I told her regardless of what happens its going to hurt to leave her after how close we've gotten and how much I care about her, so we decide to just be friends for a while. 

Recently over the past couple of weeks, there have been some changes in my plans for the future that involve me transferring schools and getting a job near this girls hometown. At first I didnt want to tell her because i felt like it would seem as if I was either lying or doing it it just for her. So I continued normally, but things started to pick up between us again, the holding hands, the cuddling, leaning against me on a counter in a very personal way one night... We were drinking one night with a bunch of friends and then started to walk home, while walking I told her I had something to say and she asked what? I let her know that I had fallen in love with her and regardless of what happens between us that I've already been planning to move to her home state, and she just smiled and hugged me. (non-relevant, but a few feet later we both saw a shooting star and it was amazing) 

So since then we've been getting closer and closer and i have kissed her on the cheek or forehead a few times after taking her home just because. Now Yesterday we spent an entire day together, something we hadnt done in a while do to work and she had a week off of vacation to spend with family, and we had a great day. she was especially affectionate, holding my hand, pulling for it whenever i got too far, wrapping her arms around my waist, and pulling my arm around her neck all the time, in the car she'd rest her head on my arm and kept looking up at me smiling. We were walking around again and her feet hurt so she asked for a piggy back ride and of course i agreed, shes very light and I carried her for a while, she said she expected me to walk 5 feet and then put her down but when i said I could carry her all night she leaned forward while still on my back and gave me a kiss on the cheek. On the ride home we stopped at a redlight and she put her head on my shoulder and looked up at me, i lay my head on hers and looked down, she got closer to me, i feel as if at that exact time she wanted me to kiss her, but my head filled with so much doubt and fear that i was making a mistake again or just imagining this that I just smiled and looked back up waiting for the light to turn green. the rest of the ride home she just kept smiling at me or making a face like =/. I feel like she either thinks I dont like her like that anymore, or something, but i just really dont know if I should try and get together with her again and go in for a kiss again. 

TL;DR I tried to kiss a girl too early and failed, now we're a lot closer and I think she really likes/loves me and I had the opportunity to kiss her again last night but was afraid I was imagining it or that she wasn't looking for a kiss even though I really feel like she was. I'm so confused and scared, help, I really love and care about this girl.

sik5l,233,2012-04-19,Proper interview attire: from a hiring manager,SweatyButcher,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/sik5l/proper_interview_attire_from_a_hiring_manager/,"There's been quite a few posts about how people should look for an interview, with a lot more unnecessary or inaccurate advice. The reason I decided to write this is because I worry that some of you are putting too much time into how you look. **If you can only dedicate *X* amount of hours into preparing for your interview, 99% of your time should be preparing for your answers. Looking better than other candidates isn't going to really play a factor, truthfully.**

Let me preface by saying my perspective comes as a hiring manager that isn't based on fashion or appearances. So if you're applying for a job in the fashion industry, marketing, presentations, or anything like this, then this post doesn't apply to you. This post is meant for people who are applying for most standard behind-the-desk jobs. 

*EDIT: As others have pointed out, this isn't an all-encompassing post that will cover every interview. Every industry is different, and every company within shared industries are different. How you should look for a government job will be drastically different than a small startup, which is different from a law firm. To top things off, the position level also changes how important your look is. I'm simply catering this post to the numerous posts I've seen: entry to mid level jobs in areas that typically don't have stricter attire standards.*

For what it's worth, I work in the software industry. Most of the candidates I interview &amp; hire are fresh out of college, or have graduated 1 or 2 years prior to their interview. As a result, I interview for internships and entry-level positions.

**WHAT TO WEAR**

***To put it simply, all you need to do is to try to look professional. That's it.*** Everything else is pretty much unnecessary. Dressing very nice won't help you that much. Dressing poorly, on the other hand, CAN hurt you. To put it in gaming-numerics, dressing nice, at best, will give you a +2; dressing poorly can hurt you by -15. The only time we notice what you wear is if it's too distracting 

From the company's perspective, they're just looking for someone who can do the job, and if they can work in team to do said job. What you wear and how you look provides almost no indication of your ability to do these things.

**So what does dressing professional mean?**

[Shujin states it best](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/sik5l/proper_interview_attire_from_a_hiring_manager/c4en9up):

&gt;For actual attire: Feel free to call the secretary and ask what most people wear around the office. If no one wears a suit ever, then it might be overkill. For most professional positions (human resources, finance, management, high-clerical, education, sales) you'll want a suit. Some positions will require a simple button-up and dress trousers or chinos (medium-to-low level clerical work, some construction or other labor, some manufacturing, some transportation services, some food services or retail).

&gt;For a suit, you want a 2-button charcoal or navy suit, with either dark brown or black shoes (preferably balmorals). A maroon, navy, or gold tie is fine. Feel free to get a simple stripe tie. Don't get any ties with more than 3 colors. A white, point-collar shirt is the standard. No french cuffs or other adornments, keep jewelry to a minimum. Socks should match the trousers. That's basically it.

&gt;For positions that don't expect suits, most of the time you are fine with a white or light blue button-up (perhaps even an OCBD) tucked into dress trousers (charcoal, medium grey) or chinos (khaki). You can get away with black or brown loafers, but oxfords are a better choice (bluchers are fine with chinos). Feel free to throw on a blazer (grey or navy) if you want to sharpen up a touch. Again, socks match trousers.
Below that, feel free to just go polo and chinos with loafers. For anything below that, use your discretion. Keep in mind that minimal is better. Wear what makes you comfortable in your interview.

**COMMON QUESTIONS**

*Doesn't dressing nicely show an attention to detail?*

Of course. But when it comes to interviews, there are far better indicators. The thing with dressing nice is that you can prepare ""easily"" by getting advice from others. Any decent interviewer will have questions prepared to show how much attention to detail you really have, especially the type that's relevant to the job you're applying for.

*Doesn't dressing nicely give a strong first impression?*

Yes and no. It gives a negative impression, if you dress VERY poorly. Not so much if you dress nicely. There's a process to selecting interview candidates. We don't just interview anyone who applies - that would be a waste of a lot of time. To filter candidates, we have to look at resumes &amp; transcripts, plus ask pre-interview questionnaires. Those are our first impressions. We're far more interested in what you have to say than how you look.

*Can I wear black?*

Most candidates wear black. Like I said, most candidates I hire are really young, and didn't pay attention to their suits. Those that don't know any better (myself included) often go with black.

*What if my suit doesn't fit as nicely?*

Again, just as long as it's close enough. We don't expect perfectly tailored suits. We know for some candidates having a great suit isn't your top priority. For the job at hand, it isn't relevant. Just make sure you're trying. Like we said, fit is only relevant if the what you're wearing is noticeably large or noticeably small. It's at that point we start to wonder ""Why didn't they get a better fitting suit? They can at least put a little more effort into it.""

**FINAL ADVICE**

Again, if it looks professional, then you've done everything you've needed to do. Dedicating more time than necessary on how you look is a waste of time. The biggest general advice I can give on landing the job you're applying for is to check out a book called ""Knock 'em Dead"" by Martin Yates. I literally credit that book for getting the job I have now. Putting a couple of hours into that book will reap SIGNIFICANTLY more rewards than putting those hours into how you look.

NOTE: *I'd also like to mention that suit recommendations for an interview is very different from getting a suit for all occasions and using it for an interview.* ***This post applies to the former.*** If you're doing the latter, then mentioning it's going to be used for an interview is most likely irrelevant. If it looks good for most occasions, then it'll definitely be good for an interview.

***TL;DR: Try to dress professionally, and err on the side of cautious and conservative. All you have to do is look ""good enough"". Dressing nice won't really help you to much, but dressing poorly can hurt you. Interviewers care far more about what you say than how you look.***

EDIT: The advice I provide is based on the idea that you're expected to wear some sort of business attire to the interview. There are lots of interviews that don't have an attire requirement, and that you're free to wear what you please. I think we can all agree that the best play is to simply ask them what you're expected to wear. "

shopi,8,2012-04-19,Day 4 - just putting it all out there,angleshank,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/shopi/day_4_just_putting_it_all_out_there/,"So i've been following this subreddit for a while now, maybe about 7-8 months, not because I wanted to quit 7-8 months ago, but because I've been entertaining (read: wrestling with) the idea of quitting for some time now. 

Well, on Sunday I smoked the last of my stash, and I hope not to buy again and also not smoke again, so that I can try to work out whether some of the issues that I have struggled with over the years really are related to Pot (let's be honest, from reading this subreddit, spoiler alert, they most likely are).

I live in South Africa, just to clarify any strange terms/ideas...
My story is pretty tame really, I first smoked when I was 16, I'm turning 26 in September. Started out very occasionally, at house parties/when I was with my friends with slightly more lenient parents we would go and buy a ""matchbox"" of proper ditch-weed and smoke it through pretty atrociously rolled roaches. 

Anyway, after school I slowly started getting into bong smoking, and also my best friends who I lived with through uni started smoking as well. So gradually we all just started smoking more and more, and from 2006 when I started uni in Cape Town, till about 2009 me and my friends/housemates' usage grew from weekends to daily. 

This didn't really affect my work, I did really well in uni, graduating top of my class with a 1st class (&gt;80% average) degree in Film Theory and Production. 

Anyway, I then went to England for a while, wanting to have both a ""gap-year"" and maybe do a little film work there. While there I became quite depressed, being stuck in various hotel/restaurant jobs, and feeling generally unfulfilled and unmotivated. As a result, and because of suddenly having access to pretty good weed, I started smoking alot. like all the time. mornings before work, after work, at certain points I was sneaking away during a shift to have a sneaky smoke (I was a shift manager at a hotel, so I could disappear for 5 mins without being interrogated). In uni, there was a ""safety net"" of sorts, I had to be clear headed to do my work, and do well, because I wanted to do well. At the hotel, or later the restaurant, I could do the work with my fucking eyes closed, so, often, I did the next best thing, I did it stoned. 

Eventually (about april last year) I realised that London was not doing me any favours work or life-wise (this isn't hate for teh place itself, I actually do love it, it was just my headspace at teh time) and I returned to Cape Town. I moved back in with my friends, and basically resumed my life here. I got a good internship at a good production company through some friends, and have, in the last 7 months already been promoted to junior researcher from intern. But, I was still smoking daily. not before work, hellz no, but afterwards, and on weekends, all day on weekends. 

At a certain point I decided to stop during teh week and only do weekends. Which worked for a while, although I tended to overindulge then on weekends. Eventually I realised that I was, in actuall fact, addicted to pot. I was no longer doing it because it was fun, I was doing it because I craved it, I couldn't be at home, not doing anything and not have it. Add to that me starting to realise (through reading testimonies on this subreddit) that alot of the ""issues"" i had struggled with in recent years (depression, anxiety, social anxiety, paranoia, procrastiantion and lack of motivation) were rather common side effects of the love affairs with the sweet leaf (some of them had actually gotten worse in the last year or two, when I started really smoking alot). 

So here I am, 26 years old, in a secure junior position, with a head full of ambition, and not wanting to compromise that ambition in any way that I have control over. 
I know I am capable of doing this, of kicking this habit and improving my life, but I also know it'll be difficult, especially considering I live with 3 daily smokers, and alot of my friends are regular smokers too. But I have resolve, more to improve my life than to quit, and I think the challenge (but also the key) is for me to keep making teh connection between quitting and improving my life.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble. Not really asking for help (although any advice and/or support will be appreciated) just wanted to write it all out, so I can see it all in front of me. Incidentally, me writing this has already given me more perspective on my dependence on MaryJ.

So keep it real r/leaves, thanks for the great discussions and support you give out, and also for just being there :-)

The non-profit is in the Upper Arlington area. We prefer a furnished apartment, 2 bedrooms is ideal but a spacious one-bedroom is a possibility.

Please let me know what you have available.

Thanks! - Dave"

“I don’t care how good you are at Q-bert, you will never beat my high-score in Frogger”!  Schlotsky yelled as he grabbed another Oreo cookie.  “I saw that”!  Eduardo said as he pointed to the bag of Oreos that had “EDUARDO’S DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT” written across the package with a black marker.  “Guys, guys lets all calm down” Sizzler said trying to break up the argument.  “We will settle this once and for all with a game of Pitfall!”


“This was the scenario that took place moments before the scene of one of the bloodiest murders in our nation’s history.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this case has been open since 1987 but today, I want to close it once and for all.  I am going to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the defendant, Mr. Elmer Butterbur was responsible for the vicious actions that took place at 10:15 pm in that apartment complex on sunnyville drive.”


“We all know that Eric Schlotsky was a master at the game of Frogger and few people could beat Edward Eduardo at Q-bert…these two young men were in a league all their own- a league that Steven Sizzler desperately wanted to be in.  Let me recreate the details of the night in question and paint a picture for you all to see……”


“The year was 1987 and 15 year old Steven Sizzler had just gotten his penis circumcised by a clumsy barber.  Steven was curious about things such as radioactivity, lamp shades, and soup strainers.  He was always volunteering to go on game shows that involved fabulous prizes until one day he got his shot.  The game show was entitled, “Don’t you Dare” and the rules were simple…there were five contestants who were each given an hour to obtain whatever was on their card.  Steven’s card was written, “Three Blind Mice”- he ran out to the closest pet store, bought three mice and gouged their eyes out with his pocketknife and returned in just under one hour.  That was when he first met Eric Scholtsky….who was already waiting at the finish line with a handful of 4 deaf turtles.  Sizzler, being a good sport, shook hands with Schlotsky and congratulated him on winning the game.  The two became friends and Sizzler was eventually invited over to Schlotsky’s house to play Atari.  “This is my friend Eduardo”  Schlotsky said, very proud to introduce the two.  “Hi friend, I am playing Q-bert, wanna play?”  Eduardo said as he munched on some Oreos.  “Do you have the game pitfall?”  Sizzler said when all of a sudden Elmer Butterbur kicked down the door and began blasting everyone in sight!  It was a sad day in the town of gopher that night I can tell you.”


The jury sat upright- they were horrified as they looked at Elmer Butterbur in disgust.  Elmer just put his head down in shame- a sure sign of guilt.  “Objection your honor” Johhny Applebee said as he stood up in protest.  “Sustained” the judge replied…”Mr. Burger King, do you have any evidence other than this ridiculous story, that what you say actually took place?”  Mr. Burger King slyly shook his head yes as if the trap he had set had just caught a big fat gopher and now he was about to have his way with that gopher in any imaginable way he could think of.  He nodded up and down at the judge as he imagined the gopher tied up to a chair with a ball in his mouth and the muffled screams were not going to be heard by anyone….he continued to nod and think of the gopher he just caught and…”Mr. Burger King”!  Are you going to nod at me all day with that ridiculous grin or are you going to show this courtroom some proof?”  Mr. Burger King shook the gopher fantasy from his head and presented the court with a necklace made out of three 6-inch penises marked “Exhibit A”.  “Allow me to call my witness- Edith Fuddruckers!”  Mr. Burger King yelled to a gasping jury.  Edith Fuddruckers made her way up to the witness stand but refused to put her hand on the bible.  She was a notorious cloud worshipper who would never have given the Christians the satisfaction of breaking her like that.  


Ms. Fuddruckers, what were you doing on the night in question at the time in question during the event in question?”  Edith Fuddruckers was no Christian but a devout cloud worshipper with exceptionally high morals and ethics.  She could not tell a lie….”I was masturbating” she said to another gasp from the jury.  “That is all!”  Mr. Burger King said as he looked at a speechless Johnny Applebee….”your witness” he said with a look that said “bring it”.  
Johnny Applebee regained his composure and said, “Mrs. Fuddruckers”….”It’s Ms. Fuddruckers”,  Edith interuppted as she hungrily looked the handsome lawyer up and down.  “Ms. Fuddruckers, has it ever occurred to you that you do not need to masturbate?”  “Surely a woman with your sex appeal could have any man she wants.”  The jury leaned forward….Ms. Fuddruckers was indeed a sexy woman- why would she masturbate?  “OBJECTION!” Mr. Burger King screamed at the top of his lungs with his voice cracking a bit.  “Your honor, the sexual orientation of my witness is not on trial here, it is the fact that three young men are dead and missing their penises!”  


The judge said “sustained” and called for a recess.  The judge really enjoyed recess and had ever since he was a young boy at Stone Hall Pre-Prep.  The teachers would call recess and little Stevie Olive Garden would run outside as fast as he could.  He always envied the teachers and their power to call recess whenever they felt like it.  He made a commitment to himself that he would become a teacher and studied his ass off to get there.  The real world is cruel however, and little Steven Olive Garden did not have the brains to be a teacher.  He was forced to find work as a judge and hated every minute of it until he learned that they too could call “recess” whenever they felt like it.  


Judge Olive Garden ran past everyone to the outside and was the first to get on the swing set.  He laughed and played while the court waited for him to return.  After about 15 minutes he came back in, sweating and smelling of body odor.  He sat back down and said, “Please continue with the closing arguments”.


Johnny Appleby was first.  “Judge, Jury, countrymen….I am not a vegetarian but I do eat vegetables.  Mr. Butterbur is not a criminal but he has committed crimes.  I think that we as a nation at war should be more concerned about what is going on in the world rather than what is going on in this courtroom.  I ask you, no I beg you not to convict this man….do it for me- please.”  Johnny Applebee said with a sincere expression as he sat down.  The jury had just been given a masterful performance by a master.  They were literally eating from Johnny’s hand and would have done anything for him at that moment…but it was a fleeting moment and soon Harold Burger King, the young hotshot lawyer fresh out of his internship approached them.

  
“Steel Magnolias” was a great movie.  “Cagney and Lacey” was a great TV. show.  “Highway to the Danger Zone” was a great song, and Johnny Applebee is a great actor.”  We all want to believe that the world is a great place and guys like Elmer Butterbur do not shoot teenage boys and make a penis necklace out of their private parts.  Hell, I don’t want to live in a world like that either…but guess what folks- we DO live in a world like that.  We live in a world where 6 out of every 10 8th grade boys lose their penis so some sick fuck can make a necklace out of it.  


Now I was on the drama team in high school and I got my degree in dance therapy but are you going to let me sing and dance my way into telling you how you should think on this one?  Or will you stand up and say “I am a free thinker and I know that Mr. Butterbur killed those boys!”?  C’mon, be a free thinker and say that for me, will ya?  Huh?


Judge Olive Garden sat back in his chair and looked out the window at the seesaw…he thought about calling for recess but instead asked the bailiff to escort an escort to his private chambers.  “The jury is dismissed to come to a conclusion on this case” the judge said as he walked past them.  

4 hours later

“Has the jury come to a conclusion” Judge Olive Garden asked.
“Yes your honor we have” a jury member said, on the count of embezzlement we find the defendant not guilty.  On the count of racketeering we find the defendant not guilty”…with every utterance of the word “not guilty” the fist of Mr. Burger King got tighter and the smile of Mr. Butterbur got bigger…until the big one- “On the count of obscene bodily ornamentation we find the defendant……NOT GUILTY!
Suddenly there was pandemonium in the courtroom!  Elmer Butterbur jumped up and down and gave his lawyer a hug.  He then grabbed his penis necklace from the exhibit table and smuggly put it on right in front of Mr. Burger King before walking out the door, a free man.  Johnny Applebee extended his hand and said “you can’t win them all” but no handshake was returned.  Mr. Burger King just stood up and glared at the audience before storming out.  He walked outside past judge Olive Garden who was swinging from the monkey bars….he got in his car and he drove home to his apartment, fired up his Atari 64 and scratched at his missing penis….yes Mr. Burger King was one of those unlucky 6 out of 10  8th grade boys he so passionately defended.


Just then Garrett Goulett woke up from his sleep….”what’s the matter honey?”  His wife said, “Did you have a bad dream?” “I don’t remember sweetie, but I sure feel like eating out!”  The play on words had been made.

I feel so discouraged because it seems like nobody wants interns and I won't be able to find any job experience before I graduate in 2014. Is there anything else I can do to be more aggressive in the job search? Or is the market just so saturated that this is to be expected.  "

I just landed a really great internship in Rochester. I have literally never been there before, and poking around online, I haven't been able to find much that fits my needs. Yes, I've been on Craigslist, and yes, I've spent plenty of time with google. I'd just like to see if anyone here knows of something! Here's what I need:

A 1 bedroom FURNISHED apartment. I need to move in April 28th or 29th at the latest, and I will need it until the end of August. I can afford around $1,000/month max.

I'm a super respectful, quiet 26 year old male Computer Info Systems major. I got a web developer internship at a company in Greece.

1. Andy and Erin should run off and elope.  When they return Erin should be much more focused and less mopey and she should be pregnant.

2. Andy as a expectant father should focus on little else.  He resigns as manager and returns to sales.

3. James Spader and that actress go away

4. Kathy Bates returns and decides to put a woman in charge: Pam

5. Pam steps up to the plate and introduces an entire new level of wackiness to the office. including:  
6. Turning the lounge\day care into a nursing station for her, Angela and 
Erin.
7. Realizing that Dwight is the top sales man and replacing Jim by making Dwight her new #2
8. Introducing morning exercises to get everyone in better shape
9. Moving on:  Angela and Dwight should have an affair.  It turns out Dwight is the father of Angela's baby.
10. The senator scandal leaks (he's gay and sleeping with a male intern).  Angela devastated but rejects Dwight's marriage proposal which causes him to quit and return to Shrute farms to run the inn.
11. Dwight's replacement is a young gay man and a relationship (slow burn) starts with Oscars
12. Ryan cheats on Kelly yet again and she has finally had enough and quits.  Pam makes Ryan do Kelly's job.
13. Toby can't handle working for Pam and decided to return to islands.

Edit: Fixed ""Erin's"" name so Andy wouldn't have to worry about a gay relationship with Aaron."
siu1r,1,2012-04-19,Moving minimalist,[deleted],minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/siu1r/moving_minimalist/,"I'm planning a cross-country move (Portland to Boston) in July, and I would love to get some advice on making the whole process as simple as possible. Here's the story: I'm a 21 y.o. student in Portland. This summer, I'll be starting a six month internship in Waltham, MA. I don't have a car, and I don't have a lot of money or stuff right now. I'll be coming back to Portland in January to finish school, so there's the possibility of storing a bunch of my stuff here until I come back. I also hope to sell a lot of the things I don't need or want anymore.

So the question is, what's the best way to figure out what I need, what I want, and what I don't? And then what's the best way to get this stuff to Massachusetts from here? Like I said, I don't have a huge amount of stuff, but I'm not a ""minimalist"" at this point by any means. I'm learning a lot from checking out posts on this subreddit. Now, I think it would help to hear some words of wisdom from someone with experience in minimalist moving. Anybody care to chip in? I'd really appreciate it!

Here's a close-to-exhaustive list of my shit, with a few notes on my plans for it:

- 2 guitars (1 possibly to sell)
- 1 guitar amp (sell)
- stereo/speaker system (probably sell)
- keyboard
- laptop, phone, tablet, monitor (too many glowing rectangles... but it is my line of work, so...)
- 5 pairs of pants, about 20-30 shirts, 3 pairs of shoes, bunch of socks, 2 sets of bedding, 2 towels
- toiletries
- 2 pairs of glasses
- a few dishes (give away)
- a few pieces of furniture in my room (to be given away/sold)
- bike (give away/sell)
- helmet, bike lights, tubes, other bike stuff
- about 40-50 books (store most of 'em)
- about 15 personal notebooks (store)

So what do you guys think? My current plan is to ship all the stuff I need to as cheap as possible, and fly myself and my guitars out there. Pretty sweet plan? Or is there a better way? How can I make this experience a little easier by getting more minimal?"
slxfp,4,2012-04-21,"""I want you to want to___."" --- Is this a common thought, is it the distance making me crazy, or what?",mdmazinglife,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/slxfp/i_want_you_to_want_to_is_this_a_common_thought_is/,"Disclaimer: A bit of a story/rant that leads up to the final question:

Ok, quick run-down: SO (M24) and I (23F) have been friends for 2 years (met on vacation visiting mutual friends), started dating this past November (LDR from the start), week-long visits in Dec/Feb/Mar with me moving to intern in his city in May-Aug, final end date for the long-distance is Dec 2012 when I graduate. He's graduated college and works full-time now, while I am finishing up my last couple semesters.

Now, this past week was a doozey for me with school and work. Group projects going wrong, next to no sleep...that sort of thing. I couldn't get over this feeling that I hadn't talked to my SO much, actually barely, all week. We usually gchat most of the work day, but I'd barely heard a peep from him. Like, not a ""hey just checking in to see how you're doing"" or anything. Which got me thinking: I'm usually the one to initiate contact. Not just this week, but usually all the time, and I feel bad about it, like I may be interrupting some part of his day when I do. I mean, if I'm not in class (total of maybe 3 hours a day), I'm just working on things. But he has friends over all the time, or places to go, or things to do (situations where he's not going to idling sit and chit chat with me).

So with me calling/txting as the initiator, or being the one that's ""hey, what's up, talk to me"" or ""call me"" or ""poke poke poke"" ... I don't know...I feel like I'm pestering him...or that I'm thinking about him more than he's thinking about me. 

I communicated to him on Friday this is how I'm feeling. I'd gotten a bit irked at the fact that when I initially told him ""hey, let's just talk when you get home, I'm feeling kind of disconnected"" he began telling me about his weekend coming up and all the plans he had. I don't think he meant for it to reinforce my feeling of disconnectedness, as when I said ""Ok, yeah you're gonna be busy. I'll just talk to you later"" he was frustrated with a ""Stop, I'm trying to tell you about my weekend and talk to you now."" Idk...just a poor subject choice.

He said that he usually just waits for me to call him/chat, because he knows that I will eventually whenever it is that I have time. To be more convenient for me? But I'm not the one with so much social time that I'm not readily available. :: shrug :: So we talk for a bit, I start feeling better, all is good until he asks me:

""Oh, hey I just got a text. I'm supposed to play tennis with so-and-so soon, we made plans like 4 hours ago. Is that okay, or should I just tell them no? I mean, we see each other all the time, so if you want me to cancel, I will.""

I respond with a ""Well, it's fine. Do what you want."" And he responds to his friend and the plans are still a go. -___-

I never want to be *that* girlfriend that is like ""cancel your plans, always hang out with me, no you can't do this, yes do that, ect"" I try to be thoughtful and respectful of these relationships that existed way before I did. If he wanted to cancel to talk to me and make me feel better, he would have. The fact that he asked meant that he thought he should, but didn't in fact want to, right? I don't want to be restrictive like that, you know?

I just want him to *want* to cancel his plans to talk to me. I want him to want to call me even if he thinks I might be busy, just because he wants to talk to me.

**So is this idea of ""I want you to want to ______."" a common type of thought? Or is the stress of school, work, and long-distance finally making me crack and be all needy? Either way, is it stupid?**

tl;dr: I want you to want to _____. Stupid feeling?

Although we have only been together 14 months, she has been my best friend for a few years. I spend all my time with her, then and now, and we never get into any arguments.

I thought things were going fine until last Monday when she told me about this guy she works with( once a week, 4 hours a week, for 16 weeks). She told me that she likes him. She told me this is because she would never lie to me. Then said she does not plan on leaving me for him and she just needs time to get over things.

Fast foreword to Friday, she tells me that she needs a break. She said she doesn't want to hurt me, but she in confused and needs to be alone. She is my best friend, and I love her to death. I can not lose her, but I want her to be happy. So it sounds like we are taking a break until she feels better.

Has anyone ever taken a break in a relationship that has not ended poorly?

Edit 1: Thanks for all the advice, and I did hear pretty much any stance that I thought I could take, so I am going to talk to her about 'terms and conditions' of the break. I will tell her that we are not to see anyone else, and if that happens then everything is immediately over between us. After a while I will want to talk to her about how she feels. A big thing that I guess I did not mention is she is done working there is a week -The dorm where she works is closed for the summer- So she may never see him again. I am also leaving her in a week because I have an internship while she is taking classes, but I am pretty sure after a week without me she will want me back. Last summer she wanted to talk everyday because she missed me. If she doesn't choose me then I can find someone else. Thanks all.

slj7g,9,2012-04-21,So HAPPY yet so nervous about my upcoming summer,fangover86,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/slj7g/so_happy_yet_so_nervous_about_my_upcoming_summer/,"I found out this Friday that I was the selected candidate for an internship in NY that was number one on my list!  I'm so so so happy and literally can't focus on studying for my finals because all I want to is make plans and get everything ready.  


However, the problem is that the actual location of my internship is in New Jersey.  I'm wasn't anticipating this and will be living with family in NYC.  I'll have to commute each day (without a car, so public transportation it is) and I'm so nervous about it.  Every time I begin to think about it, I get this nauseous feeling in my stomach and break out in a cold sweat.  I don't know why I'm so nervous but I really am not looking forward to having an hour plus commute every single day.  

I keep trying to tell myself that lots of people commute all the time and have much longer ones and that I should feel so lucky and happy to have gotten this internship (which I am) but I can't help but feel a bit scared.


Any advice, my fellow 2Xer's?   "

I just finished my first race ever (sprint triathlon) and decided now would be a good time to share some progress pics. I've been on fittit for a while now and hopefully someone can take some motivation from this. I was 20 years old throughout this ordeal. 


**I'll start with just the pictures and if this gets any interest I'll gladly throw in exactly how I did it. The long and short of it, of course, is diet and exercise.** 


[Here's me at around 240 lbs I'd say.](http://i.imgur.com/hA8Re.jpg?1) This was taken in the winter of 2011. I apologize for the lack of proper starting pictures but cameras terrified me back then. I didn't start trying to get healthier until the summer of 2011 so this picture isn't exactly me at my worst.


~[This picture was taken last week for the body fat friday thread.](http://i.imgur.com/NTZLS.jpg?1) I'm probably closer to 170 lbs in this picture than I am to 160.~ I believe I took it a little far getting all the way down to 160. [Here's another facebook photo for a facial comparison, taken a few weeks ago.](http://i.imgur.com/efG5f.jpg?1) Edit: [Here's a shirtless photo I took 2 minutes ago with the face included. Sorry for the confusion caused by the first picture!](http://i.imgur.com/n31tq.jpg?1)


I got serious about losing some weight in May of 2011 and probably hit my lowest weight in November so this took about 7 months overall. This is a lifelong process though, and I've got a long way to go!


Thanks for reading!

***Updates***

**Diet &amp; Exercise** 
I cut back on calories pretty quick in the beginning by simply cutting out any snacking and switching to water as my only drink. I did, however, still eat whatever my dad decided to make me for dinner. I never counted calories during the summer and generally had little idea of what I was doing. If I had to estimate now I'd say that I was probably consuming around 2000-2500 calories a day, but exercising quite frequently. **I know this is totally against what fittit is all about, but I did not know of fittit at this point and did not lift heavy weights during any period of my weight loss. I would not recommend this to others, but it is certainly possible to lose weight with diet and cardio alone. What's important is that this will ONLY be good for weight loss, and not so good for aesthetics and what not.** My starting exercise was biking as I probably couldn't even run a mile straight at this point. I would get on my bike with some music and ride for around an hour sometimes. I found a pretty long, flattish road and simply rode back and forth on it. I figured from google maps that I was averaging 10 miles a day biking on this thing.


I eventually got an internship that summer which was essentially a full time job (9-5, 5 days a week). This made not snacking much easier and I was essentially forced into a 3 meal day. For these 2 months or so I'd say my calories dropped a bit to 1700-2000. By the end of summer people had taken notice that I was getting pretty small. Lots of concern and what I saw as bitterness came from friends at this point. It bothered me then, but at this point I can guess they were just worried about me. Exercise at this point tapered off a bit, volume wise, but I believe I started running more at this point. I was comfortable enough with my cardio level to run around my neighborhood which was about a mile loop. I would do this at night when I got home from work. I also played basketball pretty frequently, after work when I could and on the weekends other wise. 


I got back to school for fall semester and was suddenly ""the skinny health obsessed freak"" according to all of my friends. This was a pretty harmful to my eating as I felt that if I did anything but eat extremely clean I'd be seen as regressing. I took a strong liking to the salad bar (I still love salad and eat it for at least one of my meals per day) and generally ate less. Snacking was still a no-no and after I had a pretty set diet of dining hall food going I spent a week counting my calories. I rarely came in at over 1300 calories per day. I also upped my exercise quite a bit. I found a nice loop from my dorm through a small off campus community which totaled a little more than 5k distance wise. I ran this once a day for the few months that it was warm at my upstate new york school. I also had my bike at school and would bike to a field about a mile and a half away where I would do a core workout for half an hour or so. It consisted of cherry pickers, leg raises, planks, sit ups, push ups, and whatever else I felt like doing. This was also when I first found /r/fitness and I remember I made some pretty silly posts that really illustrated how little I knew about what I was doing. One time I asked how I was supposed to be at a deficit when I was eating 1000 calories but only burning about 600 from my 5k + bike ride (I didn't even take BMR into account). 


Eventually it got too cold out to run or bike anymore and my only exercise came from core workouts that I would do every day before I showered. Because I knew I wouldn't be burning as many calories anymore, I made sure to keep my calories pretty low. Thanks to reddit I knew about BMR by this point and so I didn't cut back on intake any more than I already had. It was at about this point that I first saw my abs and it felt amazing. **This whole semester was actually probably the best I have ever felt, energy/attitude wise, even though I was cutting back on calories so much.**


Winter break came next and this is probably where I got the least healthy. I was already consuming a small amount of food but I decided to give lean gains a go just for fun. I didn't follow the macro cycling and generally just avoided carbs while keeping protein and veggies coming in. For me it was basically just a 16/8 (at least) fast which helped with calorie restriction. I didn't have a job (the summer internship was well paid) at this point and could basically do whatever I wanted so I had a system going where I would wake up around 12 pm eat some breakfast/lunch, eat dinner at around 6 pm and then stay up without eating until 3-4 am. This was easy for me and although I was hungry at night sometimes, I had grown to enjoy the feeling and knew I would be able to eat as soon I woke up. I also experimented with 24 hour fasts to off-set big calorie intakes like christmas dinner and eating out with friends and such. 


During winter break I also began to lift some weights. All I had was a bench and a very small amount of weights for it, plus some 8 pound dumb bells. I had a system going where on one day I would work on my upper body with high rep (20) sets of bench, incline bench, shrugs and rows. The next day I would do lower body with some squats, lunges, step-ups, and calf-raises with the same rep range. I was doing all of these with only around 70 lbs of resistance so I'm fairly confident I wasn't doing much, but it was something to do and I spent basically all day doing random sets of this stuff. I also continued with my now well rehearsed ab workout every day and did some stupidly high volume bicep/wrist curls with the 8 lb dumbbells on upper body days. I was also experimenting with tougher body weight stuff like planches, hand stand pushups, and dragon flags. I was down around 160 lbs during winter break. 


I went back to school for spring semester (this semester) and they had opened a newly renovated gym on campus. I quickly grabbed a membership and started with a split of upper-body days and lower body days similar to what I was doing at home. I was into fitocracy at this point and would get a little too concerned with the point totals I was getting compared to actually making a good routine. On upper body days I would do db bench, db incline bench, lat pulldowns, tri extensions, db rows, cambered rows, chest flies, OHP, shrugs, basically any back/arm/chest workout I could figure out that didn't involve barbells (I was an idiot). On leg days I did leg presses, leg extensions, leg curls, calf raises, and lunges. I also did core stuff like HLRs, weighted decline sit ups, and weighted hyperextensions on both of these days. I would go for 6 days a week generally. I also still ate about the same I had been eating but perhaps a little more. I'd guess I was at about 1600 calories a day at this point. I also began taking protein powder but very inconsistently and with water. I neglected cardio pretty much completely. I took a week off before the triathlon to prepare a little bit.


**My Current Routine/Diet**

A: (Legs/Shoulders)

* Squats

* Barbell OHP

* Shrugs

* Calf Raises

* Random ab stuff (HLRs, weighted declines)


B: (Chest/Tris)

* Barbell Bench Press

* Incline Barbell Bench Press

* Cable Flys 

* Tricep extensions

* Skull crushers

* Pushups 

* Random ab stuff

C: (Back/Bi)

* Deadlift

* Barbell Rows

* DB Rows

* Curls

* Chins

* Random Ab Stuff


I try to keep reps per set as close to 10 as I can but have to lower that sometimes as my weights go higher on the compounds. I basically start with a small amount of weight and slowly work my way up to my near maxes while keeping my reps as high as possible. I've never actually tested my maxes. **I realize this is not what fittit proscribes but I've found this workout schedule to work for me and it keeps me happy.**

I still struggle with my diet but have been eating about maintenance lately and am eating a good amount of protein. I've never really counted macros hardcore, and will need to get into this soon. 

**Lift Numbers**

* Bench - I work up to 135 for 3x5

* Squat - I work up to 185 for 3x8

* Deadlifts - I work up to 225 for 3x10 (Will be adding more weight next workout)


**Goals** 
I've been saying for a while that I want to bulk and put on some muscle but at this point I think I'd rather just stay on the skinny side for the summer and start to bulk during the fall semester of next year. I will be eating enough for maintenance though, at least, and keeping my protein levels high. I'll also continue lifting and trying to increase my working weights. 

***TLDR***

**What Worked**

* Cut carbs. This was the easiest way to cut calories for me. I honestly had no problem eating very little amounts of calories when I cut back on carbs. I basically had a bowl of cereal each day and got the rest of my carbs from fruits and vegetables. Whether or not this is healthy I do not know, but if your goal is weight loss, this works. Remember though, as long as you are consuming less calories than you burn, you will lose weight. If you want to do this without cutting carbs, go for it.

* Find something you enjoy and do it. I love /r/fitness and spend loads of time on here but if you ask what exercise you should be doing you're basically going to be spammed with SS. The most important thing is to find a routine that you enjoy and that you'll keep doing. Progress will come with persistence. 

* Leangains is cool. This made it pretty trivial to run a calorie deficit. I'm not sure whether all of the science behind it is legit or not but the fact is if you're only giving yourself an 8 hour window for eating, it's easier to consume less. I don't understand why people would ever use this for bulking, though.

**Suggestions (Learn from my mistakes)** 

* Keep your calories respectable and your protein intake high. It hurts me now to think of all the muscle I must have been shedding by running a high deficit for so long without knowing much about macros. Try to keep your protein at 1g/lb of body weight while running your deficit. 

* Lift weights while losing weight. Cardio is fun and if you enjoy it then you should absolutely do it but lifting while you're cutting will help you look that much better when you shed that fat away. I may be skinny but I'm fairly scrawny these days. I'm happy with how I look but there was certainly a better way to do this than simply run at a huge deficit. 



This was a lot to write and remember. I'm sure I've forgotten some stuff but hopefully I'll touch on everything while I'm answering your questions. I'll be answering anything you guys want to know but it may take me some time, as I have a busy school schedule currently.


Thanks again for reading!

sn4iv,1,2012-04-22,Summer Project,[deleted],LowtechLiving,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowtechLiving/comments/sn4iv/summer_project/,"I'm a programmer.  I spend all of my time on the computer.  I work on the computer, I play on the computer, my hobbies are on the computer.  Ugh.

I'm glad I stumbled on this subreddit, perhaps I've found some like minded people.  This summer I have a wonderful internship programming, so I'm going to spend all of my days programming.  It's a start up and those could be long days.  My plan is to leave my laptop at the office and not even have a computer at home anymore.

For me it's about forcing some boredom into your life. With the Internet and TV I feel hyper stimulated all the time. To find entertainment I merely collapse into my chair, click a few buttons, and begin passively consuming.

Without something neurotically occupying my attention (ie internet) I quickly become bored. When bored I then proceed to think through everything I could possibly do, prioritize the ideas, and choose one to act upon. Even if I end up watching a television show the important thing is that I chose to watch that specific show rather than passively accepting whatever was being played at the time. I have not had TV in a long time, so that's not a problem, but whenever I've momentarily had no internet I find I eat better, exercise more, have a cleaner house, and knock more things off of my to do lists.

So this is my summer project.  Does anyone have any similar plans?  I'd love to use this subreddit for updates and progress updates.  I will probably have to go to the library to access Reddit so I'll write my posts before hand.  Maybe we can make some collective goals?  I have books I want to read, cafes I want to lounge at, friends I want to connect with, and more.

I'd love to hear your summer plans below:"
smsac,3,2012-04-22,"Although anecdotal, here's my own success story (actually, a collection of mini-successes wrapped up in a series) to get you going.  I'm not a particularly talented individual, either.  (Long)",BranchedOut,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/smsac/although_anecdotal_heres_my_own_success_story/,"I've gotten motivated over the past year, and I've had wondrous results.  I'll begin my story in November.

I was going to a friend's party.  I went to go put on one of my favorite shirts.  *It didn't fit*.  My weight rose to 250 lbs.  At that point, I said, ""Time to do something about this.  Now.""  

Instead of planning a weight loss routine, planning this, making schedules for that, I just started eating better at my next meal.  I didn't change what I ate, I just ate less.  I even went OUT to eat at a Mexican restaurant.  How did I eat healthier?  I just ate half of my meal.  That then made the most delicious, wonderful smelling lunch the next day.  I pretty much calorie counted.  Still ate terrible, but just a little less.  Surprisingly, the weight just melted off.  Over the course of 3 months, I had dropped 20 pounds.  Just from counting calories.

New Years came around.  I made the resolution to lose weight like normal, right?  

Wrong.  I decided the best to way derail my weight loss was to make it a goal.  People ask me, ""How many pounds are you trying to lose?""  I respond, ""Iunno.  I'm just trying to get fit.""  This nonspecific thing I was going toward (it may be a goal, but I'm not calling it one) was the key.  

I bought some new clothes from a thrift store.  Best purchase?  A suit.  For $5.  I then bought a host of nice button-up shirts, and slacks.  They do wonderful things for your appearance.  I'd imagine you could go five thousand miles in any direction from where any of you are, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a girl that doesn't appreciate a man that dresses nice.  

I took a ""Social Dance"" class at beginning winter quarter.  I wanted to be active.  Well, the class wasn't as physically intensive as I wanted it to be, but I did learn a few good dances.  *And* it wasn't that bad that there were lots of attractive gals in there.  I took this opportunity to shamelessly flirt for the sake of flirting.  Got some numbers.  But, I'd say take the class if you ever find one.  I haven't met a girl yet that didn't appreciate a fella who knows more than the ""bump and grind.""  

Spring quarter, I signed up for a swimming class.  It'd be more active than dance!  AND I WAS RIGHT.  Every day we swim until we're out of breath.  And if anyone ever tells you that you can't get muscles from swimming, **punch them in the throat.**  I'm toning up like a sonofagun, and I keep finding new muscles that are getting big enough to notice.  I'm now 210 lbs, 40 pounds lost, and a lotta muscle gained.  

Now, all the while this was happening, I had an internship opportunity going.  A company was at my school's career fair, and was looking for interns.  I'll make the story short, and let you know the company took a month and a half to get me to an interview, but never messaged me back or anything if I got the internship or not.  After realizing they didn't want me, I went to my school's career center website.  I applied to everything with the word, ""IT"" in it.  I just middle clicked everything, went to the tab, scrolled down, and hit ""apply.""  Days later, I get an email from a company that wanted to speak to me that day.  Long story short, I went from not getting an internship in a small town in Louisiana (where I'm from) with nothing to do, to a **Full time job, with really awesome benefits, and a higher pay, in *Washington, DC* **.  Higher pay, I get full insurance coverage, and it's in a city where I'll have a million things to do!

But it doesn't stop there.  From November, my confidence also rose because I decided I wanted to be confident.  Confidence is a really attractive trait, physically and mentally.  I thought I was awesome, acted like I was awesome, and you know what?  People thought I was awesome.  It's a self-feeding cycle.  I just got more and more confident, and looked and felt more and more awesome.  I was talking to very attractive women in a way that seemed I could get them easily.  Although I'm still quite flabby (I'm in an awkard stage between fat and fit.  There's big muscles showing, but most of it is covered by a layer of fat, so I just gotta burn it off and I'll be goooood), I talked like I was the most attractive man on the face of the earth.  And it works.  Next weekend, I visit my hometown.  There, I have a date with this Philipino gal, who's just ferociously good-looking.  And she's really sweet, too.  She can really get any man she wants, and she's a good person, so she deserves a really good guy.  Unfortunately, I'm moving, so I'm not doing anything to get tied to anywhere.  But dates are fun.

**Do you want to know how I did it all?**
As cliche as it is, I followed Nike's slogan of ""*Just Do It*""  Really.  I didn't worry about small details, or anything else that would slow me down.  I wanted to lose weight, so I did.  I wanted a date with a gal far prettier than most guys my appearence would date, so I did.  I wanted a job, so I got one (but luck was a major contributor to this one.)  I wanted to be confident, so I did.  Just do it.

**TL;DR**:  Lost weight, got a job in DC (I'm a country-bumpkin from Louisiana), became confident, got a date with a girl far prettier (and a good person, too) than guys my appearance would date.  If I want to do something, I do it.  "
smhvz,4,2012-04-22,"Gf is depressed, doesn't know it.  Do I stick it out or cut my losses?",NightWalker75,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/smhvz/gf_is_depressed_doesnt_know_it_do_i_stick_it_out/,"TL;DR Gf probably needs to see a psychiatrist, but won't because she insists that she don't need it and that its for crazy people.  Her depression is ruining our relationship and draining the life out of me.   Idk what to do.  

GF Amber 25f and I 27m have been going out for almost 2 years. I used to love this girl alot, enough to tell her that I would be honored to marry her in the future and start a family as well.  She was everything I was looking for and appeared to be ""the one"".  But recently that girl serves only a figment of my imagination and has been replaced with what seems to be like a truer version of the ""real Amber"".    

We were connected in every which way.  Our sense of humors were almost identical and till this date she is still the coolest, most laid back, funniest chick I know.  Sexually we couldn't keep our hands off of each other.  Compliments were both common and easy to come by.  Expressing ourselves, feelings, and deepest thoughts couldn't have come any easier.  We were open about everything.

But now... now shes confused.  Idk what she expected to happen to her life after college, but all she really wanted to do was travel and see the world.  She got a chance to do that when she got to do a 4 month internship in Switzerland last summer.  Let me also mention that this was 4 months after I had moved back to Hawaii after living in California for the last 4 years, just so we could finally be together after doing long distance for 6 months.  So understanding this was something she had to do for herself, i agreed she should go and that I would stay with her parents for the time being.  I bit my tongue and endured the 4 months that she practically forgot about me and let the relationship fizzle away.  She would later admit to me that if I hadn't worked so hard at our LDR that it probably would have ended while she was in Switzerland.  

Well ever since shes gotten back from Switzerland, Nothing else ever seems to make her happy anymore.  She came back home weighing 20 lbs heavier and she lets that take a big toll on her self confidence.  Before you go off and determine the problem right there, I personally find her more attractive now, or at least don't find any less attractive.  I tell her I like it, I compliment her on her body at least a few times a week and would tell her more but I know when to draw the line of overdoing it.  We actively work out together.  I signed her up under my 24hour membership program, we go to sissy turbo kickboxing/yoga classes together.  I go hiking with her, we do crossfit training, we go on runs around her neighberhood, we go to the beach, and were even planning to go snowboarding in Canada in May.  So I do my part in trying to help her feel more confident about herself physically, even though I love her body as is. 

Shes worked 3 different jobs since being back home and quit one with a major career advancement within a month, allowing a well paying management position to slip right through her hands and opting to work for $12/hr insead of a 55k/year salary.  Her other job (I should also mention is her favorite) is buying back gold at a kiosk at a grocery store.  Its a dead end job, she knows it, but wants to put in full time hours here because she can just relax and not really do anything all day. This is all understandable to me though, finding the right job is no easy task and takes time.  Im also allowing her time to find her base and open her wings.  

But through all this she has lost sight of the girl she once was.  Or pretended to be for me, at this point im not really sure what to think.  

The only thing that is ever on her mind is how shitty life is.  How her schooling screwed her over with grant money going towards her masters degree (which she still cant make a decision if she would with or without the money).  Or how how bad her job is and how it makes her sick, to the point where shes gone to the ER only to have the doctors say shes perfectly fine.  Even after multiple visits to her regular doctor, they couldn't find anything. She was anxious and freaking about if she was termially ill and the doctors can't find out whats wrong with her.  Her father and I would eventually get around to her that she needed to calm her mind down, relax, and learn breathing exercises that would eventually eliminate all her heart problems.  

But weeks after quitting the job that made her sick in the first place, shes still feeling the after effects of the chemicals she had to work with.  She gets dizzy and nauzea spells daily.  Never to the point where she is throwing up or really ill, just on and off slight dizzyness.  But enough for her to tell me how irritating is... not at the time, but days later when I try to make passes at her and tells me how shes too sick to do anything.  When minutes before we could be playfighting and laughing it up like nothing was ever wrong. 

She is no longer physically attracted to me, nor has any desire or need to be please either of us sexually.  Her libido is now non existant.  I have talked to her about this numerous times and she says she will try to do better, but in the end she can't even fake it anymore.  Through this grueling process I have completely given up on trying to get physical with her.  I have come to terms and accepted that I will probably get laid once a month now if im lucky.  I have a strong libido and this was not something I wanted to do for any other reason but trying to make this relationship work.

After a recent fight she has even admitted that she does not put in her fair share of effort into making this relationship work.  

But heres the problem, This type of thing happens everytime we fight.  She will fix the problem for a few days or so, but will fall right back into her old ways shortly therafter.  Until we're back at square one.   IM tired of all the work im putting in and getting the run arounds.  She won't listen to me or take my advice on mostly anything.  She now makes me feel small and even worse about myself because she has become so condiscending.  Can I work with this girl or am I headed down a path going no where?"

so i (an american) met a girl while studying abroad last year in asia.  she's now 26 and i'm 23.  i found out she was dating an american guy who was an english teacher over there, and i was happy for her.  but after a while she starting asking me things like ""is it true in the US boyfriends don't have to buy anything for their girlfriend's birthday?"" and telling me he wouldn't let her hang out with certain people without his permission.  just an overall dick, and the thing is she's the type of incredibly kind person who didn't understand that she was being used.

so after talking with her some more, and hearing that it was kind of getting to physical abuse, she was convinced to break up with him.  i was so happy for her letting go of that situation, and even though at this point i started alluding to her being someone i would like to date and sensing that she possibly felt the same way, since i was going back to the US in two months pretty soon i didn't want to tell her anything.

in late august after getting back i finally asked her if she'd like to have a long-distance relationship with me, and it made her so happy.  normally i wouldn't recommend having a relationship like that, but for our personalities and future plans being so similar i think things can work.  and i hear stories about people cheating and stupid things like that but we were in love and i don't think either of us would ever be the type of people to even think about that.  i also wanted her to know i was serious about this since her last guy wasted her time, so i promised her that if things worked out that she would definitely be the type of person i would consider marrying.

so things were great for a few months.  i'd wake up every morning, talk with her online, chat on skype sometimes, sent letters/gifts back and forth occasionally.  we got to know each other pretty well this way, and i've never been so interested in hearing what a girl had to say every time we talked like i did with her.

but she also also went to school/work a total of 80 hours a week.  i was also pretty busy with school, upcoming graduation and an internship too.  and i didn't realize how difficult it would be not getting to be physically close to her, even when i studied abroad i gave her a hug maybe once since we were only good friend then.  i'm also a virgin, so i brought up the topic of sex sometimes which made her uncomfortable to talk about.  and looking back on things i could've easily waited to talk about some of that but i acted immaturely.

in late january, with all of those little stressful factors involved and a small misunderstanding of her thinking i talked with a mutual friend about some private stuff, which i didn't, but it's somewhat understandable she thought that.  she tells me it's better if we end the relationship.  i ask if we could work things out, saying id come visit her or vice versa in march, but she wasn't interested.  i'm pretty sad/upset at that point and i politely tell her that i can't stay friends and never want to talk with her again even though i respect her as a person.

and i thought that would be it, like i would just forget about her in a few weeks and move on.  but it's not that easy.  she was a pretty important person in my life for almost a year, and even the slightlest little things bring back memories of her that i can't really avoid.  i tried emailing occasionally without making myself look too desperate, but she didn't want to give me another chance.

in march i was back in asia for a week and while there i decided to go to her house and drop off a package.  hopefully i could at least talk with her in person again.  but because of an unknown law about not visiting a person's house after 9pm without prior approval, i was taken into a cop car right after i got to her house.  the cop goes into her house and talks with my ex's mom, who doesn't like me at this point, which only makes things worse.

at the police station i'm interrogated by two police officers, they couldn't speak english to add to that.  at this point i'm thinking i may go to jail so i'm trying to explain my side of things.  they ask to see the gift i brought her, a few small items and a letter i wrote.  at this point after my explanation he's more understanding but as soon as he reads the letter he starts crying, and i'm crying at this point too.  so he understands things a little better now and we work something out where he'll let me go without any questions asked if i just sign a piece of paper saying i won't contact her by email, in person, etc again.  he rips off a piece of notepad paper and i write that i won't contact her, sign my name, and put a fingerprint on it.  we say some sorrys, thank yous, and i go back to the US a few days later.

that's a condensed version, and i know it's a little long just for some context.  basically i'd still really love to see her, but i guess legally i'm not allowed to contact her, maybe indirectly through a friend but even then in her mind the way she thinks of me now she probably wouldn't be willing to meet.  i'm not even concerned about dating her or anything like that, just getting a chance to talk with her in person for a little bit would mean everything to me and it may help her too.  i'm not sure how else to deal with it other than talking with her.  i have plenty of money, let's say $10,000 i could somehow devote to this, free time, and my life in general is pretty good.  it's just this one thing that i'm having a really difficult time dealing with."

* Are there any brands that are particularly linux friendly while performing well?
* Conversely, are there any brands I should steer clear of?
* How difficult is it to set up my linux so that I have all the boot/os stuff on an SSD, while all the data is on an HDD?

soord,2,2012-04-23,Pent up disappointment- released!,YumYumBlueGrapes,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/soord/pent_up_disappointment_released/,"I have one goal.  After living through the grotesque transformation of the girl I loved into the controlling imitation of her mother, I decided to chase my dreams.  Family vacations to Utah and Colorado got me obsessed over the area, you could say.  Everything I love doing is out there- in addition people who shared my interests and were “like me”.  With a hollow heart I began striving for that destination.

Getting a degree in chemical engineering was the easy part.  I packed on internship after internship and sacrificed personal time for resume building projects.  I became the envy of my peers as I was not as intelligent but had a chip on my shoulder from having work experience.  I first decided that graduate school in Boulder would be a great option- but when a supervisor at one of my jobs failed to write a recommendation letter I dismissed the option of going for chemical engineering graduate school.  I wanted to work.  

I somehow became one of many people being considered for a job in Denver doing natural gas.  I put up with a two day interview process to finally be offered a job in Midland, TX while two of my classmates got jobs in Denver.  My jobs.  I tried going to Midland, and the socialite in me could not take the isolation.  It was good money, though, but the isolation got to me so I decided to not take the job.

Two more job options later, and I’m in a city only two and a half hours from my home town.  Things went well in my new field of Environmental Engineering- I grew to like the field.  However, the last four months of living in this area have gotten me bummed as I became less and less used at my job, more and more worthless.  Still no girlfriend, I had burned bridges with some friends and had failed to find enough more friends in this city, and most importantly, no Colorado.  I tend to think of the girl that started it all.  I tend to think about taking her back- as she is still single.  I would be miserable, but not as miserable as now.  I become angry at myself very quickly because I look at how my life is now and how I enabled it to become.  What if I had gotten the job in Denver?  Fuck that, out of my control.  My self-esteem has plummeted but yesterday I started applying for new jobs, out west.  The graduate school application for Denver is due in October- funding in July.  

It’s all a fucking game, hopefully I get lucky this next round.

snyki,1,2012-04-23,I have both a short and a long distance relationship. Need advice. ,[deleted],gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/snyki/i_have_both_a_short_and_a_long_distance/,"So I've gotten myself into a bit of a situation, and honestly i don't know what I want.

 

I am a student doing a university course exchange. I have a long term boyfriend from back home and our 1.5 year anniversary was in February. I love him very much and we had planned to move to the city together when I got back from my exchange.

However, I have extended my stay abroad as I was recently offered a six month internship with a company I really can't refuse. I will be the country for an additional 7 months in addition to the last 5 months. My boyfriend is supportive and says we will work things out, even though we will no longer be graduating at the same time. 

This is where things get complicated. I recently met this really great local guy and made friends with him easily. He has taken me around to several of the local gay bars and been my private kind of tour guide. One night we got pretty drunk and I went home with him. Of course we slept together and since then have become rather romantically involved. This has been going on for about a month now. He is aware of my attachement and is always calling me out on it. 

I realize what I'm doing isn't fair to either party. I can't commit myself to my local man and I can't keep my boy at home waiting while I am having an affair. I really just want to make a fair decision that I can live with and be happy with. 

I want to take a break from my long term boyfriend and spend time with my local man but I am worried this is a wrong decision as my local man just got a job offer in which he could potentially be leaving the country anywhere from 2 months to 6 months.


**Possible Decisions:**

Break up with boyfriend, Date Local for up to 6 months
*cons included breaking local boys heart, local lives earlier than expected, ruined relationship with boyf.*

Date both men
*cons include feeling incredibly guilty about being a player, take all lose all scenario*

Stop seeing local man
*cons include being in a long distance relationship for a year, uncertain future with boyf upon return, lose best friend abroad (local man)*

**I am just  looking for ""what would you do sort of advice."" I don't need anyone judging me for my life choices. I have to live with them not you. Thanks for your opinion.**

snrdq,6,2012-04-23,Lowtech Summer Project,thebigredjay,LowtechLiving,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowtechLiving/comments/snrdq/lowtech_summer_project/,"I'm a programmer. I spend all of my time on the computer. I work on the computer, I play on the computer, my hobbies are on the computer. Ugh.


I'm glad I stumbled on this subreddit, perhaps I've found some like minded people. This summer I have a wonderful internship programming, so I'm going to spend all of my days programming. It's a start up and those could be long days. My plan is to leave my laptop at the office and not even have a computer at home anymore.
For me it's about forcing some boredom into your life. With the Internet and TV I feel hyper stimulated all the time. To find entertainment I merely collapse into my chair, click a few buttons, and begin passively consuming.


Without something neurotically occupying my attention (ie internet) I quickly become bored. When bored I then proceed to think through everything I could possibly do, prioritize the ideas, and choose one to act upon. Even if I end up watching a television show the important thing is that I chose to watch that specific show rather than passively accepting whatever was being played at the time. I have not had TV in a long time, so that's not a problem, but whenever I've momentarily had no internet I find I eat better, exercise more, have a cleaner house, and knock more things off of my to do lists.


So this is my summer project. Does anyone have any similar plans? I'd love to use this subreddit for updates and progress updates. I will probably have to go to the library to access Reddit so I'll write my posts before hand. Maybe we can make some collective goals? I have books I want to read, cafes I want to lounge at, friends I want to connect with, and more.


I'd love to hear your summer plans below:"
snm1p,14,2012-04-22,"Need some advice
",CO_Coleslaw,eldertrees,https://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/snm1p/need_some_advice/,"Hey Elderents,

I'm in need of a little bit of advice from those older and wiser than myself. I am about to finish my sophomore year in college and due to being unable to find an internship or afford summer school, I will be moving back home for the summer to work. I am from and also go to college in Colorado and I decided to get a medical card before going home for the summer and have been trying to figure out what I should do when I get home. My mom and I have talked in the past about marijuana (not about usage particularly, more just general talk) and I have never admitted to smoking but I have made it clear that I am not against it and my mom seems fully supportive of that. My current plan is to find time to talk to her as soon as appropriate when I get home and tell her I got a medical card (which I believe she will fully support due to my chronic back pain). The reason I want to do this is because 1) I think she will be fully supportive of it, 2) because I don't want to hide my smoking from her, and 3) so that we can talk about guidelines for my use (such as smoking in the house, etc). 

Seems pretty simple, but here's where it gets a little more complicated. My only hesitations for proceeding with this plan is that my mom also happens to be my boss, and I don't know how she would feel if I were smoking regularly while my little sister (about to finish junior year in high school) is around. 

As far as the work situation, my work does have a drug testing policy but it is only implemented if someone suspects you are high/drunk on the job (which I would never do). What I'm worried about is that there may be some conflict between my mom, who I feel would support it, and my boss, who could technically fire me for using marijuana. My mom is generally very good about separating the ""Boss"" mom from the ""Normal"" mom but I just don't know how she would feel about it from a boss' point of view.

As far as my sister goes, she is a pretty good kid as far as I know. I don't think she smokes or drinks or has ever considered it. I plan on hiding my marijuana usage as well as possible from her over the summer but I don't want to be scared to leave my room while high for fear that she will notice.

So what do you think I should do? Tell my mom and see how it goes or just keep it a secret?

TL;DR: Going home for summer, getting medical card. Should I tell my mom or not?

sqtof,2,2012-04-24,1 month. negative mental changes vs positive physical changes (maybe NSFW),[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/sqtof/1_month_negative_mental_changes_vs_positive/,"so I checked my badge today and saw that I made it to 31 days. can't say I feel like celebrating too much.


I'll start with the good changes: 

* rock-hard boners, and my penis seems bigger now than 1 month ago

* an overall healthier feeling (more stamina, better muscle health - feels as if i can feel and use my muscles better)

* and yes, more confidence.. since I started I managed to talk to 2 really cute baristas and got their numbers, and apparently I'm having an effect on one of our interns (3 female interns.. it's heaven for a chem lab)

bad changes: 

**mental fatigue and stress**; I can't sleep well, I have very stressful dreams, sometimes I wake up crying. when I wake up I feel completely exhausted, and I need about 2 hours to gather the required energy. I've been warned that this might be (the start of) a mild depression, however I have no depressive thoughts or behavior. 

**always horny** as if this is news for nofappers.. but it's bothering me at work.

**uncommon sexual urges** the 2nd week was very weird for me.. I had slight homosexual tendencies (and I'm the straightest man I know), as in thinking how it would feel to have things up my ass; showers started to be uncomfortable.. I considered this as a mechanism of my brain to satisfy sexual needs. this phase lasted about 3 days.

I am happy to see such physical changes, but I must say that the mental issues have a stronger impact: I'm tired a lot, have difficulty focusing, bad sleep, my memory got a bit worse..  it feels as if things are worse than before, or maybe they are the same and I feel them stronger..

however, I do have a thyroid issue, which I suppose nofapping made worse (hormones disorder and whatnot I think).. it's my only explanation so far..

oh well, here's to hoping things get better \o/"

I swear to God, it took me 3 months of trying to download Chris Jericho to finally succeed in doing so. My next attempt is to get that sweet Lord Tensai, but by the time I get him downloaded the gimmick will probably be dead. Fix this, or stop advertising all these awesome CAWs scrolling by my screen on the main menu.

#2 - You fix this fucking pin system and you fix it now. This piece of shit is the dumbest system ever implemented. How could anyone approve this? Do you test your games? Apparently, nobody in your almost out-of-business company has nephews, because playing this game with a couple 10 year olds will  prove to you how fucking dumb this pin system is. Guess what they do when they are getting pinned? They press all the buttons like a wild man. I show them how to use the kick out system and they don't even understand. One of them got the hang of it and only managed to kick out ONCE. FUCKING ONCE. Don't tell me I don't know how to use it, because I fucking diddly do. I can use it to kick out, it still sucks. The pin system should appear right when the guy's skin touches yours (AW YEA!), not when the ref counts 1. STUPID STUPID STUPID.

Do you know how annoying it is, having to wait until the referee starts to count 1 before the graphics even appear on the screen? Kicking out is a frantic thing to do, nobody wants to slow down and play some goofy ass mini game. Fix this shit.

#3 (but not really that important) - Your models this year looked like Herpa-Derp the Third. Do interns make your character models? I can forgive the graphics, because you DID manage to make the game's replay value FUN again... and I feel like the AI was well done this year.

That's all I'm going into. I feel like WWE '12 was the best WWE game in the SmackDown Series and the revamps they made were great but#1 and #2 need to be fucking fixed. Still doesn't top WWE All Stars as the best engine THQ/Yukes has put out though. You put realistic physics and graphics on that game and you would have something magical.

I may continue to quit if I feel that the sober life has more to offer than being high 24/7. I have been a daily smoker for ~3.5 years.


So this past weekend I was with MANY friends that were smoking while I was around. I tried not to make it a big deal that I was quitting for however long it may be, but just said no thanks when offered. It actually felt kind of good being the only one around that wasn't high because I could really look around and see that most of these people just sat around and watched the world go by, I on the other hand wanted to experience it! On the flip side of things I was pretty envious that they were toking it up, and I actually still enjoyed being in the atmosphere of smoking even if I wasn't hitting it myself. In the end, I refrained from smoking and I feel like this is my greatest challenge that I have faced yet.


Here is how I have been feeling lately:
1. The not-smoking headaches are completely GONE! Thank god, they were getting very annoying!
2. My head continues to get less blurry. I still notice random instances where I just totally zone out or feel a little ""after high"" kick in.
3. My cravings aren't as strong, but not a day goes by where I don't think about smoking.
4. Sleep schedule is back to normal, but appetite still doesn't feel completely normal. I still have to force myself to eat on certain occasions.


I hope my experience motivates others to continue on their journey!
I will continue to check in every 2-3 days.
Stay sober!

What would be the best way to go?

I just started my third and last internship at the company im currently working at (Paying 36k a year for the next 4 months and then i get another raise of minimum 4k).

I am planning on staying at my parents house for another year, but my gf and I really want to buy our house and live together. How much money do we need to save before we are good to go?

Any tips?

Thanks everyone.

**Edit :** Ok, after reading all the comment, I realised that you have some good points. I was really thinking that buying a house instead of renting was a good solution but you have proven me wrong.

So, my next question would be : What is the best way to go from living with parents to living with your wife/girlfriend?

**My short to middle plan looks like this :** Right now, I still have 6 classes and 1 internship to finish before my college ends. I got my boss' word that I will get hired at the company where I am doing my internship. 

I am currently saving about 80-85% of my money. My girlfriend and I are trying to save up to 60k before we move in together.

Once we have 60k, we are going to try to find a small appartment in repentigny at a low cost (300-500ish a month). We will keep on trying to put money aside until we have 100k, and then we will buy a house.

Is that a better plan?

This will let us : 1) see how it is going living together 2) buy most of the stuff we will need in a house

Does that make sense?

**Some background on me:**

I'll be graduating next December from GW with a degree in Political Communication. I'm thinking about pursuing a master's in Political Management or Public Relations, but considering it's a big decision, I thought I'd take a shot at finding a job first. I've even heard about some firms offering to pay for a master's education, so I thought I'd look into this.

I have tried to have a relevant internship every semester of my schooling. I interned in the Hart Senate building my freshman year (even got to go to the President's first SOTU), interned for a K-Street PAC my sophomore year, went abroad earlier this year, and just finished interning for a DC Council candidate.

**What I'm looking for:**

I'm not sure exactly what I want to do, but I am obsessed with politics. I'd love to some day be a campaign manager, and this summer I am leaving DC to work for a Senatorial campaign. However, my candidate is not likely to win, I am unsure how to enter this field and find a job in Washington once I graduate. I suppose I should be looking for an entry-level job for a political consulting or public relations firm?

**My questions:**

What should I be doing between now and the time I graduate?

Where should I be looking for a job, and what can I do to make sure I'm not only employed after graduation, but on track for a lucrative career as a Washington professional?

Any tips or guidance would be appreciated, and I will answer any questions you may have.

I believe some of the problem is that for his entire life, his parents have always taken care of him. If he wanted money or a car, they'd always give it to him. I've had to work since I was 14. Now, his parents have been transferred out of state and he wants me to pay for his things when he's not working, but I don't want to be a mother to a grown man.

I've talked to him about all of this before, but when I tell him how I feel, he starts crying and begging me not to leave him. he tells me that I'm the best thing that's ever happened to him and leaving him would destroy him.

I know he's depressed, but I feel that if I stay with him, my career and social life will suffer. I want to be able to go to company functions and be able to work all day on projects without feeling I have to check up on him. I love him, but ultimately, a relationship with him isn't worth more to me than I am to myself and my needs. I also want to just have fun.

Is it wrong to dump him when he's depressed and what's the best way to go about it?

TL;DR boyfriend is depressed and I want to live life and have fun. Is it wrong to dump him and how?"

I just got offered my dream job.  I'm not going to specify, but it is a major defense contractor.  The problem is, they aren't really cool with drug use.  For now, it is just an internship so I only need to do a urine test, but if I get offered the job full time, I will have to go through the process of obtaining security clearance (extensive background check, as well as a polygraph).

Anyways, I have a few questions for you guys.

(1) Have any of you ever obtained a clearance?  I know that I need to quit for good if I am going to get it, but I used to be somewhat of a regular smoker for a few months, so I am terrified of being rejected.

(2) I will have to take a drug test before starting.  I'm pretty sure I have about a month before this happens, but I NEED to be able to pass the urine test.  This is my dream job, and losing it would crush me.  I am about 140 lbs, female, and probably like 5'6"".  Is a month enough time to pee clean?  Is there anything I can do other than extensive exercising to ensure that I am clean?

Thanks guys.  I had to create a throwaway in case during the investigation they check my reddit account (yes, they're that thorough)."
srqp8,20,2012-04-25,Guideline to stay debt-free after college?,matlem,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/srqp8/guideline_to_stay_debtfree_after_college/,"I am about to finish my college without any debts (Thanks to my 24h/week job since high school and my parents who paid for most of my education fees).

I have asked in /r/frugal if buying a house with my gf was a good idea and I have realised that we should rent first. 

Now, my question is : What are the best way to stay debt free once we leave the parent's house and live in the ""real world""?

1. My car is paid
2. For now, my only expenses are food, phone bill (53$/month which is actually low in canada for my data plan) and my car insurance (75$ a month for full coverage)
3. I just started my 3rd internship at the same company where I now make 36k.
4. My boss told me he will give me another raise after my internship (in 4 months), which will bring me up to minimum 40k.
5. I do not see my gf and I breaking up (we have been dating for 6 and a half year). (I know things will change when we live together but I really hope it will work out good.)
6. I still have 5 classes to finish at college but I will work at the same time (they are evening classes and aren't really important)
7. We have about 20k saved up and are putting 85-90% of our money aside until we have at least 60k before making a move (Either buying a house or renting an apartment)
8. We were thinking about buying an apartment because the renting price are almost as high as a house payment (600-800$/month compared to 900-1100$ a month)

I think that sums it up... I will not take it personal if you guys tell me I am naive and/or ignorant. I just turned 23 years old and would like to know what you guys would do differently if you had the chance to go back to being 23 and starting in the ""real life"".

Thanks."

JOSH DENNY is here, with former intern Shooby and fan Max. We’re drinking spirits and celebrating Friday the 13th. Watch out for spooks and killers out there, kids. We talk about Shooby being late, and how his teeth look like they’re escaping from his mouth. We talk about food trucks and Mexicans, as well as shitty bands. More stupid stuff with Flapper’s Comedy Club. We start a new ongoing new Natasha Leggero reference for anything that sucks. Is milk steak a real thing? Max and Shooby aren’t original and repeat each other’s jokes. How would society start over if almost everyone died? A weird British fan calls in. Our mandatory talk about shit continues. Patrick reads an IM conversation from a fat girl with no sense of humor to one of our fans about Patrick and the show. We talk about why Hitler got a bad reputation for killing too many Jews. We get in to Shooby’s phone and read texts from Tony, a girl who manages High Roller Tattoo in New York, where Shooby recently got a tattoo and Patrick will soon be getting his. Shooby texts likes a man-girl. Domino’s Pizza Hero game for iPad is so addictive and it actually makes their pizza look good.

su5wz,3,2012-04-26,Soon to be New Grad RN-many questions!,goeyfish,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/su5wz/soon_to_be_new_grad_rnmany_questions/,"Hey, so i'm about to graduate with my BSN this may and I was wondering how difficult my job hunt is going to be? Before I started nursing school I came in with a 3.8 GPA and that quickly went down the drain-it took me a while to get used to nursing school-not to mention year #1 I had TERRIBLE TERRIBLE professors...in two 8 credit classes I wound up with a C and it sucks because right now my GPA does not reflect the type of student I am or the type of nurse I will be.  Right now i'm in my last semester (with amazing professors) I am running all A's. I think my improvement will look great for me-but at the same time I am looking to work in a well respected hospital in NYC. I'm worried that my grades are going to hold me back from that happening. My sister works at CHONY (NYP Presbyterian Children's Hospital) and I'm praying for some connections through her but all in all I don't know how much connections will really help. I hear that a lot of people don't get a job for 4-6 months-this scares me. My sister got her RN job right when she graduated before she even passed her boards (and this was only 3 or 4 years ago). 
I'm also really nervous for interviews-I'm one of those quiet and sweet kinda girls-not loud and confident-Interviews make me really nervous and I need to learn how to suck it up and be proud of what I've done and exude confidence-if anyone has any tips for me that would be really amazing. 
I also hear that a lot of people get jobs where they interned in btwn the 2 years of nursing school. I did in internship at Bellevue in the Peds ER--&gt;Will that look good for me? My dream is to work at NYP I am just worried about how difficult it may be for that dream to come true-am I way in over my head?

Any advice is welcomed! 
From a soon to be RN :)

st7ii,15,2012-04-26,[FR] Food truck line.,pethebi,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/st7ii/fr_food_truck_line/,"Hi guys, this is my first FR so sorry if I'm not following specific FR rules or anything, I've only read FRs but couldn't find any links on the sidebar on making FR. I've also recently read the link on not giving girls HB #s anymore, so I'm trying that out right now. It also might be a bit long, so let me know if I put a lot of irrelevant stuff in here too.

So today I went to a weekly food truck festival-type thing where a bunch of food trucks gather. It was raining so most people had umbrellas, and I was standing in line with my roommate behind these 2 girls. Let's call them girl 1 and girl 2. Girl 1 was standing right in front of me in the rain without an umbrella so I spontaneously asked her if she wanted to share my umbrella. She turned around, said something with a smile and we started talking, and I moved my hand towards the middle so that it was pretty much over all 3 of our heads (girl 1, girl 2, me. My roommate had his own umbrella). I found out that it was her first time there (it was my first time  at the one in this city too) and that she moved into the area a year ago working in social media, say it sounds fun, but it's really not. I joke that at least they have a job, I'm still an intern, but that topic quickly died. As I was talking to girl 1, I saw three friends who I was supposed to meet up with walk up behind the girls and I waved at them, and then continued talking to girl 1 about other stuff I don't remember.

At some point she mentions that girl 2 was a coworker and also a bartender. I instantly tell her that my roommate was DJ and they hit it off pretty well. While they were talking, I realize that my friends had disappeared, and I start looking around for them while she talks every once in a while. Eventually, I find out that she used to live in the city where I work, so I start talking to her about where to find places to live around there. 

Eventually, we get to the front of the line and I ask my roommate what he's getting, if he wants to get 2 things and share it. The girls turn around to look at the menu. My roommate mentions some coke grilled food on the menu, and girl 1 turns around again to talk about it, saying how it should be good and stuff. But then after they ordered they just walk away and leave without saying anything.

After the 2 girls left, while we were waiting for our food, another couple came up to us and the girl asked us to explain to the guy what dim sum was. We got to talking about a lot of different foods and it felt like a much better interaction than the one I had with the 2 girls because everyone was talking and there was laughing and stuff. Eventually I realize that I have to go look for my friends and told them it was nice meeting them, shook their hands and asked them for their names then left.

In hindsight, I think I could have got her to talk more about her job and what kind of things they do, maybe throw in a couple of negs. 
I also think that looking for my friends was a bad idea, because I was no longer paying attention to the girls. I could have just looked for them after we ordered and got our food.
Should I have also moved in closer after I offered the umbrella? I moved my hand towards the middle and took maybe half a step forward, but maybe I could have stood shoulder to shoulder with girl 1? 
Also, when girl 2 was talking to my roommate, should I have gone back to talking to girl 1 instead of listening to their conversation? It felt like it was 1 to 1 conversations going on during our entire meeting, rather than the entire group talking.
Finally, should I have asked them their names sometime in the conversation?
I also didn't get any # closes because at no point during the interaction did it feel nature to ask them for it. I also wasn't too interested in either of them and didn't feel like we had too much in common. I feel like after reading seddit a lot, I need to get rid of this mindset, should I?

TL;DR: Offered girl in front of me my umbrella and hit it off, but then interaction died when we got to the front of the line and they just walked off. Not too sure why, but I have some ideas."
st71b,7,2012-04-26,Girlfriend of two years not interested sexually at all: Am I justified in being upset by this?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/st71b/girlfriend_of_two_years_not_interested_sexually/,"I (M20) have been in a relationship with my gf (19yo) for a little over 2 years now. We both have known each other since high school and ended up attending the same college--her a freshman while I'm a sophomore. Let me preface this by saying that our emotional relationship has been very healthy throughout our time.

Things were going great throughout the first few months. We were extremely attracted to each other and messed around about 3 times a week -- no intercourse though. We talked about sex on every so often and she would repeatedly put it off. This didn't upset me because we were virgins and I know she wanted her first time to be with someone special to her. I felt the same way so I agreed with her. We kept up this routine for the entire summer before I went off to college. This is where I felt like our healthy sex life ended.

I moved in to school in that Fall. It was really hard on us, many tears were shed the night before I left. This is where I felt we really had something special going on. I made it a point to try to better myself by losing weight so when she was able to come to school with me the next year I would be even more attractive than I was when I left. 

I would visit often maybe once a month and whenever I visited she never wanted to mess around and sex was way out of question. I would almost always be turned down whenever I visited...even though she would say different. I never got too upset because I didn't want to seem like that was all I cared about and that it was reasonable that she would just want quality non sexy times. This continued throughout the entire school year. I even lost 50 lbs over this year to no avail.

I spent that summer at home where I had my first engineering  internship. I was hoping that the summer would be a return to the same type of summer as the year prior. This was not the case. Whenever we did mess around I would have to almost beg her and she didn't even seem to enjoy it and still no sex -- this time she said she wanted to be on bc and planned on starting it in the fall. I chalked up her disinterest this time to her anxiety of moving away from home. She is super super close with her mother. This continued until the fall when she joined me at our university. 

First semester I had built up new hope that our sex life would increase; but again barely anything. I blamed the disinterst this time on bc side effects and separation anxiety from her mother in addition to moving away from home--definitely understandable. I tried as hard as I could to be a rock for her.

Now we have just passed our two year anniversary.  She quit taking the pill and has been feeling a whole bunch better about being away from home. We have both being super successful academically and she has made tons of friends. We still haven't had sex and I practically have to beg for any type of sexual stimulation. Any time I bring up how sex she gets super upset and angry and makes me feel like I am being unreasonable. She has straight up told me that we will not be having intercourse any time in the near future. 

I don't know what I am doing wrong if anything. The constant rejection is whittling away at my confidence. I feel inadequate around all of my guy friends from high school who are not virgins. I am also having a hard time making new guy friends because of this. It also makes me angry because she wants us to act like we have a sex life around all our friends. Is this my fault?

**TLDR:** Been with girl for two years and she has constantly turned down sex even though we have a very healthy emotional relationship. The constant rejection coupled with feelings of inadequacy around my guy friends is fucking up my confidence.

Writing all of this has been an awesome catharsis for me. Thanks for listening. But tell me people of Reddit, what advice do you have for me? "
st5t4,1,2012-04-26,22/f...I feel like I'm in a soap-opera,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/st5t4/22fi_feel_like_im_in_a_soapopera/,"Ok, I'll try to make it to the point, I really don't want to tl:dr...

A couple of years ago I met this guy at a social gathering (we're in the same student organization at my school) and we've been friends ever since - though nothing more than friendly acquaintances; I've always been attracted to him but didn't have enough interest to pursue anything more.

Flash forward to a couple of months ago, and we randomly start hanging out on a semi-regular basis. Like, 4-5 times a week at various social gatherings. I get to know him much better and turns out he's a super cool guy. He starts pursing the crap out of me for a couple of weeks - texting, hangouts, what have you - and I was certain it was going to go somewhere. Turns out he's just super friendly and led me on ""by accident."" We talked it out and our friendship has been great since then (that was the beginning of March); we hang out nearly every day and have gotten considerably closer as friends since everything happened.

The problem is that ever since then, I've been in total anguish about the situation. The more I've gotten to know him the stronger the feelings I have for him have become. It totally blows. He's still friendly (if not friendlier) than ever and evidently wasn't scared off by what happened. Friendly enough to make me doubt sometimes that he doesn't have feelings for me - which makes getting over him much more difficult than it should be, but that's another story.

OK, SO...Here's my dilemma: he's going to move to another city for the summer to do an internship, so I pretty much won't see him/talk to him at all for 10 weeks. I've been harboring these feelings/heartbreak for a while, though I'm pretty sure he's oblivious to both. Would it be worth my time to make him aware of either of those before he goes? Part of me really wants him to know so I can fucking stop holding it in, but the other part is afraid of more rejection (obviously). Plus I don't want things to be weird between us...but if he's going to be gone for months, it might be a good idea to clear the air? At least for the sake of my emotional well-being? Is that stupid? I kind of want to know once and for all if I have any hope with him...I just don't want to come across as too needy or dramatic or something. You know? Gah!

Halp!"

I drove to him all the time, dressed the way he liked, changed how i part my hair to how he liked, I helped with his resume and cover letter and sent them out to companys for him. I planned things and always came up with creative gifts. Not to mention get him the gaming stuff he wanted... He bought me dinner that was it. I would ask him to come over and he never did. He was so stubborn. He liked to just be home and play games all the time. I finally had enough. I know i deserve better. I am angry but then i get sad because he is not even trying to contact me. All i wanted was for him to visit me and be more affectionate... So anyway I am trying to get by. I got two internships this summer so i will be busy but he is on my mind everyday. I get sad when my roommates bf is around or just in general. At night is the worst. I cannot sleep and I cry sometimes. 

I know i shouldnt contact him but it hurts all i think about is why is he not contacting me... He unfriended me on facebook he said if i broke up with him I never loved him... I do though. I am lost. I dont know how to deal with things. Why isn't he contacting me... why does it seem like he is not even sad. I feel like he has just moved on... If he loved me why wouldnt he a little thing to make me happy. I feel broken"

This will be my first post on reddit, so lets see if I do this right.

So I got my new case in the mail yesterday and I was really excited about it. I started by taking out all the komponets that where in the old case and putting them into the new one. Old one was a mid tower, new one is a big tower. Then when I was done putting it all back together I put the power plug and one of my monitors in to see if everything was ok. It was not The light on the motherboard was lit but when i pressed the power button nothing happend. I then was going to take it all down to see if ther was anything I had done wrong. When i was about to unplug the monitor it suddenly started up but as soon at I moved my hand in any way it stoped again. i thyed aplying diffrent preasure to the graphics card and from ther on I could only get it to power up by doing that, it didn't even work sometimes. 

Things i have tryed to get it to work again are:
Removing the graphics card and only use the inbuilt graphics card in the motherboard. Didn't work.

The power supply is powerful enought to handle the power requirements. I even tryed without any case fans, only CPU cooler and SSD. Didn't work.

I have tryed mulible other tings that mostly would have worked on other computers I have worked with before. Non worked so far. 

I am currently working as a computer intern, got one year left to get my degree. A few of my friends has master degrees and simular grades in computer engenering, programing etc etc, no one of them knew after hours of trying all sorts of things what to do. 

This leavs me to seek help from my fellow redditors to see if anyone has anyide of what could be wrong and what i could do to fix it. 

This is a computer that has a price tag at about 3400$ that is just sitting there not working. 

Any sugestions?

However, I find myself having some jealousy issues. I'm not sure if this is normal for all guys in new relationships (this is my first relationship that lasted for more than a couple weeks/one night)

I am also her first boyfriend (she had a bunch of guys friendzoned and had a thing with another last summer, but that's it)

 
I have no reason not to trust her, but she is very VERY social and has a lot of guy friends.

We have seen each other every weekend except once in the past 4 months (she is on an internship away from our university).

Otherwise it makes me quite uncomfortable when she goes out drinking with some of her clients / co-workers. She works in a gym during her internship so obviously she is surrounded by a lot of guys. This hasn't been so bad, she usually texts me quite a lot during the evening and the next morning, but sometimes it's hard for me.

For example, last week we were going out for one of her girlfriend's birthday, and she invited the two guys from the gym she had met in her internship. This made me feel a bit uncomfortable when she told me she invited them them.. but I got over it. 

Obviously I talked to her about it once or twice. I told her I want to let her do what she wants, I don't mind her going out with guys at all, but it makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes, and I hope she knows. Those discussions always go very well and she makes me feel a lot better right after. This being said, there is no way I well ever be THAT boyfriend who gets all pissy when his girl goes out, or who prevents her from going out (I know some guys who do this, sickens me)

This week it's been the worse ever though. She is in some all-exclusive resort in Mexico with 3 of her girlfriends for a week. I've been over-thinking about all kinds of stupid shit. The fact that she told me her friends were boring and she wants to make some new ones to go out and have fun makes me more paranoid. I obviously haven't heard from her since she left last Sunday. I know I should have nothing to worry about, but just thinking about how crushed I'd be if she came back and told me she hooked up with some guy makes me sick. (She couldn't tell a lie if her life depended on it, she would tell me right away).

So, is this normal? I've been told it's all about my confidence and stuff... But honestly I consider myself fairly self-confident, good-looking, on my way to a good job when I graduate, we share interests, I can satisfy her in bed etc... Basically I have REALLY nothing to worry about but I still do. 

So, how do you guys cope with jealousy, and does this happen to everyone in the early stages of a relationship?

TL;DR: Been in a relationship for 5 months and I'm a jealous fucker. Is this normal? How do I fix this."
suobc,0,2012-04-26,Computer Science/Engineering major thinking about applying to law school for a career in patent law. ,[deleted],law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/suobc/computer_scienceengineering_major_thinking_about/,"As it says in the title, I am currently a computer science major and I am seriously considering applying to law school for fall 2013. Since it is getting close to the time when I need to either start studying and preparing for the LSAT or otherwise start on the path to grad school, I figured I should get educated a bit before I decide. So here goes:

-I currently have a 3.57 LSAC GPA (plan on at least a 3.6 before graduation). Assuming I get a reasonable LSAT score (165-170), what are my chances of getting in to a top 20 school?

-Assuming that I do not get in to a top 20, would it even be worth it at this point, as far as my getting out of student loan debt is concerned, to pursue a career in patent law?

-I have two internships under my belt as well as several leadership positions in on campus organizations. Also, if all goes well I should be graduating with honors (honors program as well as academic honors). Will this have any basis on my being admitted? 

-I come from a white middle class family and did not have any spectacular hardships growing up. What would be the best way to make my personal statement stand out if at all possible?

-Is a career in patent law, particularly in software and/or computer engineering if that matters, a satisfying career choice in the first place?

That's about all that I can think of at the moment, but I would welcome any other advice!

swk8z,8,2012-04-28,My boyfriend has been lying to me about something I feel very strong about for over a year; is he worth it? ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/swk8z/my_boyfriend_has_been_lying_to_me_about_something/,"I'm 18, he's 20, and we've been dating for a year and ten months.    

Background: My mom's a pretty mean alcoholic and I've found pot in her room a bunch. I'm REALLY against drug and alcohol use.    

My boyfriend knows that. We used to argue about it a lot, and he would watch me cry (I never cry about anything other than this and family problems) and beg him not to drink when he visited his friends at other universities, but still do it. Eventually (a year and three months into the relationship), I gave him the ultimatum of drinking or being with me (because this really is a huge problem in my life, and I don't want to worry about it all the time and be unhappy with it), and he said that I was more important to him than doing those things with his friends.  

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I found out from a coworker that he had met my boyfriend at a party. I asked him about it and he said that he went, but I didn't have to worry about it. I asked if he drank and he said he did (even though he promised he wouldn't). After hours of unanswered texts, questions, and phone calls, he finally admitted to me that he's been smoking pot at least once a week for over a year.    

I broke up with him, but then we got back together a few days later.    

I don't know if I made the right choice. He's been nearly perfect with everything else; this is the only serious problem we've ever had.      

Back at the time of the ultimatum, he said that I was more important to him than doing that stuff. Well, now he's doing what I thought PLUS smoking, so what does that mean about my importance?    
He knows I struggle with feeling unimportant, and that I hate that my mom puts alcohol before me. But he's doing the same thing.    

Please help, I can't get this off my mind.     
Note: He told me that he's smoking tonight.  
For those of you saying that I'm too controlling, I'm really not. He's going off to an internship for the summer, and I'm okay with it. We're going to different colleges and I'm okay with it. We really only hang out like once or twice a week, and I'm okay with it. I'm not one of those people who's like, ""You have to call me/text me all the time."" If he's busy, he's busy. I don't care. I've never asked him of anything other than this.  

**TL;DR**- My boyfriend has been lying to me for over a year about smoking pot at least once a week, despite me being super against it. Should I stay with him? "

Here is some criteria I am working under. I am just looking for a fun/sporty rwd (or awd) manual.

Here's a list of cars I've been considering:

E30 M3, E46 M3, Z3 M coupe (E39 M5, but v8 fuel mileage scares me). Porsche 911, Hyundai Genesis Coupe, Mazda Rx8.

Does anyone have any reasons I should or should not get any of these cars? Or is there anything that I may have overlooked. I'm definitely open to suggestions.

I will probably try and pick a car up from the SF Bay area this summer. I also spend a lot of time in Portland in Seattle if that matters.

Thanks!

TL;DR: Help find me a RWD sports coupe for ~$20,000. 

Edit: I've driven the E30 M3 and my family owns an E30 318is.

I'm currently studying Computer Science. I may possibly hold off from buying until I graduate. But I figure it would be convenient to grab a car in the SF Bay area while I am down there for an internship and then drive it up north when I am done (it seems to have the best used car market). "

When any of the people in my life ask me why i stopped being a christian i always say ""it's a real long story,"". Here is that story. I, like many other suburban kids, was raised christian and when i got into high school is when i really cranked up the jesus juice. I became a part of first priority (a christian group at my school) i even went to Honduras as part of a mission trip group, twice. i was in, 100 percent in. You see the way they got me was they made it seem like the only ""proper"" way to help people is through ""the love of christ"". so when i got done with high school i did not really know what i wanted, i was always interested in psychology and sociology so i though maybe a therapist. so i left my hometown to discover what it was that i wanted out of my life. Then everything went to shit. I had some friends (such a shame that they are not my friends anymore, i loved that family as if it was my own) in the town i moved to and they enthusiastically invited me to their church. well i had a sit down with the pastor and he was very excited to have me going there (I had played in a band that played at the church and the kids already liked me) and asked me if i would become the ""youth leader"" for the high school group. i of course accepted thinking this is what god had planned for me. if it was, god is a cruel bastard. do not get me wrong, i loved the kids i was overseeing and for the first year it was a blast, i got to play fun games with these kids and help them with their various problems. all these kids needed was someone to listen to them and support them and i did my best to help. then the fateful day came, you see i had been working for the church on a volunteer level and was perfectly fine with that, i held down a steady job at a local factory and had a (for a 19 year old kid) decently nice house. my pastor came to me and asked how devoted i was to this group and these kids, i of course, said that i was completely devoted so he told me that god had a plan. i should have asked ""why did he tell you and not me?"" but i did not, i asked what i could do. he told me that i had to quit my job and devote the next two years of my life to an ""Internship"" he said that my rent would be paid for and my food would be taken care of and all i had to do was do this internship and after i would be a pastor. well i had not gone to or taken any college classes and i was really excited about it. a pastor, now there is a job i can be proud of. so i was swept up and within a month i was enrolled. then they paid my first months rent and i was set to go. i had my ""interview"" which was a joke. they gave me a tour of a church i had already been too and talked up the program and then told me i was in. well on my first day i felt like a fish out of water i did not know anyone there and they were WAY more committed to their church than i ever was to mine, they basically lived there. not to mention the man that was in charge of it all pastor dan. he was a real life, grown up bully. he made petty jokes about me constantly and picked on the other man  (who was a 50 something year old man) i was there with my church. i should take a minute to explain my church siuation, you see there are these things called ""chain churches"" and they have separate locations all over the state and they all answer to the same head pastor guy in a bigger city. well the church i was working for was about 50 miles away from the church where i attended the internship. in the internship it was myself and another guy and we drove the 50 miles four days out of the week to be at the church by six. and immediately for some reason pastor dan began making my life more difficult and making petty jokes about my fingers (i have two missing fingers on my left hand). it was an awful experience but i kept going cause at the end of the day all i wanted was to help these kids. well as you may have guessed the church stopped paying my rent and food and with the hours we were at the internship (6 am to 5 pm) i could not find a job. the pastor from the church i was working with had the idea to move me into the house with the other man i was at the internship with. and that is when it got really bad. you see the family that i was staying with had a very very different idea of how a youth leader should behave, you see i was 20 by then and i had a circle of friends that i was very close with and not all of them went to my church and some no church at all. i want to pause here again, i can honestly say that my friends in that town were the only thing that kept me sane, they would be the ones who i would complain to about the emotional torment i endured because of dan and the others at the internship. they were amazing and i could not ask for more loyal friends in my life. but back to the story, if i were to come home late, late being 10pm or later, the family i was staying with would lock me out. sometimes i would stay with friends, sometimes i would stay in a car and a couple times i stayed in my old house (it had not been rented out yet, and i still had the key). and to some that seems reasonable but the thing is, even if they were awake they would not come to the door to let me in. and sometimes the accptable time to come home was 9 sometimes it was 8 sometimes it was even after dinner. i had no way of knowing when i came home whether i would have a place to sleep or not. and meanwhile back at the legion of doom (i had to) the internship had a new class starting adding like 8 or 9 kids that were fresh out of high school. now out of these kids i knew like 4 of them from different church functions and they are still some of the few people who still will talk to me, and i will always respect them for that. but the others, were not so accepting. once again i felt like an outsider at home, an outsider at the internship, and an outsider in my own church, for dan had been sending my pastor letters and emails about my dismal performance at the internship. and to be fair i was having a really hard time with motivating myself to try any harder because no matter how well i did dan would have some petty comment to say to me so i just gave up.well fast forward about two months and i was living with my parents in my old house, again. but i still had to find a way to ludington every weekend (for because of my epilepsy i did not have a drivers license). well after the first year of the internship i had to find a job and found one again in the town my church was in moved back up with yet another church connection. and after two days their mind was changed so i moved into my car by the lake in northern Michigan in January. needless to say it was an awful experience. but i pushed through and tried to find a job where i did not work with a person from the church because i was getting ready to step down. i had enough. well i was fortunate enough to move in with one of the friends i mentioned before.  i never did find a job in that town but i lived rent free with that friend for almost a year before i moved back to my hometown with my dad. i left the church i stepped down. now that is not how i became an atheist, that is simply why i left the church, when i did i researched the other side, read Dawkins, read Sagan read anything i could get on the ""world without the god glasses"". and that is how i became an atheist. but i would have never done that if i never left the church, you see we had a strict reading list being a part of church leadership. and it was not a list of books to read, it was a list of books not read, at the top of the list was The God Delusion by Dawkins. after i left i immediately read it and realized why i was not supposed to, it makes perfect sense. i, someday, would like to thank him for writing that book as many former christians would, and i hope someday i hope to be able to do that.
so that it it r/atheism, i did not write this for sympathy i wrote this to show people what i have been through in the name of religion. i still have lingering guilt and a sometimes crippling fear of hell (even though i know its illogical) but i am 23 now living on my own in a house and working to go to school in April of next year. thank you for taking the time to read this

come to the door to let me in. and sometimes the accptable time to come home was 9 sometimes it was 8 sometimes it was even after dinner. i had no way of knowing when i came home whether i would have a place to sleep or not. and meanwhile back at the legion of doom (i had to) the internship had a new class starting adding like 8 or 9 kids that were fresh out of high school. now out of these kids i knew like 4 of them from different church functions and they are still some of the few people who still will talk to me, and i will always respect them for that. but the others, were not so accepting. once again i felt like an outsider at home, an outsider at the internship, and an outsider in my own church, for dan had been sending my pastor letters and emails about my dismal performance at the internship. and to be fair i was having a really hard time with motivating myself to try any harder because no matter how well i did dan would have some petty comment to say to me so i just gave up.well fast forward about two months and i was living with my parents in my old house, again. but i still had to find a way to ludington every weekend (for because of my epilepsy i did not have a drivers license). well after the first year of the internship i had to find a job and found one again in the town my church was in moved back up with yet another church connection. and after two days their mind was changed so i moved into my car by the lake in northern Michigan in January. needless to say it was an awful experience. but i pushed through and tried to find a job where i did not work with a person from the church because i was getting ready to step down. i had enough. well i was fortunate enough to move in with one of the friends i mentioned before.  i never did find a job in that town but i lived rent free with that friend for almost a year before i moved back to my hometown with my dad. i left the church i stepped down. now that is not how i became an atheist, that is simply why i left the church, when i did i researched the other side, read Dawkins, read Sagan read anything i could get on the ""world without the god glasses"". and that is how i became an atheist. but i would have never done that if i never left the church, you see we had a strict reading list being a part of church leadership. and it was not a list of books to read, it was a list of books not read, at the top of the list was The God Delusion by Dawkins. after i left i immediately read it and realized why i was not supposed to, it makes perfect sense. i, someday, would like to thank him for writing that book as many former christians would, and i hope someday i hope to be able to do that.
so that it it r/atheism, i did not write this for sympathy i wrote this to show people what i have been through in the name of religion. i still have lingering guilt and a sometimes crippling fear of hell (even though i know its illogical) but i am 23 now living on my own in a house and working to go to school in April of next year. thank you for taking the time to read this     "
sye9z,11,2012-04-29,RPG: innovation concerning quests?,zegazefazfa,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/sye9z/rpg_innovation_concerning_quests/,"Hi,

I've been playing RPGs for a long time (lands of lore, might and magic 4/5, BG1/2, fallouts, morrowind, witchers, skyrim...) and been enjoying them at different level (I have to admit that I've been kinda disapointed in the more recent ones, and more and more seeing thru the ""tricks"" of gameplay/mechanics now more than before). Lands of Lore still feels like the game where I was the most immersed, I was younger, and did not ""see through"" the gameplay but just enjoyed the story and atmosphere.

Now what is my problem? Quests (and stories).

I don't know if it's me getting older (29) or just having worked for the industry for a brief time (game design internship @ ubisoft) but I can't help but call off the bullshit of the way games are rolling out in front of my eyes: get this, pick this, kill x, go there, hide and kill y, wait in the dark ... 

Now that I'm older **it seems that the story is just a way to interconnect gameplay/mechanics one after another** and not the other way around (gameplay supporting the story). Everything feels cheap.


*The Basics*  
- My question is, is it possible to get rid of the fetch/kill quests that make up 99% of the actions were supposed to do?

*The false innovation*  
- And even the so called innovative gameplay is most of the time gimmicks. Meaning, that you ""feel"" that you are just here to roll out the specific gameplay, the ""scene"" was just waiting for you to do as told and that's it. (the way they inject random ""new"" gameplay mechanics at some point of the game (sneak, snipe...))

----------------------
**Quick idea:**  
Most of times it seems that the quests (3 basic types fetch/kill/find) are the way the story advance. So you're not living the story but you're just makeing it advance acting as you are told to within the framework of these mechanics.

(a)--&gt;(b1/b2/b3)--&gt;(c1/c2/c3)

If you are in city A and the story must roll out towards city B, you're not going there on you're own, for you own reasons (except maybe in Morrowind, very unique game), you go there because you have to go thru a specific task.

See, stories in RPGs are often a series of tasks. If you realize that, you feel cheated. When I was 12 I could pretend I didnt see that, now I can't anymore (I am struggling to finish skyrim because of that).

An idea I had, would be that the story plays out, with you going along the world, geographically or timely or with dialogues, and ACTIONS/EVENTS happen along the way.

Take Skyrim such a big WASTED, i repeat, wasted, by making you go from point a to b to c to d, in a crazy manner, zig zaging across the map! It's insane.

Proof? I often try to FORCE myself to roleplay (miss things, walk more, take actions that are more in character rather than mix maxing, try to travel in a logical way - ie not jumping from quests to quests like a mad man across the map)  to kinda enjoy the game! WHAT a gamedesign if the player has to PRETEND and BEND the gameplay in order to enjoy it!

I would like, once, a game where the kill/fetch quests are the exception. Let say you are the hero warrior, so you start somewhere, and then take on a journey with friends, to a certain direction and things HAPPEN along the way! not the other way around (things happening force you to travel &lt; you lose control, you're  puppet just pushing button to make the story advance!)

In some ways, older FPS (doom) are way more logical! You move forward the world, and things happen : magic and amazements!

Can we discuss this? Thank you."
sxkih,5,2012-04-28,Looking for an internship!,timtamboy63,perth,https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/sxkih/looking_for_an_internship/,"Hey everyone,

So I finish my final exams on the 17th of May, and after that I have a lot of free time until university starts (3-4 months). 

I was looking for an internship where I could actually do something useful instead of working at a supermarket or something. I'll be studying Computer Science in university, and I already know a fair bit. I've done a lot of web design and development, so if anyone owns a web dev firm, etc, I'd love to work there.

szabq,1,2012-04-30,My Story On Religion (Fixed),[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/szabq/my_story_on_religion_fixed/,"When any of the people in my life ask me why I stopped being a Christian, I always say ""It's a really long story,"". Here is that story. I, like many other suburban kids, was raised Christian. When I got into High School is when I really cranked up the Jesus juice though. I became a part of First Priority (A Christian group at my school). I even went to Honduras as part of a mission trip group, twice. I was 100 percent in. You see, the way they got me was they made it seem like the only ""proper"" way to help people is through ""The Love of Christ"". When I got done with High School I did not really know what I wanted, I was always interested in Psychology and Sociology so I though maybe a Therapist. 
*So I left my hometown to discover what it was that I wanted out of my life. That's when everything went to shit. I had some friends (such a shame that they are not my friends anymore, I loved that family as if it was my own) In the town I moved to and they enthusiastically invited me to their church. Well I had a sit down with the Pastor and he was very excited to have me going there (I had played in a band that played at the church and the kids already liked me). He asked me If I would become the ""Youth Leader"" for the High School Youth Group. I, of course, accepted thinking this Is what god had planned for me. If it was, god is a cruel bastard. Don't get me wrong, I loved the kids I was overseeing and for the first year it was a blast. I got to play fun games with these kids and help them with their various problems. All these kids needed was someone to listen to them and support them, and i did my best to help. Then the fateful day came. You see, I had been working for the church on a volunteer level and was perfectly fine with that. I held down a steady job at a local factory and had a (for a 19 year old kid) decently nice house. 
*My pastor came to me and asked how devoted I was to this group and these kids. I, of course, said that I was completely devoted, so he told me that god had a plan for me. I should have asked ""Why did he tell you and not me?"" but i did not. I asked what iI could do. He then told me that I had to quit my job and devote the next two years of my life to an ""Internship"". He said that my rent would be paid for and my food would be taken care of and all I had to do was do this internship. Afterwords I would be a Pastor. Well, I had not gone to or taken any college classes and I was really excited about it. A Pastor, now there is a job I can be proud of. So I was swept up and within a month I was enrolled. Then they paid my first months rent and I was set to go. I had my ""interview"" which was a joke. They gave me a tour of a church I had already been to and talked up the program, then told me I was in. Well, on my first day I felt like a fish out of water. 
*I did not know anyone there and they were WAY more committed to their church than I ever was to mine. They basically lived there. Not to mention the man that was in charge of it all, Pastor Dan. He was a real life, grown up bully. He made petty jokes about me constantly and picked on the other man (who was a 50 something year old man) I was there within my church. I should take a minute to explain my church situation. You see, there are these things called ""Chain Churches"" and they have separate locations all over the state, but they all answer to the same Head Pastor guy in a bigger city. Well, the church I was working for was about 50 miles away from the church where I attended the internship. In the internship, it was myself plus another guy and we drove the 50 miles, four days out of the week to be at the church by six o'clock. Immediately, for some reason, Pastor Dan began making my life more difficult and made petty jokes about my fingers (I have two missing fingers on my left hand from an accident). It was an awful experience, but I kept going cause at the end of the day all I wanted was to help these kids. Well, as you may have guessed, the church stopped paying my rent and food. With the hours we were at the internship (6 am to 5 pm), I could not find a job. The Pastor from the church I was working with had the idea to move me into the house with the other man I was at the internship with. 
That is when it got really bad. You see, the family that I was staying with had a very very different idea of how a youth leader should behave. I was 20 by then and I had a circle of friends that I was very close with and not all of them went to my church, with some no church at all. I want to pause here again, I can honestly say that my friends in that town were the only thing that kept me sane. They would be the ones who I would complain to about the emotional torment I endured because of Pastor Dan and the others at the internship. They were amazing and I could not ask for more loyal friends in my life. Back to the story! If I were to come home late, late being 10pm or later, the family I was staying with would lock me out. Sometimes I would stay with friends. Sometimes I would stay in a car, and a couple times I stayed in my old house (It had not been rented out yet, and I still had the key). To some that seems reasonable, but the thing was, even if they were awake they would not come to the door to let me in. Sometimes the acceptable time to come home was 9, sometimes it was 8, sometimes it was even after dinner around 6. I had no way of knowing when I came home whether I would have a place to sleep or not. Meanwhile back at the Legion of Doom (I had to), the internship had a new class starting adding like 8 or 9 kids that were fresh out of High School. 
*Now, out of these kids i knew like 4 of them from different church functions and they are still some of the few people who still will talk to me. I will always respect them for that. The others, were not so accepting. Once again, I felt like an outsider at home, an outsider at the internship, and an outsider in my own church.

To be fair, I was having a really hard time with motivating myself to try any harder because no matter how well i did, Pastor Dan would have some petty comment to say to me. So I just gave up. Fast forward about two months and I was living with my parents in my old house from high school. I still had to find a way to Ludington (town with church without internship) every weekend ( Because of my epilepsy i did not have a drivers license). After the first year of the internship, I had to find a job and found one again in the town my church was in (Ludington). 
*So I moved back up with yet another church connection. After two days, their mind was changed. I moved into my car by the lake in northern Michigan in January. Needless to say it was an awful experience. I pushed through and tried to find a job where I did not work with a person from the church because i was getting ready to step down. I had enough.

I was really excited when I first heard the message. It was after 6 PM when I heard the voicemail, so I planned on calling back first thing Friday morning. But all night I thought about all the reasons why I wouldn't be good for this job. All the interview questions I have fucked up in the past. I think about all the other recent engineering grads from the nearby Ivy League school who probably got calls from this company, too and have much more technical and internship experience than me.

I woke up Friday and said ""OK, I'll call at 10 AM"". 10 AM came and I said ""OK, I'll call at 3 PM"". And then 3 came and went and I was just too afraid to do it. Now if I find the confidence to even do it tomorrow morning, I'm convinced that 2 working days just too much time to pass to return this call and the HR person will think I'm lazy and that I don't care.

I have a lot of trouble with ""selling myself"".

I'm 22, just graduated from college and am applying for engineering jobs. The process is stressing me out the past few months so much that I'm sabotaging myself. Last month, I scheduled a phone interview (for a different company) in advance, and then psyched myself out too much and then sat and watched my phone ring when the time came for the call.

Instead of trying to think of the good things I've done and spin my failures into positives, all I can think of are the things I've done wrong on projects in school and reasons why I would be a failure in the working world. All weekend I've sat here worrying about waking up Monday morning and being faced with having to return this call and how I can convince an HR person that I'm good enough for this job when I really don't think that I am.

I feel depressed for feeling depressed. What company wants to hire someone who feels so terribly about herself? I'm a pansy.

I'm afraid to talk to someone about this issue. Based on what I do, I look like someone who just doesn't want to help herself. I'm not worth being helped by others.

I don't have a Mom or Dad to call who can tell me I'm the best and give me a confidence boost. I'm alone out here and just can't get it together mentally by myself. I could skate by with this anxious/depressed cycle while in college classes and managed a good GPA, but interviewing and all of this stuff is making me face it head on. I'm really feeling stuck based on the logic my brain uses to respond to inputs. I need to re-train my brain but there's no time. I need to get my shit together and get an interview since my current job will end in December.

How the hell can I squash that nagging voice inside that says ""you can't do it""?

Thanks."

I've been having trouble finding a good place to live in Red Deer for the next 8 months while I work at an internship. I have plenty of references and will have no trouble paying the bills. Does anyone know of anything that's available? I've been making calls on kijiji but they're either rented or never answering their phone. I'd appreciate everyone's help.

I'm a single male university student looking to (preferably) live alone.

I'd want to rent the place starting May 1st. (Immediately)

Thanks"
syzi9,0,2012-04-29,I need advice. Moving from Boston to NYC in September and no idea where to start.,Stares_at_llamas,NYCapartments,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/syzi9/i_need_advice_moving_from_boston_to_nyc_in/,"I'll keep it short. I'm applying for grad school and will have a paid internship in the city starting September. 23-year old composer. The thing is that I've never been outside of Manhattan so I'd like to know:

-What areas should I be looking at that aren't $2000+ for a studio and not plagued by sketchy people?
-Any areas I should avoid at all cost, even if the rent is temptingly cheap?
-What common NYC knowledge should I have before hunting for apartments?

Please keep in mind that I'm 23, still living on a budget (my previous rent in Boston was $1600 for a 2BR/1Bath, so I paid $800 with some utilities), yet I'll take what I can find that's fairly decent.
I'll be going down to the city for a weekend in about 2-3 weeks, and I'll be able to explore a bit, maybe even start looking at places and surroundings.

Thank you in advance!"

I may decide to quit longer at the end of 40 days if I feel it is beneficial for me. Regular smoker for ~3.5 years


So this weekend was just another weekend without weed, uneventful and stressful. I really could have used a bowl yesterday after having a very long day of moving! But at the moment I have no weed and my pieces are all clean and put up, probably for the best. I still think about smoking weed constantly but that ""withdrawal"" symptoms are no longer there. I am happy I am still keeping it going, but I wonder if the feeling of wanting to smoke will ever go away? I am still kind of tired all of the time, and my motivation has dropped a little bit (I always considered weed as my motivator). Hopefully I can find something else to fill that void.


This is BY FAR the longest break I have ever had since starting smoking. After looking back on it, these 22 days kind of went by fast...hopefully motivation for others! I still have a ways to go but I know I can finish, and maybe continue longer !! 

I am here for any questions or guidance for anybody! Stay sober!!"
